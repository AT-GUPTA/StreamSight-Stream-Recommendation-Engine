Your solid/important player wants to go to bigger leagues/teams, throws hissy fit if I don't sell them for pennies, eventually get enough money from them to sell and found good/better replacement. Smile while you watch them to waste their next 4-5 years in reserve team bench. While you roll on the millions you got from him.

Your just recently signed fringe/impact sub comes 15-20 games in season to ask new contract, because he thinks he's so important to team and wants star money with his 2 starts and 1 assist in those 15-20 games. Say no, watch him throw hissy fit and screams how he's going to ruin my career. Rest of the team doesn't gaf about him, because they love me because I always pet their heads when they train properly. Eventually gets loaned/sold to team in some siberian farm league. 

Alternative version of earlier, you actually give the guy raise because figure that he's okay for the future. Again beginning of next season comes to ask more money again, just because. Sell him instantly away to some league with smaller salaries and smile while he wastes his next couple years there with less money.

Hold team meeting just before cup/league finals, tell the guys play well and become champions. Everyone is thrilled/encouraged. Except 2-3 guys who spent whole season as fringe/emergency backups, which throw hissy fit for too big ambitions. Win championship/cup, sell the complainers next summer to some beer league teams for pennies. Smile as they probably never reach that stage again.


Also always remember to pet your players gently and praise them if they're doing well in training or matches, if you don't they don't like you as nann..manager. Also if they're doing poorly you always have to tell them that's bad, or they don't like you as manager.

What is essentially a series of numbers interacting with each other (more so than any other game) produces such high-stakes drama that I've elicited concern from housemates at my explosive swearing or cheering. Your attachment to your team and players, and subsequent exploration of their real-life counterparts, results in a grand soap opera experience where losing can be just as thrilling as victory. I now have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Colombian football and it's byzantine league system for instance! 
While there is an inexhaustible supply of resources online to help in tactic formation and player selection, Football Manager still remains opaque enough that my main concerns are likely conspiracy theories. 
I feel like team training is way over-thought by most guides (it's just raising the bars using the appropriate training module right?). I'm also CONVINCED that there's a dice-roll whenever you start the game which determines whether you inexplicably drop in form! 
This is my first foray into the franchise, which has long been criticised for resting on it's laurels and iterating slowly. Should this be my only Football Manager though, the experiences and dramas will be more than enough to get my money's worth.

With Kyle Walker-Peters being the only footballer over 30 in his team, the manager decided that his golden generation of ""regens"" (lovingly referred to by the media) would go on to compete for decades to come, adorning the Southampton trophy cabinet with vast riches and treasure.

The 4-2-3-1 gegenpress was as familiar a sight as the smell of hotdogs and burgers as the fans edged closer to the stadium on a match day.

Drawing 1-1 in the 88th minute, the manager of Southampton decided to switch from the 10 minute spam, as if by clockwork, of ""Demand more"" to ""Berate"" and, like a bolt of lightning had erupted from the drab, winter's sky, the Southampton side kicked into gear with aplomb in the form of a key highlight.

Unfortunately for Southampton, things did not go to plan. Kyle Walker-Peters' run, while astute and profound, found the feet of Julian Alvares who, now his mid 30s, shot the ball straight at the wonderkid goalkeeper from Brazil, who happened to already be capped with the senior international team - a man known for possessing reflexes to match even the most acrobatic of felines.

With a long goal kick out, the Grimsby Town players ran for the ball like they had never ran before. Grimsby's young Spanish inverted-winger played a floated cross into the box from the right and, to the relief of the hot-dog eating Southampton faithful, had not troubled their young, Croatian wonderkid goalkeeper. However, this was not the end of the highlight.

In a frantic attempt to counter the counter, the ball was kicked straight up into the air - or so the goalkeeper had wished for. Instead, the ball was kicked straight into the posterior of Kyle Walker-Peters and slowly but surely made its way over the Southampton goal line. On this rare occasion, VAR was not consulted, and the Southampton players held their heads in their hands, knowing that another defeat to the almighty Grimsby FC was on the cards this season, and their hopes at challenging for the title were in tatters.


In conclusion, if you're looking for a great football game generator set in a period of wonderkids and wage problems, this is the game for you. 

You can figure out for yourself if you like the graphics and audio or not, I have no problems with either. If you won't be playing 4-2-3-1 gegenpress, be prepared for a less fun time (and if you don't ""wire the world"" when scouting as a certain YouTuber says, are you really playing?).

Plus, the AI loves to set enormous asking prices for the best wonderkids, so be prepared to pay for the editor as well so you can transfer them to your club for free. Don't worry, you'll build a team full of wonderkids that conquers the footballing world in no time...you did remember to buy players with only 15+ determination that aren't fickle, right?

FM puts effort into shit like ""Social Feed"" and any immersion in the game continues to be worse than FM had almost a decade ago when you could legit call up a journalist to trash talk and start drama with other managers.

Other Examples of dreadful game engine/game mechanics: 
1) The amount of blocked shots (and never have I once seen a handball called) the AI gets in FM21 would be world record setting.... and I usually start files in English tier 6 with....much better players. 

2) Scouting I would argue is worse (explicitly give instructions you want no players under x age, scouts give you scouting reports on 38 year olds anyways, wasting time that could scout young talent), and contract negotiations are laughable. 

3) AI staff/players are mindbogglingly stupid in their contract decisions refusing to even entertain discussions with clubs with a max rating ""Friend/Idol"" Manager because of club ""stature"" where in the past, recruiting people who respect you was a given, and a scrub tier young players insisting they want to be starters.

So...If not for the streamlined training system added a few years ago, I wouldn't hesitate to play FM15 instead. Sadly my old editor data never got backed up so I'm stuck with it.

 I expect 22 to be just as garbage. SI, like most devs these days, seems to not actually play their own games. If FIFA actually had English clubs below League 2 (Tier 4) and all it's domestic cups, so I could play with lower clubs, I'd drop FM immediately.

Also, go figure, none of these issues were addressed, and according to some reviews got worse, including fullbacks not marking. I recommend grabbing any FM prior to 2018 you can get your hands on, FM13 or FM15 ideally. If I hadn't lost my awesome FM15 editor files I made myself I'd be playing that right now instead.",1643022694,1643599979,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the match rigging element (which has always existed) seems a bit too rigid this edition. I know the purists have always argued ""Oh matches aren't rigged"" and mostly they're not. Skill of the player is key. But you get the odd game that is simply unwinnable.

For example, I'm currently playing a game purely for my own amusement where my focus is on the second season of Real Madrid having won everything in the first season. So I'm cheating and re-loading defeats to create that scenario I want. Not claiming it's not cheating. 10 games into season I'm winning most games because it;s Real Madrid. You expect that. The odd defeat I can live with as long as (for my own scenario) it's not crucial.

Just played Cadiz. They're bottom of La Liga. Lost every game. Scored three goals in total. They also have injury problems with not a single recognised striker. I'm largely full strength and no fitness issues.

I know the game is SUPPOSED to do calculations based on player quality, strategy vs strategy, factor in form, fitness and player morale etc. Then it should add a small factor of luck. That decides the outcome. I accept on rare occasions, Cadiz win this game out of nowhere. 

I have played that fixture, lost, reloaded it and played it again TWENTY-SEVEN times. And lost every time. EVERY SINGLE GAME, I mean every single one, Madrid miss a penalty. Every single game Madrid has huge numbers of attempts to their almost nothing. Every single game, Luka Modric is booked in the first 10 mins and they always win by one goal, every single time. Never scoring more that 2. I've counted them up, 27 games has produced 49 disallowed goals.

The game has decided that I lose this match, like it or not, nothing I can do about it. No formation, so strategy, no line up no turn of events sees me win this.

Like i said, I'm cheating, that's how I'm seeing this. Normally you move on, take the hit and never know.

When your players show ""composed"" after a team talk - Little you will do in match (tactical tweaks, shouts etc) will ever raise their performance level.  Too much reliance on team talks in relation to match performance - Choose the wrong ""lucky dip"" teamtalk/tone option and you're getting beat.

match day screen is stupid, the amount of data that i can view and gather is much less compared to fm20. no assistant feedback in sight. seriously, fm20 is much better. how did you decide which feature to include or remove when you plan to create this game? you managed to removed many useful features, it's just ridiculous.

stamina and sharpness icon is unhelpful. go back to percentage man. stop trying to be cute with this icons, numbers is the most important.

i've played FM for thousands of hours, and i can tell you, UI and UX is getting worse. and i glimpsed a bit on FM22, i don't see anything that makes me want to buy it. looked similar to FM21 and i don't even like FM21.

-updated review

there are annoying little things that still happening, for example injury time always on point when my team controlling the ball even if we're almost on opponent's penalty box. but when it's the other way around, the injury time that was supposed to be +3/+4 minutes, can become +5 or more when my opponent is attacking. stop testing our patients man!",1635863381,1637936206,False,2,0,0.489852815866470337,0,True,False,False

I'll start off with the negatives: It is boring at first. Very boring. If you aren't the type to commit to games and go a couple hours without particularly enjoying yourself then this game isn't for you. Secondly, it is very much 'easy to learn, hard to master.' I have played this game a lot and still haven't mastered it, as it takes a lot of dedication in terms of time to master it. Really you should be spending more time looking at the finer details of the game as you play, but I don't bother and neither do everyone I know who play FM. Lastly, and perhaps most frustratingly, this game crashes tons. I hear it's not only me, a lot of people have had this problem and I simply can't stand it. 


In terms of positives, there are a lot of good aspects to this game: Firstly, it feels very realistic. Relationships with other managers, data, x.g, youth development and more all contribute to this feel. Secondly, the diversity and selection. You can choose to play this game pretty much in any way you'd like. Choose to manage from most teams that exist and your save could go on forever without stopping movement around the world, there are no limits. Long term saves are particularly satisfying as you can pretty much say 'Huh, I remember seeing this guy come through as a 15 year old exciting prospect, and now he's the best player in my team', this is very oddly satisfying. In a way, this game has also taught me a lot about real life football. Tactics and positions I had never known before, and players and nations I didn't know were alright at football. 

In summary, this game is incredibly fun for most people that are interested in football on a level that isn't just playing it. It is very realistic, satisfying and detailed but crashes more often than not. I believe for the right person it is definitely worth the price.

The new UI is everything I could've asked for (with the exception of not being able to see live scores), and the overhauls to press conferences, match analysis have given the game a very fresh feel. FM20 feels like a distant memory, and retrospectivley, a much shittier entry than I first realized. FM21 solves every problem or issue I had with FM20 (the big one being the match engine that eliminated one on ones). 

Now I will say this. I've read a lot of negative reviews about this game, in which the reviewer described the game as being all luck based or whatever. To that I say, I can't be the judge, as I only started purchasing FM games in 2019.  But I will say this. Re-releasing the same game over and over again with new features every year is only gonna work until a point. The only reason I got FM21 was because the FM20 match engine was annoying the crap out of me. But now that I have FM21 and its so much better, and is everything I want in an FM game, I have no reason to buy FM22 (I still might, but I don't see why I should now). 

So I recommend to people to just, get mods for the current season and hunker down on your favourite version of FM instead of paying for a new game that constantly updates every year. For me, the FM game I want to hunker down currently with is FM21",1635879581,1635879581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They believe they ""don't need to release info about new games because our fans should buy our new titles no matter what."" That's the company that you are supporting. SI is a prime example of capitalism without competition. The founder, Miles, is an absolute insufferable prick to top it all off.

EDIT: Edited after playing thru a couple more seasons with a lot more playtime. This game is... not good, guys. I'm sorry. Seriously, how this company manages to ruin key components every single edition such as player interactions is honestly impressive. Guess what, y'all, it actually ISN'T fun playing babysitter with completely mentally-braindead player AI on your team! 

""COACH, YOU DIDN'T EVEN REGISTER ME FOR THE LEAGUE! I WANT A TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY."" - League registration window is more than 45 days away. Btw, I selected ""auto select players to register"" and had an additional EIGHT OPEN PLACES IN MY SQUAD. THANKFULLY, GREAT AI DIDN'T WANT TO INCLUDE THIS PLAYER IN MY TEAM FOR NO REASON SO NOW HE IS MAD!

Here's another favorite: I offer a player for sale. ""COACH, WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SELL ME? THIS IS PISSING ME OFF. I NO LONGER TRUST YOU AND I DEMAND A TRANSFER."" LMAO! Amazing, incredible updates. Seriously SI, you ought to just be embarrassed. Add on top of this Miles' (lead developer) incredibly blase attitude towards any suggestions that he doesn't agree with. This game is headed straight for the dumpster as soon as any competent competitor comes along.

Tactics are clearly more cookie-cutter than ever, xG has the be THE most frustrating addition to the game I've ever seen (if you thought watching your team lose with 40 shots to 2 was frustrating, wait until you lose with an xG of 6 to an xG of 0.1!), and the FIFA-level ""scripted"" feeling is so apparent it's almost insulting. 

I cannot support this company anymore. I have purchased every edition since FM 2010. They copy-paste virtually the EXACT same game with updated rosters every year (which, by the way, are horribly updated - Man United for example has been massively overrated for at least a decade). Sports Interactive has to be the shining example of why competition is so crucially important in business. With no competition whatsoever, they feel completely justified in rehashing the same sub-par product from 20 years ago. They created an unbelievable, genre-defining game with the Championship Manager series. Unfortunately, I think FM is going to go the way of Call of Duty - straight into the garbage bin.

I will not be purchasing FM in the future. Enough is enough.



I don't normally write reviews, but I left a blasting review of FM 20 - so it only seems fair that I'd recommend this one.

Even though they (imo) completely butchered the new UIs and things like xG are totally worthless additions, the vast improvements to the match engine in this edition represent actual, noticeable steps forward that you'd expect of a ""new game"" instead of bulls&%t fluff changes that they normally do with roster updates for each new edition. As long as they make actual technical advancement to the game, like they have in this version with the match engine, I will gladly overlook whatever other minor additions they decide to add as these are not important to the game's actual quality.

So, have fun with your random ""feature"" additions and do them however you want - much of this is moddable anyway. However, it's nigh impossible to mod the match engine, transfer AI, etc. Hope you continue this good work of upgrading the game technically, SI!

Good game, worth getting if you haven't bought in a few years or if you're on the fence. For once, I couldn't see myself going back to a previous version.",1607158868,1633372396,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

FM21 is a fantastic evolution to the series, and hits the spot for soccer professionals like me as we build up our IRL careers into something bigger and better.

[H1]WHAT'S NEW?[/H1]

With the full release of FM22 less than a month away,  it's prime time for reflecting on what FM21 brought to the series and what we as players are hoping to see in FM22. When people reflect on FM21, I think they'll remember the improved match day feel and streamlined system, making you feel as if you're in control of every aspect of your team. In fact, FM21 cleared up a lot of the issues I had with the series for multiple years in terms of clunkiness and randomness. 

I hope that FM22 (and based on the things that have been announced e.g. the new deadline day system, more options for stat geek-level analysis etc it seems like it will) focuses more on polishing the gem that was FM21 rather than trying to re-invent the wheel and getting stuck in the mud.

Now it's all about making the players happy, letting them have a rest every two weeks and give them higher wages every year. And if they get criticised for having a bad game, or if an opponent has a better haircut, they just can't win anymore.

I have been buying FM since it was called CM in 96/97. I have bought a copy of the game every single year until this year. For the past few years the game just isn't good enough, it's not fun or realistic anymore. This is the last one I'm buying, because the essence is gone.

FIX YOUR GAME!!!! or don't I don't care you're never getting my money again

Edit: Re-Review 3 months later 

Tried playing again and the verdict

This game is still horrible, how is issues I picked up in FM19 still appearing here? What have you guys been doing for the past 3 years???

The FM19 edition was the gateway to a whole new world of passion and love for the sport. When FM21 came out, I grabbed it early for the beta and never looked back. Has there been some bugs in the ME? Has there been some disappointing things that could be addressed, such as online/network play, statistic keeping/ratings in the game, and slide tackles? Sure.

But I still got a load of value out of this game, a lot of fantastic saves and don't regret the time spent at all. I'm still grinding out a save or two as the FM21 cycle ends. Already planning for FM22....

I have only played two FMs so far this one and 20. I plan on getting 22 when it comes out, but for the time being I felt compelled to talk about what I thought about this installment.  I am about 35 years into a save moving from the USA with Austin FC to having an illustrious career at Borussia Mönchengladbach enjoying every bit of it.
The match engine has greatly improved with being able to score many different types of goals and not seeing my team become side-netting FC. Enjoy getting close to my players with the interactions, while tedious and repetitive it adds a nice element to it. I feel like press conferences, pre/post game interviews need a rework or something. Its incredibly boring and I feel adds nothing fun to the game. The tactics are always fun to mess around with to see what works, but I always feel like I am at a disadvantage whenever I don't use an attacking style of play no matter what. Also with the way formations work I always find myself coming back to the 4-3-2-1 Wide. As much I wanted to use different ones again I felt like the game doesn't offer much success with others. Plus the regens I would get in youth academies didn't offer much else in differing positions.
Either way I adore this game and find myself getting lost in it for hours on end. It can obviously be improved in many ways but in its current state it isn't too bad and provides a good way to enjoy the in depth side of football.",1631902383,1631902383,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Personally felt that FM20 a bit of a step back in the core tactical side of FM while adding new features in the miscellaneous management area. Thankfully, FM21 improves a lot on some of the weird tactical stuff in FM20 besides continuing the trend of adding little features make the managerial experience more realistic (asking agent about player availability, removal of the role suitability circle, a hell of a lot improved image scan for manager character...especially female faces, the dugout section instead of perpetual pop ups, etc).

If you are in to gaming and like good graphics then you'll think this looks like a pile of sht, and it does. The graphics and engine are still terrible looking and a stupid, clunky mess.

I feel like they’re exploiting the loyalty of their customers. Every year they do the same thing. They leave a knowingly buggy game broken and then expect us all to pay for it again next year in hope that they’ve finally fixed what we paid for last year. Don't get me wrong, FM21 is still the greatest football management game ever made... But then again, is there really any worthy competition or any to compare it to? All we can do is compare it to last years which it is always going to be better than because its the same game with more content.

Off the pitch the experience is nearly perfect in terms of football simulation and management. While on the pitch the game has really a clumsy and obnoxious match engine. Those saying it has good graphics must be stuck in 2005 cos they're fking dreadful. Another issue is the lack of new interactions. Every question from the press is repetitive af, the same player interactions, random responses from players that you would not expect. You tell a player he had a good training session and he gets upset that you are happy with his training cos he thinks his training was not good enough. Ok mate. Then the argument drags out over months and he ends up sold in the next window. Stupid. Makes you not want to interact with players at all.

Overall, FM21 is a great game. You will spend countless hours perfecting your tactics, tweaking your player roles, finding the next best football player in the market, twiddling your finances, and much more. Off the pitch the game is amazing and won't disappoint. The fake 'social media' part of FM is great and I love reading it, but yet again like everything else... Its the same old things repeated again and again.

If you've never played FM or haven't played for a few years then you'll have an incredible time and it'll take up half your life. If you've played FM recently then there is hardly any new things and it isn't worth the price tag.

I can't recommend the game because of how much I feel mugged off by SI every year. They don't add enough content or new things that make it worthy of £40 price tag. 

I won't allow comments cos I don't need to hear from silly FM fanboys telling me the graphics are next-gen incredible feats of development.

If you're married and your wife hates the sound of the Xbox/PS turning on, this game on your laptop is for you.

Observations: the depth of this game is vast compared to FIFA. With a couple hundred hours into it, I only made it to the end of my fourth season. Granted, it was my first time ever playing an FM game so it took me awhile to learn. I watched numerous YouTube videos, Twitch channels, you name it. I was all in. Now, I'm exhausted. I was told that the game was more realistic than FIFA, maybe so. But the actual games... infuriatingly unrealistic. 

The amount of times the opposition scored in the final moments of stoppage time, times the opposition scored multiple goals a man down, times my players played the ball directly to the other team leading to one-on-ones with the GK. (Memphis Depay notoriously did this two times in a single game and at least 5 times in a season before I rage sold him for pennies on the dollar to the Chinese Super League.) I get it, unpredictable things happen in soccer/futbol. Great. But not like this. Not to where these are the usual. Not to where you become so numb that you no longer have anxiety as the extended highlight shows the inevitable.

In their determination to make it unpredictable, they made the game unplayable.

My breaking point was a little experiment that I did with Liverpool and Chelsea. More specifically, Liverpool U23 and Chelsea. In the FA Cup Quarter Final. The game had made me so jaded towards Liverpool that I just wanted to destroy them. I pulled out the In-Game Editor for the first time and stuck it to Liverpool. I loaned out all their Senior squad members, making them play with only their U23 players. But that wasn't all. I wanted them to feel my anger, my hate, so I made all of them ""Abysmal"" morale through the editor as well. That would do the trick.

I was wrong.

After 7 games, Chelsea's senior squad starting eleven finally beat Liverpool U23 in the FA Cup Quarter Final.

The U23 squad won 3 games, tied another 3 and finally lost the final game.

Different formations were tried, 5-3-2, 5-2-1-2, 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3
Different starting styles: Defensive, Cautious, Balanced, Positive, Attacking. But all led to Very Attacking in the final 10 minutes trying to muster another goal in the waning minutes of stoppage time. Yet Klopp prevailed with his Youngsters time after time.

The final (only) win: 4-2-3-1, Gengenpress, Attacking. But even then, Klopp had his group of U23 tied 2-2 in the 80th minute before conceding two late goals to lose 4-2.

That was when the realism was lost. Regardless of tactics, formations, or style, Chelsea starting eleven should beat Liverpool U23 barring the use of extremely unrealistic formations.

I had started to question the realism in my first save when I was Manchester United and won the treble (Premier, FA, Champions)  in my first year (completely unrealistic) without ever save-scumming. The FM gods granted me this, trying to suck me in. And it worked.

Maybe I'll play again. I can't say that I won't. I might have a weak moment. But I'm FM will quickly show it's colors.

T&P's to all you brave souls who continue the ruthless grind, for you are better men/women than I.",1629401714,1629401714,False,3,0,0.489063650369644165,0,True,False,False

Nope same POS they left us with 3 years ago. Wing backs and wings still dribble to the touchline and shoot from a 1 degree angle regardless of instruction or training or really, anything but an act of god that they should drag a cross back to the 6. Pressing is completely useless via the lack of AI which is actually understandable but its painful to watch 2 of your players chase a guy or the ball around the field and not control the space. Computer generated Players and tactics rarely if ever can emulate the actual design of soccer/football which is the use and manipulation of actual space. So often players collide in the same space from the same team or block a teammates shot simply because they can't understand the fundamental guidelines of moving through and into space as it applies to football. The end result is something like my sons 8U Saturday AM games I coach. Fortunately I don't swear nearly as much at them as I do at the FM franchise because I expect it from them. And for those of you who think i've missed the mark because this is a manager franchise - I can't even get my wing backs to not take long throws to absolutely no one when I've ordered them to keep possession. so uhh.....yeah Nothing to see here move along

Ad Addendum playing 12 hours more for science - imagine a world where KDB misses not one but TWO penalty kicks, Erling Halaand misses 2 point blank headers and 3 breakaways, every shot every  center attacking midfielder takes is blocked not only by the other team but more often by his own players AND this is all in the same game. By both teams so its not a bitch about just my team. I'm just so tired of an algorithim having to try to play out by giving some player like KDB or Halaand bullshit like that to meet the end result. The end most definitely does not justify the means. Sorry this game is just about as poisonous as a toxic relationship. They should rename it, ""The Ex"" I'M NOT KIDDING THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS SHIT. NOTHING FUCKING NEW HERE SINCE 2012. STOP PUTTING EARRINGS ON THE FUCKING GORILLA. EVEN WITH THE EARRINGS ITS STILL A FUCKING GORILLA. SOCIAL MEDIA????? REALLY????? BEFORE YOU FRENCH RETARDS (SORRY FRANCE) FIX THE FUCKING AI FOR THE HORSESHIT SHOOTING FROM A ZERO DEGREE ANGLE YOU LANDED ON ADDING THIS SOCIAL MEDIA HORSESHIT AND HAVING PLAYERS WHO ARE PLAYING EURO SOCCER DEMAND TO BE SOLD TO SOME TEAM THAT ISN'T??? THERE ISN'T A METER THAT COULD MEASURE THE SUCK IN THIS GAME. PLAYERS LIKE RONALDO OR MESSI HAVING GOAL DROUGHTS OF 13 HOURS??????? EVEN AFTER ENCOURAGING THEM AND COAXING THEM IN PRIVATE CHATS????? NEVER FUCKN' HAPPEN!!!
Know what this game needs? BETTER FUCKIN' PROGRAMMING CAUSE THERE'S NO TACTIC TO COUNTER THAT!

edit: 8/21 - bored AF and went back to remind myself why I don't ever play this - Yep still sucks. Absolute garbage. The transfer market is such a joke. Pennies on the dollar for my players, 386 million for Trent Alex-Arno.  even after i made him my #1 for a year and did all the right media things. Can ONLY retain players with huge contracts. I won the champions cup four years in a row and my star player leaves for a team that hasnt made it past quarters.

• The off field management is simply incredible, you can spend hours just managing the first team squad and hiring the right staff members
• Handling finance is also incredible, it's always satisfying to keep a club raking in the millions
• You also get a lot of control when it comes to training players. Molding a wonderkid to be the perfect player has never been better

Negative
• BIG NEGATIVE is the match engine. It's outdated and reeks of garbage.
• First of all the tactics are very one sided. If your not playing a high line, fast tempo, gegenpress your team will struggle.
• Defending is also abhorrent in this game. The Devs decided to balance it out by nerfing Attacking plays resulting in wingers hitting the side netting instead of squaring it, players just shooting the ball from long distance for no reason instead of taking a couple of dribbles and slot it in, and full backs waiting to be closed down resulting in the crosses blocked or losing possession for a counter attack
• Sweeper Keepers are just normal goalkeepers who take more passing risks. Very rarely you see them outside their box and actually SWEEP the god damn ball.
• Pace is also very important for attacking players as through balls over the top of defenders is op. Doesn't matter if the passer terrible he'll turn into prime xavi and find that pacey striker from 30 yards",1628994058,1628994058,True,1,0,0.49824562668800354,0,True,False,False

First, huge props to programmers having to deal with 20 years of legacy code, dubious frameworks and all other challenges of preserving and upgrading this enormous project. Development cycle of these games isn't long enough for meaningful changes and bug fixing. It's very hard to come up with something new, implementing it and having it completely tested on a yearly basis which could lead into things getting very stale and unexpected exploits appearing. There are also problems bleeding from one yearly version to next and so on.

These games suffer mostly from years and years of problem solving and innovating for the sake of innovation and bigger sales. Because of many overpowered exploits, or sometimes need to bring something new each year, things get overly complicated and some features get gutted. For example, in older versions corners were overpowered, so to make them more realistic we now have set piece routines that need to be set up before every single match if you want to have a chance at scoring them. Of course, you can save those routines but they are dependent on your players that you rotate almost every single match every season. Training was very simple and somewhat effective, but to add some sauce it got reworked and now it's kinda impossible to mold players to your will, improving specific attributes needed to take them to a new level. Meanwhile AI has almost free reign in developing their wonderkids. ""Realism"" is used at will to justify many creative decisions. Yet FM presents unrealistic scenarios all the time. Not only in match engine, but for example with man management. Would a player with loyal personality throw a fit after bid from a barely higher reputable team gets rejected? Would professional personalities try to turn whole dressing room against manager for not getting a contract they required with astronomical demands? To me at least, fun is much more important than the realism.

The challenge of FM games can be as difficult as you wish. Everything is possible with enough time and dedication. There are pre-made tactics which are so overpowered you don't even need to build any, if that's how you wish to manage. As time passes the games sadly boil down to recruitment (having better players than the rest) and going through the same motions which is inherently the biggest flaw of designing games like these. Unfortunately they will eventually become a chore regardless of how fun the challenge started. 

My frustration mostly comes from encountering same irritating things that kill the fun for me:
[list]
    [*]Transfers are a nightmare. If you are already very rich club you have nothing to worry about. But if you care about managing finances, you will have to deal with disgusting demands of players and AI teams. AI teams will lowball you when buying and rip you off completely when selling. AI teams will trade fairly between themselves and players will accept much lower contracts compared to what they demand from you. Worst part is that other teams will destroy your squad harmony and upset your biggest performers in order to buy them, only to not play them more than 10 games over 3 years before selling them on a bloated contract.
    [*]Wingers waiting for defenders to cover them, so they can blast a cross right into those defenders leading to corner number 53.
    [*]The amount of micromanaging stuff. You do have option of delegating things to other staff members but they will always do a below par job. Letting your assistant manager lead training could sometimes damage your match preparations and lead to multiple season long injuries. This is a management game, yes, but the amount of control and systems is simply very high and to play optimally you simply have to utilise them all
    [*]In former games, you could simply stack as much Brazilian and Argentinian wonderkids as you want. To nerf this, their wonderkinds became much more expensive and luxurious. So to bypass this, you simply resort to buying cheap Colombian, Peruvian, Chilean (all other South American really) and Eastern European wonderkids.
    [*]Promises to players when buying them are really stupid. Sometimes they will require to play in a role you randomly set on your tactic last match when experimenting. You might never even play that role again and that player probably didn't even play that role ever before. Yet if you don't fulfill those promises, whole squad will turn against you.
    [*]Squad dynamics, morale and player personality systems being completely out of whack. Get out of CL groups as an Eastern European team for 4 years in a row? Say that your goals is getting out of groups again in team meeting and they will jump their guns, get abysmal morale and whatnot thinking it's unrealistic. Every player no matter the personality is just a mercenary that will turn heel at first chance. There's rarely one club players among talented wonderkids (possible if you are 5 star reputation team), and the only thing personality can tell you is how likely will those players improve in the future (if they have potential).
    [*]Reputation system is a bad. You could be winning CL every season for 10 years and your reputation wouldn't increase much. It's very slow and has so many factors in play. 
    [*]Scouts are almost useless. The only good thing they can do is show you huge lists of potential wonderkids that will not become a star players in 9/10 cases. Sometimes you manage to dig a real gem there. Also, scouts' judgement of players ability and potential gives almost exactly the same reports when that grade is above 9.
    [*]Tactics. They are all over the place. AI doesn't need tactical familiarity to counter you yet if you try something new, you will be punished. Defensive tactics are terrible in this installment, leaking goals left and right with not much to offer in counter attacks. Yet AI perfectly parks the bus when it needs. Pre-made 4231 Gegenpress simply stomps the game.
    [*]Some matches are simply not meant to be won. Every now and then comes a match that simply isn't winnable, sometimes not even drawable. I've tried replaying those more than 20 times with many different tactics and results would be similar, despite my lower level sides managing to beat stronger opponents only months prior. 
    [*]Getting FM'd (losing or drawing last minute while dominating the whole game) occurs from time to time but unlike matches above, replaying them will have wildly different outcomes.
    [*]I don't care if real world statistic might back this feature up, but from FM19, present even today in FM21, every time without fail, on a day 2 days away from a matchday, at least one injury occurs. Micromanage every player's training, overload, rest, whatnot, every time, on a day 2 days away from a matchday, dreading message appears in the inbox informing you that at least one of your players (even U19 are included in this black magic) got injured and won't recover in time for said matchday. 
    [*]I dislike how player improvement works. Late bloomers basically don't exist. Jamie Vardy, van Dijk, Mahrez aren't possible as every player's ceiling is determined when they are created. And their development is over when they turn 24. Achievements do not lead to stat improvements which I think should be a feature. It's even realistic...  
[/list]
I've probably missed many other things but it's the gist of it. 

These games are great to scratch the itch but over time they got overly complicated and time consuming. In older versions you could easily do a season in one sitting while this one simply eats time like a candy. Aside from that FM21 is plagued with flaws. bugs and uncreative substitutes to move the problem from one thing to another.",1627754015,1627754015,False,428,13,0.871378779411315918,18,True,False,False

I bought it last month on sale and played for a bit but didn't touch it because it was very confusing but after I watched a few Zealand videos I could do what I wanted and now I am hooked. It recreates all the emotions of a football match perfectly. I found my self celebrating like my team had just won the Champions League but in reality we didn't get relegated in League 1. It is just a fun game to play and it's great to play by yourself.

At a certain point, you've just won the Europa League with Tranmere Rovers, having munched through the English leagues, and think to yourself ""this is boring."" It's a lovely looking game, sure enough, but all the bells and whistles can't take away from the fact that it's utterly unchallenging. I'm not boasting about tactics, because I played a 2-3-5 and still beaten Bayern with Queen's Park with 58% of possession.

Loaded up a save as I have some time off work so can really invest into it. Did a full preseason and had to force quit the game after 4 league matches due to the sheer frustration I now always feel when playing it. I hate the phrase 'FM'd' but on this edition (and the last one) its a real thing. Every game is the same. Dominate the game, create more shots, more shots on target and have double the xG of the opponent and either lose or scrape a narrow 3-2 victory with conceding at least 1 goal in the last 10 minutes no matter what tactic you use. 

I've got strikers with 18 composure, 17 shooting who need 4 good chances a game to score a goal but the opposition need 1 or 2 tops. It just feels like its so weighted towards the computer. and against the user. 

I'm not saying i want to win every game 5-0 and it be easy but there is a balance and it hasnt got it anymore. 

On the other side of the coin, its not realistic at all when it comes to player transfers and manager movements. Man City and Chelsea spend circa 300m every year and never break ffp. City spend 150m each on Fati and Mbappe just to use them as impact subs. I tried to buy ilaix moriba from barca and they wanted 150m and he wanted 600k a week, he was then sold to chelsea in the same window for 100m on 200kla week?

Real shame because i have poured thousands of hours of my life into this franchise both on pc and psp since fm08and fm16 is one of my favourite games ever. I still fire up my old windows laptop every so often just to go and look through the save. They have taken the 'game' in the wrong direction and its not a fun experience anymore. :(",1627512750,1627512750,False,6,0,0.569378018379211426,0,True,False,False

This is a game almost exclusively played by men because women generelly don't care for football and they care even less for football manager simulation games!

The fm series is the perfect game for you if you are the kind of person who likes to look into tactical aspects of football and have a love for the sport.

Though player attributes play a big role for the game, the tactical side of it also takes a big proportion of the factors deciding whether you win or lose in the matches you play.

Although there are new tactical features such as gegenpressing and tiki taka, there are some tactics which are more dominant compared to others. If you get the hang of the game, you can figure out that there are some best response strategies based on the tactics of the opposing team. If you are playing single player, upon realizing this, it kind of gets repetitive after a few seasons.

+ The game is detailed, allowing you to control many aspects of managing a football club, from tactics to locker room dynamics.
- 3D engine feels weird sometimes. Match engine feels like it decides what the outcome of the match should be, not based on the quality of the teams involved, but based on some mysterious dark force.

Full story:
Well, I've spent 96 hours on this game, and I think that's it for me. I know this may sound like a rant, and some may say that I'm frustrated from bad results, but I'll try to be honest and unbiased.

The game interface is extremely detailed and, in my opinion, well designed, albeit a bit confusing at first. You can control a lot of variables, from individual and collective training, to tactics, set pieces, player instructions, team talks, individual player talks, and so on.

The 3D match representation... Well, it isn't the biggest issue I have with the game, but it could be better. In most of my attacking moves, it feels like my winger has a clear opportunity to cross a ball, but he just waits for the opposite wing-back to arrive and crosses the ball against him, so that a corner is conceded. And I get that the 3D graphics are just representing the outcome of whatever the game engine has calculated based on all the variables, including the pace of the winger and the defender, and so on. Even so, one would guess that the engine would try to be as realistic as possible. And I have an insane amount of corners for my team in every match, so that is not realistic.

So, that takes us to the match engine, which is the biggest issue of this game.

I started out as SL Benfica, one of the title contenders in the Portuguese League. I tried to play attacking football throughout the whole season, and mostly succeeded. As I haven't played FM in some time, I wasn't familiar with the whole (enormous) range of tactical options, so the games against my direct rivals were tough. I think I lost most of them in my first season, which is okay. Even so, I won most of the games against inferior teams, and won the title with about 10 pts difference to the 2nd place.

During this first season, there were already some ridiculous results. There was one Champions League match against the weakest team in the group where I dominated most of the match, but lost it with a late winner by the opposition. And that's tough, but that's football, and that happens every once in a while. And I can understand that. Also, in the middle of the season, my team had a dip in performance, which was associated with some problems in the locker room, and that was also realistic. Even then, I was able to pull through most of the matches with some tight wins.

That's not to mention some ludicrous results that happened in some international matches where I was not involved, like Juventus beating Liverpool by 8-0. I mean, that could also happen in real life, but come on.

Something weird I noticed during the first season was that I was suffering one goal in almost every match. Even in matches that I absolutely crushed the opposition, they always managed to find the back of my net at some point in the game. And I get that there could be something wrong with my defense, tactically. I mean, it's weird that it would happen in every match, even when I was winning by five goals, but still. I made several tactical adjustments throughout the season and ended on a strong note, not conceding for like 4 or 5 matches.

And then came the second season.

It started great. I won the supercup trophy with a comfortable win against one of my major rivals. The off season tactical changes and transfers seemed to be working for the better. I won the first three league games comfortably without conceding goals.

And then it happened. In the following match, the game decided that it would put an end to this. I had 30 shots on total, about 15 on target, I hit the woodwork three times (it was even mentioned in the press conference). The opposition had two shots on target and, obviously, in the 80th minute, they scored. I lost 1-0.

I get it, this sometimes happens in football. In one match, maybe. But this continued in my following three matches. I tried to make tactical changes, I tried holding team meetings, and we always dominated the match, I always ""put up a fantastic performance"" (I'm quoting) according to the mysterious ""xG"" indicator, which was always ""far greater"" than that of my opponent, but I still ended up drawing or losing the match. In the 4th match, I was expecting the same to happen, and suddenly, in the 93rd minute, I scored the 1-0. I got up from my chair to celebrate, surely this was the end of the bad lucky streak. I immediately gave my team instructions to try to hold possession and defend the result; with one minute left in the match, there was no way I would lose it now. But in the kickoff, literally from the kickoff, the opposition exchanged two passes, and with the third pass, the ball ended up with their striker and past my defenders, and they scored the equalizer.

This is also football, and it could happen. But I find it really hard to believe.

Even so, my team pulled back together, and we got a couple of wins in the next matches. After that, I played probably my last FM match ever. It was a cup match against a third division team. I was having about 70% ball possession, 12 shots, 6 on target, and was winning 2-0 at the 25th minute. I remind you this was a third division team, vastly inferior to mine. And they were losing by 2-0, with 0 (zero) shots on target at that time. Suddenly, on a goal kick (yes, a goal kick) their keeper makes a pass directly to their striker, he zaps past my central defender and makes it 2-1. I mean, okay. They were lucky. They had barely exchanged two passes until then, but yeah, I could accept that. My team was still the better team. The problem is that this happened two more times. Yes, they scored three times from a goal kick. When the second half started, I was set on reversing this tendency and grabbing the result. But the match engine was having none of that, because this third division team scored two more times, making it 5-2. I remind you, this is a game I was winning comfortably 2-0, and they hadn't even made a single shot on target. Suddenly, they were the best players in the world.

I ended up losing the match 5-4, but that didn't even matter anymore. I can stand one or two of these incredibly improbable events, because that's the beauty of football, but they are improbable for a reason. They don't happen in five consecutive matches. I don't like a game where it feels like the outcome is pre-determined. That i lost the match, not because the oppostion was better, but because the match engine deemed it so. That's why I'll probably never play FM again, at least not until they fix this situation, which I find highly unlikely, to be quite honest.",1626328375,1626328844,False,5,1,0.519132614135742188,0,True,False,False

Yes, like most sports games, it is just a rehash of last year, with a slightly new skin, and some new rosters, however, this years addition adds just a little bit more. The match engine has been completely overhauled since last year, and players make decisions 10 times better, and watching the game feels way more fluid. A lot of bugs that had plagued last years edition, even through the updates and patches, have been completely fixed in this years edition. I loved the simplification of some of the UI, mainly the conversion of the green circles to star ratings that better indicate levels of proficiency at a certain position / role. I am not too fond of the new pep talk system, as I feel sometimes the gestures are not as easy to understand as the emotions that had been in previous iterations, but over time I got used to it, and its been alright.

I am an American who has barely watched a full match of soccer in my life and I still instantly fell in love with this game. The staff delegation system makes it so easy to learn the mechanics and not get too overwhelmed with complexities of this game. The noob friendliness makes it so easy to learn the mechanics one at a time instead of throwing you into the thick of it all at once. You don't even need to watch or really enjoy soccer to get into this game, most of it consists of the backroom aspects such as signing players, scouting, budgeting, gameplans, and much much more. This game has instantly became my new favorite game to play and I recommend it to anyone who likes strategy sims.

Pros:
Amazing and intricate gameplay
Fully Fleshed out rules for every league
Noob friendly
Immersive

Cons:
I wish there was music on the homescreen or any sound honestly, the only sounds in this game are fans cheering
Run into the occasional hard lock bug
Some freezes that last ~15-20 second
The depth chart screen is hard to understand when it puts some starters in positions where they are third or fourth string which makes it harder to understand the depth of your team (maybe there is a filter for this i haven't found)

I won every competition with arsenal 4 seasons on the trot, played with millwall and got them promoted top of the league then won the premier league first season then the champions league straight away, with dortmund i didnt lose a match for the two seasons i played. I do have a decent understanding of football tactics but surely this shouldnt happen. I have played an arsenal campaign 5-6 times and always win everything first season in, even with minimal squad changes. I did the 5 main leagues in one career and managed to win the champions league in my first season with each club.
The game really feels far too easy making it relatively boring once you know what youre doing, many interactions feel like pointless clicking. I struggled to find competition from the ai and had to abandon a lot of saves as the AI didnt provide much competition. Gestures seem pointless as once you work it out you just click the right 2-3 eventually becoming a bit of a chore and boring. Would be nice to see more negative things happen with the team off field in order to balance the ease of everything(outside of injuries). 
Would be good if they could make use of several  tactics instead of setting one up and beating everyone with it(certain formations should overpower others more like in rl so that you actually have to 'manage' the team).
I know licensing is an issue but i shouldnt have to delete files just so german players can play in  the german team etc. Being honest the main leagues and main nations are most important, name changes dont upset me too much but national teams with random generated players is just a joke when they come from major footballing nations.
I like the menus and the tactical analysis, I just wish the game was more difficult so i would feel bothered to actually look at it. If its the tactics i created that were overpowered then they should be balanced more as i was using common tactical approaches which are seen throughout modern as occasionally classic football. I find it to be a game that can be very enjoyable when a competitive element exists but winning constantly with ease becomes boring very quickly. Gegenpress with majority of tactics is too overpowered, it needs to be in the game as it is a common tactical approach but should have some weaknesses in game surely?
Overall the game can be very enjoyable but if you understand football, especially the tactical element the game becomes far too easy, big clubs or even decent sized clubs are too easy to manage also.

It can still be played as in-depth as you want or you can give it a light touch and have some fun without tweaking every dial and knob in the game. 

I go about half-way between the two. I'm very hands on with the senior team, but let my staff handle the U23 and U18 sides and utilise by Director of Football to handle a lot of the contract work which lets me focus on selection, tactics, training and recruitment for the senior team. If you have ever listed to or read the huge amount of information out there about the game then take this one thing away: everything in the game is connected. Having players who suit your tactical system, who have a good work eithic and are great trainers will stand you in good stead. If they can play a bit too then that's great :)

My top tips for having a good save on each area:
Recruitment: Work your scouts and build up your shortlist. Scout everywhere, when they make a suggestion then get them to scout the player and scout them until they are 100% scouted. Be liberal with your trials, there is absolutely no harm in getting a player in for four weeks to see if he's any good. From this you can build up a long shortlist of players which you can instantly turn to when your main striker does his cruciate and is out for a year or you get promoted and need to upgrade your playing staff.
Tactics: Keep it simple. In FM21 game you will often get players saying they are unfamiliar with the tactical setup even though you've been practicing it for months. Play players in the position that best suits your tactical plan, and don't overburden them with instructions, one or two will do, if that. I hardly give players any individual instructions at all. In real life footballers are mostly not tactical geniuses and this follows in the game. Oh and take a little time to create set-piece routines (you don't need to go mad and do them all at once, set up one per quarter of the season, it is a boring thing to do). It will benefit you in the long run, set-pieces are so important in modern football.
Training: It's important to have a training plan, but you need to keep an eye on it and tweak it now and again. I let my assistant handle setting up the training sessions, but if I see something that requires attention I will throw in a session or two to address it. If my team is wasteful in front of goal I might put in a Chance Conversion session. If the upcoming opposition are good from set-pieces (There is loads of analysis available on your opposition and I find watching key highlights from their last match useful) I will put in a session on defending corners.
Selection: It can be hard to keep a large squad happy as they mostly all want to play. I rarely play the same team in consecutive games, changing one or two players each game can help give game time to everyone and keep the players fresh. If a player does become unhappy and starts demanding game time then I will never back down. I'll try and convince them to get their head down and work hard to earn their chance, but if they are adamant then it's my way or the highway. There can only be one boss.

I like the new analysis features, simple things like if you xG is bad, working out a way to get more good chances to my forwards (You can have lots of shots, but low xG a lot of the shots are taken from poor positions). Heat maps can be instructive, are my players playing in the areas I expected?

There's loads to get your teeth into in the game, but try and keep the AI guessing. Think of it as an opposition manager, if you play the same team and tactics every single week regardless of results and opposition then then that opposition manager will work out a way to combat you.

Overall, I have really enjoyed the latest Football Manager iteration so far, some good new useful features while it hasn't lost any of the playability of old.",1625234706,1625234706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A few matches before the end of season. My most used player who played in 35 games. He was really tired, I benched him for 1 match to give him some rest. He called for a meeting because he want to play more.
In league preview we were supposed to relegate, we made it to play off where we did not promote because of one goal. I told players next year we will promote to increase their mood, all went to depression because the target is just too high.
Youngster asked why I didn't fulfil my promise to loan him to give him real match experience after a season when he started in more than 50% of matches with my team.
And the worst thing that is happening every transfer window. I got very low offer/s for my youngster/s. Board decide to sell because it is great offer. I protest, they told me I can use my transfer budget to find replacement. Equal replacement costs 10x more. Once I saved and put my resignation on table to see the reaction. They told me they want me to stay and therefore will increase transfer budged by the same amount that club received for the sold player. They were selling the player for 1.6m while club had 36m in coffers. Equal replacement was 20m+ And you can make the situation even more absurd. Next transfer window you can buy some of them back for 10x more.

There were more non sense complain from players or weird reactions, I don't remember them all.

I like to buy the editor and edit some rules for English nation that everybody is treated as EU to overcome some transfer limitation. There really should be a warning about Brexit. Because I played first year, England said goodbye to EU and all my rules are gone and now it become pretty problematic to buy anyone.

I hate all the talks, they are absolutely silly. Players do not reflect real situation, they react on situation that was year ago. Often what you say and their reaction does not make any sense.",1624871949,1624877494,False,18,7,0.612535476684570313,0,True,False,False

Fast forward to 2021 and we live in interesting times. Facemasks and lockdowns. So what better game to help beat the Covid blues than to take a look at how far the game has come in 10-odd years. Just a look for nostalgia's sake.

First FM game i've played, and i'm completely hooked. I used to play the occasional FIFA game from around 2002 till 2010, but the playing itself was always my least favourite part. Picking formations and securing transfers was always the stuff i sunk my teeth into the most, so FM is right up my alley. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, now i get to be in charge of training, youth intake, facilities, staff, press and more. 

Highly recommend if you enjoy the managing aspects of FIFA, which i can never go back to.

Ronaldo is beyond broken tho. I had to reload the saved game twice in order to beat Portugal as France. He just scored a goal when we are tied like 1-1 on 90+. LoL. I guess I was lacking on in-game strategies. So I had to form from clean sheet. Then I found that a single style (called 4-3-3 DM wide/tiki-taka) it also works with a composition of wing press, that on every single match there is a really high percentage of win. 

Since then, I've became the number one with both France and PSG. 

I've made an offer for Messi but his fee was also enough to made me extremely uncomfortable. Barcelona demanded like 220m just for the fee. My budget was just about 10-40m. 

Tho I knew that the transfer section will be problematic so I've created a character named Falcon who is just 15 yo. and fully boosted. Can line up every single position except GK. Unfortunately that damn fella injured with a back pain when he tackles. He is my exit plan nowadays. 

I've totally liked the game. The only issue is that whenever I start to game, it leads a casual main menu but with a fucking tik-tok add on! it is the only bloody downside is for this gem. Just delete the fucking banner fam. I don't want to see anything related to that cursed app and platform. And seeing something like that in a manager game is such a controversial disappointment...

You can be the by far best team in the league and you will always have a seasonal rival (undocumented in-game) which will keep the pace with you. You can be a heavy-weight in a small league and there will be a team which is not better than any other in competitions which will go with the same results as you. 

Worst part when the game decides that it should boost your real rival. I have just one example of it: playing in UPL with Shakhtar I managed to finish the season with 28 wins and 2 draws in the 30 games. Guess what was the gap with Dynamo Kiev? 2 points. The third place was like 20 points lower. A season before I lost the league to Vorskla - it had lost points in 4 games through the whole season and my only loss was to them. I had numerous finishings in previous seasons with different teams when on the last match day the leader was losing, my team coming second won and then the third team became the first on goal difference, winning 5-0 and scoring its last goal on the last minutes in injury time. I get that it happens in football, see Man City and Aguero, but not in the course of couple of seasons in a row.

Apart of that the game is addicting as ever although SI doesn't care for bug fixing (top managers have like perpetual contracts, in my 15 season save Simeone, Conte, OGS, Pochettino and Flick ALL were managing their starting cubs) and their UI designer clearly hates people - I can't find any reason to make the UI overloaded mess in dark purple color. In 2021 SI didn't even care to add additional skins leaving it to fans. Really, you become so lazy? You had to tweak a couple of lines of code to do that.

Match engine looks much better until you realize that it relies heavily on the patterns. If you get that patterns, you can exploit it, and if you want to keep it natural you will face artificial difficulty spikes. Maybe in 2000s it was the same, I don't know, it all felt like an unscripted free flow and now you can guess the outcome of episode 90% times the 3D field appears.

Tactics make no sense, as you can't play defensive football relying to soak the pressure - it's instantly punished by the opposition. Players with 5 in long shots suddenly pull of Roberto Carlos if you play defensive and there is no way to explain it but the match engine flaws. If the game decides that it's time to score, it will score. To play attacking you should do counter-intuitive things (deep defensive line and low pressure against the last team in a league is a must or you will be heavily beaten with the magic 30-meter screamers).

On top of that you have the SI community forums with extremely gatekeeping audience which is intolerable to any criticism of their game. Moderators delete negative comments claiming they welcome meaningful discussion and constructive criticism. Like, I'm a paying customer who gets banned for stating that I'm not that happy with what I've payed for. In all my years online I've never seen more toxic and hostile community - even Reddit is friendly and supportive in comparison. Think twice before sponsoring it. I was a big fan of FM in 2005 - 2012 editions, I haven't really played for 8 years and I had over 700 extremely frustrating and unrewarding hours in 2020/21 versions. I won't buy it before they fix the UI and fire their UI designer. I can't possibly recommend the game which is made with the goal to frustrate the players and encourage exploits.",1624035903,1624035903,False,124,11,0.791296005249023438,0,True,False,False

It all combines to make you feel like you're actually a manager and not just playing a game. I'm at around 230 hours of FM21 and I'm still constantly finding myself engaging with new things. 

Last, I'd just like to share my experience/thoughts on scum-saving. For the most part during my thousands of hours of FM over the years, I felt like I was pretty fair about reloading matches - I only tended to do it if I had a bad injury to a star I'd just signed, or conceded a BS glitch/bug goal, etc. Sometimes if I was having a bad day and fired up FM only to be down 4-0 to Man City in the 35th minute I'd just Ctl-Alt-Delete and replay the match a few days later. But with my new save in FM21, I've been experimenting with a strict no-save-scumming policy, and it's added a whole new compelling element to my gameplay. I had a real stinker of a game against Newcastle (5-0 I think) - the sort of game I'd have been tempted to reload in the past - and a day later my players refunded the supporters' tickets for the match. How cool is that!? I also got to within one bad result of getting sacked, and had to get something away at Sheffield Utd - what a nerve-racking match that was! My boys pulled out a 3-1 win to keep me alive, and we had a short run of good form to finish the season, allowing me to get the transfer reinforcements I desperately needed. 

So TL;DR: FM is hands down the best sports management sim on the market, I felt it was well worth the money to upgrade from FM18 to FM21, and if you've never experimented with a no-save-scum policy - give it a whirl. I think you'll find it rewarding.",1623524201,1623524201,True,100,4,0.885791897773742676,0,True,False,False

One of the most annoying for me is the following:  for example, my AML is an inside forward. I have a player who I've customised so he is inverted winger. Once I pick that guy, the position changes to inverted winger for good. This is the same all over. DR is a winger? 1 guy gets custom complete wing back and the position is forever changed. 
Another one is I can't customise the player landing screen, I need to see current and potential ability of my players buy SI don't care. Also on player page the pitch icon showing positions is tiny and poorly done.

Absolutely shocking game, so many bugs with match engines like the same team wearing 2 different kits, AWFUL considering i build a new pc as i thought it was my previous computers performance but its actually how bad the game is/runs, pretty sure they introduced the match engine in 2009 and its EXACTLY the same. Work permits are an absolute mess and are so inconsistent, gestures in press conferences and team talks have Zero impact and are pointless, training camps when selection is left to assistant main squad players are left out leading to them being unsettled, transfer glitches which are blatantly their algorithm failing. For years they've just brought out the same game and 99% of the time add a meaningless feature and brand it as a 'complete revamp'. The next EA Sports and Fifa when they find a way to make more than the £40 robbery already.
Injuries are beyond a joke, you'd accept first season injuries due to covid and the schedule but there are 2-3 players getting injured or knocks every game regardless of training or match fitness, played in a cup semi final on my latest career and made 3 changes at half time, player gets injured after 60 minutes and am down to 10 men for the last half hour, goes to extra time and the game itself will not allow for the injured player to be substituted despite being granted an extra sub so had to play an extra time with 10 men because the game itself hasn't got the scenario inputted due to absolutely CLUELESS PROGRAMMERS/DEVELOPERS! If this was £15-£20 like your standard indie games you wouldn't be so fussed, but the idea that these criminals charge £40 for an unfinished game full of bugs is beyond a joke!

The matches feel real (which is a welcome change!), and maintaining a good run of form, getting the result that gets you out of a losing run, preparing for a big match, all of it feels insanely real. The stakes feel really high and I feel far more tense than I ever have playing Football Manager.

The pre-match and post-match briefings are similarly more detailed, and I'm a big fan of the added post-match screens that show the reaction on social media, next to other results and a glimpse of the table.

Games are as  difficult as ever to manage, and the minutiae of detail is just as overwhelming as always. Rather than a complete overhaul, there are numerous minor tweaks in Football Manager 2021, affecting tactical exploration and simulation. This time around, energy levels in particular seem to play a greater role, presumably to combat previously effective pressing tactics. In other words,  you can’t rely on your tried-and-tested methods from last year to get by.

Football Manager 2021‘s biggest change seems to come in the way that you, as a Manager, communicate. Gone are the meaningless emotions while addressing people; instead, your decisions are broken down into what really matters. While talking to players, the boardroom or press, you can respond in a much more clear way. You’ll be able to choose from responses that are positive, negative, convincing, or even backing down. Better yet, the intended meaning of everything you say is clearly laid out.

The communication overhaul really adds a lot to how you are judged as a manager in Football Manager 2021. Yes, results are still important, but you can really change the parameters of what your personal success is. If you aren’t doing especially well but are achieving the promises you have set out, you will be given more time.

This happened to me; in my first season of managing, I had slightly underachieved. But because I had delivered on my promise to repair the financial damage of the over bloated squad, I wasn’t kicked out at the end of the season where I might’ve been in previous instalments. The next season, having been able to gain control of the finances, I was able to cultivate success. This is a new experience for me in a Football Manager game; a series I’ve been playing for over a decade. While I may have improved the finances of a club before, I have never overtly communicated my goals to the boardroom and insisted on time to deliver.

Football Manager 2021 has done something that great managers do: it has acknowledged its weaknesses and improved upon them without completely rocking the boat. It still feels truly familiar as a Football Manager game, but the overhaul to expectations and communication makes for a more coherent and impactful experience. There’s more of a focus on what you say and do in your role as a manager and, over seasons, your performance is better judged. It makes a real difference to how the game can play out. The matchday experience may not be massively improved, but the improved focus elsewhere makes a real difference. For anyone who truly likes to get into the role of manager, Football Manager 2021 is a must.",1622815267,1622815357,True,21,0,0.694169521331787109,3,True,False,False

This game provides a fair and balanced system which lets you do well if you know what your doing and are prepared for opposition but if you try and speed it: you get really something back for being bad.

I enjoy the ethic of always improving. I feel very immersed and determined to become a better manager. For example, I had a bad playoff season with Nashville in the MLS. I got so annoyed because we lost to a trash team so I berated the players and got rid of dead wood. I then signed top prospects and I'm now in the running of finishing 1st in the supporter's shield.

However, I don't purchase every new FM, only every second. Last one I played was fm19 and fm17 before that. It seems the developers are bit lazy for bringing in new features and removing or fixing features that don't quite work and therefore getting every second new version is enough. 

An example: The team talk is still practically the same as it was 4 years ago. New comments are rare and you get very quickly bored when asked the same questions over and over and over again. AI is poor in the questions as well. Last question before my CL final was a random team in the same league putting a random player on transfer list and asking if I agree with the decision or not. The impact of answers seems minor as well yet it features now more often than ever. At least in the new version you can safely let the assistant manager handle them not risking everybody getting angry when they say silly things. 

Another (small) example: Negotiating a new contract with your club. As it has been years now, they don't budge at all. They offer something regardless of how well you have managed the team and asking even ""one tick"" more results them just offering the original sum until you either accept it or don't get new contract. So you can make the team best in the world winning CL many times in a row and the salary stays at the same, or you leave. Just a minor thing but annoying.

So basically a very good game as always with minor improvements from FM19 (match engine is really cool from time to time and removing % and putting hearts in condition for example is way better and realistic) but if SI wants us to buy every new version coming up yearly, they should have little more effort than just updating the database",1621674926,1621674926,True,110,1,0.90991520881652832,0,True,False,False

Most of the options (tactics, training etc.) feel like a series of traps rather than a way to get your team to play the way you want.  Every little tweak sends your players' behaviour off in a wildly exaggerated direction.  Pick one of the handful of combinations that work and you'll do well every time.  Most combinations produce awful results.  Press conferences are still repetitive, dull and relentless, but sending your asst manager feels oppressively suboptimal.  The social media guff is repetitive and often makes no sense.

If I had to guess, I'd say that a few years back SI made the decision to limit control over player behaviour to prevent people from making overpowered tactics that broke the match engine, which has resulted in them... breaking their own match engine and sucking a lot of the fun out of this game which was once such a joy.

edit:  I gave it a fair go, ten seasons.  It's just so bad.  Players behave like they've never seen a football in their lives, making the *exact* same stupid movement combinations over and over.

I have 3 suggestions for future games. 
1. a notepad in game, jot down points, little reminders. ability to note stuff on the calender ie. to give players a weekend off. 

2. Matchday sounds are terrible. perhaps include chants, or DLC to include club songs such as if you play as Liverpool you get the first verse of a muffled 'walk alone', maybe some commentary. 

3. Far more shouts ingame, far more options in team talk. having the same 5 options is repetitive. Same with talking to the board and all interactions with people including press.

I skip every couple of years, because no matter how good these games are not much changes on a year to year basis. I've held off from buying for a little bit longer because I saw all the reviews these last couple of years about the ""match engine"" but honestly have had no problems.

The game runs really well, feels really good, and more importantly is a lot of fun. I enjoy some of the new stats/analysis they've given us, as well as amount of talent that get's generated 10 seasons+ into the game. in the past I've noticed that once the non-generated players have gone in the past, that sometimes good players were harder to find. Not for the players, but for the rest of the clubs. I enjoy that despite developing some of my players for 5 seasons, I still am challenged by other teams. In the past I felt like the game turned into a steam roller once you got enough talent. This is the first game that I've played where it's still challenging me.

At the core it's a spreadsheet, you won't be controlling a player and using them or anything like that - it's strictly a game about managing. A lot of numbers, a lot of looking at numbers and, at least at first, a lot of trial and error until you work out to game the various mechanics and such.

What's really odd about is that it's not boring. Given you're basically staring at an excel spreadsheet for a few hours before a match happens it's oddly enjoyable.

I will say though the press related stuff that happens in game, as well as player interaction in general is repetitive, dull and utterly meaningless in any real sense. At first it's fairly immersive... until you realise they're the same questions and issues repeated forever.

They claim to add new features in the game but all it does is over-complicating it, rather than fixing the actual issues. 

Years after years the game has never changed because the scenarios are always the same. I don't even think they bothered to change some codes for maybe 10 years. Outcomes are predictable and the game feels scripted as hell.

And the bugs.. Imagine a ""simulation"" where a team scores a goal, it's not offside, it's not canceled, no VAR review, players celebrate it, it is even on the replay after the game, but it is not registered on the scoreboard. I wouldn't even mentioned this if it happened once but it happened 3 times in a single career so I assume it's not a rare bug at all.

When you complained about this back in the old days, people would say in the forums that your chances are probably not that valuable, or most of your shots probably were long shots, they've come up with any type of excuses. Because there were some people constantly winning games, and you were not winning, so the problem must've been about you.

But now we have xG. Now we can prove that the match engine is flawed, and no matter how much big chances you create, you will lose that match if the engine thinks your tactic is bad. You are watching the matches for nothing. If you watch the match you will think that your tactic is superior, but if you check the scoreline you are losing. And it is impossible to understand just by watching your matches that your tactic should change to win, because everything is in order if you don't look at the scoreline.

I am also playing the games on 2D engine, because the 3D engine kills my love of football. The players act like someone took their brain out, the shots and pass physics are a joke, and the marking and initiative skills of the players are equal to a 3 year old kangaroo's. Even the net starts shaking before the ball goes into the net. With 2D engine, at least I can still use my imagination and think that the makers are not robbing us year after year.

- great amount of detail
- easy to navigate menus
- in game graphics much improved
- online play is awesome
- plenty of customization available in the workshop


Bad =

- in game xG makes no sense
- in game shots + shots on target seem to mean nothing
- some badges + team names missing

I would say a must buy for any football fan. Takes some getting used to by is really worth the patience. I would strongly recommend playing online with friends in the same league.... far too much fun!

1. Gives you in depth knowledge about the footballing world tactics, about player growth, management of club at an overall level. Very close to real life club management.
2. Live tactical changes and side line shouts to make your team going and keeping them up and running all the time.
3. Real time transfers with a social section where the system has created bots which give opinion on a specific transfer and all about their fan clubs. The rumour mill ( xD ).

Lets get to the cons -
1. The extensive features of the game make it quite difficult for new players to where to start from! Referring to you tube videos to - ""How to get started with FM21"" is the right thing.
2. As a FIFA player, the transfer concepts to me were quite simplistic. But this game has totally made me mad! The transfer of a player is such a tedious procedure. Specially big name transfers!, the club does not leave them. Better refer to videos where you can sign good potential players.
3. The worst! Club names, player faces and the UI, you might get sick of it and after some time you will be pissed off! The ManU logo of my club had me going all through videos and setting up all the stuff for myself

BUT AS A WHOLE - "" THIS IS NOT A GAME! THIS SHIT IS REAL. I HAVE PURCHASED IT BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS, IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO STICK TO ONE DEDICATED FOOTBALL GAME AND HAVE A LIKING FOR TRANSFERS AND STUFF! HERE YOU ARE! THE SOCIAL FEED HYPE GETS YOU GOING!""

1. You can't beat Liverpool or Man City no matter what system you try unless you are managing an equally big club full of superstar players. Believe me I've tried. They both appear to spend massive amounts on players every summer without selling hardly anyone. Liverpool now have Haarland, Jota, Firmino and Salah up front. Totally overpowered.
2. Too many goalmouth scrambles and GK's who can't hold onto a shot but deflect it to another opposition player to tap in.
3. Too much derping around when a cross is clearly on. Pull backs don't exist. But trying a shot while standing on the byline does.
4. Every VAR offside decision is correct but you still have to watch while the AI goes through the motions.
5. There seems to be more attacks in the four or five minutes of injury time than there are in the rest of the match put together. Hence a lot of goals are scored late.
6. Refs dishing out yellow cards from the first minute. The AI recommends hard tackling and after three or four of your players have been booked it says ease off tackling. FFS.
The fact is after three or four seasons you end up with a bloated squad of grumbling players all  and the youngsters are useless so you just start again.

They were handed loss after loss, and could only barely eke out draws occasionally. It wasn't long before, mid season, they were bottom of the table. Meanwhile their promotion partners, Notts Co, who had also come up from the lower leagues with them, was showing their true talent as a top of the league team. By mid season they were placed #1, Phoenix National at the bottom #24

Head coach Cope decided then to radically change his tactics. He abandoned the defensive, passive style of football he'd taught for the last season and a half and switched to an incredibly aggressive possession style of football that truly controlled the pace of the game. Phoenix national got their first win. And then another. An unbeaten string of games from mid-season all the way up into a surprise playoff contention spot just barely squeezing in at #7 after an incredible run that included a 4-0 rout of a team that had previously crushed them

Notts Co had always been a difficult match for Phoenix National, but Phoenix beat them in a surprising 2-1 game, shocking the attendees. And then. Playoffs came. The very first match saw #3 seed Notts Co vs Phoenix National #7. In a tight first game, Phoenix just barely got the better of their rivals in a 2-1 game, and drew the second winning by aggregate. Then Phoenix went on to rout the playoff finalists Southhampton in a 3-0 crushing victory, securing themselves a second promotion in a row. Phoenix National had truly risen from the ashes.

As a game, there are the occasional bugs and problems, I've seen a couple clipping errors. But as a story-making device, as a simulation, it's phenomenal. Creating your own club, taking a bottom-of-the-league team and turning them into a success story, watching your striker go from goal drought to rainforest, cheering when your players win after a hard-fought penalty kickoff.

No matter what you do after a good run there will be one match a season, veterans will know the match I am talking about, where all of your players become limp fish on the pitch and lose form at exactly the same time. And before the hardcore fans come out and say ""oh it's complacency"" no, it's not there is not a single player with a complacent body language and everything has been done to reduce potential complacency. Messi's dribbling turns into Peter Crouch, Kompany's defending becomes like Ozil, and world class players just watch the ball go past them, hit the woodwork all of the time, miss every 1o1, cross the ball into defenders more often, pass the ball long straight back to the other team even though you have defensive short passing on, injuries to the best players etc etc. It's pretty much the same as the FIFA scripted mechanic. 

Then after this one match, the next 10 or so will become extremely difficult, and no change in tactic, roles, swapping in players, match talks, press talks... nothing will change this mechanic. The form is hard coded in the game and there's nothing you can do about it. Some people will say this is like real life; teams go through bad forms, and that is true, but the question is do we want to play a game which forces a bad form onto you which is completely out of your control, or would you prefer to have some influence over the bad form? This bad form will hit once a season on average, no matter what you do, consistent rotation or no rotation, changing tactics to adapt to the AI, or keeping them consistent it doesn't matter. Alot of people also respond to this criticism by saying, ""the AI adapts to your tactics after a while if you are winning"", and the AI does change their tactics, but them changing their tactics has nothing to do with why your team suddenly can't pass forwards without an interception, or they stand and watch the ball go past, or dribble straight into the opposition players, or hit the woodwork or get injured at 300% rate than normal, or suddenly can't make a first touch anymore, or their crosses hit the opposition and create a corner and you know all 1o1's will end badly during this form. Most of this has nothing to do with the opposition tactics, just because they went counter attack, shouldn't mean my players all lose 10 to their dribbling, passing, first touch, positioning stat for 10 games. 

The next response to this I see often is ""what incentive would SI have to put such a mechanic in the game?""
Because commercial incentives developers have in keeping their customers coming back every year. SI can't make the same game every year with an updated roster and a couple differences in the UI and match engine without generating an addiction in their customers. This bad/good form streak creates an actual dopamine psychological addiction, similar to loot boxes in other games or player cards in FIFA. The reward in this game is good form, and a feeling that you have overcome something which was prior out of your control. When you regain the good form streak, where now all your players dribble like Messi, and shoot like Lewandoswki, you feel like you are responsible. 

The human condition of contrast effect (is the enhancement or diminishment, relative to normal, of perception, cognition or related performance as a result of successive (immediately previous) or simultaneous exposure to a stimulus of lesser or greater value in the same dimension) creates a much larger sense of achievement when we get into a good form relative to the out of control bad form. Doubly it has an additional contrast effect as we feel like the game is out of our control during the bad form (external locus of control), and in control (internal locus of control) during the good form creating a massively exaggerated sense of being in control during the good form and we experience a dopamine feedback loop for the good form as we, without cognitive awareness, compare it to the experience and external locus of control of the bad form. 

SI used to have an addiction rating in the game based on the number of hours you played, they are well aware of how dopamine responds to this contrast effect of psychological states of external and internal locus of control. I worked in insurance gamification, so even more morally bankrupt than EA with FIFA, and they are very aware of mechanics for creating addictions in the customers. It's a business, it would be poor business management and product development if they didn't find a way to get customers coming back every year. SI would without a doubt have KPI's and OKR's and targets for customer retention every year, so the department responsible for hitting these targets would be probably the ones responsible for keeping these frustrating game mechanics in the game. Add to this that this bad form also creates an artificial difficulty spike which keeps the game engaging for veterans, who would stop buying the game if they found it too easy every iteration. 

This mechanic is actually not as bad as in FM2020, but it is still there and I doubt they will be removing it any time soon. I probably wouldn't have played this one for so long without the sense of achievement I had in being better at this one than FM20 which had even more bad form/good form mechanics. But my skeptical mind tells me they make each iteration in a rotation of difficulty to keep that addiction fed. FM22 will probably be more difficult again, and FM23 will be easier, so they generate a long term meta contrast effect, and we feel more in control in this version relative to the last so we enjoy it again, then it's too easy so they make the next game more difficult and frustrating again. Cycle repeats. It's actually good game design if you don't notice it, but once you notice it, you can't really go back in good faith realizing you are just actually psychologically addicted to the cleverly crafted dopamine cycles. 

And if you think it's not possible to be psychologically addicted to a game, gamblers on the slot machines have been shown to have actual similar dopamine responses to winning as people have to hard drugs. Think about that before you buy a game that intentionally gets you addicted. SI are no better than gambling companies, they just use a different psychological effect to get you addicted, just instead of money as the reward they give you a sense of inflated control relative to the bad streak.. which come to think of it is the same as a slot machine. To your brain there is no difference between winning money and winning a sense of control, they represent the same thing. 

The problem is if they made this mechanic transparent, it wouldn't have the same addictive effect, the same way knowing that a slot machine will ALWAYS hard coded give you a return of 96% on your $1, most people who realized this don't gamble. This game does the same with their hard coding of streaks, and once it's become transparent it doesn't have appeal anymore. So they need to keep it intransparent to keep the game engaging, and we will forever be frustrated at that bad streak until we liberate ourselves with the knowledge that this bad streak is intentionally there to keep you interested, and spending more money.",1617102096,1617102096,False,116,12,0.803378105163574219,21,True,False,False

Really great game, would absolutely recommend.

The most underrated and rarely mentioned part of this game is the match day engine that actually allows you to influence and watch your players in real time as they face the other teams on game day. It's full 3d and looks pretty good. I've now played some other management sims e.g. Out of the Park Baseball and they don't even come close to actually making the matches/games look good compared to FM21. The FM21 match engine is one of my favorite features and is very rewarding after you've spent hours before each match tweaking your lineups and tactics to see your players in real time do their best to bring your side the win. I find myself watching full matches now sitting on the edge of my chair and shouting at my players both in real life and in the game when they make mistakes or celebrating when they find the back of the goal.

Many compliments to those who have the skills and dedication to put such a intricate product together and make it available to football enthusiasts the world over. Muchas gracias to all who do this. Please know that this product is quite the handy educator. Yes, in addition to being  an enjoyable freetime pastime, this game helps educate us all on the world through seeing league structures in different countries and even learning some geography. After all, it is interesting to look up where some of these smaller clubs play in such countries as Spain, in Ireland, in places in Scandinavia, Greece, Eastern Europe and throughout all of South America and Asia.  That is one suggestion I would like to make.  A map included which shows the cities of the participating clubs within a given country.  For example, in the Netherlands, a map showing the clubs of the Eredivisie and then another for the second league.  Or perhaps just one map.  Red dots indicate the top flight clubs, blue dots the clubs of the second division.  Perhaps the next tier down in green dots too? Yes?  Yes, something like this.  This really can be quite the educational tool.  Plus, in Spain it lets me know how far I'll actually be travelling with the team when leaving the Basque Country to play away in Murcia, Almeria or Cartagena  down south on the Med coastline.  Las Palmas too ;)  In a country like Italia, it helps with the appreciation of lower league clubs having the expense of travel requirements.  It also helps better appreciate why local rivalries have emerged over time in countries or regions we football enthusiasts do not know so well. My only quibble with your game in this 2021 version is the lack of a light skin and middle, neutral skin.  The darkness of the overly dark purple  only in-game skin is very poor. It's frankly cheap.  Surely you know that it is difficult on the eyes.  The only thing that has saved this year's game is those who make the effort to create Workshop Community skins and share them with the rest of us.  You can have the greatest sports management game on the planet right now, but it is only a fraction of its real worth without a variety of skins to help the gameplayers find what suits them best.  All of your hard work is meaningless unless your products is very welcoming, very pleasantly visible. Please take this into account and make real accommodations to honour those who spend their money and time on your product. Thank you.  (Hint:  It is never too late; please go ahead and add an official FM21  Light Skin for this 2021 game. You'd be instant heroes worldwide for doing so - I mean it. You'll also increase the number of people purchasing this product. Cheers!)  Yes,  FM 2021 is an overall very intriguing product that offers the sports interested a completely different view into the world of global football.  Thank you for doing it and offering this manager game as a means to enjoy The Beautiful Game.",1616604553,1616604553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Football Manager 2021 is the first FM game I've played, and honestly.... one of the first sports manager games I've played. I've always had an interest in them, even though I don't follow sports, but FM21 is my first jump in. 

So As a complete novice in every respect I jumped into FM21 with the head cannon of ""I'm a stratagist in a massive army fighting against many other armies."" This honestly did help me a lot to get to grips. I'm not learning a new sport, I'm learning something I'm familiar with.

And teach is something that FM21 does... decently. This game is a text heavy. There is no voice overs, no videos, it's just text explaining all the text. It's honestly a lot to take in especially if you don't know what team formations are. What is a 2-4-4-2 tiki? I don't know. And there's hundreds of different formations. The game doesn't tell you what this is. But it does have a thumbs up to tell you ""Hey, you're team is pretty well equiped for this formation. Use it.""

And that is one extremely nice thing about the management side of things. You can deligate off basically everything to the AI if you don't want to deal with it. Training, scouting, contract nagotiations, almost all of it can be given to the AI at any time and you can take it on any time. This creates a nice enviorment that you can focus on 2 things at once, and than introduce whatever next and it doesn't seem to really affect the team, at least not in any ways that new comers will notice.

That being said there is a lack of explanation with some things. For instance, during the simulated matches, you watch from the side lines and can give out callouts. Things like praise, scold, ect. Now you would think praising the team after a goal would be a good thing. A nice ""Awesome job guys! Keep it up!"" but NO! Praising after a goal for some reasons lowers moral during the game. I've had them at great and drop to discouraged. I guess it's something to do with praise actually being something else and you need to wait to praise until the last quarter. There's no real in game explination, just people relaying what they've figured out.

In terms of how welcoming this game is to new players I'd say it's pretty decent. The hardest things will be all the info related to the sport. Knowing what teams are good, what players are good, what formations are good, what skills to look for for whatever spot you're trying to fill. But it really does have that addicting managment simulator gameplay, so even if you don't like sports that much there's still a ton of depth to be found.

However the absolute lack of sounds is a hit against the game. A lack of voice acting is sad, but no music, no sound effects when changing tabs or emails or anything is just... off putting. I cranked my volume thinking something was wrong, only for a match day to start with suddenly cheers and noises to blast through my headphones. It makes the game a really silent and boring time.

Overall though I do recommend this game if you're a managment simulator fiend like me. Be it that you know every football player on the pitch today or you only know the ball goes in the net. There's a ton of depth and a very big and active community to help you along the way. It is a bit quite and doesn't fully explain everything to you, but it does a good job of getting it's teeth into you and holding you there.",1615154863,1615154863,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is extremely biased towards players and teams who are thought to not be part of a team with history.

There is no point playing if you want to build up a team unless you play for like ten seasons. 

To resolve this, I would recommend this game team panel get enough and proper and thorough research before putting up a game that is supposed to make long term football fans stay.

If you want your team to perform to the max, make sure you add each one of the match preparation once a week at least to the training and the team bonding one as well under extras. Every single week. Except maybe match practice one, your assistant will include that one when appropriate anyway. 

You can leave it to the assistant for creating the rest and just add/tinker these in using the ""change once"" confirmation. Do not take out match preview or recovery ones though. 

Do not be afraid to just add these instead of a rest as these are not demanding schedules. (I happily train all 3 sections daily except the day before a match and most of the time after)

This will mesh your team together, make them perfect your tactic and team bonding one will create partnerships (the green lines) so quickly you won't believe it.

Most of the changes that are required for an optimal game play have simply been ignored by the devs.

1. Fixture congestion is a real problem, you will often have f.ex. 11 days with no fixtures or internationals only to have to play 3 games in 6 days, in a WC season I had 6 games in 12 days. It has been problem for a long time.

2. First team players who aren´t constantly starting will be restricted to light training schedules if you have a very busy season with games every 2nd or third day. It means they aren´t really evolving, sending them to the U23 squad to get normal training makes them unhappy and the ""elevator"" micro management of each player isn´t desirable either. A simple solution for U23 players would be to have the ""Available for first team"" option but so far I havn´t been lucky in getting any responses.

3. Regardless of tactics you will still encounter ""super keepers"" who just are your only opponent, their entire team getting 6.2 avg rating while the keeper is getting 8.5, I still win, sometimes by a large margin but their keeper is often MoM still. I have lost 4 finals in a row, conceded 4 goals in 4 shots while their keeper made MoM in all games.

4. Penalties are weird, in one of the 4 above mentioned finals I missed 5 penalties, Wolves missed 4 and scored on the last thus winning. At least the AI is having difficulties with penalties as well, in the league I have about a 50% penalty conversion rate and so does the AI, this has gradually worsened as seasons have passed so it could be a regen issue.

5. Speed/Pace still has too much of an influence.

6. While you can be successful without constant high pressing it´s difficult, it´s doable but tactics rely too much on total pressing. This especially proves true if you have high acc/speed players.

7. The AI harassing you about wanting your players is okay, in FM however this gets taken to entirely new level and you can hear about it every single week throughout an entire season how much X club wants half of your team. When it comes to the bidding however .... they try to buy your players for peanuts. Aston Villa would probably receiving 3-5 bids every week of about 20 million euros in FM in 2037 on a relative comparison, he is worth about 50 million I believe.

8. You get asked the same questions from the press every single week, one would think they would have had the time to develop interviews to be diverse, it´s like a loop that never ends.

9. The training schedules from the ass. manager are horrendous, they may work if you can´t be bothered to change them but results on the pitch definitely improve vastly with a lot of tweaking. This becomes especially true when you are involved in all competitions and the schedule has heavy duty training the day before a match.",1613859554,1613859773,True,0,0,0.484110742807388306,0,True,False,False

Finally on December 2020 I decided to buy this game after 14 wonderful years with FIFA and it has been the greatest decision I have made with gaming. 

The amount of freedom you can get with tactics and training is just fascinating. Player/team interactions and team-meetings. I love every aspect in the game currently. The thrill of improving your youth intake and signing for ex. a 16-yo Norwegian Mezzala from Molde to your team. To press conferences ( [i] your sayings can actually matter, not like in FIFA where there is just automaticly generated answers to Q's No consequenses after what you have just said. Just answers and vibes [/i] ).

Eventhough it has been a great improvement on playing football career mode as manager, there could be lots of things to implement into the game. My listings:

- More tactical freedom per player (when leading a crucial game by 1-0 and few minutes remaining as underdog, you could inform your wingers to go near corner flags and hold the ball up there. Tho you have a TEAM instruction to frequently waste time)

- How many touches preferred before pass in which area of the field
- More tactical freedom in formation

FIFA has the gameplay, more licenses BUT FM21 has all the other aspects of non-arcade football that is the closest football game regarding realism. Only reason I would buy FIFA again is that if they decide to release CM game as their own game and made a full team to handle that.

So for a very short version, this review is negative, but not as a complete let-down - to me this is a 5/10 game. The philosophy is steering back into the right direction, it can be fun once again and there are certain improvements. But there's so many small things wrong, considering we pay full price for basically a database update and some minor UI improvements every year, there is no excuse.  Also additions to the game are starting to feel like bloat, rather than extras.

Anyway, for the long part - I'm a huge football manager/championship manager fan, I'm one of those old fans who made the game what it is, sinking thousands of hours into it and recommending it left and right. From Bojinov to Yaya Sanogo, I've been along for the ride. At some point the games lost their ""fun"" for me in exchange for realism and I stopped buying them. 

Starting with the positive, I should say this is the first FM I've actually had fun with since 14. I don't regret 15 and 16 but they were more of a challenge I got through than a game I had fun with. I also tried 20 and hated it. The match engine to me is a huge improvement over 20 and even a huge improvement over old ones where you had to play around certain huge weaknesses, such as very poor striker movement. In this one it feels like you have a choice. Long passes are back and are no longer just a tool for direct, counter-attacking football. Fullbacks actually contribute to the match and aren't a burden. Your tactics, players and decisions are more in control than the code of the game. 

The graphics improvements are also nice. These two things alone show a shift in what should have been the philosophy from the start, focus on graphics and keep the fun. 

HOWEVER, the game is riddled with small bullshit that just kills all the enjoyment when you encounter it. The biggest one for me is that it can get way too easy - set a strategy, get the right players for it, have a bit of depth and watch the game play itself. There's no challenge in getting the right players - if in previous FMs it was ridiculously hard to buy or sell specific players (such as in smaller leagues) in this one its hilariously easy. You can easily form a team to challenge the champion's league with the budget of a second tier italian side (albeit not with that reputation, since players seem almost 100% motivated by reputation on whether they move). Playing in a lower league? Get a 100k $ transfer budget or free up some wage budget and you will easily buy out the entire league. I like the ""ask agent for availability"" thing, I really do, but since transfers seem so much easier, it just adds even more ease. Spam it on players and you can essentially have an overview of the exact price of every player on the market. 

The second most annoying thing for me has to be the end of every match. Now I felt I was getting scored on/scoring way too much towards the end and I looked at the stats - in a single season I had 60 goals total scored and scored against me. Out of those 60 a staggering 22 were in the last 10 minutes. More than a third!!! An even more staggering 8 of those were AFTER 90 minutes! Nearly 10%. My players were determined, ok with stamina, nothing special and I made no big changes to tactics at the end. I monitored the AI and it rarely did anything either. The second season I played the case was roughly the same. 

Injuries - I feel like the frequency of injuries is ok and players recover realistically. But for some reason small injuries, i.e. a 2-3 day tight groin, a cold or a virus are ridiculously common. This is quite annoying. 

It also feeds into my next point, which is the vast amount of bloat and micromanagement. I've never liked press conferences, but I give them a try every time since I feel its unrealistic to just ignore the press. But these gestures just add more bloat to what felt already like bloat. Same with player interactions - I try, I really do, but by the 6th time your entire team is unhappy you won't sell your only good striker for pennies with no possible replacement and you just have to go through the entire conversation over and over with no real choice, just pressing the same buttons, adding gestures is again, bloat on top of bloat. The UI has been discussed enough, but its the same case for me. I feel these things take away from the core game and create a lot more opportunity for small problems that break the enjoyment.

Some more, minor issues - wingbacks are hilariously overpowered in the right setting, easily scoring a hattrick with long shots outside the box. For that matter, crazy long shots are still here and still way too common, getting a ""oooh! magnificent goal!!"" from an unlikely player twice a game really ruins the fun of scoring them. Trust me, get a wingback with okish technique and set him to stay wide and shoot - watch as he gets unmarked, never pressured and smashes ridiculous shots over and over. Lastly, when a team finds space it will do so over and over again and trying to close that space by adjusting tactics will rarely work. On the other hand, if you find a weakness in the AI it will basically never cover it - hence if you score 2 in the first half you'll probably score 5-6 by the end. This especially ruins one of the most fun parts of FM, developing youngsters, as a youngster underperforming can easily make you concede a ton of goals on its own. 

Now I could overlook all of this, I really could, but we're getting sold essentially the same game every year. And millions are supporting it. How many developers can boast a 100% guaranteed revenue stream? So with that in mind, to have these small mistakes and oversights is just not acceptable. So many of the reviews to me seem like ""well it's football manager and its functional, so five stars"", which misses the point. I think reviews should serve to point the game in the right direction and to me that's thorough testing rather than changing the already great UI or adding more options for interactions.",1612836835,1612836835,False,115,7,0.783721923828125,0,True,False,False

My favorite part has to be the depth of FM. It's crazy that you can enter and view key highlights from games that don't even involve your own team. The database for the game is massive, including ratings and profiles for players on teams that aren't even playable. It's a great game and I cannot recommend it enough.

The game contains all the bugs from the previous versions and brings new ones. Months after release FM feels broken. On top of that they decided to make all interaction UIs clunkier. I thought it's just me and I need to get used to that, but no, 260 hours in nothing feels any more comfortable. Every interaction requires more steps, everything important is now spread thinly around the screen, so that your eyes and hands have to travel more. This is the worst UI they have had in years, and it doesn't even have a stock dark skin: enjoy some random white backgrounds popping out of nowhere and burning your eyes in low ambient lighting.

These hates have spanned about 65 years.  I tried team sports in school while growing up, I hated them all.  The funniest fact of all is that soccer was my most hated team game next to basketball.  Soccer was THE most hated team sport, the top of my hate list.  Man has hands and soccer won't let him use them.  Stupid.

However...

My most favored genre of games are management, builder, and simulation.  In 2020 I saw Football Manager 2020 and instantly hated it.  The only good looking part of what I saw on Steam was the color purple.  I like purple.  Then I saw the word Demo.  I also like the word Demo, reminds me of the word Free.  Soooooo, I tried the Purple Demo.

Then...

I was amazed at the massive amount of management options, supported with tooltips and help.  The more options I tried, the deeper I fell into management bliss.  One option led to another option, and a spiderweb of fun began to form.  I was liking the sport of soccer, team sport and all!  Pretty soon I owned FM2020, then FM2021, a purple mass of team sport management greatness.  The many varied ways these games inter connect within themselves is beyond amazing.  I've been impressed with a few choice games of this genre, but never even close to the amazement of this FM series by Sports Interactive.

UI is awful, especially match day UI. For some reason they also decided to ditch Dark Skin because why not? Game-breaking bugs have marred this edition for months (e.g. youth intake bugs), while other long-running issues have been there for decades (seriously why having MLS and A-League available if they're virtually unplayable?)

Match engine was at least promising during beta, certainly an improvement from past 5 years pinball/crosses party. Of course despite positive feedback form users ME has gradually gone back to FM 20 random pinball because why not? 'Minor changes' of course.

The best parts of the game are the mods/updates provided by the community (skins, leagues, data,  hopefully korean match engine like last year), at least for now (remember how SI decided to make hair packs impossible to add? Btw regen hairstyles are still awful). This company does not deserve my money, of course fool me once shame on you fool me 10 times shame on me!

Listen, not everybody will start at the screen for the whole match. Many players are not hardcore players that will watch the whole game and write down the stats by themselves.

So why you remove the whole timeline and the in game stats?
I would like to replay the goal that I missed because I was browsing some websites. 
In this version, no way. You have to wait until either half time or end of game to replay only goals. Yes you can't even replay some great opportunities you missed!

Also for example, if I found the midfield of the other team is doing really well, I'd like to send one of my defenders to stick with him. I need the in-game stats to show me whether my strategy is working. But I can't now! I can't check if the other team's midfield has less passes or shots. No way! You have to wait until the whole game. 

This is extremely annoying that almost destroy the whole fun of ""trying a strategy and get the feedback"". Your UI designer or PM just doesn't understand the game at all.

2. Whatever formation, mentality, players instructions and strategies doesn't reflect clearly during highlights and keeps you on your toes what is happening when you played attacking while having 0 shots for almost 30 minutes. 
3. Randomly, your players could be playing like Barca and other times possessed by school boys while playing against weaker team. 
4. Whether teams seem motivated or fired up doesn't reflect on match statistics and you will expect there are more prompters/asst manager or coach to do the ""observation"" for you and give advises or actual situation to react accordingly. 
5. There is also no longer advise to play shorter/direct passes during wet weather or weather events which I thought were vital information. 
6. Not sure why do info such as players lacking tactical familiarity only appears right after team selections and not easily reflected during training.
7. Wingers could run across the entire pitch just to pass to side netting - almost all the time.
8. When your players have negative confidence on the pitch, they will tend to pass to opposition so they can quickly go home and eat popcorn.
9. Playing cautiously against strong teams will make players so nervous, they tend to kick to opposition players all the time even when they are not being pressed and have another 6 teammates within passing distance. 
10. Gegenpress with High intensity and pressing game with hard tackling shows players running or strolling with opposition player with the ball refusing to tackle - all the way from opposition half to 6 yard box, almost all the time. 
11. On one instance, all players stood still while the ball rolled into the net with the keeper 30cm away and the nearest players were near penalty spot. 

I don't see how tactics and strategies really matter when the game engine is so buggy. I don't find it realistic to see players passing to oppositions all the time when morale or confidence is negative or even when leading and complacent.

It has been 9 years since FM2012. IMO This game does not reflect 9 years worth of improvements made since then. It is deplorable that this game made tweaks yearly, buggy and still sells at full price. SI has made the game engine and visualization an outright insult to football and for those professional teams that seem to play like school kids. It is worrying that this is still considered the better FM simulator around.",1607512725,1610524472,False,4,0,0.484116345643997192,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the last two releases, more specifically 20, this game is a welcome edition. From FM20, to FM21, there are a lot of notable changes that make the experience feel incredibly fresh and brand new. The new interface and mechanics make this the best FM game that I've played to date! The inclusion of being able to shout individual orders at individual players makes the ""shout"" system actually feel useful; (so far) press conferences actually feel like they matter, rather than the filler they have been for ages. 

The updated match engine offers a more slick and smooth feel to the game as it unfolds. Players move a lot more realistic compared to previous titles, which makes goals feel a lot more rewarding for one reason or another. 

The more I play, the more I'll be able to talk about. But after day 1 of the beta? So far; so good!

The tactical mechanics are fun to use and work well, but it could be taken to a deeper level. One way of achieving this would be to allow players to adjust formations automatically based on the phase of play, just as teams do in real life. 

For example switching from a 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3 when in possession of the ball, where your CB's split and your DM drops between them, while both FB's move higher up the pitch into a Wing Back position.

I believe console games offer something similar to what I am describing.

FM continues to improve and I am glad to see improvements to the match engine, but I must admit that I do dream of a match engine built by one of the big boys...

Transfers feel realistic, clubs negotiate astutely at times and it's not often I get frustrated when clubs are being unreasonable... but perhaps that's in fact, less realistic?

Overall it's a solid effort with real improvements, some of the highlights being the UI and match engine upgrades. I will however continue to pray the day comes we get to see what a top shelf game engine looks like in a Football Manager game.",1610392186,1610392186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, after 1 season with Wigan (I was promoted to the Championship, 20 was expected) and 3 seasons with Valencia CF, I have won the Champions League, the League and the National Cup. My forward Maxi Gómez has been the top scorer of the three seasons (a team that in real life struggles to be in the center of the table).

I feel that this game does not convey emotions to me. It is a game without a soul. These are the reasons:

-AI does not pose any challenge to the user. The decisions they make are absurd as I expect great teams to constantly sign players, make efficient tactical changes to fight my team, and hire a coaching staff that lives up to their reputation.

-This leads me to talk about the DIFFICULTY of the game. Year after year I notice how the difficulty decreases. This is bad news for veteran FM players. Simply knowing how to place the players with high morale and in a more or less acceptable position for the player, the job is done. I don't know if this is an SI strategy for attracting customers, what I do know is that it will make long-time loyal customers get tired of spending money every year. My experience sharing FM with people who come from other management games / soccer games is that they consider that the game has too many clicks (well, that's another story, for example I really appreciate the immersion that I am not feeling this year). Simply, that type of user just wants to press a button and have his team score goals. Wrong SI strategy in my opinion.

Another note on difficulty: the game is based on streaks / matches won without losing streaks / matches without winning streaks, the latter being very rare.

-This leads me to talk about the ATTRIBUTES having almost no effect. I have come to use clearly offensive midfielders as a recovering midfielder and they have had disconcertingly positive stats. Something that already happened in previous FM. Experiments are known in which people have used goalkeepers from the U23 team as forwards and have had positive results, scoring goals as real killers.

- Game day experience is terrible. Much information is missing. I can't move my players from the match screen, for example. I have to go through the tactics window for everything. The timeline has disappeared, something I used frequently. I am supposed to have my second coach by my side but I cannot consult him when I want (?). The tips disappear when a play is played and I can't go back to them.

Other aspects with which I am not going to elaborate much:

-Use a 4231 gegenpress, you will win everything and without physical consequences on your players. Take a starting eleven and repeat it, without doing rotations and you will win them all.
-The interface: a lot has already been said about how poorly implemented it is and how little intuitive it is.
-Press conferences: what a useless novelty. It is still repetitive and also now takes me longer, its consequences being very little visible in the game.
-You can't trust your employees at all because their actions are just stupid. (an AI problem that has dragged the game down year after year)

The only positive that would come out of this FM is the improvement of the ME. And although some details have to be polished to give it more realism, I must say that it has been a great improvement compared to last year (something that was not very difficult).

Finally, another thing that makes me very furious is paying for a game that won't really be ready until February or March. Although, sadly, this happens frequently in many new games. This, as consumers, is something we would have to react and act on.

Last year I was one of the clients who said this year's news wouldn't fool me and I still fell in love. That will not happen again.

Match engine - great, in comparison with FM 20, massive improvement. Though it would have been damn hard to actually make it WORSE than FM 20, which was rock bottom
Interface in-between the games - Meh, but tolerable, horrible layout, too many extra steps, but tolerable
In-game interface - total garbage, at this point I believe, that SI have no UX/UI specialist in their team, or that person is hilariously incompetent.

UPD after 20 more hours I can give a new update. ME shows some strange things like assists from own half almost every game, but it's tolerable. What's not is that schedules in season 21/22 don't return to normal and play out as if it's still COVID year. So in short, don't buy it now, wait till first major fix

UPD 2. I've decided to change to thumbs down unless it's ironed out. UI has grown on me and turned into awful and eye-hurting endeavour. It was unlikely that they would make press conferences worse, but the task was handled effectively. Before you could just click through all answers automatically and get over it, but now player has to look into opposite parts of screen to read small fonted questions and then find an answer even though NOTHING changed and answers are still the same. Like ""yeah we know you all hated interactions, so now we'll FORCE you to deal with them""
ME also behaves in a strange ways, no setpiece goals, AI plays passively and almost submitsn to you, turning supposedly tactical sim into power trip, players as usual disregard instructions.

Long story short, I'm losing all hope. I'll keep with this game till update, but if it stays the same - I'm out and won't be buying another FM. Goodbye long and beautiful addiction. SI needs a competition

UPD 3 (and last one)
Winter patch returned ME to sorry state of ME 20. No more square balls, no ""dribble less"", chance conversions are back to where they were (i.e. strikers can't hit a barn door again).

After purchasing every version of Football Manager, and its Championship Manager predecessor, FM 21 is the poorest iteration in the series. 

Somewhat controversially, the game is only a meagre update of FM 20 with some additional stats like xG sprinkled on top. While the game’s marketing materials suggest that the new innovations stretch to more complex interactions with the club’s board and squad, those are, at best, trivial and simply add more bloat to the standard user experience. 

With regards to the match engine, there have been the customary patches from the developer to correct a myriad of technical issues. All of which have been detrimental to the immersion of watching two teams play competitive football. However, this year’s offering stands out as recent patches to the game have caused further, more serious issues with the analysis of player performance. At present, there’s an issue where individual player ratings have been greatly reduced across the board. For experienced players of the series, it’s unusual to see players win end-of-season awards with average ratings between 7.1-7.25. 

Callum Wilson scored 35 goals in 35 games in my last season, an incredible haul, and barely scraped an average of 7.1. Full backs, wingers and central midfielders all suffer as the game doesn’t currently track key tackles, an important performance metric for players who aren’t scoring or creating. 

The animations reflected within the match engine have been increased in volume, but the player behaviour has become farcical. Defenders standing still when they can easily reach a ball first is a frequent occurrence and renders so much of the players tactical activity meaningless. The developer’s forum keeps a track of the list of issues which have been fixed and those that are still being worked upon. 

Another disappointing trend has been the number of clicks a user must make to access information which used to be easy to retrieve 5-6 years ago. The implementation of the ‘social’ tab where a large amount of the game’s news is hidden beneath has only grown in size with every new version. 

In the developer’s quest to be seen to bring innovation to the annual release, so much of that innovation is presented as affecting the most laborious aspects of the game. Press conferences. Player interactions. Board interactions. 

All of this leads to the user making more clicks in order to advance to the core managerial gameplay. Meanwhile, not enough innovation has been brought to the manner in which the match engine produces content. 

There’s also a disappointing lack of options for users to rearrange parts of the user interface to best suit their needs. The new match-day experience presents a vast amount of data through an extremely limited number of panels. Few of which are customisable. This creates a bottleneck of data visualisation which is so needless and easy to fix. 

This year, IGN came down hard of FIFA 21 for the Nintendo Switch for charging full price for what was essentially a threadbare update of FIFA 20 on that platform. Other review outlets did the same. Whilst there’s clearly been the challenge of developing during the pandemic, the game is a weak update of FM 20 with more than enough immersion-breaking bugs that the game simply cannot be recommended.

Firstly the match engine has definitely been improved. I see some comments saying it hasn't but if you've played/watched enough FM games you'll know the outcome of almost every highlight during a game but now some things will happen that you didn't expect. For example teams can counter attack 2 or 3 times before someone actually has a chance. Passing and movement seem much slicker too. The interface now shows useful information in-between highlights such as match stats, player ratings, opposition formation and a live league table instead of just staring at an empty pitch.

Outside of the match engine I've noticed players don't moan as much and are easier to appease. Usually every season half of my squad want to move to a bigger club but in 3 seasons so far I've only had 2 players ask, I convinced both to stay.

At the end of the season there's what I can only describe as a presentation of your season highlights. From a veterans point of view it's a really nice touch. It shows all the things I would usually look for at the end of a season in a really nice format, without me having to check each one manually or through an email. Things like player/manager awards, most goals, most assists, signings of the season, best results, reputation/stature change and a lot of other things I can't remember 😂

They have tweaked some of the menus and when you can do certain things which took a while to get used to. Usually I buy the new FM and autopilot but this year I actually had to learn some stuff which is good.

My only gripe is the lack of skins (not a fan of the purple) but there are so many available for free online that it's not a problem.

From being a person that previously played FIFA, i grew out of it and becoming tired of it ha. All because i wanted this experience, but it took me a few versions, until i finally appreciated it.
After playing previous versions of football managers (18, 19 & 20), it's safe to say that my mate got me into it. As i was playing Football Managers on a crappy laptop, that struggled to open word! Also, I bought FM20 touch, but it just wasn't in-depth enough and because it wasn't seamless enough, I stopped playing it.     Now that's dedication, to get someone into FM!
No more waiting and being restricted to 3 or so seasons, at most! (with 1 or 2 countries/leagues at most!). This game just brings you different challenges and experiences that you don't get anywhere else and you're not bothered about any other game. All because it takes all your spare time up ha. 
As I achieved promotion and stability with Sparta (Netherlands), within 3 seasons (FM19) and just did top saves/easy saves (on other FM's), because it was just painful haha.

Now, that i have put in over 164 hours into FM21 (From release), i love this game more than ever! As i learnt from previous versions and i am loving my time at Stirling Albion! 
check out my channel, to see how i'm doing: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0Nyj82-4PQj3nds54IGrA

As well as, now that i have bought an gaming laptop, that can run it just fine(: Let just say i'm on it daily haha. Also, i don't think it would have done any favours, for my college results ha (worsen them ha).

I would urge anyone who is interested in football, to give this game a try!
You could get the Touch versions or mobile versions. But you might as well just stick with FIFA/PES, at that point ha.

I look forward to future versions, sport interactive and miles. Such a great game that gives you everything you would want!  But anything can be improved(:

5- When running just commentary on fast, some goals don't flash. Think your still winning come end of game and then on match summary you see there was an equaliser.

For the third year in a row, an update to MacOS has left the game a clunky, laggy mess that will probably take months to make playable again. FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW! Seriously, does SI just ignore Apple's developer notes?

The game is unplayable for Mac users at the moment.

It bothers me less this year though because the game is already complete and utter garbage. Lags. Horrible GUI. Needless one second cut screens just to talk to a player.

In previous years, I would probably be on year 5 of a save by xmas time. This year, I haven't even completed one season because the gameplay is so rubbish I just get tired of it and turn the game off. You know the game is bad  and ridden with bugs when the community site has essentially banned feedback threads (oh sorry, you need to get a support ticket to contact the developer).

/EDIT

Should be re-named RNG Manager 2021.

If the game decides you're going to win, it doesn't really matter what you do tactics-wise. If it decides you're going to lose, it's the same. The new in-game GUI is poorly laid out, and just like every other year, it seems that SI puts out a great match engine for the beta that turns to rubbish the second the actual game is released.

Can't really blame them as I bought it once again, but I have put less hours into this version than I have into any previous version.

+best match engine of any FM's ever
+content for years to play and experience (huge database of nations and playable players)
+faster loading and especially much faster saving times

-absolute horrible UI design
-terrible workflow with the current UI
-only 1 UI skin at game launch
-wasted resources (gesture system) on a part of the game most players ignore
-actual matchday UI is like being thrown back into a midst 90's adventure game, in a bad way!

Is it worth it? Yes. BUT,

this years saving grace is the improved match engine and the faster loading/saving. Without it, the rest of the game is actually worse than the couple years before (first and foremost and most importantly the UI design).


Edit after 3 more weeks:

FM21 is riddled with fundamental, underlying bugs. It is even moreso than previous years a frekking blender. The match engine is also not what it looked like at first. There are still fundamental issues at work here too. But most importantly, the ""under-the-hood workings of FM21 - like AI player signings, AI player generation, or even simple stuff like moving senior players from main to reserve back to main teams JUST DOES NOT WORK.


Tbh, even the ""imporved"" match engine doesnt rectify them asking full AAA $$$ for this really really subpar product. 

I just cannot recommend the game anymore under these conditions. THUMBS DOWN.",1606833849,1608518143,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can say with certainty the match engine in FM17 was more realistic. In FM21 the animations improved, but the match engine took a step backwards. The defenders seem to be rather afraid of the ball. It is very common for an attacker to dribble for 60 meters and arrive in the box without any pressure from defence.

FM17 had more and better 3D cameras. Also the 2D (not the classic) was by far far far better than this awful one in FM21.

I can't say the UI improved. On the other hand I find it worse than FM17.

In scouting, scout for player card only is not an option anymore. Minimum 1 week scouting. Scouting process may be more realistic now, but finding players got more difficult than FM17.

Dynamics and Training are nice additions since FM17. 

Overall it is a less enjoyable game than 17. I knew that when I played the demo before I bought it. However hardcore FM fans need to own it anyway.

Much like VAR irl, realism and accuracy have been shoehorned in over an enjoyable experience:
1) Love hearts and thumbs up for fitness and condition. Why?! Yes, I know real managers don't have exact numbers but it looked so much better and was so much simpler to have %.

2) My biggest gripe. The match day screen. I have no idea what developers were thinking here. There's been a great UX for years imo and I get the need for renovation but the most important information I need; my players performance, their condition, and body language have now been squashed to the bottom of the screen and replaced with inane stats.

3) Team talks. Did the screen really have to change from a list to a 'room'? It's added nothing to the experience and isn't instantly clear if what I've said is motivating or not.

4) Body language. Just a gimmick. I used it once or twice and now ignore it.

If you're a sporadic buyer of FMs then this is a good choice to come back in to. I'm sure loads of people will enjoy the game and it is still fun. It's just not as good as 20, and nowhere near the classics (07, 11, 12, etc)",1608397443,1608397443,False,52,2,0.778221487998962402,4,True,False,False

The bones of the game haven't changed massively since then even as a lot of bells and whistles have been added. It is still an extremely in-depth football management simulation that still requires a massive time commitment in order to get anywhere. 

My impression is that in comparison to those early 00s versions, the game is trying to provide you with more assistance in figuring out what you actually need to do to have success. That is actually a big plus. In the old games there was a bit of an arcane element which could lead people down the rabbit hole for sure. There's still some of that but there is a more apparent effect of cause and reaction to what you do and how it affects the outcomes. 

There are also mechanisms that clearly were designed to take some off the workload from you. This also seems like a welcome attempt to make the game more accessible, and honestly it's very much needed. All the bells and whistles added since those early 00s games have hugely increased the amount of things on your plate as a manager in FM. If you've ever held a job in which monitoring an email inbox was a big part of your duties, well, much of the game will feel remarkably like that job to you.

I have found that it was relatively easy and still satisfying to go through all that as long as you still feel that drive to lead your beloved club to that promotion, that league title, and eventually that European trophy. Once you've done that though and have gotten your 100 hours in just to accomplish that, well, the tediousness of it all may very well catch up with you. It can easily take a full day of playing this game just to get through an off-season. Even during a pandemic with nothing else going on, and your 'office' being the living room couch, that started to wear on me eventually. 

My feedback is thus still the same it was give or take 15 years ago. This is game that is aimed at hobbyists. And I don't mean people for whom football is the primary hobby, I mean people for whom playing football computer games is the primary hobby. This is a 1000+ hour plus game. The old adage ""Less is more"" is certainly something SI could take to heart to make a wider audience happier i.e. football lovers who still nevertheless enjoy the company of people, want to pursue other activities etc.

In spite of that, I will give it a recommended vote because if you love football and want to play a football computer game, this is certainly the best option out there right now given the relative decline of the FIFA/PES series. And at least for now, I think most of us have just enough time to at least get some joy out of it.",1608309059,1608309059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was fairly critical last year as they hadn't built on anything from the previous year, was fairly clunky and the match engine left a lot to be desired. You didn't want to keep playing.

This years however is so much better, even the little tweaks. The match engine is superb and it actually makes you keep playing even if you are not invested into a save.

The speed the game plays at now is a huge improvement and the UI is still okay but can be improved (way too many extra clicks). Bugs are almost non-existent which considering most of the development was done at home is pretty amazing.

The main dissapointment is once again regen faces & manager avatars. They are really poor and have not improved from 2012, when SI continues to neglect its superb modding community that make lifelike faces. For example, Laura (Chilled Moose) makes faces that SI could only dream off. Why not hire somebody like her to oversee an overhaul of the regen faces?

FM has a great modding community & they should utilise them more. Let people have more control over skinning and let people play around with their own UI's (that SI could use in future additions).

Oh and still no improvements to online play, FM would take off to another market if it brought back FM Live, such a good game that was way ahead of its time but the stubborn Miles poo-poo's it everytime it is brought up.

As always there are the standard licensing issue with club names, logo's and what not but this is easily ""fixed"" with mods and ""how to guids"" on the several fan websites to make the experience even more glorious!
You can download face packs, logo packs (for clubs, leagues and cups) real name fixes and additional leagues, for free or for a small fee, it's up to you really how immersive you want to make the game.

Of course the critical gamer would ask ""why isn't all this content in the game already""? 
Quite simply put; licensing and plain old money! Football clubs and leagues have gone the big money route and for even to use their name / logo / faces etc you downright have to throw cash at them and if SI (devs) were to use that route this game wouldn't be the price it is at now but about 10x as expensive if not more so just do as all the others do and look for websites that help you create the immersion you want from your Football Manager career!
The game has regular updates (after transfer dates usually) to keep it as accurate to the real world.
The game can seem hard to learn and overwhelming at times when you are new but luckily there are a ton of content creators on Twitch and Youtube explaining the game so you can get up to speed in no time.

This game, with it's in depth management, is for the ""hardcore manager"" and not for the casual ""one season a day"" player that wants to quickly manage it's hometown club to glory... you will have to invest time into bringing glory to your club and it won't be easy as a new player but if you have the time and energy to learn this game it will give you great fun, excitement (will the new Messi come through your club's youth system? Will you discover the next Cristiano Ronaldo at some obscure club?).
If you like in-depth management and football then this game is for you!

**Small note** This game can be demanding on your pc (depending on your pc specs and the ""database"" you load; amount of players and leagues you set to be in the database)
So if you are unsure your PC can run this at a decent pace you might want to try out the demo version first

Also the game is really bugged with small and annoying things (also I'm hearing there are some breaking bugs). Maybe after a couple of patches they'll fix some of the bugs at least (I don't have any hopes for the match engine anymore). As of now this is probably the most disappointing release of FM ever and I've been playing this game since FM05.

Edit: the support team actually suggests to some users to start a new save when they can't fix issues from save games from earlier versions of the game. I SERIOUSLY ADVISE AGAINST BUYING THIS GAME.

Edit no.2: In case some people think that I'm just ranting because I lost a match while having 50 shots vs opponents 1 or sth like that, here's a list of currently unsolved game-breaking issues that are reported by the players:
- Broken youth intake - not playable and view-only leagues do not provide new players. Makes the game unplayable after couple of seasons
- Broken fixtures in Premier League - season 2 in PL you get 2 away games with one random team and 2 home games with another random team. Gets worse every season to the point of complete randomness.
- Broken squad registration 2nd season - teams do not register their players at all and play youth only
- Many more, not game breaking but irritating / killing immersion (like press article half-season about Man City securing survival in the league)

Note - these bugs do not appear 100%, however for anyone who wants to buy this game, if you start a new save you're risking running into those issues.",1606853586,1608040210,False,53,6,0.644873976707458496,0,True,False,False

That's now nailed on to your match screen and you can't get rid of it and it's even spammier! Likewise they nailed on a match stats panel, but removed the ability to customize what stats are displayed, so if you want any other stats you have to use one of the remaining panel slots to add ANOTHER match stats panel... what kind of dingleberry came up with this shit?!

But the UI fuckery isn't limited to the match screen. They've turned the player condition into some bullshit smartphone icon nonsense. So now you have no clue if your player is at 100% and able to play the entire match or 90% and about to be gassed by half-time... shocking stuff!

Match engine is much prettier this year, but under the hood it's the same dumpster fire. Low blocks still somehow get beaten by over the top long balls, it's still gegenpress or gtfo, defenders will still opt to mark their man instead of closing down the guy advancing towards goal unopposed, if you want wingers you still need to use wingbacks because actual wingers straight up refuse to play any different than IWs/IFs and all of them continue to shoot from 5 degree angles instead for passing. 


Tactical options are still limited as ever, setting up training is still clunky AF, there's still no individual training focus for some attributes (like tackling wtf), game is still littered with gimmicks that just waste your time without serving a purpose (who needs var when the ai has already made the calculation?! Also, moving the text around doesn't make pressers any less crap)... Oh and transfers get ridiculous real quick... prepare yourselves for Neymar at Gladbach

So far, the game is getting more and more complicated, but with the option with making it easyer if u play the touch version, or with the full version, keep on delegating tasks.

However, I feel this game provides so many hours of entertainment for the cost of the game, that it is in the top class of games for me. World of Warcraft, Ark Survival Online and World of Warships.
This game might be the pinacle of gaming for us footbal fans. I am now 10 hours in to the game, ( full version ) and I still have 2 games left of this season. Found no bugs so far. There probably is, all game has.
But all over, after playing the games I have played over the last 27 years of gaming I have put behind me, Football Manager 2021 gets a 9.5/10. The last 0.5 will be when they find a way to make the multiplayer a lot better.

This version of FM provides yet more analysis ability, though with a squad that appears scripted to do whatever it fancies; managerial input feels nothing more than pressing a few buttons. As before, the 'shouts' either don't work or are counter productive and 'very attacking' exists purely to concede goals, if that's your aim. 

UI is worse in this than FM20, little things like column sizes changes still unfixed. Not entirely sure why SI felt it necessary to put in additional steps when requesting changes from the board...

Feels like the SI have seen the success that EA have with FIFA (namely not changing the game much and charging the same amount each year for what amounts to squad changes) and decided they want a piece of that. Can't really be faulted, since it makes money, but not exactly a rewarding experience for the gamer.

Mainly because SI stated they were going to fix it but still have not, making the game incredibly difficult for me to play for extended periods. 

Some UI decisions have been questionable at best. They didn't even take into account those with poor vision or colourblindness, like myself. 

It's so hard for me to gauge my players fitness. They say ""it was unrealistic to see a players fitness by a percentage"". Well it's also unrealistic to know a players exact ""reaction"" after a shout. When I hear a manager shouting in real life on the side line - I don't see them take out a smiling emoji?!?!?! Nor do they smile, give a thumbs up or act delighted. 99% of footballers are so focused they totally ignore anything and the only reactions you do see are celebrations or anger fuelled by their adrenaline. So lets put this talk of ""realism"" on the back burner and put our eyesight and long term/extended play as a priority. If it aint broke, don't fix it.

Also regarding fitness etc. At least you hear managers say in real life ""he's about 70% fit at the moment"". Knowing a players ""feelings"" by body language is way more unrealistic - same as morale.

Some other UI decisions are weird - like the crooked ""official team sheet"" that represents data on an angle - totally triggering my OCD. Never present data on a weird angle - its ugly. 

Also when you do team talks - theres half the starting line up on the left and then the attackers along the top. Si stated and I quote ""this is a bug we will be looking to fix for the full release"". Still not fixed. Also highly triggers my OCD and it's just difficult to look at. This was perfectly fine on FM2020...just leave this stuff alone, seriously.

The match engine is a huge improvement but I still see a lot of ""ping pong"" rebounds and very odd decisions where players keep trying to all shoot into a wall of players. I almost felt compelled to make a video of it with pinball sounds as a joke. I also noticed that there is some match speed changes this year. Match speed at 50% feels like its in slow motion at times and 1 notch to the right seems too fast.

Match sounds (which have not been updated in over 15 years) have managed to regress again. It suddenly and abruptly cuts off during highlights - giving the game an unpolished feel. I know 99% of FM players play with the sound off but sound is a huge part of football - it's a huge part of the atmosphere. Covid has already taken this away from us in 2020, so please fix the sounds or work on a HUGE expansion to the sound in FM22!!! The only reason 99% of players play with the sound off is because its bad. They don't play with the sound off because they want to. If FM21 had similar sounds to say (FIFA or PES) they wouldn't play with the sounds off. This is the classic chicken or the egg question...you tell me this. How many people play FIFA or PES with the sound off. How many people play ANY game with the sound off?? That's right - not many - if any. Improve your sounds and you will see most people will play with the sound on. 

Selling players is incredibly difficult this year because they tried to add ""covid"" effects for realism. Look - either add Covid in FULLY into the game with empty stands, the actual virus and all of its effects in the game or leave this cruddy disease out of the game and allow us to forget about 2020 and enjoy a fantasy 2021. I think it should have been totally left out - with 0 effects from covid and allow us to enjoy the game normally, with normal finances and the ability to sell players at least for their value. It does make buying players easier, but then again - most clubs I have managed have a 0 budget to begin with...cause of covid! Thanks!! Can't even enjoy a fantasy.

Also match day camera angles. They now added a zoom to the TV view. This actually gives me a little bit of motion sickness and dizziness at times. I don't experience this with a real life game, but in a video game at 60fps it does make me feel a bit queasy. Please give us an option to turn this off or add more camera angles (like a manager first person view). This is the first FM where none of the camera angles are suitable for my enjoyment. Director Cam is actually fine, but I hate all the other weird and distant angles during corners and throw-ins. Again a director camera with a toggable ""other views"" would be good.

The other stuff is pretty good - its a big improvement compared to older FM's but some of these design and UI ideas and implementation doesn't take into account those with colourblindness and/or poor vision - causing eye strain during extended play.

As stated, the match engine has improved but its still a bit silly at times.

SI do the same thing year after year - they put in 110% effort and deliver a product to 90%. That extra 10% is always missing and eithe requires multiple patches until March to get things to maybe 95% or they let things slide for another year - then eventually letting things slide for over a decade (like sounds). They need a decent competitor to shoot a rocket up their butts to actually deliver 110% effort and a 110% product. For a full AAA price year after year - and one of the best sellers on STEAM - the old excuse of ""we are just a small company"" no longer suffices. This is a company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars and hiring some sound developers and giving the game a much larger improvement to atmosphere and graphics shouldn't be as slow as a progression as it has been. Ultimately this game still has graphics of a game from 2006 and sound from a game in the mid 90's. 

Again, this is a game that I love and pump a bunch of hours into - but at the same time - I expect more and I expect a polished product that takes into account people with vision issues, colourblindness, ocd and such.

I will update this to a positive review when they at least fix the UI as they promised. I won't hold my breath for the match sounds to be fixed but I hope that it will be a feature of FM22 ""New and improved match day experience and atmosphere!"".

My guess is that by FM2030, they still won't have updated sounds.",1607312698,1607312698,False,13,6,0.559987485408782959,0,True,False,False

And there is nothing wrong with that (except the full game price we need to pay every year). Sports Interactive continuously evolving the game, making it more detailed. Though their vision about what is needed to be done may differ from yours (so, no multi-monitor support, no female leagues, no from-scratch/sandbox environments), it's hard to deny the effort.
This year they focused on interactions, adding the gestures instead of the old speaking tone. While ""kick the chair"" may look funny, I doubt I'll ever kick it. But for some people who want to roleplay Jurgen Klopp, it may be of some use.
I'm happier about match interface changes, especially about the detailed ""Match Stats"" widget. It's finally possible to see woodwork stats again after all those years! (And yes, it's pretty much high).
I can't say much about how useful the recruiting meetings are, as in the first season I usually play with what I have, but they look nice. The same goes for the season review as I still haven't finished one (but can't wait for it).
One of the most important things: they finally fixed visual tearing plagued FM20 on some systems (ignoring VSync settings).
As for the match engine, nothing changed. I loaded my tactics from a previous FM, and it worked without any difference - more or less same stats, same performance, same (expected) results. That's rather good than not. But there is still no different attack and defense formation settings. Even PES has it for years. You can't recreate asymmetrical formation change in FM at the moment, and it makes Andrea Pirlo sad. Maybe next year? Time to give us more tactical flexibility.
Let's cut it short. If you want a quality football simulator, not sports anime/manga-style (PES) and not arcade-style (FIFA), with a huge up-to-date database without errors even in the top team rosters (cough, cough, KONAMI), look no further.",1607243296,1607243296,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Besides all the bugs, especially the infuriating visual ones that make some menus and screens literally unusable, the main issue is that defenders are just absolutely horrific. And before the ""sdhafhehhfsh it's just your tactics broooo sdhshdfh"" crowd comes along, I actually think it's just as big, if not more of a problem on the opposition teams. It's just not at all satisfying to score a goal after the opposition defender, under absolutely no pressure and with multiple passing options in different directions, just decides to run away from the ball and gift it your striker for no reason at all. It would be one thing if this happened occasionally (mistakes happen, obviously), but EVERY SINGLE GAME there are one or more mistakes that would end up on a end of season, maybe even end of decade highlights reel for terrible defending (almost all individual mistakes).
SI's seem to suffer from a complete inability to simulate real football matches, which leads to them forcing totally unrealistic goals so that SOMETHING actually happens (beside the occasional 30 yard screamer). So disappointing!",1607130579,1607130579,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know it sound crazy that someone spends 50€ every year and every year is getting disappointed, I know I promised I won't trust SI anymore, but I failed. I saw lots of positive feedback talking about a revolutionary ME and I fall for it.
Of course there is nothing true in those reviews apart from the very smart SI move: make the BETA really easy so that people will start winning every match and leave a positive review. ME is the same as the previous year, the game has the same flaws and I see not a single reason to buy the 2021 if you have 2020 (or 2019, or 2018...).
It is pretty clear to me that FM, as a football manager simulator, died many years ago and now SI has focused on producing movies disguised as videogames. FM2021 is a just the usual mess: 1000 useless buttons, millions of fake details, informations and options. You can click buttons, move sliders, imagine to decide something, but in the end all you really do is to watch the movie that SI has prepared for you.
This year I guess they fired their english screenwriter and went for an Hollywood one because every seems to be pushed to the extreme. Every match is a wonderfull emotional roller coaster with amazing comebacks, crazy overturns and last minute goals, no matter what you try to do.
But it's not just the ME: economy in this game is a joke. You have more options to interact with players, other managers and agents than in SIMS4, you can define extremely complicated contract with options that only someone with a PHD in economy can understand and in the end your player (and all the team after him) gets mad because you don't sell him for 10% of his market value. But who cares about economy in a manager simulator when you have the in-game editor and you can easly make your favourite team richer than Soros?

The conclusion is that the new FM2021 is an incredibly precise simulation of the whole football world. SI has worked very hard once again to try to include and reproduce every aspect around football and I am really impressed by the level of details and similarity to real life they have reached. The only one problem is they forgot they are producing a videogame.",1606983382,1606983382,False,15,2,0.556600272655487061,0,True,False,False

Another year another FM, every year i say i'll skip this one and every year i cave. The reviews all looked great so i took the plunge and honestly this release is so hard to recommend right now. 

The game itself is solid as per,  but the UI is a bit of a mess and really frustrating. Phantom clicks/drag and drops when trying to select the team, end up swapping my striker for a keeper or drilling into the players page. Formation weakness doesn't seem to update straight away or will just highlight different squares red for a couple of seconds before reverting back to normal. Issues with specific player instructions for example you can have Advanced Playmaker role set but when you drill into this to set specifics nothing appears to be selected, 

Never know if the changes i've made on the ""touchline tablet"" will carry forward to the next game, sometimes they do sometimes they don't. Colour coding makes no sense a journalist can have an negative opinion of me that appears in green then another one will be positive but appear red, i've seen the same thing with player opinions. On one of my first matches i was playing in my away kit, i made a substitution and the player came on in the home kit, i made another and all i could see was a players shadow and their hair,

I've already had two or three crashes, the game seems to think it's graphics related and keeps asking me to check driver, i'm using a 1080 and it's on the latest nvidia driver... could FM21 be the new Crysis?

I'm sure most of this will get patched soon but i'd avoid the game for now if you were on the fence, give it a another month, just like SI should have done for the release date...",1606605115,1606841562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:

The game shows improvement in the area of UI, mainly when playing matches where you can comfortably see the status of every player, everything else is pretty much unchanged but that's not a bad thing. 

The match engine has definitely changed. I don't know how to explain it but it feels very smooth and looks (most of the time) like an actual football game. 

The interview mechanic has been overhauled, it now has an actual purpose, it's not like previous games where I didn't care about it at all and skipped them, now you can have relationships with the press and change the mood of players but it can get old pretty fast since the interviewers almost always ask the same questions and at that point, you know what to answer to improve or worsen your relationships.

The bad:

The game is STUPIDLY EASY. I don't know if it's the formation I use or my tactics but it's VERY EASY. I can't emphasize that enough. I've only lost 4 games across an entire season and now I'm almost halfway through my second season and I haven't lost yet. Mind you, I picked an Argentinian football team so it's not like I've chosen incredibly popular teams. 

Sometimes the players do whatever the hell they want. Like I said at the beginning, I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to FM games but players just ignore orders, do whatever the hell they want and make stupid decisions. I'd like to believe that this is some kind of ""realism"" where players tend to do things wrong and not because of the game itself.

It's also very annoying that at one point, your players will want a raise that reflects their improvement as a footballer but your club will not have enough money to pay them, leading to selling said players. I believe there should be some kind of option or a solution of some sort to tell them: ""bro, why you asking so much, we don't have that much money"". I've lost 3 good players because of this and even though I managed to mitigate this quite a bit, I'm about to lose a couple more. 

Overall, I think this is a great entry to the FM series, despite the issues, I think the good things outweigh the bad things. If you're thinking of giving the games a try, check this one out. As long as you get past those incredibly frustrating moments, it's a pretty chill game where you can dump time into.",1606758204,1606758204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They also managed to make more formations viable and the reduction in value at the beginning of the year makes it possible to bring in some players that you otherwise wouldn't in other years. My only gripe with this game would be the little to low amount of changes to the interface and no inclusion of the J-league, but those would be nitpicks.

The match engine feels smoother and better. Players seem to really play football now and it's harder to tell when you will score or concede a goal. There's a also good amount of VAR moments, but it's not an annoying amount as it was in earlier games. 

The interface looks cleaner and feels a lot smoother. Loading times are also better and I really love the new UI. The only issue I have is the new logos that are used for fitness, etc. I hate the hearts and would love if they brought back the option to turn it into numeric percentages. 

The youth development and scouting tabs of the game have been changed and definitely improved. While it seems more advanced, it's also more user friendly to understand what the game is telling you about different players. 

A downside of this game seems to be the punishment you get from playing high intensity strategies, because it seems to really hurt your players and get you a lot of injuries. It somewhat forces you to play a less intense strategy, which doesn't really fit into everyone's playstyle..

The last issue I currently have is the amount of spelling and grammatical mistakes that are in the Dutch translation of this game. I can't tell if this issue applies to other languages as well, but it's annoying. It could and should've been avoided. 

That said, I do think this game is worth it and is a great experience and upgrade from the earlier games.

I started playing FM20 around Jan 20, so most of the bugs and issues had been ironed out by that point.

But what bothers me about this game isn't the bugs.

Simple things in previous games are now a chore. For example, you can't change the mentality of the squad in match whilst viewing the main stats screen.

So many good things which made the last FM one of the greatest in the series has been changed or removed making this game for me the worst in the series so far.

The layout is difficult, confusing and irritating. Meaning this game is losing it's fun, and is starting to become a chore.

The match engine has been made so much better, and that seems to be the thing that gets the most attention, and perhaps rightfully so, but I've noticed other smaller things that I'd like to mention. The game seems to run so much smoother than in previous years, so there must have been some overhaul there, and I'm also a very big fan of all the new interactions that you can have. Team talks feel more like team talks than just clicking the same prompt over and over again, and the same goes for press conferences and player interactions. Pre-match briefings are the best they've ever been, and the player feedback you get after setting your tactics also improves immersion. Even little things like the end of season roundup you get has been improved over what it was in previous years; just some emails that pop up in your inbox.  

I could not recommend this game enough, especially for players who are familiar with previous editions but grew disillusioned with the lack of a more realistic match engine or the lack of little quality of life changes.

The difference in interactions with players, press, recruitment etc is fantastic and adds a level of immersion that was missing from previous versions. When it comes to squad selection, the extra playing time options is great, for example being able to designate a goalkeeper as a purely cup keeper. Which i find extremely useful as it stops me worrying about whether the virtual player is happy with his playing time.

The revamped match day experience is also very neat and just adds a splash of glamour to everything. Which isn't something i thought i wanted until i experienced it! The match engine looks so good that i've been converted from 2D to 3D, which as a diehard 2D man i didn't think would ever happen!

The new interface does take some great use too, but i imagine that's down to me coming from playing fm19 and missing out the 2020 version.

In summary, if you love football manager, you'll love this game. The jump from fm19 is big enough to make the game value for money. Can't comment on the difference to fm20 however. Great stuff!",1606427082,1606427082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can shake hands or put your arm around players now; odd that a game about the immersion of being a manager, should not think to add these touches in, a long time ago. I still feel the dialogue between manager and player is too thin, repetitive and vague. But at least now, you can kind of develop a relationship with those players you like and those you don't. But, the makers of FM know that they don't have to produce a new game, because most people only buy it for the updated team sheets. Nobody likes playing, if a player is not adequately skilled because he's developed massively in 9 months, or  player starts off at the wrong club or a youngster just isn't in the game. We buy the game, simply to see Rashford, Mount, Grealish have appropriately high skill ratings, or for Balotelli to be finally rated as poorly as he is in real life, or for Gareth Bale at Tottenham and not at Madrid. The in-game edit function is useful, but not even a dedicated geek is going to make sure Southend United have the appropriate players in their youth team. If you've got £40 to spend, if you liked FM20, then you'll like FM2021, because they are fundamentally the same game.",1606387423,1606387423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main problem is during the match where all options for how you want it to arrange your information have been taken away. What you are left with is an information screen popping up in between the highlights with preset information on it, most of which you don't want. It all feels too prescribed and If you want information during a highlight it totally obscures the action.

Which part of individual instructions Devs dont understand? In beta the problem was with that everyone was selected. Now once you issue individual instruction to a player the checkboxes get disabled so we need to toggle from one of the groups. How difficult is it describe a feature that has been working well for over 5-6 iterations. Look at your previous code for christ sake, or hire some damn testers.
Have requested for refund. Totally messed up gameplay engine. Immediate need of ensuring the amount of shots/passes/crosses crashing into players are reduced. The sorry state of players not running after lose balls is frustrating specially when opposition launches a counter from that. Rest of the game is good but something has gone horribly wrong with match engine after full release.
Exact same tactics and players that defeated Liverpool, RM, Chelsea by more than 4 goals each, now fail to seem to find a single decent pass. Wingers will not cross or pass to striker and will try to walk the ball into the net, only failing to do so. Lost a game to 2 backpasses from defender to GK , resulting in 2 goals within a span of 1 minute, the last minute. Frustrated. Shut it down. Am back to FM20 and I need a refund


Having played almost every game of this series since FM07, this one is a mixed bag. I have also been one of those who complained about having to buy a full game for just a design/cosmetic changes to the game. Now having played this for close to 10 odd hours, I am left with a mixed feeling.
This game surely has some nice upgrades, are they worth buying immediately at a full price, is the question?

Positives:
1. Match engine has improved a fair bit. Seems a lot smoother too.
2. New interactions is a step in a positive direction. Must focus on not making it very mechanical for long term users.
3. Transfer fees seem to be toned down a bit. Haven't yet seen an offer of 100+ Millions.

Negatives:
1. Salaries are screwed up. Players in south american/african leagues with below 10k, no international experience are expecting more than 100k. This is way too common an occurence.
2. Why did the devs touch the inbox and themes? This high contrast purple theme is a nightmare. I can barely look at inbox. Why not include dark theme? Why not change it as per team colors like in past? Do not touch what works well.
3. Match engine is better however the quick interaction cards are still unpolished. Randomly these cards become unclickable and only way out is to let time pass a bit, defeating the point of quick interactions.
4. Individual talk annoyed the hell out of me to the point I considered asking for refund. Why would you ask users to manually unselect 10+ players for every individual interaction? Which part of individual did devs not understand?
5. Not sure if its just me, however percentage of shots getting blocked (or bouncing off players) seems unnatural. Follow throughs are getting blocked off, which just seems like unrealistic reflexes, far too often.
6. Even the players with best attributes don't make a run for a ball. Players randomly slow down or hold up and lose possession, and a counter attack starts, is horrific. This has been there in previous versions too.
7. In terms of search, there was a filter which could identify key attributes for a role. This doesn't exist anymore making it much harder to search for staff or players.

Verdict :
Overall the game has some nice changes. Even though mostly cosmetic it may still seem like a fresh change.
If you've never bought a game or haven't bought in last 3-4 years - Definitely purchase this.
If you've been a loyal follower - Wait for it to be on discount.

However overall a positive change.",1605338483,1606370052,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:

1) Great and modernised Visual Style, it will look good not only in PC but specifically in tabs or smaller laptops

2) Up to date and accurate data base even for obscured leagues

3) Great Game Performance, even for a low to mid end Gaming PC. Saving Time is slashed.

4) Graphically improved match engine. Player interactions are more realistic now

5) Gameplay simulation and Financial simulation is good and realistic

6) Addition of new player and press interaction is great 

CONS:

Some systems specially much hyped xG is not properly explained and cannot ascertain how can it help aspiring managers
