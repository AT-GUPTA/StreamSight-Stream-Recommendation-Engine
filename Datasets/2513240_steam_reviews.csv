they simply do not belong in any game. but to have them in an idle game ... I can't even fathom how anyone could arrive at this idea

I am actually infuriated after realizing that I have to press C or X within split seconds to make use of a stat I have. this completely breaks the game. would break any game. 

it shows that the designer of this game is not a gamer, but some suit who doesn't understand why people play games, what is fun and what is motivating.

full down vote from me


the little hand with the finger pointing to the thing you ""gotta click"" oozes disdain and disrespect. it feels like the dev thinks his customers are senile 90 year olds, not people who want to watch a lighthearted battle based on your decisions, stats and items on screen while having dinner or working out.

that he thinks that people playing this would have their hands on the fucking keyboard so they can press C every few minutes but within a split second shows that the dev has no sense of reality.
just like doing a 50$ supporter pack for a game whose genre he doesn't even understand.

I have 2000h in Path of Exile, one of the most complex games on the market and also one where you have to be fully focused every millisecond of playing, or fail. I don't need some little hand constantly telling me what button to click. 
and I do not play a game like this to actively play, but to idle it.

one has to imagine the arrogance of designing a game without having gamed oneself, and especially designing a game in a genre you have never played.

Only 2 problems for me :
- I pay two times 5$ because we can't link the account from google to steam...
- No infinity respect (with gold or quest or nothing) to help us for the early game (swap armor build to magical ass example before to be lvl 200 or more, SPOIL : need lvl 290 for max the tree)

I mean, it's a mobile port, that flies over there, but it's supremely ridiculous to charge £15 and £45 for a dlc that gives a skin for a faerie that just hangs out on your screen plus speeding up training. On mobile you can view ads to get access to those things for short amount of times, steam you're expected to fork over the beans.

Just make the DLCs £5 a pop and someone might actually look at buying them as support, expecting someone to fork £65 over to get full access to a very simple idle RPG (albeit, well polished and clean) is not it.

You also only get 1 respec, ever, as far as I can tell. Why not offer respecs for gold, or just more respecs?

For the last fairy +50% gold is kinda meh for 50 euro, if it would've been around 30 then it's fine but the last one is for support the devs. Just for the fanatic fans in my opinion, gold is totally useless because it's idle grind and you only need around 200-240k(training points one time) after it, you can't do much with it (buy arrow?)

The game is good for idle gamers, nice graphic average balance but it would be more amazing if it contain ranking or guild or smth then the game might be much better and have bigger playerbase :)
