First of all, if you are looking for a heavily story-based game such as FF14, WOW, Dragonborn, etc., this is not what you will be expecting.

At its core, Trove is a light-hearted game that's based on character power leveling. Every system and mechanics contribute to your character getting stronger, and the gaming style is, putting it in a bad way: ""Endless Grind."" 
However (Here is a beauty of Trove), unlike running dungeons and raids like ""WOW,"" farming anything in this game is really easy and non-hardcore. You don't need to know any fights beforehand, there are no required classes until you hit the end game, and overall, you can yaba daba do anything with ZERO stress.

Trove also relies heavily on playing with people/friends. 
Because the gaming style itself is really hollow, the game is more like a social platform to play with random people and friends, especially your in-game Club members.
Benefiting from its super openworldness, you can ""Team up"" with anyone you want in maps (The game even offers you a teleportation stone that can teleport you to a random player in the world) 
The most important and attention-grabbing of this game is that it is primarily a tool for you to hang out with other people, almost like a party. 

Ok, let's talk about some hostries and some of the current problems with the game.

You probably have seen a lot of reviews and comments that this game was so awesome back in 2015 to 2017.
This is because of three factors.

First is the end game power cap and balance. 
Unlike games that reset your power levels, Trove constantly updates its end-game cap. (If you upgrade everything to the maximum, collect every collectible, and complete every in-game achievement, you will hit a power level cap.)
One of the biggest reasons the game was enjoyable back in 2016 is because there are fewer near-end-game players. I know you probably wonder why this is a bad thing. The bad thing about this is that there is no power level balancing in dungeons and raids, therefore people with higher power rankings can just one shot and carry the rest of the players.
The game was good back then is because you can't just find a random end game player in the open world therefore you must find people to work together to fight dungeons and bosses. The process of it is very enjoyable and fun (Because there is almost no punishment if you constantly die) 
Nowadays, you just queue up with a group and sit to wait for your Club members to carry you, which is exactly what Josh experienced in the public Delve. Plus, you can trade mid-end-game items with other players, and they are effortless to farm.
I will give you a picture of what it is like. In order to enter the higher world, you must hit the required power levels, like 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500, 5000, etc. You must fight dungeons and upgrade your gears. min-maxing stats and watching your character grow and entering higher zones are SUPER FUN. 
But now, you get a set of gear from other people like your club members that just get you to 5000+ power levels in 1 second, and you just skip the entire first part of the game, diving straight in the grind. 

The second is the so-called pay-to-win system and in-game shop.
One of the biggest reasons people say there are way more things you have to pay for now is that most of the stuff you buy are collectibles, which increases your secondary stat: ""Mastery."" Mastery does not really affect your character power level therefore it is easier to make and it won't affect the players as much. Because tweaking power levels is a very frustrating thing to do and can cause a major disaster for the end-game players. 
However, there are still many things you can buy in shops that can help boost your character's power levels, so it is essentially a pay-to-win game.

The third is the content update.
For the past few months, the devs are a lot better at updating and reworking classes and content. But still, because there isn't much content, the end-game players have figured everything out and are just feeding the information to the new players thus there is no process of learning the systems and mechanics of the game.

That's about it, in general, if you have always been a solo player or story game based player, then Trove is probably not the game for you, but if you have friends or looking to meet new people, just have fun and feel good to kill and level up, then Trove is a great game that you can enjoy for a long, long time.",1485573491,1647160404,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Cancer community, just like League of Legends. Salty kids everywhere, the end-gamers insult everyone. But thats not the worst...

The game got a free add-on (expansion) named ""Mantle of Power"", in which gems were introduced. This killed the game for me and many others. Since then, the game is brainless grinding for resources. Only the early game is fun, the leveling and gearing. But when you enter the mid game, to improve your gear and ""wealth"", you have to turn off your brain.
Everyday, every session the same grinding, over and over and over again. Grinding resources is the keyword of the game.
Did I mention the heavy pay-to-win aspect since the introduction of gems? Since there is a PVP-Mode, you have a heavy advantage if you just buy powerful gems for real money in the ingame shop. Why grind for a powerful gem if you can just buy it for 20€, AMIRITE?!

With all the beautiful memories with my friends and new cool people I met in this game (who of course don't play this game anymore), I do NOT recommend this game.

It's very hard for beginners to reach high level, and it's almost impossible to reach end-game if you dont spend countless amounts of money in the game. If you're a free to play player, you're going to need litterally thousands of hours to grind the different resources needed to advance to higher levels, better gear. The gem system is AWFUL, and it needs you to grind time gated resources which obligate you to log in each week and do your weekly quests and challenges. The game gives you no incentive to continue playing, because of the ridiculously useless rewards you're given for being in the higher tiers.

Dont get me started on the Geode update, which is boring, way, wayyy too long to grind all your materials to get to the geode end-game. This update feels like it has nothing to do with trove, as it has absolutely nothing in common with the regular Trove gameplay, and that it's rewards only concern Geode gameplay.

The game is known for it's ""one step forward two steps back"" policy, which means that everytime they add something the community wanted, they find a way to make it fucked up. Trove is heavily relying on RNG instead of relying on pure time spent on the game. A newbie can win super rare stuff that they dont care about when a HL player can spend countless hours of the game getting that item.

According to the wiki, there is 136 different kinds of lootboxes.136. Really? I know a good lot of these are just different tiers of the same boxes but still, it's completely stupid.

EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.
https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaints

[h1]What was:[/h1]
An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).
[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]
Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.
[h1]After the ""Cancer Patch"":[/h1]
This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. 
The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.
As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.

Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.

EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened.",1487462882,1531691672,False,862,13,0.961073815822601318,104,True,False,False

This game still isn't good; the server's are terrible, as such, disconnecting randomly is common, and the game regularly crashes.

I can honestly not recommend to play this game, as the frustration playing it is often greater than the fun-value it returns. Especially due to its repetitive nature... [i](Always wanted to defeat the same boss 900 times across 3 difficulites? No? Well, you get a reward for that... for 2 bosses. Just an example.)[/i]

Despite all this, I can't stop playing this game for a reason that is beyond my perception... Almost like it's haunting me.

Well, yeah... Don't play.",1488036295,1511381345,False,1,0,0.477802634239196777,1,True,False,False

The gameplay is okay and even though there is huge focus around grinding, it's a fun sort of grind because you're constantly working towards things and getting epic loot. It kind of reminds me of a third person ARPG (or in this case an AMMORPG). Even though it is free to play, you can see Trion's greed wheels turning in their minds. Almost everything has a pay wall and though there are ways to earn things through challenges and chests, it is very limiting. Some items for example, the re-gemerator, are purchase only, but when gems go wrong or you wish to replace them, then you must buy them and depending on many times you screw up, this can mount up across multiple character playthroughs. Every new slot in the second inventory (backpack) is divided up into paid slots (there are 3 inventory backpacks I believe). 500 credits each for 5 slots (there are approximately 30-40 spaces in each inventory). Storage space costs double but you get more.

I simply cannot believe how poor the servers are and how little has been added to the game over the years, especially when Trion has filled the game with so many forms of microtransactions (and even a subscription service) and when the quality of the game is simply not up to par. 

There's undoubtedly a lot of naive kids, probably enjoying the game, but paying ludicrous amounts for frankly shocking quality. The servers are completely unforgivable though and I have never in my life seen any game with this amount of microtransactions in it.

The argument and defensive points around MT and subscription services are - it's optional. Sure, sure it is. However the game is seriously watered down and the value for those who do invest in the game is poor to say the least. I still cannot wrap my head around just how bad the servers are (hence repeating myself). The lag affects combat and occasionally disconnects happen at inopportune times, which results in you being put into a queue - this usually only lasts a few minutes - but still an annoying inconvenience.

It's a good game to an extent, but it is marred by poor servers, mountains of MT and greedy paywalls and a subpar experience for those who have to grind excessively if they do not want to spend a fortune on overpriced store purchases. I'd be far more supportive of games like this (as I have on PC games and Android) if not nearly ever important item was sold in the store, the prices were reasonable and the servers were reliable and lag free).

Trion have handled this opportunity very poorly and the declining population is not a surprise.

What is surprising? The game has charm. It has fun classes. It has lovely, amusing loot - some of which looks badass. It has mounts. It has a nice atmosphere. It's fun for a while and is worth checking out, but don't be too disappointed if you experience lag spikes or your jaw drops at just how many things these guys are willing to sell (and the prices they charge).

Edit: ""New update"" (with a video promoting it) that offers nothing adventurous even though it's dubbed ""Adventures"". It's basically just another biome with the same rinse and repeat bull that has been the basis for all the boredom this game offers. It's a grind with zero direction, zero meaning, zero satisfaction and huge emphasis on spending money. The servers are also inexcusably bad and have been since the game was first released years ago - no money that they have earned has gone into servers. There are far better games on offer out there.

I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding. 

Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.

[i]As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b]
If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. 
I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.

[b]SoundFX:[/b]
While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.

[b]PTW or FTP?:[/b]
This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%
The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.

[u][b]Personnal notes:[/b][/u]
This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. [u]Be warned,[/u] it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.

INGREDIENTS:

1 c. unsalted butter
2 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. flour
1 c. cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella
5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbled


DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.
4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)
6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)
7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.

You fight, mine, and help build your home. It is a game in which you use both creativity, adventure, and the need for better gear that drives this game. The game is free to play but has several costs at the benefit of this. This game is more of a grind, dungeon, and building game.

Reasons to Get the Game:

The main reason for me was that it was FREE. As in no cost, but there is always a cost and item that requires you to pay the company who made trove. Examples are like Costumes, Different Mounts, and Loot Crates that help give you a type of Gambling feel into a game. The best part of the game is that it is one of the free games that include BUILDING. Building your own home from a simple house to a cool castle or tower makes the game more fun and better. If you have nothing to do I recommend to get the game and just try it out.

Problems Regarding the Game:

The problems regarding it is the INSANE level of grinding for better loot and in-game currency to make your character look at least decent. The next problem is the building area: The building are is not as big as you think it would be. So I recommend that before you start building plan accordingly to the size given and use it to your advantage. For Example, a tower would be good for the Building Space Provided.

Overall Result:

I recommend on trying the game out because it is a free-to-play game. It helps me have something to do when I have lost interest in other games.

I have spent countless hours in this game, its blocky graphics remind me of minecraft but the game itself is unique in such a way that one just has to admire how much time and effort the developers have put into the game so far. The controls are smoothe and tight, the classes are fun to play, and the gameplay itself is extremely unique when it comes to MMO games in general. Many people claim it is pay2win, however the game is actually quite easy to advance in without paying. However, I would definately classify this game as a Pay2Speedrun as to reach the max level higher you can pay money. 

My Perception:
      Graphics       8/10-I cannot really judge based on graphics here but the water looks beautiful.
      Gameplay     10/10-The controls are tight and packed and the abilities and classes are well thought out
      Server            6/10-The game's server connection could be run better on a potato but its an MMORPG so thats to be expected of it

Those of you who remember Cube World will find this satisfying in a way you wanted that game to feel (although the movement is far more ""static"" and ""controlled"" in a sense as opposed to the float/glide feeling combat in that long-dead game. Not a bad thing at all, just a difference worthy of note and, frankly, an easier system to acclimate to if not quite as satifying). 

This is a good game, end of story. Flawed? Oh yeah. But, this game delivers one of the best experiences I've ever had in the voxel genre (not as complex in building as Minecraft nor combat as complex/satisfying as Cube World or Portal Knights, but more well rounded than either). Great game and worthy of your time.

HOWEVER!!!!
My account (yes, the one played and loved since EARLY alpha) ran into bizarre account security problems. The support I recieved was worse than non-existant. I threw a couple bucks there way (well earned, I can't lie) but it was hurtful having my account with such time/money investments taken from me and ZERO way of retrievale (believe me, I've tried 3 times to date and been essentially spat in the face for it by either automated replies or uncaring support staff). I remember being able to chat in-game with dev's during alpha, listening to world chat talking about shadow items before the name tier name of ""shadow"" was even implimented, but damn do I feel betrayed.

I'd highly reccomend to anyone looking to have fun, especially with a friend or few, but if you want long term DO NOT INVEST. Loss of security or any similar problem will result in uncaring dismissal of your problem and believe me when I say that kills the enjoyment of what could be a great game. So, mixed bag review. Wish there was a ""sort of"" recommend option on steam for this exact case, but without I cannot reccomend to anyone who (like me) loves investing themselves into a game.",1486799704,1486799704,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great community
Great sandbox options
Smooth gameplay
Vibrant, colorful, happy environments.
Player-driven economy.
RNG loot drops.
Fun bosses
Great zoning out while listening to music game
Catchy music. VERY catchy music.
You can be a pirate riding a dragon.
You can be a dragon riding a dragon.
There are like a million dragons now.
Seriously. Dragons.
Classes are unique in design.
Fae.

Cons:

Takes a million years to grind 20-30 on a single class. (Runescape level experience curves near the last few levels.)
Gem system is pointless time waster medium for grinding stats.
Used to be able to buy classes for free currency, no more after MoP.
RNG loot drops.


Summary:
Trions pay2win model came into effect with MoP. The game simply is not fun unless you spend money on it., or focus purely on the sandbox aspect. Period. Unless you have countless hours and no life to throw away like I did. (or are talented at merching the player driven economy.)

however...

from the time i started playing trove to now, i've realized (with much disappointment) that it's basically a pay-to-play game at this point. not everyone can afford credits, cubits and what not. i totally understand the whole patreon thing, wanting to give certain fans access to some rare things here and there, but it feels like that is the absolute only way to make any real advancements or anything other than grinding and farming 24/7. everything, from credits and cubits to materials and costumes, should be more accessible than what they are now. im not saying to just hand things out, but jeez, don't make it to the point where we can't get any even slightly cool stuff without having to pay for it.

You get two free classes without much effort, more if you decide to refer a friend and use their class coin, but you must reach a high level to finally get it. The characters that are more advanced cost actual money but can be crafted if you're willing to put the time into it. Trove is essentially a grind game where you raid dungeons endlessly in open worlds and collect loot. When you reach a certain power level that increases with better loot, you can move onto a new world where you repeat the looting process, an endless loop of looting. If you like a game that feels rewarding, I can recommend this to you. Personally, this is my type of game. Despite the repetition, I enjoy putting time into it because it feels rewarding and your appearance changes with different loot so you don't always look the same. If you love what anything looks like, you can save its appearance and apply it to something different and keep its stats, I really enjoy that option. Plenty of interaction, each world has its own chat and there is a main hub where you can talk to people or find your friends and play together. You can also build your own home but within a limited square, the great part about this is you can transport your house anywhere you go for free. You can only spawn the home within squares that are randomly placed around every world. Only you can edit or destroy them. All interactable furniture placed inside of your home is usable by everyone, but it's personalized for them. Only you can access anything you have stored. There are trading stations but you have to be a very high level to use them, as for the player market.",1486356484,1486357022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But to begin with if you are reading this thank you for taking your time and if you are one of my creators i know you have been to my guild called mega freedom but i dont remember who and just wanted to say hai. So in general this game is really amazing. I have played this game for a long time a previously said but the game has changed a lot. Some of it in a cool/good waybut some if it in a really bad way. 

To begin with, the market was really cool because it gave people an easier way to get  some good stuff like instead of farming sunlight bulbs for an hour or 2 you can jsut go to the market and spend some flux and get some that way. But if you are like me who has shit loads of flux you can get even more money from it which is a downside and i say this becuase i am a victum of it and now say you wanted to buy sun light bulbs usually there like 10-15 flux a peice which isnt bad so thumbs up for that. NOW the down side is like i said if you like me and have a lot flux you can buy all of the sulight bulbs and then sell them for way more like 100 a peice because no one has it and wants it so they will buy some which you can miake big profit from this which now the rich get only richer and you can do this stuff for materials that are harder to obtain like a penta forge soul and then boost the price to 40k flux and people will buy it because some are desprate enough to buy them because they want a radient which is where i usually make money like that but differ items. 

On a good note though i like how they have added radient and stellar items becuase i thought they were really cool.  Now the bad note is if your new its going to be harder to get them because you need at least 600 magic find and thats the lowest to where if you're farming for about and hour you will get one radient and if lucky a stellar. On that note though lets talk about one of the biggest parts of trove.

Power Rank, this is what gets you almost every where only for the reason of the the places you can go with 15k power rank or more becuase with out power rank you can get no good items like shadows and resplendent if you want to count those. But i only said that power rank takes you almost every where because you also need mastery rank just for some bonus items it can get you and i highly recommend that you take the time to learn about gems because a lot of new players miss out on gems and then wonder how to get power rank because in this game gems wil give you the most power rank and if you really want get to lvl at least 20 so you can use the special gems (forgot their names so sry people) and then spend money to get gem booster packs so the n you can get some good gems for your person and get some power rank. or farm up and just get the gems when you reach 550 power rank because at that pr you can do a shodow tower. With that if you kill daughter of the moon then you get some lunar souls which then you can make a gem booster and get a good gem(s).

More down sides; 
-you have to pay for classes or just farm chaos chest for chaos cores
-if your new then you will have a rough start (you can message me  if you need help but ill be playing with differ acount because its a good excuse to lvl up my oter chars on my other account)
-carful of scammers when you trade best bet is to look in market and then from that see the normal pricing for the item then buy the cheapest ;]
-farming flux can be really annoying for new people because they cant go in ubers 8/9 for good items to deconstruct
-PvP is a little effy (my opion) love the banner idea though (nother note: it is really fun if you do guild PvP i do it a lot and it's really fun)

Upsides
-game is very fun in general
-community is nice (most of the time)
-there are some cool dragons now (sadly though getting dragon coin are a lil annoying)
-getting to level 30 and having it said to everyone online feels great 
-the farming is really fun with friends and alone (biased a little)
-the graphics are good


Some Tips
try to find a good and nice guild and make friends and they can help you get good
start learning hot to garden in the game because it will help you a lot to get to mastery 20
buy a boat so you can get over water fast
another good/easy way to get mastery points is to fish
DO NOT DO SCROOL CRAFTING THING i say this because that is something you want to do whe n you get to mastery 200-299 because it will help you a lot when you get that far
carful where you go because say you have 5000 pwoer rank it will let you go to uber 8 which you are only level 13 or something you will die so stay in areas where your lvl is like uber 2/3 if you're lvl 13 
make friends on the game because if you do it will only get funner



Stuff I miss 
is when glim was actually useful i cry now becuase of it 
cant trade/sell chaos chest
a big one is the old shadow towers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  these were the best because shadow towers used to be where you have to find them in the worlds of uber+ and have a shadow key and this made the game really fun becuase of when you found them you had a chance to get differ bossed. now sadly all you have to do is just get flux and boom you get a shadow tower and you can choose your boss. (but i do love that there are random mini dungeons that lead to the main boss)



I could go on about this game but i've spent some time typing this and now my hands hurt so i hope you liked this and found this helpful and i also hope you arent a grammer nazi ;] just saying ehehehe

If I could describe it, I would say its similar to minecraft with its building mechanic and style but the gameplay is almost completely different. You start off being able to choose about 15 different classes all with different abilities. You then get to go off into a randomly generated world with dungeons scattered everywhere. All you do is just beat them and level up,..thats about it...yes there are shadow dungeons and some different realms as well as a horrible pvp mode but thats it. It lacks in content and it starts to get extremly repetitive. The content they add is just pay 2 win mounts and wings. Yes, this game is a pay 2 win once you get past level 20. And even if you buy stuff, it just adds something better next week. This has brought the game down because they now care more about mounts which make a quick buk instead of adding actual content. It's a shame really and a dissapointment. I think the game is good but to repetitive and boring in the first 20 hours. Then its just grinding simulator. I would recommend this game but its just gotten worse over the past 2 years.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

Its basically a dumbed down Minecraft, with limited crafting (recipe list), and the combat is RPG-lite. It lacks any and all depth, as a freshly created character can take on even the most challenging dungeons with nothing but holding down left click and pressing either 1 or 2 every few minutes.

This is clearly designed for children, though I guess that should have been aparant from the intro movie.

Really, its not a bad game, but it will never provide a challenge, or anything to *do* for an adult. So while I do recommend this game, the caveat to that is that its for your children.

At first when I saw the game on store, I thought it was a really bad attempt at copying Minecraft and other survival games.

I quickly fell in love with it, both the amount of things inside the game I could do with friends, and the game concept that ties in block building games and RPG in a very neat way. Though maybe to some, the graphics are not the best, as everything is made up of either big or small pixle-blocks, but if you're a fan of 3D pixel graphics like me, or you have actually tried to make 3D riggings of these 3D pixle models, I'm sure you will appreciate the game. The game does not lag a lot for me, despite the servers being located in the US (I live on the other side of the US), and there are many useful and meaningful updates to keep the players interested. This game is great for people who wants to quickly play something before dinner is ready, or could only game a few hours a week due to school, as this game is an easy-to-start and easy-to-put-down game, which means you can quit playing the game at anytime and won't feel bad about it (some games make you feel uneasy to put down by making you lose progress in the game in a certain way if you do quit the game. This game doesn't do that). Anyway, as it's a FTP game, you really don't need to waste your time reading reviews.

The game is extremely repetitive, you'll see this once you get up a few levels and have to enter the same area over and over and over to level up. That is the entire game, all the way up, just re-entering areas over and over again to level up until you get to endgame, just to do it some more. 

There is very very little content. Once you get a little far into the game you realize that all you've done is go to the same maps over and over and over, the game itself is absolutely tiny.

It is ""pay to progress"" to the point where you'd have to be crazy to play for free. It implements the ever so popular ""nag you at every single corner to pay"" which is easily just as bad as blatant ""pay to win"", if not worse, because ""pay to progress"" generally means a much higher cost to keep up than blatant pay to win.

The crafting system is extremely basic for a voxel game. It feels almost as if the developers just looked at minecraft and copied the crafting/building at the most basic level just because it's voxel and it might appeal to minecraft players.

Extremely poorly optimized for a tiny voxel game with very little content. Not much to say here, my friends had issues with half decent machines that could run most games on medium/high.

I have to say, I'm generally very forgiving when I review games, but this game's only positive is that it is a cute voxel game. May even be the worst game I've ever reviewed, It is very clear that this isn't a project made out of love, it is a project made to capitalize off of the success of another game (Minecraft).",1485093930,1485093930,False,0,0,0.499868452548980713,0,True,False,False

It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.  

If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.

My verdict - If you can bare, or even enjoy the grinding that this game takes, and set yourself goals, and be willing to sacrifice a lot of time, go for it, have fun. If you cannot, atleast try the game till you hit that slow point.
