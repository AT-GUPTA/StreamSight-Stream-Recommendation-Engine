Not for 50$, no. Game felt just as bad as Kiwami 1 mixed with Yakuza 3.
Yakuza 8 trial was tempting but after i finished Gaiden that trial felt as RGG+Sega were like ""hey, at least you get Yakuza 8 trial"" *crickets chirping*.
If you bought both Gaiden and Yakuza 8 you paid twice for Yakuza 8. 'Like a dragon: Gaiden' should be free or paid DLC for Yakuza 8 like 'Majima saga' was put into Kiwami 2.

Game feels really rushed. Imagine weird child of Kiwami 1, Yakuza 3 (mostly bad storytelling) with some things from Kiwami 2, Yakuza 6 and Judgement. These were my overall impressions.
If i wasn't familiar with Yakuza series and Gaiden was my first game i'd drop it after playing first chapter. Or even maybe first hour, because:
[olist]
    [*]things that could be optional and put as substories were obligatory to progress main story. Just like stupid missions with kids in Yakuza 3. This dumb intentional dragging.
    [*]top notch dialogues like:
- you're Kazuma Kiryu
- no, i'm Joryu
- you're Kiryu
- no, i'm telling you
- dude...
- bro, i swear
- tell me one more time you're not Kiryu i gonna beat your ass
- okay
    [*]nothing much to do besides Colliseum. Trailer looked promising with karaoke and cabaret, but reality is disappointing. Almost.
[/olist]
In the second chapter things get better.

Fights using agent style felt less soy as fights in Judgement games. You have gadgets that actually are fun to use against crowds. Drones suck and useless, explosive cigs are fun and chaotic. Yakuza style is okay, but i didn't like that you can evade only when you're locked on an enemy. And i couldn't figure out how to switch targets. Also switching styles was completely inconsistent and unresponsive. Animations prevent you from switching styles and this was really annoying when you're in the middle of a big fight.
There're Colliseum fights. They're more likely fun than not. Fighting crowds of weak or medium enemies was okay. But when tanky or just strong enemies come out, fights turn into cheap simulator of:
[list]
    [*]trying to punch through enemy's blocks
    [*]trying to hit evading enemy. Specially with guns (remember Kiwami 1 boss fights?)
    [*]waiting until enemy's phase wears off, because if it's on you can't deal damage or deal very little damage
    [*]incosistent damage. That Justice guy either one-shot-kills-you with his laser, either he just deals some damage
    [*]934856 health bars
[/list]

As for other minigames, they're just lazy copypaste from previous games:
[olist]
    [*]Karaoke. Okay, but 1 new song
    [*]Cabaret. You're guest again like in Yakuza 6 but now hostess are recorded live on videos. Probably because it was easy to produce than fiddle with in-engine cutscenes. Overall impression is okay, i guess. But quantity over quality crops out
    [*]Pocket circuit. Nothing changed at all. You spend more time navigating through obsolete menus than actually playing the game. And it is still random number generator[/olist]
Substories are nominal. Most stories are non-brainers like fetching stuff to people as it was in Yakuza 3 or doing some 3-minute substories like ""go and beat somebody"" or ""wander to some random point several times and talk to people or fight and substory ends""

Main story makes almost no sense. Everybody still knows that you're Kazuma Kiryu in Gaiden and even in Yakuza 8. I guess writers just had to pull story in Gaiden towards Yakuza 8. Ending should've bring some tears but i legit laughed out loud when Taichi saw camera and started telling story of his life thinking it's camera for Kiryu (camera shows many graves, not just Kiryu's).

cried alot at the last chapter because of [spoiler] [strike] kiryu [/strike]  joryu's reunion with watase and the three tojo clan superiors, and the scene of the surveillance camera feed of his fake grave in okinawa,,,,, [/spoiler] and is also the first game in this series i 100% in my first playthrough!

Gameplay and Story wise, it has everything you would expect from the previous games, maybe even better, but I might be biased.

Apart from the absurdity of Kiryu being brought back from his definitive retirement for the 6th time, this game is just filler content. There is a story, but it's a very uninspired one with characters you don't care about, and the rest of the game is just a set of minigames like colloseum, gambling or fetch quests with random items. While mechanically sound, graphically it's nothing to brag about. Dotonbori area is good, but the tiny part of the game when it takes you to Yokohama, it's terrible. You really can tell that the only reasoning behind this game was being a cash grab rather than bringing any value into the franchise.

It's just a glorified ad for the newest LAD you pay full price for and nothing else. It reaches peak absurdity towards the end where some random guy is easily more powerful than all bad guys Kiryu had faced up till that point and when in the last cutscene sequence he reminiscences a character that hasn't been brought up even ONCE for the last 6 installments. 

tl;dr
PROS:
- more beat'em up content with Kiryu I guess?
- you get to see Dotonbori 
- certain red haired character looks good
CONS:
- repetitive and uninspired content aimed to extend the playthrough
- boring story with major plotholes 
- really bad graphics in ceratin areas 
- cringy attempt at making Kiryu an Inspector Gadget",1707421093,1708182286,False,0,2,0.336797893047332764,1,True,False,False

I was expecting a quick adventure just to explain Kiryu's whereabouts betwen 6 and 7 but man I was not prepared for how much they developed and fleshed out Kiryu's character in the mere 5 chapters it has. While the combat isn't as good as something like Lost Judgment, the story, characters, voice acting, and presentation were just amazing. It was great to see how far RGG has come as it constantly reminisces about its older titles, letting you join Kiryu on a trip down memory lane. This one is easily in my top 3 Yakuza games. Of course, it has its flaws, but the way they handled a modern Kiryu post-6 was great. 

And outside of the main story, the shortness of this game actually benefits it imo with a smaller and shorter set of substories and side content quest chains. The coliseum was fun but just short enough to not let its simple gameplay get too repetitive. And pocket circuit was a nice return even if I didn't play it that much. 

This game is a love letter to fans of the Kiryu games so this is a must-play if you're interested in his story. It gives me high hopes for how 8 handles him too. Thank you, RGG.

Took me three years from 2021 to play all the main yakuza games and I just know that this game will hit you like train especially if you know where Kiryu comes from. I would say if you're a big fan of the franchise and havent gone into like a dragon with Ichiban yet then this game is ripe for you because it serves as a prequel. 

I tried to give Yong Yea a chance as Kiryu but after seeing clips of Darryl in like a dragon, id reccommend that you start this off with Kuroda instead because its just works. I'm baffled that SEGA didn't bring back Darryl again for this game and they missed out on a huge opportunity.

I would say that the MSQ is probably 7-8h. The rest is substories, grinding the ""Castle"" which has a Coliseum, which in itself is not new aspect but like each Yakuza game, there's some level of mini game that makes you stupid rich. It's the prettied Coliseum of most Yakuza game in my opinion. You can use the taxi to get on it, which I felt was breaking my immersion that it's a boat in international waters. The critique I've read so far is that you can play with other character in the Coliseum but their moves/fluidity is far from being fleshed out and is by far a let down.

As for the story, I feel it's pretty good, this feels like a kind of ""Multverse"" where Kiryu looks not older than 35 yo but this appears to be set in the future when the kids from the orphanage are in their early 20's. The vilains are mid, the overall dept of the Yakuza line of story is not good. Well to be fair, it's still pretty fresh, I like that Kiryu works as Joryu a covert agent which works for some covert government agency also collaborating with the CIA... Kind of sexy spy who get in to leave the life of crime, protect is children while pretending to be dead. (an absolute easy card pulled each time in Yakuza).

So overall the structure of the game is good. The fluidity of the fighting system - the way it's been kind of dumb down is still very fun. The gadgets are super fun and OP AF. The levelling can be pretty much fully done by chapter 4. Which is 2/3 into the game. Doing all the substories unlock some nice stuff including the 2nd point system needed to level up. So they are kind of extremely important. 

Like every Yakuza game, we are in extremely familiar territory. The mini-game are stale and basically feels like a copy-paste of all the universe and feels lazy.  It's a plus and a con. The pocket circuit comes back and it's a blast! The datacom/SEGA console old games are ok but when I play Yakuza I'll admit, I'm not interested in that. The Karaoke is also not scalable (no difficulty level adjustment); I suck at it! Still enjoyable. The Cabaret is ok. It's a film cutscene of JAV actress, which is OK I guess. 

Like in every Yakuza game, you have a side partner which here it's Akame who was a ok new addition but didn't felt like a mark in the Franchise. Meaning, I wouldn't care if she's not in the next game. She share a drink with you, she talks about why she's doing what she does. There's an attempt to build a rapport, but only feels like a tick in a box to achieve a level of narration, rather than an ally that's actually OP (like all past close allies usually are in Yakuza game) that you find either funny, interesting or add tons of fun to the game. 

By the time you're ready to do the final chapter and you've completed S rank all of the coliseum, gotten all the sexy expensive gear, you've filled up in potions and food. You've had some fun challenges in the Coliseum, you're thinking, Let's freaking go!! Last Boss, Last chapter, action pact +100 low level yakuza, with 30 mini boss and 5-6 big boss fight... Right? Nope! It's OK but it's just not good enough, In fact after you're done with it and you're like... Oh... Ok. 

There's No New Game + , much MUCH shorter than other games. The added features are mid and overall the polishing of the scenes and the custscene as still very good.  It's a solid 6, low 7/10 - Still pretty ok

One of the best boss fights the game has ever seen and of course the coliseum. Fight as Majima or even Chicken Head. Also shout out to the sonic fighting game in the arcade!

Gameplay:

+New fighting style is great fun big shout out to the spider whip.
+Mini games galore, some of my faves are here, Pocket Circuit and all the sega arcade games are not to be missed.
+Small Map makes it easy to traverse for smaller side content.
+Progression is hella fast.
/Coliseum is so much fun but a little short.
- Some Side content is boring and just fetch questy.
-Some battles are too easy!

Story:
+Kiryu is back
+Funny dialogue
+Great heart wrenching ending
-Middle falls flat due to its shortness, the stakes arent as high as other yakuza games.

Graphics:
+Some scenes look great and the game runs very well on PC and especially steam deck! (able to plug external 1080p monitor and still hit 40fps)
+Colours a vibrant and pop out the screen.
-Feels the same to all yakuza games since 6.

Taking place 4 years after Yakuza 6 and alongside Like a Dragon 7, this offers a story explaining Kiryu's disappearance and eventual role he plays in Like a Dragon 7. The story is enjoyable and does a great job of making me anticipate his crossroads with Kasuga Ichiban. 

Everything hits all time high notes of the series. The models and graphics are fantastic. The detail is extraordinary without feeling uncanny valley. Facial animations, skin and cloth detail, everything. The music fits and enhances scenes and fights as great music should. Some bangers are Deadly Struggle, Psycho's Anthem and Soul of the Ogre.

The fighting is as good as ever. Utilising Kiryu's usual Dragon of Dojima style being the powerhouse and a new Agent style, there's plenty of ways to switching things up and delivering a creative beatdown. Agent style had some fun gimmicks like gadgets and essentially being similar to the Rush style of the past, whenever you use a gadget (save for the Spider) it slows the combat to a halt.

It's weak point is content. Don't get me wrong, it has PLENTY of content. The usual fare like pub games and arcade games, gambling, etc return. Cabaret dates also come back. The absolute GEM of a game that is Pocket Racing makes it's return as well. Sidestories take the form of the Akame Network. But the game is half the usual length. It's on a comparably smaller map taking place in Sotenbori. I could easily clock in 40 hours in the beginning messing around with quests and games but the whole game took that long to finish.

The story in this game is really good, even if it is a bit short, the new characters are cool and the ending was incredibly sad.

The combat however... what were they thinking? This game is trying its hardest to be like LJ, and it fails in every single way. The launchers are very limited and inconsistent, and the air time of the juggle lasts for only 6 seconds.................. Why????? RGG also decided to remove enemy queuing, meaning that multiple enemies spam attacks while you're half a second into a combo, which is very infuriating and makes comboing in fights with multiple enemies basically impossible unless you spam a million Agent gadgets beforehand. Also the dodge in Agent is absolutely useless, it's pretty much the original Ishin's wildancer dodge.

I played Judgment and Yakuza 0 before this game and can definitely say that the combat feels much nicer and crispier. The only annoying thing is the ragdoll stun attacks that just force you to wait a few seconds to recover. The problem is so much worse with pistol enemies who just stun spam you. Also surprisingly there is no quick select of items like there was in Judgments. That just makes it more annoying to heal as you need to go through the menus every time.

In terms of story, it is engaging right from the start and I am glad that you do not need to play all the yakuza games to understand what is going. The only game I would say you need to play before this one is Yakuza Like a Dragon as the story would make a lot more sense if you do. One minor complaint I have about the game is that there are a few times where the story is locked behind progression in the open world. The grind is not too bad and it honestly never affected me as I was already doing the side objectives anyway but I still find this game design annoying.

The fact that this game is shorter than others in the series actually plays in its favour as it picks up much faster and the story is just overall lean. That is especially praiseworthy as these yakuza games tend to be a bit bloaty and consistently run about 8 hours too long. Here the story is to the point.

Overall a great game and a nice change of pace to have a brawler as a bridge between two huge 60+ hour turn based rpgs.",1705809688,1705809688,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The story is very interesting and good, especially the ending is very touching
- Some side missions have unique stories and surprises such as crossovers with characters from other games

Cons
- The story is little dragging in the middle

- You need to know some of the lore in the ""Like a Dragon"" universe

The story is quite short, however you will find yourself branching out:

There is a decent amount of variety content. Not too much to be overwhelming but not too little to seem thin, I think I prefer this kind of ""bitesize"" Yakuza as it motivated me to 100% it and complete the majority of everything in the game. Despite it being ""bitesize"", nothing felt half baked or rushed and I enjoyed everything I had to offer. (Except those shitty japanese card games smile)

As mentioned earlier, it is a love story for those who have played the 0-7 games and but mainly uses the context behind Yakuza 5, 6 and 7 to drive the story. I would 100% recommend anyone whos played the series from the start to give this a playthrough, even when 8 comes out.

As is the case with most Yakuza games, the world within the game doesn't follow its own rules. This makes following the story silly and frustrating. First your character is plowing through enemies as if they were cardboard. Next you'll watch a 5 minute movie about your character struggling with a piece of said cardboard. This is supposed to create tension and motivation for the story, but since the world already lost most its believability, it's hard to keep invested.

Next we have what's actually happening in the story. Well... not much really?! The main story is very simple and short. There are side missions that you mostly plow through, and as usual they don't have much story to them. They work as an excuse to beat up people but that's it.

The coliseum fights are somewhat fun, but there's only so much of those until you've seen enough. Maybe some more variety would keep things interesting?
 
The fight system also feels somewhat more limited and boring compared to previous titles. Things are mostly smooth but it's just very repetitive even with full abilities. With only two styles and quite clear use cases for them, fights start to quickly repeat the same pattern.

One of my surprising personal favorite features in previous titles was eating at the restaurants. It brought my mind back to Japan (where I've visited a couple of times), and I always got very hungry watching and listening to Kiryu eating. Unfortunately that feature has been basically removed, as you don't gain any experience from eating anymore and the eating animations aren't that delicious anymore.

It's not a bad game at all, but unlike Yakuza 0, I don't think I'll remember or miss what happened in this game after a few years. And hence, I'd only recommend this to people addicted to Kiryu beating up people.",1705194065,1705194065,False,2,1,0.448641389608383179,0,True,False,False

When a powerful Yakuza clan believes that Joryu’s true identity is actually the legendary Dragon of Dojima, Kazuma Kiryu (despite the fact that Joryu wears glasses, while Kiryu doesn’t wear glasses, and he’s definitely not the same guy wearing a terrible disguise), Joryu is drawn into a plan which could define the future of the Yakuza.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Writing is good, and contains the usual dramatic scenes, twists, and betrayals that the series is known for. This is also a story about how much someone will sacrifice to protect their family.

•	TMWEHN also connects to the later chapters of Ichiban Kasuga’s story in Like a Dragon, which means we already know how this part of the story ends, however we do learn more about Joryu’s role in those events.

•	I really like Joryu, so I hope we see him again as the main character in another game. There are also a few other interesting characters, including government agents and Yakuza members who want to use Joryu for their own agendas, and a young woman called Akame, who runs a network which takes requests to help homeless people.

•	Cutscenes are cinematic and have good graphical quality.

•	I played with the Japanese voice acting, which has good quality, but only the cutscenes are voiced, with in engine conversations during both the main quest and substories, being text only. Yakuza 6 was fully voiced (I can’t remember if this was also the case with Like a Dragon), so this is a backwards step.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Most of the action takes place in two main locations, Sotenbori (previously seen in Yakuza 0, 2 and 5), and an amusement park for the rich, known as the Castle.

•	Fight against gangs of Yakuza and other thugs in real time combat, using a combination of punches, kicks, and various melee weapons, while building up your heat meter to perform powerful finishing moves.

•	Joryu has a new “agent” fighting style which allows him to use various gadgets during combat. The spider can trap enemies in webs, but I didn’t find the others that useful, so I preferred to use the classic Yakuza style.

•	Boss fights are fun, mainly thanks to the responsiveness of Joryu’s dodge move allowing him to quickly evade their attacks, while also setting up opportunities for a powerful counter attack. I was actually able to win most fights through skill, instead of relying on drinking the drug store’s entire stock of toughness z’s to stay alive like in some of the older games.

•	Besides the main quest, there are various activities to keep you busy.

•	Akame Network involves stopping groups of thugs from beating up civilians, and simple fetch quests (mainly to buy food or medicine from shops). This is basic copy and pasted content similar to what Ubisoft fill their open world games with, but they do reward you with cash which can be used to buy ability upgrades.

•	Substories – the best one features a cameo appearance from a familiar character, but unfortunately most of them lack the wacky tone of the previous games, and can also feel a bit repetitive, for example three of the substories ask you to defeat gangs of thugs, but each gang involves the exact same sequence of 6 fights.

•	Fight in the Castle’s coliseum against single opponents or larger groups for huge cash rewards. Many of the substories allow you to recruit allies into Joryu’s clan, which can take part in team fights. However, I don’t like the time limits, especially at platinum level, where you have to fight 15-20 enemies who all have massive health bars. Winning is less about skill, and more about how much money you’ve spent upgrading your damage to KO enemies quickly.

•	When you want to take a break from the action, there’s also the usual wide selection of minigames, including darts, pool, golf, karaoke, sega arcade, pocket circuit racing, poker, blackjack, mahjong and shogi.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me just under 30 hours to complete the story and most substories and coliseum fights, which is a decent amount of content, but still shorter than most games in the series.

•	Controls worked great on my xbox 360 controller.

•	I didn’t have any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate.

•	I recommend using DLSS to clear up some distracting edge flickering, which can be particularly noticeable on Joryu’s glasses.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is a good game which existing fans of the series should enjoy. While the gameplay feels like just another Yakuza game, its definitely worth playing to continue the story. However I would advise waiting for a sale due to this being a shorter game.

As the story directly follows the events of Yakuza 6, this wouldn’t be a good place for new players to join the series. I would advise starting with Yakuza 0, or the Judgment spinoffs which have similar gameplay but a separate story.",1704931113,1704931113,True,19,5,0.637495040893554688,0,True,False,False

Missions aren't discovered like the previous ones where you would stumble upon it along the street, instead they're activated and then you search for it. 

Fight mechanics -
Only 2 fighting style the agent and  Dojima style. first the agent style is gimmicky its fun at first but pretty average at best.  The Dojima style is not great too, its the muscle strength attack style, which is a mix and match on preference.

Heat moves - I feel after 0 each version game has less and less heat moves, extra heat moves only activate while in rage mode, and not many after that anyways. So you are limited to seeing about 6 regularly and maybe the odd occasion 3 more that only happen on rare conditions. It makes the fights uninspiring and not really fun, more of a slog.  how can this be such a downgrade from 0.

Pros:
- The visuals are amazing. Character Models, Textures etc are high res

- The combat feels fun and every hit feels like it really has big impact on an enemy.

- Skill Upgrades offer meaningful improvements and not just small boosts. After my first two DMG upgrades i could really feel the difference in how fast enemies got knocked out!

- the Story was incredibly good and the ending a good way to lead into the next main game!

Cons:
- The new Agent style felt like it was TOO gimmicky. At the end i've never really used it whatsoever because the Yakuza style just offered everything i wanted.

- having real life scenes for the cabaret was awkward and a bad decision.

- the Request System that works kind off like the one for the Judgment Series ultimately offered too little variation. There were like 4 quests that offered an interesting storyline while the rest was just a pretext to have some random small gangs show up that you needed to beat up enough times while running through all of Sotenbori..

- For all the hype around this feature i just didn't like the Coliseum at all... For example why would i want to cripple myself playing other characters that barely have any good combo? And those rumble fights were just pure chaos. I didn't decide to play through this completely at the end.


Overall i still recommend it for any Like a Dragon fan out there, though, since it explains well what was going on between Y6 and Y7!

There are plenty of moments where this game nods to older entries and I can't imagine how you'll experience it if you're in the dark by starting with this game.
I know RGG is pushing the ""LaD"" title on us, but I'mma stick to Yakuza because I'm stubborn.

With that said, overall, I'd recommend this game.
While this is a short Yakuza game - by Yakuza's standards at least - it's still filled with the usual stuff you'd expect from Yakuza. It's got the plot, characters, events and side stuff + explanations for all that and it all comes together pretty darn well. 
As far as gameplay goes, the latest entry for Kiryu and his combat in the Dragon Engine is Kiwami 2 which I didn't really enjoy. Gaiden has improved on this quite a bit, but it feels worse than Lost Judgement; it's still good though. 

If I have a complaint, it would be that this game is HUGE in terms of download size - almost 90 gigs - but for the wrong reason; namely the cabaret girls are all high quality videos which are 20 sodding gigs all by themselves. I didn't ask for this, so kudos to those who are desperate for it I guess.

I'm not a newcomer to the series by any means. Just checked my game time and it's at least 950+ hours in RGG studio games.

A very humble message to Sega before we begin. Fck you, greedy cunts. Why ? 

A) Intentionally locked Pre Orders for several developing/""poor"" countries and THEN proceeded to sell the game at release day, thus depriving fans those silly P/O bonuses
B) The most disgusting price tag across the series in terms Price:Content (Quality + Amount; we'll talk about it later) and the absence of adequate regional pricing. Ukraine, LATAM, MENA, India; you can check and compare prices here if curious:
https://steamdb.info/app/2375550/
I've bought Y:0-6 for full price. Every game. 7 and J games with a small discount. Can't anymore, because Sega decided to raise the price 2-3 times.
C) Sega's support didnt bother to answer a single ticket regarding locked Pre Orders, just marked them as ""Solved"" and closed.

If RGG had a say regarding pricing and pre orders, I, honestly, wish them the same.

If you wanna know a bit about my ""taste"" in these games, here's my Top 3 without specific order:

- Narrative-wise: Yakuza 0, LaD (7), Judgment
- Gameplay-wise  Yakuza 0, LaD (7), Lost Judgment

Frankly, whole game felt just like an advertising campaign for IW. With a price tag 50$.

What I disliked the most ? 

LaD Gaiden is a big DLC rather than a separate game. A huge fan service sinkhole which appeals to nostalgy of the fans.
Game surely looks and plays like a LaD title. It has the ""shell"" of the series, but I didn't feel the ""soul"" inside that shell. I wasn't hooked on the story. Guys, I loved babysitting at Y:3, Haruka's part at Y:5, but again, this game just didnt click with me.
I also have my doubts regarding writing. It didn't feel like Yokoyama wrote this story. Made some edits - maybe. I'm aware they develop multiple games at the same time and Gaiden was meant to be a small game. It seems like this project was given to junior team/employees.

Characters were okay. Voice acting is top notch as always.

They recorded 30-ish compositions for this one, but the other half of the music - the same tracks from previous games. I wanna stop here for a moment. Music has always been a very important part of narrative in LaD games for me. It dictates the mood and sets the atmosphere for the events we participate in. And RGG always wrote a new tracks for each game with small exceptions. These are Yakuza Kiwami re-made tracks from Y:1, alterations of Kiryu's and Majima's theme Receive You and maybe several more less repetitive examples. Never bothered RGG reused assets from time to time but this title is the one big half assed repeat.

Chapter 2 (was it ?), when Kiryu arrived to the Castle was a cringe fest as well as amount of Ryuji Goda (at this point I dont even know what to call it) references. From my point of view, RGG didn't wanna put more original content in this game or I dunno. What I want to say is that for the first time I'm genuinely scared for LaD series future. This title is theirs first ""new"" project (Ishin is a remake) after Nagoshi left the studio.
I'm freaking out not because it's something huge. On the opposite. It's a sum of many red flags.

One guy said that nowadays big companies mostly ride on the success on some old titles and almost never develop something new. This is my exact thoughts regarding Gaiden. Too many Y:2 stuff.

Last nail in coffin was the last unlockable Coliseum fight - Minamida Grand
Prix. I guess many reckon it was cool, but combining everything said previously - I think not. You will face robots that mimic movesets of all final bosses from Yakuza 6 to 1 in reverse with their music themes. I already had a bad taste in my mouth and now just remember the emotions every previous title and corresponding battle and the character brought me, only to see a metal piece of crap in front of me - a reminder that the devs are slacking off. This one really controversial for me. On the one hand it would've been fun idea if not all previous fan service in one small game, but on the other, yeah, that and text above.
They also tried to ride on success of previous banger tracks like Pledge of Demon (0) and Theory of Beauty (6). Check tracks Hellish Octagon and Psycho's Anthem and tell me you dont hear the ""resemblance"".

Whats new ?

Well, 1 new Combat Style; 0.5 new mini game (It's called Hell Team rumble and since it's still in Coliseum...see for yourself) + ""biggest"" but idk if best addition - Akame Network. Shortly, Substories were mostly converted into requests in here plus you have a lot of mini requests and brawls across Sotenbori. Complete them, earn Cash and Akame points to upgrade your skills, buy new gear. Substories mostly bland and boring in Gaiden. Ai app was okay, Judgment crossover too. At least half of them - eliminating three gangs. 
First Summer Uika's play as Akame was good. Fun fact, her surname is Dojima :D
The rest is familiar to the fans. Same mini games, same bullies on the streets, eateries, shops, lockers.
There are very few Dynamic Intros we all love, and maybe one was good.

No NG+, no Legendary difficulty. Fifty Bucks. FmL....


LaD 5, 6, Gaiden SPOILERS AHEAD !


I wanted to talk regarding specific topic, which caused a lot of confusion for me. Idk why I include this to be honest.

[spoiler]One of the most complex moments in LaD games is ""Why Kiryu had to fake his own death ?"". The answer for this question is behind the stories of LaD 3, 5, 6 and maybe even more. I must admit I've spent a good hour, trying to remember the events that led to this, plus too look at several discussions. These couple days I played Gaiden and fake death plot twist from 6 felt like unnecesarry stretch. But the orphanage, kids, Haruka's statement in 5, her kidnapping in 6 and many other events just show that sooner or later Kiryu's enemies realize they cant defeat him head on and they pressure his family and friends to get to him. And while he's dead, there's no reason for criminal scum to involve those.
But on the other hand, Daidoji's demands regarding this secret are pure evil, forcing Kiryu to accept the cards that will lead to discovery of his secret sooner or later, just to shorten the leash around his neck.
Me and I'm sure a lot of you hate Daidoji and would prefer Yakuza underworld any other day, but it's a Criminal Drama after all. We have, what we have.[/spoiler]



Since we talked about the story, my favorite part, hands down - Kiryu watching recording on tablet in Finale. That was strong, that was good, that's what we love in LaD games. Strong emotions. But again, almost everything else - meh.


Had no issues with Performance. Rtx 2060, Ryzen 3700x, 32GB Ram. 1080p high settings, DLAA, no DLSS - 80-90 FPS.

It was the first time, when I considered viewing cutscenes on YouTube and maybe reading a bit after, instead of buying the game. And my guts told me to do so. But constant possibility of a rocket coming into my window (greetings from Ukraine) told me ""You only live once and life is too short"" so I bought it. Which I, honestly, regret.

If you're on the fence regarding this game - don't buy it until -75%. Not worth it. Not buying similar project in future.

Platinum is very easy.

And regarding future of LaD series and my concerns, I, honestly, hope I'm wrong and everything will be super great, in terms oа quality. Less than 3 weeks until Infinite Wealth release. Oh, and one more f u for Sega - New Game Plus in IW locked behind a paywall in a Master Vacation Bundle, available as a part of Deluxe edition. Pre Orders locked again for several countries.

Yakuza style and Agent style were fun, even if I preferred Yakuza style more than Agent when I was in combat. Speaking of combat, it's fun and plays similarily to the newer Kiwami games. I found myself not really using the Agent gadgets besides Spider (the blue grappling wire) and Serpent (jet boots).

The mini games and side stories were good too. Overall a great experience.

The Infinite Wealth demo really really really gives me great vibes about the upcoming game. I can't wait for the 25th.

This leaves me very hopeful for 8 especially after 7 didn't run especially well on my PC.

Beyond the performance, the gameplay was another area that blindsided me. Besides 7, the only other Yakuza game I have played was 0 and I really didn't jive with the combat; it didn't click and I really didn't find it fun. But Gaiden is fantastic and so smooth, it really just feels super slick to play. I think I can attribute that to the increase in tools you have as Kiryu in his Agent style; that and the fact that boss fights are super responsive.

By and far the best part was the story as is typically king in my Yakuza experiences so far. The only lull was the forced Akame Network level and Coliseum Rank; I don't like forced side content especially when it messes with pacing. Everything outside of that was fantastic and tells a really great story of what Kiryu has been up to. It really is a testament to how much love RGG puts into this series with how much time and effort they are willing to give to this side story. A worthy note; the end of the game has a real series standout moment that had me crying like a baby; just another example of how well written this series is.

This one feels like an extended DLC that should've been part of another game rather than sold as it's own thing. I'm a few minutes into the demo for Infinite Wealth and already enjoying it more than I did the last half of Gaiden. I was just getting so frustrated at watching Kiryu/Joryu whiffing all his attacks instead of hitting anyone laying defenseless on the ground and then getting sucker punched by those enemies the second they stand back up. The more I played the game, the more the flaws in the combat system started to reveal themselves. Outside of using some of your Heat Gauge when a button prompt appears next to an enemy on the ground, most of your attacks and moves are going to whiff right over top of them. I really don't understand how it's so hard for Kiryu and all his allies to hit enemies lying on the ground and by the final chapter, I just wanted to finish the game already so I could check out the demo.

The story in this feels short and rushed. It's over in 5 chapters and most of the 5th chapter is an hour or so of consecutive fights and cutscenes. Plus it all takes place in one tiny map with no good means to avoid enemies when simply walking around given they spawn at almost every intersection and there's not enough space on the streets to run around and avoid them. I don't really play these games for their side mini games as much as I checked them out for the story and combat. This is only the third one I've played beside the turn based one and the samurai one. I liked both of those more than this one and the best thing I can say for this one is it made me wanna finish both of them too and check out the demo for the next one.

Don't get me wrong, the combat can be a lot of fun when things are flowing right, but then you or an ally will knock an enemy to the ground and then you just stand there throwing attacks that go right over their heads. The agent gadgets as well. Maybe I should've been leaning on Yakuza mode throughout the game more, but the agent gadgets were honestly a lot of fun throughout the whole game. The only thing that sucked about them is what sucks about the combat as a whole-defenseless enemies on the ground are so hard to hit and knock out.

If you can get this on a sale for like $20-40, I could see myself recommending people check it out cause it does have 20-40 hours of content here, but I imagine you might get frustrated with the combat halfway thru like I did and I had/have the Infinite Wealth demo to look forward to now that I've pushed thru to the end-without that motivation, I probably would've abandoned the game 10 or so hours ago and gone on to play something else.

I know some people say/think you have to know all the lore from previous games to appreciate the story in this one, but I don't think you do. I liked the story as much in this as I have in the other 2 even if I haven't finished either of them yet. Extra context can always be filled in later if I wanna play more of the older games. Dropping the game or at least considering it had nothing to do with the story in this game and everything to do with getting tired of the combat by that point. I think if there were mechanics in the game for your character and his allies to determine an enemy was lying on the ground and adjust their attacks and gadgets accordingly, it would've ended up being a lot more fun throughout and I might have been willing to keep working my way thru the Colosseum fights after beating the game. As it stands, though-even the combat in this feels rushed and not fully fleshed out-like it's meant to be part of a big expansion DLC that instead became it's own ""full"" game. I went into it pretty excited and am leaving slightly disappointed but with the hope that they could keep refining it and make it better at some point-although I don't know how they would do that.",1704282634,1704282634,False,2,1,0.496503472328186035,0,True,False,False

True to the Dragon of Dojima's fighting style, the game maintains the traditional Yakuza combat style of a 'beat em' up.'

Combat is fine, but Lost Judgement's is still superior.

Definitely conscious of the character. This game does justice to Kazuma Kiryu's past, ideals, burdens and history.
It does an excellent job at feeling as a perfect focus for him, with its occasional callbacks to past games, with it not being too little, but not too much either as not to feel like complete fan service rather than a well founded game. So yeah, if you want a game, even if short (5 chapters in lenght only) that gives a gives a more proper send off to Kiryu, this is a entry you shouldn't skip by any means. (Why would you want to skip it, anyways?) 
Kiryu has much more attitude than in many previous games, too. 
The ending made me drop tears of both sadness and joy.

Gameplay: 
The gameplay is, to put it simple, fun. 
Agent, the new fighting style, is presented as a more tactical one, being able to overwhelm hordes of enemies. However, as you progress through the game, it becomes less than that to become more of a quick, easy way around finishing fights. And no, it's not because the character being bound to get stronger as the game progresses, but rather than it not being as tactical as presented, but more of a silly mix up of gadgets that justify the name of the fighting style, some of which are of quick and of more slow use, but all of them being able to finish the battle in a minute, or 8 seconds in most cases. It doesn't mean it's not fun, because it's the complete opposite, but it's definitely not a before and an after when it comes to battles styles in the series either. 
Kiryu's signature Yakuza fighting style (now being the fighting style that you unlock as you progress a little further into the story) has some minimal changes that might not be for the convenience of the player too, like it being powerful at the price of being slow, and the beloved ¨finishing hold¨ move being stuck behind Heat Mode. Even so, this is the most fun it has been playing with Kiryu in the Dragon Engine so far, to say the least.

Duration and side stuff: 
The main story is around 12 hours, but that was no relevant for me because of how the side content of the game does a wonderful job at stretching the game to around 30 hours. 
Side missions. Customizable clothes. Minigames. Immersive hostesses. Pocket Circuit Races. Colisseum fights and the entirety of the Castle. Even being able to play as any of the characters you recruit to join your side at the colisseum.
All of that felt like a fitting part of the main story as I went through it. 
What I'm trying to say, if you want the game to be longer and more enjoyable than what only 5 chapters sound like for a Like a Dragon/Yakuza game, all you need to go is to go out of your way and have fun. I cleared all of the colisseum fights with a S Grade and reached rank 30 in the Akame missions, and it was like having a buffet served in front of me that left me with a smile and conversations topics for the future.

DLC: Owning the Legendary Fighter Pack DLC is fun, but definitely not a must to overcome the colisseum. In case you think it will be defining to your enjoyement of the game if you don't own it because of how the characters there are some of the glorified cameos of the series. (Looking at Majima still spinning as the fight ends is fun, though).

Conclusion: Akame is very cute. Having the game's duration in mind might help you savor and enjoy the game and its events more. Buy the game on sale.",1704167942,1704167942,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

[h1] The Combat [/h1]

Yakuza Gaiden's combat is more akin to Judgement's combat rather than Lost Judgement. Like Judgement, Kiryu has 2 styles now, being Agent Style (More Defensive, and Gimmick related), and DOD/Yakzua Style, also sadly Kiryu does not have the power of Tekken to Juggle. Extreme heat is also back, and it increases the amount of Agent Style's Gadgets Kiryu can use; while for DOD/Yakuza Style, it enhances the physical capabilities of it (More damage, and a new light attack combo after the 6th? light attack where Kiryu uses that one heat action but it isn't now). 

[h3] Agent Style [/h3]

Agent Style has 4 gadgets being a long-range web slinger (Spider), a drone (Hornet), a explosive cigar (Firefly), and a pair of thrusters for the shoes (Serpent). Spider, Hornet, and Firefly's upgrades just increases the number Kiryu can use it, while Serpent's upgrades just increase the duration of the boots. The gadgets are mostly just crowd control gizmos, with Hornet being a distraction for bosses, or enemies. Agent Style's normal attacks are rather lackluster, but Kiryu can dish out more than 7 light attacks. Personally Agent Style is more used for defensive or crowd control situations, but its still a decent style.

[h3] DOD/Yakuza Style [/h3]

The Dragon of Dojima style (Yakuza 6 version) is back, and its rather good. There is really nothing to say about this style other than the addition of having an ability to have Triple Finishers (One of the finishers is the Famous Kick), and that the style is rather pretty great.

[h1] The Prologue/Story (Spoiler-Free) [/h1]

The game's story right off of Yakuza 6, and also runs parallels with Yakuza 7. At the start, Kiryu makes a deal with the Daidoji. Under this deal Kiryu is ""Dead"", and works with the Daidoji. A new life outside the Yakuza underworld, and a new life under the Daidoji. Daidoji is an organization of elite skilled agents who do contracts from certain other organizations (like the CIA). I would classify the Daidoji faction as a shadow organization since no one really knows it, and the HQ is a temple. Kiryu lives under the new name of Joryu, and is trained in martial arts (Agent Style), and was given gadgets by other Daidoji affiliates. One of Joryu's major tasks refers him to a dockyard where Joryu waits for a truck of gold; however, this turns out to be a trap. Soon Joryu goes to Yokohama (Literally only appears in one chapter), where Joryu investigates the Omi which is also a trap and Joryu's handler, Hanwwa (I don't know how to spell his name; however, its something like that), is kidnapped by two Omi Members Tsueno, and Shishido. The Daidoji does not care about a single member of their team getting kidnapped; however, Joryu cares about him, and the Daidoji does not allow him to leave. Soon Joryu discovers the truth of the kidnapping, and the plot of the Watase Family.

[h3] Story Spoilers [/h3]

To be written... probably trust me.

[h1] The Maps [/h1]

[h3] Yokohama [/h3]

Most of Yokohama is locked out, and its literally only available for the first chapter, and premium adventure. It has nothing to note apart from a reference to Yakuza 7 when Namba found Ichiban.

[h3] Sotenbori [/h3]

Sotenbori is the main map of LAD:Gaiden, and it added back the park that was removed from Sotenbori in Yakuza Kiwami 2. The map is still the same Sotenbori, apart from the removal of certain businesses, and the addition of others.Pocket Circuit Race returns within Sotenbori; however, Kiryu's favorite buddy, Pocket Circuit Fighter, is sadly not present.

[h3] The ""Castle"" [/h3]

The Castle is the ""second"" map you have access to throughout the game (Yokohama is only available for one chapter and then you're locked out lol). There are two main attractions within the Castle, and those are the gambling hall/Casino, and the coliseum. Not much people gamble within the Yakuza fan base, and instead they just play mahj-, so the coliseum is just the main attraction. 

[h1] Misc. [/h1]

Anything else notable? Yes.

[list]
[*] [b] Dynamic Intros [/b], There are like 3 Dynamic Intros in the game. 4 if you count the Darts minigame where you challenge your handler since that has a unique intro.
[*] [b] Return of Billiards/Pool [/b], I have no comment on this, its fine.
[*] [b] No Kamurocho [/b], Makes sense, Kiryu does not want to return to the dreaded city to have another shirtless fight at the top of the millennium tower.
[*] [b] Amon [/b], New Amon fights Joryu. His moveset is just Classic DOD, and agent gadgets with Yakuza 7's Amon Theme. Nothing really interesting compared to other Amons.
[*] [b] Karaoke [/b], Baka Mitai is back, and the picture is Pocket Circuit Fighter again! Kiryu mourns more about PCF than Nishiki, or Yumi.
[*] [b] No New Game + [/b], WHY RGG.
[*] [b] 100% [/b], probably the only yakuza game that people can 100% easily.
[/list]

Like a Dragon Gaiden is a rather good game; however, Yakuza Gaiden is a half of a game, and because of that it is rather short. The Combat follows judgement rather than Lost Judgement, which means no juggling or attack cancelling. The Story is very interesting (Not on any of the Judgement series story's level though), and I can't wait for LAD:IW to come out and continue Kiryu's story in Hawaii. Overall this game is okay, will I recommend it? Eh kind of if you want to see Kiryu's story in Yakuza 7.",1699765083,1703905743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the return to the traditional Yakuza combat; I didn't mind 8's turn-based combat as much as some die-hard fans but it was definitely a slog at times. It definitely fits the more standard Yakuza theme of ""Kiryu keeps punching things until the world is as it should be"" that this game has.

My only complaint is that there is a specific fight that overlaps in this and 8 ([spoiler]The fight between Kiryu and Ichiban[/spoiler]) that I would have love to have played from Kiryu's perspective, but that was just shown in flashback form at the end. I was really looking forward to it, and was bummed it wasn't there. Not a huge deal though, as the rest of the game is fantastic.

One thing that I liked / disliked was the Akame requests system. I do like that it was really easy to find and complete all the substories without wandering around looking for the triggers or relying on a guide, but it also felt less ""Yakuza-y"", in that there wasn't an equivalent of, for example, randomly getting roped into a Michael Jackson music video. It certainly streamlined things though.

Loved all the mini-games. 

- Karaoke (really fun! wish we could invite more than just the 1 person though ) 
- Pocket Circuit (yes its back! ) 
- Arena matches (This is where u make money and also is part of a side story ) 
- Casino's
- Cabaret club's (sadly only visiting and no more managing )

This is with Kiryu so its Action based game, so a brawler style combat. I personally enjoy this a lot. I do feel like having 20 -30 people to go up against to be a tad annoying, its just a cluster Fuck of things happening and most of the time i dont even know whats going on (Its the same when i do hell mode in the arena )

Kiryu has a new fighting style, which is enjoyable, but i personally sticked more to his dragon style fighting. 

The main story is incredible, some twists and turns here and there. The main villain and last fight are spectacularly made. 

U get to see some of the old gang, sadly u can't really do anything with them since of the plot. 

All in all. If u enjoyed all the Yakuza games and played Like a Dragon, this one is a great addition.

I finished the game is about 35-40 hours with a bit of grinding. It can be done faster, if u just follow the main plot. (lets be real though, the mini-games wont let you ^^ )

As a companion to Yakuza 7, it provides a wonderful feeling of familiarity, and as a standalone entry in the franchise, it stands tall among the better entries in the series.

By nature, Gaiden is a much shorter game than 7 or either of the Judgment games - it's designed as a side-story, returning to Kiryu to fill in the gaps in his narrative between his exit in Yakuza 6 and his small side-role in Yakuza 7. Despite clearly being a shorter narrative, though, I found that it felt plenty meaty, moreso than several of the pre-5 entries in the series. I think a big part of this is that its story is split across just five chapters, making each of those chapters quite long compared to how these games are usually structured. The end result is that the narrative has very little downtime, with only a few periods where the story gives you the time to poke around and do whatever you want for a little while. The story is typically split between serious, heavily-written drama and absurdity, centering Kiryu's struggle to continue on in a life that, in his perception, no longer has meaning, and this narrative thread carries him through to where he seems to end up in Infinite Wealth. It's well-written and feels like it does Kiryu much more justice than 6 did, while setting him up for a potentially perfect true departure from the franchise with the next game.

The combat is not quite peak Dragon Engine combat - Yakuza Style still feels weird and retread-y even with the tweaks to combat borrowed from the Judgment games, but Agent Style is an absolute revelation and completely justifies the weird narrative framework of the Daidoji faction. Seeing Kiryu shoot out Spider-Man webs and whip people around relentlessly, zip around on rocket boots, summon literally fifty drones to irritate every enemy in sight, and blow people up with explosive cigarettes is both hysterical and deeply satisfying. The group/1v1 split in the styles is still clear, with Agent ideal for clearing out large groups of enemies and Yakuza best suited to one-on-one showdowns, but it often felt like a necessity to switch to Yakuza rather than a choice I was glad to make. On the whole, though, it's still modern Yakuza combat, and it still just feels great.

On the whole, Gaiden is another worthy entry in the Yakuza franchise, far more essential than its side-story nature suggests. As a brawler-style palate cleanser between the turn-based 7 and 8, it's extremely fun, and it provides a great mix of connective tissue between the games and standalone entertainment and intrigue.

Gaiden's the cherry, and it's deserving of sitting atop the cake.

-Coliseum is the best it's ever been, tho more ""cosplayers"" of famous characters would have been appreciated...not including the legendary fighter dlc which honestly should be a premium adventure bonus

Loved the gameplay and combat, especially since I recently got into fighting games (mwah, Mortal Kombat) the juggle system was a chef's kiss. I know Lost Judgment was the first to introduce it but that's not the point. Although I will admit, I did grind all of the upgrades before half of the story (my bad, [spoiler]Shishido[/spoiler]), it kinda ruined the game but was still fun nonetheless.

This game feels like they tried to make a better conclusion to Kiryus story then yakuza 6 as well as kinda leading into his story in 8 (Ill mention the ""kinda"" in the spoiler part). Gameplay is solid as usual and the minigames are just as strong as before. 

The Agent style as a fighting style is the fast style of this game {most comparable to Crane in the Judgements), but with a more defensive profile (kinda like Snake from LJ but in role only) and has gadgets to mix it up and make groups easier to fight. Agent styles gadgets are sorta disappointing overall, since Id usually use spider gadget for most groups and Seprent boots for heat build on the street, for the other gadgets, I barely used drones other then early games and never used Firefly other then for the extreme heat move with it. Overall great style but the gadgets feel sorta lack luster.

The Yakuza Style is Kiryus style from Y6/ YK2, but tweaked a bit and has a better game feel then those games since it has less early Dragon Engine jank. The damage output for this style is insane and makes Agent feel lacking damage wise. Alot of moves came over but some got removed or tweaked so it doesnt intrude on Agents group handling niche, most of it is fine but some changes I dont necessary get, like the grab finishers being stuck to extreme heat when theres better options in extreme heat for Yakuza style for groups (or you just switch to Agent for groups). Yakuza style is the boss killer style of this game and due to its damage output makes fights go faster then Id wish (played through this game on Professional), probably just a personal thing and it doesnt make coliseum any easier though. Yakuza style was my go to for this game and felt great the entire time.

Coliseum is the main minigame with a quote on quote storyline connected to it (same sort of the story of there being 4 kings as main minigames after 0), and within the story you have to play in the coliseum. This allows some fleshing out of the minigame, primarily with alternative characters to play as that were not playable before and those characters being put into group battles. Unfortunately even a half fully upgraded Kiryu will be able to handle more then the other characters (except the fucking chicken man, hes pretty good only because of his special move), maybe I just didnt level them up enough though. For the group battles, they are fairly alright, with so many guys helping out its really hard to see what your buddies are doing except the healers because they have a huge aoe heal visible.

Into the spoiler section because I dont want story spoilers up at the top of the review: [spoiler]As per usual the story is solid for an RGG game, it sorta gains the same bonus that the Kaito Files has for being only 5 chapters long, since some of the games like 7 or LJ felt like they dragged in some sections. Kiryus arch in this game is solid and does indeed confirm that he will never be free from getting thrown into situations he doesnt want to be part of. [/spoiler] The ending stuff: [spoiler] Dont want to say much other then it ending at the dissolving of the omi is fine but when this game got announced I assumed it went until the beginning of 8, but instead they sorta skim after the omi dissolving. Also I dont remember Yumi mentioning wanting to go to Hawaii but I havent played K1 in awhile, I presume from trailers of 8 they will explain alot of, what is currently, off screen interactions/ relationships with past characters or will expand on them [/spoiler]

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is a spin off game which details the story of Kiryu Kazuma more or less during the events of Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon. 

First and foremost, I remember I was pretty annoyed when this game was announced as I remember (perhaps incorrectly) reading somewhere that the writers were done with Kiryu's story and that Kasuga Ichiban would be the new protagonist going forward and that turn based combat would be how the games would proceed. As someone who fell completely in love with Y7 I remember getting frustrated at the idea of going back to beat 'em up. But quite frankly I was just wrong in my entirety. 

LAD:G plays like all the Yakuza games before Y7, it is a beat em up but the story itself is significantly shorter than what we're used to from a Yakuza game, if you're like me and like to do a lot of side content (not to 100% completion, just messing about a bit) and doing the main story, you're probably talking about 25-30 hours for a standard playthrough, still a lot, but less than what we're used to. Much like every Yakuza game, the story is compelling and it's very easy to get invested in.

Gameplay is similar to Yakuza Kiwami 2, feels great, punches and kicks are heavy, overall very satisfying. Although I'd say one of the best improvements is the seamless blend of running around then transitioning into combat. No more little ""Crack knuckles"" mini cinematic, no more money counting up at the end, it's literally just run around > Guy wants to fight > You fight him > Money added. There is no downtown between any of the random encounters in the game, which is a huge improvement as I'm sure a lot of us have been frustrated at times having to do random encounters in previous games one after another; this feature really saves a lot of time.

Has everything that hallmarks at Yakuza game, daft little mini games, a bunch of substories, bigger sidewquests that hold their own weight alongside the main story, it's all here.

Overall I can definitely say that my initial opinion on this game being released was wrong and I should have had more faith in the Development Studio and the Writers, I guess I just wanted more Ichiban that I forgot about just how good it was to be Kiryu again. If you're looking for a short quick beat 'em up, or something just to tide over that Yakuza desire until Infinite Wealth comes out, this is the game to play. 8/10.",1703487508,1703487508,True,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The combat uses the styles mechanic from 0, 1 and 2, which in my opinion is a more fun and dynamic feature than the single combat style we have (for Kiryu at least) in Y3-6. There are two very distinct styles and both of them feel satisfying and fun to use.

Let me state up front that, despite what Sega's marketing claims, this is the absolute worst place to start the Yakuza franchise. Not because of its quality, but because this feels like the closing epilogue to a saga that spans close to two decades in releases. 

I've played Yakuza for going on twelve years at this point, ever since importing the Japanese release of Yakuza 5, then emulating the originals, and slowly working forward from there. It's given me great joy to see the new waves of popularity RGG have rightfully gotten in the wake of Yakuza 0's debut in the West, and it gives me even greater joy to see that rather than sit on their laurels, they've consistently pushed themselves to make each new release as great as it can be. 

Gaiden is a side game, and that nature is plenty evident in everything from its skeleton to its skin. It simply lacks the wide variety of content that the mainline franchise is well known for. It tries, and my hour count- I hope- serves as sufficient evidence to show you'll get plenty of bang for your buck, but I would strongly encourage you to temper your expectations somewhat before diving in, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised as a result. 

I don't want to speak overlong on the story, because I consider it Gaiden's greatest strength. If you've been following Kiryu through the course of his life, from 0 to 6, then this absolutely *is not* something you want to sit out. Speaking personally, it's the sweetest kind of pain seeing what he goes through in Gaiden. It's the sappy, Valjean-esque sort of drama you've come to expect from Yakuza, but it hits home all the more simply because it's Kiryu. To see an immovable force of nature show the scars and strain behind his stoicism wasn't only deeply moving, it was heart-wrenching. 

Because of Gaiden, because of the momentum RGG have been picking up with Yakuza 7 and Lost Judgment, I am wholeheartedly certain that Yakuza 8 will be their crowning masterpiece, and a game that'll leave me utterly broken with tears.

2)Play as the chicken man for any Colosseum match's you're struggling with, most people struggle hard with the third King when playing as Kiryu.

Kiryu is back with another engaging story that you never want to put down... Taking place during the same time as Yakuza: Like a Dragon, it is highly recommended that you play that game first. You will be able to pick this up and play without too much missing if you haven't played the previous title, but things make even more sense if you have the hindsight of the last game. It is also very exciting to be able to draw similarities in the key story points. ""Oh, I remember that happening in LAD7!"" is something you will think a lot.

The game looks incredible and feels seamless to play. Running into enemies keeps you in the world and you're right back into it after fighting, no loading screen, no waiting. This was my only gripe with Like a Dragon 7, and it was solved. It's as funny and off-the-wall as Yakuza games are, with the focus on combat quality that the Like a Dragon section brings to the table. 

It is worth mentioning, though, the game is probably only ~15 hours. While that's a lot for a game nowadays, it's unusually short for an RGG game. I imagine this is the case as it is a ""catch-up"" storyline, so we learn what Kiryu has been up to just before Infinite Wealth. With the two games releasing so closely together, along with the rerelease of Ishin in an entirely new engine, it's no surprise the game is short. I just hope Infinite Wealth will be a longer game. 

There are still a ton of quests and minigame challenges I haven't completed, though.

Now, let's talk combat. Kiryu's new agent style proved to be a rule-setter and a ton of fun to experiment with especially the Serpent wire. They also brought back the classic Tiger Drop Yakuza style, too and its as great as it was in the other games. Although the combat was indeed good, I still think Lost Judgment had the better combat overall, But hey, considering this game was cooked up in just six months, the combat's pretty damn good.

And the story? Short and sweet, but man, it's great, especially the ending. Prepare for emotion and tears, especially if you've been tagging along with Kiryu on his journey. Seeing his vulnerable side hits you in the feels. The guy might be a dragon, but he's still human.

I beat it wishing there was more. It has a good, action-packed story, a few fun minigames, and the best (only) tournament mode from any RGG game since Yakuza Kiwami 2, though I personally found training clan members a bit too grindy to be engaging. Which is a shame, since about a third of the game's content revolves around said tournament mode, which requires you to have high-level clan members to progress through the side-story.
I would only buy this game at full price for the story or if you're a big RGG fan. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale, and save your money for LAD: Infinite Wealth.",1703205812,1703205812,True,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Like a Dragon Gaiden is unlike previous LAD games more of a side story like experience, but even then it's still a LAD game. With beautiful visuals, it still has the classic vibe and side stories/minigames but with a much more compact story. And man, what a story it was! Also my personal goty.


[b](My thoughts on the story)[/b] 
I'm going to keep this very short considering that the story isn't all that long either
so I'd rather want you people to experience it yourself. 
But man to me this was the game everyone (me included) needed
that weren't agreeing with the way Y6 ended and used some of its characters.
Overall the story is great man, lots of intense and crazy moments happening, with some fun stuff as well. 
But I am gonna tell you this, this game broke my soul man :')
This game also overtook 6 as my favorite Kiryu game. Yeah, it's that good!


[b](Gameplay)[/b] 
Gameplay is crazy, the fact that Kiryu has more than 1 style again and for the fact that we can JUGGLE as well in this game. You start with the new style Agent, it's the style that you acquire from the Daidoji, it is basically a mix of Yagami's Crane style with a more Agent like vibe I guess??
Either way it's more fast-paced compared to the second style as that is more for a brawler and street fight type way, the move style for agent is more of a martial arts tactical fighting style.
Both styles also have a color, for Agent being the color blue and for the other red. Agent style is also a great way to start juggles when going in heat mode. Overall, you're gonna get a lot of Judgment/Lost Judgment vibes when playing the game. But Agent style is not only fighting no, no, you have like 4 gadgets you can use, a spider-man like web/string that comes out of your watch to pull enemies to you or push them away, a cigaret that's basically a bomb. Freaking rocket boots, and drones that can chase enemies.
Agent style is crazy hahaha there is so much from it. And of course for the second style we have 
The Yakuza Style as the game names it (normally being dragon style but oh well). It is vastly improved from the versions of Y6 and Y:K2, being overall much smoother and fleshed out with some changes, new move sets and finishers, he can basically do his iconic kick pose as a finisher. But dude do you kick the shit out of enemies when upgrading it oh man enemies went flying hahahahah.
I do gotta say this in all honesty, this is I think is the only game where I haven't relied on heat moves as much compared to the other games, I was really mostly just fighting with juggles and charged attacks
so that did kinda surprise me a little. Overall the combat in this game great, although a combat speed could have been nicely added, It's good but not LJ level good as that one still takes the cake for best RGG combat let's say it's better than K2 and 6 and on par with JE combat considering that one also has 2 styles. 
However, one huge new thing has got to be the feature that you can actually personalize Kiryu. That's right full on character customization, I freaking love this feature in this game
and I really hope it doesn't just stay in Gaiden, but actually carries on to other games as well. 


[b](Substories and Minigames)[/b]
LAD Gaiden still has the side stuff like Substories and Minigames, as they will always be a core piece of these games. this time you have something called the Akame points, in order to get those Akame points you'll have to do Akame missions/substories, as in this game substories are actually a checklist that you do in order to gain more bonding with Akame, it's kind of unfortunate that it's not randomly like the previous games
but as for Kiryu being an Agent like person, it kinda makes sense that he is doing it this way, and either way the substories are still fun to do, especially for some! But you'll have to see it for your self.
Mini-games, oh man POCKET CIRCUIT IS ACTUALLY BACK, I love this minigame man, one of my favorite things to do in Y0 and K1, and I'm really glad they brought it back one more final time, aside from that another mini-game that returns to the Dragon Engine is Pool, yes that was missed as well for some odd reason and that is also still fun to play, one other new thing is that some point you'll unlock a hideout that has an actual Sega master system which is pretty nuts, has around 12 games in it, tho some you got to buy at like ebisu pawn something close like that.
Also, later in the game you'll unlock a new play environment called The Castle, there it has the casino/Japanese gamble games, a cabaret with LIVE ACTION performances yeah it's super weird honestly, and holy shit does it take so much space around 28 GB????? (0_0?). 
Outside of that you also got the place where you personalize Kiryu, The Boutique which has all kinds of clothing options.


[b](Enemies, Colosseum and Bosses)[/b]
Enemies are your typical street guys or yakuza like the previous games and not the unique types like in LAD7. However, they are very advanced like the enemies in the Judgment games, so when you have a low upgraded Kiryu, be tactical as to how you fight them because lots of them fight back hard. 
A returning feature to the game is The Colosseum, which also is featured in The Castle, but man is this the best version of the Colosseum we all know.... EVERY FIGHTER IS PLAYABLE, and no I'm serious every fighter in it is playable, if you preordered the game you get playable [i]Majima, Saejima and Daigo[/i] (or if you buy it separately as DLC). But holy shit actual playable Daigo is nuts, lots of the fighter have their own move sets alto some also have move sets from previous bosses and enemies, pay close attention, and you'll see it. The rest you'll have to see for yourself, as it's too much to say about it. 
Now, then, the other thing this game does great are the bosses. Every, and I mean every, boss in this game is just great. You do have some mini bosses, but they are also good. But the main bosses? Holy shit, very fun to fight to and to some degree quite challenging, also there is a returning feature that the enemies will use Mortal Reversals, as they were first introduced in LJ, Gaiden also has them for some of its enemies and all the bosses. Now I will stand on this with all my heart, this game has the best final boss fight in all LAD, yep there I said it! Overall just the final boss fight was peak LAD moment it has 3 action phases with the last one having a different OST.... Holy shit, I loved this boss fight.


[b](Soundtrack)[/b] 
The soundtrack is quite a take cause holy damn this shit good! What's surprising is that most of the composing was done by a lot of new people and by some returning composers
that did the OG Y1 and 2. The boss fights, fantastic osts, the battle themes for both styles are really great, long battle themes also great, personally the main theme Fading Away hits in every spot for me that's some tearjerker stuff right there if you just even read the lyrics. The third phase of the final boss really nails it for me man, I've been constantly listening to the soundtrack a lot! 
It really is still something that RGG studios does for every LAD game of theirs.
Having an absolute banger of a soundtrack!


That concludes my review for Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.
Even though it's shorter, this game was very much quality over quantity to me from the gameplay, the great story and characters, and even the side stuff.
I really hope we get more Gaiden games, maybe for other characters like Majima or Akiyama
there are tons of options! I also hope this is really not the last Kiryu Action game...
Cause if so, I'm really gonna miss it :'(

LaD Gaiden is the second swan song for Kiryu, and a beautiful one at that. Since it is solely focused on him, the game has the breathing room to reminisce on the earlier games, his past adventures, and ponder on the mistakes he's made along the way; through both the you get to glimpse into the human behind the brute facade, and laugh (often out loud!) with him at certain moments and callbacks to previous shenanigans that have now turned into franchise-defining memories.
Kiryu absolutely pulls this story through, and both voice actors manage to deliver an emotional impact at the end that demolishes any other RGG game in emotionally destroying me. Having spent over 230 collective hours across seven entries with this character, I couldn't think of a finer ending.
RGG is also clearly succeeding in stepping up their storytelling and game design with each iteration: the combat is fast, flashy and the most fun it has ever been, making me hold it in the same esteem as Lost Judgment and managing to get me to play through the coliseum, which I usually steer clear of; the boss battles are cinematic, fun and super long, and took me back all the way to Yakuza 0 and 2, which still have some of my favorite ones; Sotenbori is fresh and dense, accompanied by Akame, which turned out to be a fun and happy-go-lucky companion, and who offered great contrast to Kiryu. The only thing I would change is the skill upgrade system being tied to Akame Requests, which did not hinder the game for me, someone who is not invested in her or the substories Gaiden has to offer might feel put off and not enjoy the combat as much as a result.

I'm gonna be honest and say that at first I didn't expect much from this game. It seemed like recycled content with some Kiryu story that could have been part of the other games. But as more info got out and I learned more my interest got picked. Now I regard this among my favorites.

I think right now my ranking goes something like this: Y0, Y7, YK2, Gaiden, YK1, Y5, Y6, Y3, Y4.

In the end I feel that although shorter, this is a complete Yakuza package. Everything we've come to love and expect is here. Twisting heavy drama story, whacky side quests, great minigames, memorable characters, awkward content to explain to your loved ones, Japanese weirdness and so on. The difference is that the game does all this without any bloat.

I really liked how they portrayed Kiryu in this one and made him a bit more human. I also really enjoyed some of the new characters and how they got developed throughout the game. And I loved Akame! More Akame in the next games or we riot!

It rewards players who were invested with Kiryu's story with callbacks from previous entries and paves a way for Infinite Wealth. If you have only played Yakuza 7/LAD and want to know who this Kiryu fella is then this is an okay starting point but it is highly recommended that you start off with Yakuza 0 or Yakuza Kiwami (Yakuza 1 remake)

Combat feels better than Yakuza Kiwami 2 and is akin to that of the Judgement sub-series offering two Combat styles, those being Agent Style and Yakuza Style. Agent Style is a new style utilising gadgets to take out multiple enemies and helps with crowd control while the Yakuza Style is akin to that of previous entries and is better for 1v1 battles.
Upgrades are a mixture of Yakuza 0 and Yakuza 6 where you need Money and Akame Points to unlock new skills which is fine, the Coliseum is a great way to grind money while exploring the world of Sotenbori and The Castle nets you Akame points.

There are only 2 locales being Sotenbori and The Castle which is again fine, as both have great set-pieces and help the world feel more alive

The DLC gives you the Legendary fighter pack in which you are able to play as 3 legendary Yakuza in the Colosseum Only and also fight against them in Special Matches. Those being Goro Majima – The Mad Dog of Shimano, Taiga Saejima – The Slayer of Eighteen and Daigo Dojima – 6th Chairman of the Tojo Clan

My only gripes with this game is that there is no NG+, No Dragon of Dojima Outfit for Kiryu to wear + can't take off glasses and Staff Roll/Credits not being in the Replay Cut-scenes

LaD Gaiden, in a nutshell, is basically what happens in between the story of Yakuza 7 (LaD). I won't go into much details as to not spoil it but I am gonna say that this is a worth it buy. I will, however, NOT recommend this game as a starting point to the Yakuza games (as much as that one article said about it being so), I will only recommend this game after playing the entire series, from 0 until 7 to enjoy the story fully. 
REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU ARE PURCHASING ANY YAKUZA TITLE, ITS STORY FIRST THEN BEAT EM UP AND THE SHIT AND GIGGLES SECOND.
The graphics are fantastic even on Medium graphics (the graphics I played it on), there are loads of things that are brought and improved from the Dragon Engine they used for Lost Judgement, the combat feels amazing, loads of side content for you to enjoy (and not enjoy if you are planning to 100% this game), and much improvements from the previous series. There are some minor inconveniences like how everything costs money like in Yakuza 0 and the classic RGG Studios of reusing assets but they have never bothered me THAT much that I didn't want to play the game.
This game has literally made me, a grown ass man, cry in tears and its fucking worth it. So if you've played the entire series until 7, this is VERY much a worth it purchase.

I'd give this entry a 9/10, if it weren't for the grinding I had to do to upgrade some of skills and the Pocket Circuit Racing being RNG based, I would've rated it way higher. But the story was worth it just to get here.

At least try Yakuza 0 or 1 to see if you like them, as it is more of the same and should be much cheaper at this point.

For veterans to this series, there is a new fighting style that is unique and funny with how it interacts in this game.  The secret boss is also the easiest in the series. 

There are no new side games.  One unique twist though is the one-on-one cabaret scenes with the new girls are all live action.  That took some getting used to, and they do not have in-game models which is disappointing.  So no karaoke with them, or billards, or darts.  In the past, there would be substories involving all the cabaret girls, and that did not happen this time.  I hope that makes a return in the next game.

It's only 5 chapters long and all of the characters are rushed and uninteresting, all of the minigames are reused (Pocket Circuit, Arcade Games from LJ, etc.), and the soundtrack is oddly middling outside of a few tracks. 

Graphically it's better than 7 but continues the long running track of Dragon Engine games always looking worse than the last, with this games being noticeably uglier than Lost Judgment while also having way less effort put into the presentation, with very few prerendered cutscenes as well as a general lack of polish all around. 

The story is just not that good. Most of the new characters don't land that well save maybe Hanawa, Nishitani III is just a weird retcon of Nishitani being a lineage as apposed to a single guy which falls flat, Shishido would have been cool if he was in a full game and wasn't telegraphed as the big bad from moment 1 because of how short the game is, and every returning character is just their Yakuza 7 scenes save for Watase who apparently got stabbed before the speech (this literally does not matter at all idk why they did that).

New Karaoke song is good, and the scene at the end with the kids got me to tear up a bit, but that's only really because of the context from Yakuza 6 (also you never see Haruka wtf).

All in all this game simply did not need to exist and it sucks that this is Kiryu's last game now. Yakuza 6 wasn't a perfect game but it was a much better ending for him than this.

Combine that with the gadget-enhanced combat and you've got what would have been called a substantial sequel in the series seven years ago.

Cool new agent style and enchanced Dragon Engine DoD style(not as fun as original but still better then Yk2 and Y6 one). Arena and Clan Creator is peak in the series, in CC you can actually take part of the fight which is something that this minigame needed. In arena you can take control of your clan members which is huge, unfortunately some characters are disappointing because of limited moveset like Daigo for instance . Story is OK'ay, last two chapters are the best in Gaiden. You can also change Joryu's wardrobe, mix and match or cosplay as Takaya Kuroda. Minigames, we have some standart stuff, casino, darts, golf, pool(which is cursed, physics are all over the place), new karaoke songs Silent Night and modern version of Ichizu Samurai, slot car racing is back and cabaret club which personally I dislike and this one is the worst in the series, almost fell asleep and i felt burn out at the last two girls which reminded me of my Y5 Remastered burn out(took me 2 years to finish that game lol) they only did live cabaret club videos because deadline was chasing them. For the game made in 6 months I must say that RGG Studio did good, you can see some rough around the edges but it's good addition to the Taichi Suzuki saga(oh and I'm not meming about the name). 8/10 Pricing of this game is little to high.

Anybody who knows Kiryu knows that's Kiryu, my man has put every Yakuza in the hospital by this point and thinks he can fool people. The gameplay is amazing and I love using the gadgets of the Agent Style, plus whipping people around like your Spider-man is beautiful. The Cabaret section sucks ass and I want the old one back.

For a shorter title compared to RGG's other works, the game is still full of content that can very well take over 30 hours to complete. Side content like the Coliseum are obvious stand-outs, and there's a decent selection of substories to go through as well. Combat still feels fun to mess around with, and the soundtrack features a very different feel that other entries haven't had (in a good way). For me though, the story, while relatively short, was the obvious star of the game, featuring a great cast of characters and a deeply emotional ending that broke me more than any other Yakuza game. 

In all, Gaiden is another excellent entry in the franchise, and one that makes me very excited to see what's in store next for Yakuza fans. While I wouldn't recommend this title for newcomers, the payoff after playing all previous mainline titles is fantastic, and very much worth waiting for.",1700723597,1702535501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

   As a Like A Dragon entry, it's well paced and punches way above its weight with a very cohesive narrative that still has its classic mood swing charms, yet it avoids the messy plot webs of the PS3 era games that might make it too nauseating for less committed fans. Kiryu's characterization is even stronger than it was in the previous games, but it still finds time to explore and discuss the formerly-titular organisations that this franchise is actually about. 
   As a standalone game, it is one of the shiny gems of 2023 with a characteristically strong desire to make an enjoyable product and tell a compelling story. The downside i can see in playing this game as a person unfamiliar with the series, however, is that structurally, Gaiden is heavily reliant on callbacks and references to at least 4 previous titles, from characters that are mentioned to events that are retold, which can leave a new player with gaps in the understanding of the overall story. 
   The $50 price tag, though, might just be a bit too steep for a game with about half the playtime of a mainline title, especially considering that most of the secondary content is reused from previous titles.

An absolutely beautiful love letter to Kiryu and the ""Yakuza"" saga of Like a Dragon. While it seems Infinite Wealth will be our farewell to Kiryu, Gaiden feels like a heartfelt farewell to the games that introduced us to him.

The gameplay was a lot of fun. I'll admit, I definitely favored one style over the other, but even primarily using one style throughout most of the game, I still had a blast playing. As per usual, this game is chock full of minigames and side stories to invest your time in to, and they are absolutely worth it! Also in usual RGG fashion, the soundtrack was phenomenal. While being a game focused on Kiryu, it featured a cast of primarily new characters, and I loved them. Akame was an instant favorite for me. Shishido and Hanawa were strong favorites as well. But the story is where this game absolutely shines. It maintained continuity from the stories that came before, while also building up immense anticipation for the next game to come. The ending in particular was phenomenal.

This game was absolutely meant for the Yakuza fans who have been along for Kiryu's entire journey. If you're new to the series, this absolutely should not be your starting point.

As I am awaiting the release of [b]Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth[/b], to my surprise [b]Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio[/b] released [b]Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name[/b]. This takes place after the events of [b]Yakuza 6[/b] and during the events of the 7th game. This title uses the action beat-em-up gameplay that the previous games have done, rather than the turn-based RPG mechanics that were used in [b]Y7[/b].

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Fantastic story with many twists
[*]Very fun gameplay with a lot of abilities
[*]Fun upgrades and interesting gadgets
[*]Tons of side content to do
[*]Excellent soundtrack
[*]Beautiful graphics that look amazing
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The story is a bit on the shorter side
[*]Agent style is a little underwhelming
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
[b]Kazuma Kiryu[/b] is now putting his [b]Yakuza[/b] life behind him, assuming the name of [b]Joryu[/b] and effectively becoming a dead man to everyone he loves and the world. However, one night during a mission he was assigned to someone seems to know what actually happened to him and wants to bring him out of hiding. [b]Joryu[/b] must find out what is actually going on and take down whoever is trying to expose him but it also seems a lot more is going on than it seems.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111729471 
The only issue I had with the story in this game, is that it’s really short. I completed it in like 6-7 hours at best. The story for this game is honestly fantastic, it fills in some gaps that [b]Y7[/b] had and the characters are overall amazing. It will also showcase some events from [b]Y7[/b] as well as some of the characters making a cameo appearance. 

To top it all off, the ending to this game actually made me shed some tears which is one of the first and only games to do so.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay is very fun, and I enjoyed playing through the beat-em-based combat as always. This is also the first game where I played on professional difficulty, which was manageable for me. You have access to two fighting styles, [b]Agent[/b] and [b]Yakuza[/b], each having its own set of skills and abilities for [b]Joryu[/b] to utilize. [b]Agent[/b] style allows him to use the [b]Daidoji Factions’s[/b] specialized martial arts. It’s a fighting style that is very fast-paced, with fast punches and kicks. [b]Joryu[/b] can also use special gadgets in combat, including a grappling hook called the [b]Spider[/b], AI drones to home in on enemies called [b]Hornets[/b], Jet engines on his shoes called [b]Serpents[/b], and [b]Firefly[/b] - a bomb disguised as a cigarette.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111727742
Then there is the [b]Yakuza[/b] fighting style, which is more mixed with the [b]Brawler[/b] and [b]Dragon[/b] style used in the previous games. It now has triple finishers and a new red aura so your enemies can know you are a threat. All of his heat actions are back, from all the way back to the first [b]Yakuza[/b] game, with two new ones added to spice things up. Overall, the [b]Yakuza[/b] style is a slower fighting style and the one I used the most during combat, as it was my preferred choice.

There are also times in the game when enemies do a special attack that will do massive damage. [b]Joryu[/b] can counter these moves with a counterattack and deal some damage to the enemy while doing so. The [b]Heat Action Meter[/b] has also changed - if you take damage the [b]Heat Action Meter[/b] will no longer deplete, the only attacks that can make it deplete are ones that use electricity.

While in [b]Extreme Heat Mode[/b] any damage done to [b]Joryu[/b] will be done to the meter instead and will keep doing this until it’s depleted or shut off. There is also gear you can equip that will help you out in combat by providing state buffs.

To get upgrades in the game, you can do side content to get money and [b]Akame Points[/b]. The latter are given to you after you are done with a side quest. You can get stuff like new moves, health, attack damage, etc. There is a ton of side content to do and I did a bunch of it throughout my playthrough to make sure I got enough [b]Akame Points[/b] to get some upgrades. I never had an issue with getting enough [b]Akame Points[/b], though I did have an issue getting money as that is also used to get upgrades. However, there are ways to get money - it’s just that I ran out most of the time getting upgrades and buying healing items.

As mentioned before, The [b]Akame Network[/b] has a few side quests for you to complete that will earn you money and [b]Akame Points[/b]. There are also [b]Stroll and Patrol[/b] missions for you to complete that will give you the same rewards. This can raise your [b]Akame Rank[/b] and the higher it is, your rank will go up in the [b]Castle[/b], which is a secret area you can visit that has a colosseum for you to fight other people.

However, I do have one issue with the gameplay and that is with the [b]Agent[/b] style; it’s underwhelming. The issue comes with the fact that the [b]Yakuza[/b] style is better for taking out enemies as a whole. While the [b]Spider Gadget[/b] is useful for crowd control and there are upgrades to grab more enemies with it, that also has an issue. To use any of the gadgets you have to hold down the button. So, for example, if I want to use the [b]Spide Gadget[/b], I will have to hold the B button on my controller and this applies to the other ones as well. To get them out is a bit slow and you are kind of a sitting duck while doing so.

Except for the [b]Serpent[/b] gadget, that one makes you move and it seems to be quick to activate. I wish I could have used [b]Firefly[/b] more but besides the delay of holding X and the time it takes for the smoke to explode, it's not worth it as sometimes it will be out of range of enemies and can hurt you and your allies.

[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]
The graphics for the game are honestly beautiful with some of the scenes being simply breathtaking, all backed up with a fantastic soundtrack.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111728377
I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing, and the game ran fine for me. Although there were some drops in my frames a few times that may be due to the fact I need new PC parts, only time will tell if I can run the next game.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I had a ton of fun with [b]Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name[/b], but I need to mention that if you are someone who is starting out with the series, I'd avoid this game for now, as you won’t understand the story of this game all that well. Also, the game is only 6-7 hours long. There is a lot of side content but that only brings it up to about 20-40 hours in length. I’d wait for a sale before buying this game as 64.99 CDN is a lot of money if you only want to focus on the game's story.

edit: turns out the translation team either knowingly censored an entire part of the story where nishitani III sexually abuses shishido or mistakenly translated everyone with a kansai dialect as if they spoke with a kanto dialect leaving out critical differences in the dialects. meanwhile in the game's data there are alternate translations (possibly for the english dub) that downplay it even more and playing it off as if it were consensual. this kind of censorship is genuinely fucked up and not something i expected from a series that doesn't shy away from such themes and honestly i am even more disappointed with this game.

Most of my issues come from its combat being a downgrade from Lost Judgment. You can't really seamlessly switch styles as easily as LJ allowed you to do, it's better played similarly to the old games where you switch styles depending on what the situation demands. 

The enemies also have an obnoxious amount of super armor (cannot be stunned) so Agent style feels really bad if you try to use its combo strings, Yakuza style practically carries the entire combat until you get upgrades later on.

Other than the weirdly paced start of the game, the story hits it out of the park in hindsight for me. It might allow Kiryu to be phased out and allow Ichiban to finally flourish after Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The final boss is basically Kiryu beating up the representation of most of the struggles he had to face in the series.

And in situations like with this game, I’m not sure if there was the point. Not that I disliked Like a Dragon Gaiden, quite the opposite, but it does feel almost unnecessary at points…

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is a new entry in the long running series of titles that erased their old international name (which was Yakuza), but remained mainly open world action adventure titles with beat ’em up combat and cinematic stories. This entry, as the title itself says, is a side story that is set during the events of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, but despite the short visit to Isezaki Ijincho (the main setting of that game), most of the events happen in the classic Sotenbori that was originally seen in Yakuza 2.

At this point I usually write that the “open world” section is not big but is otherwise dense with stories, but it isn’t exactly the case in this game. It’s not fully embracing a typical open world onslaught of icons pointing to busywork tasks, but for whatever reason the substories do go in this direction this time around. Not that there are no longer more deep side stories for you to explore, but most of the optional content this time around is far closer to how substories were in the earliest entries, with simple “bring me X item” tasks. While the longer more involved substories rarely do anything interesting even when their premise is good. There’s one wonderful crossover exception, but apart from it, the substories are pretty weak in this one.

Same goes for the main story, really. You do get to learn more about some secret agent-like society that was first hinted upon in Yakuza 6 and some of the characters shown there seem to be set up to reappear in a later game. But as far as the current story goes, you get some minor details and some new emotional scenes talking about things you already knew from other games and it’s not particularly fulfilling. Some of the new characters are really nice and Kiryu, for a change, has more range in his personality, but it’s not a game that will interest anyone with its story but the biggest fans of the series.

So what did I like about Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name? It plays really goddamn well. Just like with Lost Judgment, combat controls are extremely fun and better than they’ve ever been in the series. Every fight just flows well and provides enough challenge (on a highest difficulty) for those who like it, while providing a perfect amount of challenge (on other difficulties) for people who just want to have fun. Granted, some mini-games still go really unfair, unless you grind or look up best solutions, but those are an exception and most of the time this game is just really fun to play.

Yet it puts it in a weird spot. If you like RGG universe games for gameplay and it alone can interest you, this is a good game for you. It’s unlikely to become your favorite, but it’s really really fun. But if you like the RGG universe for the story, you really can skip this one and not miss out on anything the games won’t recap if needed later on. I liked it, but at the same time, it was a rather forgettable even if enjoyable time.",1701898956,1701898956,True,1,0,0.506015539169311523,0,True,False,False

Riddle me this: how is it that a game that was thrown together in six months - PALTRY amount of time by today's standards - has far more content for $50 at launch than most games that cost $20 more and took YEARS to develop? Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. That is all. 

Let's get one thing out of the way real quick: this is easily the shortest story in the series by far. Only five chapters to get through, most of them can take you - assuming you prioritize the story and occasionally upgrade your abilities - about a decent seven to eight hours, tops. That being said, story itself is as rock solid as you'd expect. Though be warned, if this is your first foray into the series, you might be left out of the loop on some things, so at the very least, watch a story recap to get caught up (bare minimum; play or watch Yakuza: Like a Dragon). To keep it as spoiler-free as possible, this is a short and sweet adventure that - especially towards the end - is a perspective flip on a certain part of Y:LaD (set at the same time as the latter, to be exact) and leads directly into the next game, Infinite Wealth. 

As for the game itself, well... it's more Yakuza. Or Like a Dragon as it's called now. More of that beat-'em-up goodness that you've come to know and love is still present and accounted for, and given some of that much-needed polish from Judgment, 'cause RGG have pretty much mastered the Dragon Engine by this point that - without exaggeration - this is THE BEST Ki-er, Joryu has played in DE by far. 

Spoiler alert - no, the styles from 0 and Kiwami don't return, and Kiryu's still using the same style that he did from 6 onwards, but two things - it's given a proper name now (Yakuza) and, perhaps most importantly, it just FEELS so much better to play. And if you want to be on some real goofy ahh Roger Moore-era Bond chicanery, then the Agent style's got you covered. It's a little cumbersome to get used to (the Rush Combo in particular is a little sluggish), but the gadgets more than make up for it with how hilariously fun they are thanks in part to the DE's wonky-as-ever physics. 

As for side content, there's still a fair bit to be had. For all intents and purposes, this is basically the Kaito Files from Lost Judgment if it were turned into a standalone entry. Short story to get through, but this time around, the content is a lot more plentiful (Substories are present, for one), having all the usual staples you'd expect (Karaoke, Pocket Circuit, Hostess Clubs, Completion List, etc). Realistically speaking, though, you'll probably be spending A LOT of your time in the Castle, which has the best iteration of the series' coliseum (last seen in Kiwami 2, fun fact) yet. Trust me, it's better to see it for yourself if you haven't already. 

Yes, this game is worth it. Whether full price or on sale, you can never go wrong with an RGG Studio product. Just that simple.",1701845958,1701845958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Final boss is really REALLY good.
+ [spoiler] The final scene at the shrine made me cry. [/spoiler] 
+ The Castle is pretty cool.

+/- The combat, while an improvement over Y6 and Kiwami 2, is extremely odd; Agent feels like a cut down version of Crane and Yakuza is mismatch of 5's Kiryu and 6/K2's Kiryu that attacks far too slow.
+/- Professional difficulty is surprisingly actually hard but I didn't find it particularly fun.
+/- Akame is okay.

Lot of the same issues The Kaito Files had: Most bosses are fought like 3 times at minimum, two styles don't blend very well together, very little focus on side activities.
- Lots of issues with combat that were already present or even solved in previous games are in this game: Most bosses are fully immune to grabs/spider grapple/basically every gimmick, bosses constantly get super armor, style switching is really slow for whatever reason, and a fuck load of bosses with bladed weapons.
- All side content is recycled from other games.
- Despite the very short run time of the story, the plot manages to spend most of it having very little happen other than Kiryu repeatedly making Omi or Daidoji upset and then being interrupted by Akame making you go do a substory.
- The story desperately needed some sort of personal throughline like Kiryu's depression from erasing his old life being shown more.
- It's an alright game but nowhere near enough unique content for the price point, it should have been 30 dollars.",1701751415,1701751415,False,1,0,0.420835793018341064,0,True,False,False

Originally felt that I regretted buying it (First time buying a game at full price) because of how small the chapters were, but with all those chapters and the story unfolding even more after the events of Yakuza 6, its still really worth buying. Even the sub-stories were enjoyable (🗣️🔥🗣️THE FUCK IS A NORMAL SUB-STORY??? 🗣️🔥🗣️) and is just overall fun to follow whatever the hell is happening. Long story short, the game made me go back to enjoying the series because of how much I missed it, and made me contemplate if I should play the entire Y0-Y6 Series again because I missed it quite a lot, and because of this game I might as well. 


Although I still do have some nitpicks with the game, with how much they could have added even if its simple ones (Some are fixed with the mods you could download) One of them are some parts of the combat, while fun and interesting that you could literally just freaking juggle them in the air Tekken Combos style (Please Kiryu for T8) it felt really lackluster and feels like there could have been some other moves added (Installed Like A Dragon Gaiden Deluxe, which gives newer move and combo possibilities for his base move-set)  and if even, add back the style switch that he had from Y0/YK1, another random combat related cope I got is how some of the heat actions are hella specific, like full hp and run into some enemy or something lol. Last other nitpicks are mostly end-game related, like why can't I fight the previous bosses again? (Again a mod that could be downloaded to fight the previous bosses was created) But overall? definitely worth the purchase, hella fun to play especially if you have your brains off just to have a good time beating up people you randomly see on the streets holding the strong attack to fly them across the fucking sky.

The combat is very fluid and it is the very best of the Dragon engine that I've experienced since Judgement.  

The substories have a lot of callbacks to other Yakuza games and some of them are funny though it's not the funniest collection. 

The minigames have a lot of the same offerings.  One thing I really like is the Coliseum.  You have a card based fighter system but the fighters actually join in with you on the fun so it's so much better than the RTS stuff you see in Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6.  

Really, I think the minigames are all very good except maybe for the Cabaret ones since they use live actresses for it and it's a bit weird.  I mean, they look a bit busted because one of them will smile and you'll see like eight crow's feet around her eyes so it's not very sexy.  

Compared to the ending in Yakuza 6, I'd say that this one is more satisfying and that it's a good transition for Kiryu into the upcoming new game.  

Yes, this game is short compared to other entries but it looks amazing and the quality of the activities you do is higher than many of the other games.

TECHNICAL

Maybe my computer is getting old but it seems like this game takes a while to load things. Entering combat or a building causes a bit of lag. It also crashed twice during these ""entering"" situations. Maybe wait a while for some performance things to be ironed out if your computer is not so good. Aside from that you can expect typical Dragon Engine stuff to happen, for better or worse (for me at least the ragdolling is funny).

GRAPHICS/AUDIO

The game still has realistic models and buildings, it looks like how it would in Kiwami 2 for example. It matches Kiwami 2's appearance to the point where it has the same level of saturation and shininess to it that I don't like. I much preferred the look of Yakuza: Like a Dragon on that front. 

VAing is of similar good quality to previous installments. Somewhat of a spoiler: Kuroda gets to flex his crying chops and does a good job on that end. 

COMBAT

The combat system has a two-style system akin to Judgement. Kiryu has a hard hitting, slower Yakuza style that is better for one-on-one combat and a fast Agent style that is good at group fights and uses James Bond gadgets. I certainly think the system is better implemented than Judgement's was in that neither style is overridingly better than the other. Yakuza style uses a lot of moves from previous games and it's satisfying to kick a guy across the street. Agent lets you steal weapons, throw people, and blow them up; there's a drone move but I found no actual use for it. 

In general, juggling enemies definitely seems easier than in previous games. I was able to get juggles off every combat and I'm a complete scrub at this sort of thing.

The leveling system is like Yakuza 4 with the lines of orbs. You don't really unlock anything incredible through leveling but it gives stat ups so you will need to level up.

SIDE STUFF

The game is set in primarily in Sotenbori, which is unusual but makes sense for a more compressed game. There aren't any truly new minigames other than one arcade game but there are innovations on existing ones. The cabaret clubs use FMVs with real people and are much shorter per hostess, pool got added back, as did Pocket Circuit, which had an overhaul to make it completely independent of money. I personally have never liked Pocket Circuit as it was effectively random whether you would fall of the track even with an optimal build, but it hasn't gotten worse.

There's a new ""secondary city"": the Castle, where you can do some cool things. You can change your appearance and fight in the Coliseum, an RGG staple. One of the funnier innovations of the Coliseum are team battles and the ability to play as non-Kiryu fighters. Yes, you can fight a hulk of a man in the arena while playing as some scrub you had destroyed in 30 seconds just prior, then recruit that same hulk and do it all over again. 

Unfortunately, the substories have re-used the annoying system from Judgement where you have to go to your ""office"" to start any of them. It's even worse than in Judgement, actually, because in Judgement you could encounter a few substories on the street, but here you get every substory except for a specific sequence of seven via this office billboard thing. Another oddity is that almost no substory grants an item as an award. 

Aside from substories there are also these miniquests you can do that are mostly either singular fights or fetch quests. They're pure filler if we're being honest, except for a few interesting ones that make you hunt for landmarks. 

PLOT

Two things to note on the outset:

1. This game is only five chapters long, which is a half to a third of most RGG games. If that's too little story, get this game on sale (or don't get it). If it's not, then it's not. 

2. This is not a game to introduce someone to the franchise with. If you don't want to play through the first six games, that's one thing and Gaiden would introduce you to the contours of Kiryu's story to some degree but the game has significant spoilers for Yakuza: Like a Dragon so it's not great as a primer for either main character's storylines.

The story's not bad but I was expecting a bit more on two fronts. The first is that the impression I got from promotion material was that this would be like a James Bond - RGG hybrid, but I would say that largely it's more of the latter than the former. Obviously having an RGG-type story is not bad in and of itself but the secret agent angle is not as prominent as I thought it would be. 

The second thing is that I feel that this game's story exists to promote the upcoming game, Infinite Wealth, and therefore is a bit beat-by-beat by itself. The side characters for example were a bit undercooked and not exactly special. The main villain is honestly not all that great either and is someone we've seen before (not literally but also quite literally). Some of this may be the short length of the game: perhaps there was not enough time in the story to make them more developed. The twists in the story weren't great but I can see what they were trying to do with some of them: they were out of the blue but also not shocking on an emotion level either. The best part of the story was the absolute end scene, which is strange because it is one of the most emotionally impactful scenes in the series; the rest of the game shouldn't really be standing on the same podium as that cutscene.

I imagine that sometime down the line after Infinite Wealth comes out people will make the case that plot-wise, Gaiden should be considered by new players to be a supplement to Infinite Wealth and not something that is outstanding on its own except for the aforementioned cutscene. I assume that some but not all characters will show up in the next game: the yakuza characters will potentially be prominent but I cannot imagine a significant role for ""Boss"" who appears two times ever but has a trading card dedicated to him.

INFINITE WEALTH DEMO

I would venture that this demo accounts for a significant portion of the price. I didn't play too much of the demo stuff but what I see makes me optimistic. The map is packed, the minigames are quite fun, and the combat is expanded upon in a good way that leaves much less up to chance. There are a few iffy things like animation stuff and some strange audio effects in cutscenes - one of Ichiban's lines had a noticeable echo for example, but I assume by Jan 2024 this stuff will be fixed. The story demo makes me think that the writing will retain the quality from previous entries as well, even given the setting transplant. 

I know there is some controversy over the English dubbing, but I don't usually play these games with dubbing anyways. It just seems strange in concept given that the past games kind of point against the main characters being perfect unaccented anglophones, you know?

Note that you have to beat Gaiden to be able to play the demo.",1701559049,1701559049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Absolutely amazing game. Playing this reminded me of when I played Yakuza 0 for the first time ever and I enjoyed it so much. Combat is fun and feels smooth, it feels very streamlined which is nice (compared to Yakuza 6 from what I remember). The story is great. I love Kiryu. The agent abilities are super fun. The minigames are fun. One of the best games in the Yakuza series in my opinion.

Although it's quite short compared to the other games in the series which is unfortunate, it's entertaining and a wonderful experience with amazing gameplay. I really wish it was longer considering it's really good. I truly hope we get to be spoiled by more games similar to this, because personally I'm not a big fan of turn-based combat that the other games seem to be heading towards to.

Like A Dragon Gaiden is a must play for veteran Yakuza fans. For newcomers who love the action beat-em-up style, I highly recommend this series and to play Y0-Y7 before starting this one.",1699677936,1701554306,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So, true; the bases of the gameplay are relatively the same as before, even if each Yakuza game has the talent to show some notable differences for this matter. The map consists in only the city of Sotenbori, and later on the castle, and at start I wished Kiryu could have evolved through a different area, city, as he was supposed to be ""incognito"".

Well . . . fact is, now that I've finished the game, I feel just blown away by those few dozens of hours I've played, and its' captivating story; it's a Yakuza title that is very worthy to appear in the series, even essential - with an ending that is certainly long, but ""Grand Finale"" style. And I think that what strongly participated to my feeling of satisfaction in the end was, as for other Yakuza games I've played (including the Judgment ones), I just took my time, with the mini-games, with the Coliseum, and the Akame requests - and all just fit together perfectly, the game was a real blast and don't regret one bit playing this to the end. I also felt that the combat difficulty was a bit higher, which I appreciated.

It isn't perfect though, some lengthy grinding may be necessary for the Coliseum for instance; or once again, the map is actually the most limited in the series - but whatever, Like a Dragon Gaiden is a total banger, mostly if you care to not rush it and explore well all of its' map and everything it has to offer.

So if you already played and liked some games of the franchise, you can buy this with no hesitation ; and if you're a newcomer, my personal advice would be to play the games in the most chronological order possible, starting with Yakuza 0, the first game in the series, and a most well reputed one, for all its' great qualities and fun.

I cannot stress this enough. For a side game, I have played for over 30 hours and will probably play for even more, which is kinda crazy ngl.

It's a short one, well for a game in this series, only having a small handful of chapters and a fair bit of side content. The combat in this game is fun. The Agent Style adds quicker moves together with gadgets that are fun to use in certain fights when you've figured out how to control your opponents with them. The Yakuza style is probably the most fun Kiryu has been to play in a non RPG game in a good while. Overall the usage of these two styles together can make fights with enemies and bosses alike interesting if you use them in fun ways. 

A fair bit of the side content is related to The Coliseum which gives you your standard 1 V 1 fights of past games, vs groups of enemies and the new mode where you have a team you assembled face off against an enemy team. This mode is fun when figuring out how to best support your team to make sure they don't get eliminated whilst fighting everyone although leveling up said team mates does feel a bit tedious and time consuming unless you have a lot of money on hand already. That being said, when your team is the appropriate level it's a fun side mode to figure out how to handle battles. You can also play as the fighters you recruit although they have a limited moveset so Kiryu is usually who I stuck with.

The story and music is some of the best the series has had. Almost all of these tracks are amazing and the composers of them went above and beyond! The story is genuinely something I did not expect to hook me as it is a side story that seems like lead up to Infinite Wealth but oh how I was wrong. This story goes from a small steady thing to one of the most engaging bits of story this series has ever had. I am honestly amazed with how they hooked me so good towards the end. This is a must play experience for fans of Kiryu's story. 

Beyond that this game has side activities you would expect from the series. Golf, mahjong, gambling, cabaret clubs, side stories, pocket circuit, locker keys, Master System games, arcade games, claw games, pool, shogi and darts. 

This is a game that is worth it for long time series fans and if you are new to the series start with Yakuza 0 or the first game on PS2, otherwise this game will probably not do as much for you.",1701409397,1701409397,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As a reminder: 
[b]Do not play this before completing Yakuza 0-7[/b]
This game is a conclusion of all the Yakuza games released to this day. Playing this first would be the same as watching the final Season of Attack on Titan or any other good series before Season 1-4. You would ruin your experience.

Now for the review:
Kazuma Kiryu is back, for better or worse, depending on how you see it, but on a technical level, this game takes everything that made Yakuza 6 and Kiwami 2 amazing and improves it quite a bit:

[h3] Combat [/h3]
Kiryu keeps his Dragon of Dojima style, which is now called the Yakuza style, but it’s slightly nerved in comparison to Y6 and K2. They made it slightly slower and took away two of the side-steps, you can only do one now (and you get a roll upgrade later) otherwise the moveset is mostly unchanged.

The star of the show is the new Agent style. It’s mixture of Yagamis Crane and Kiryus old rush style with some new gadgets, which are really fun to use.

Gameplay wise Agent style is superior, especially on harder difficulties, due the nerving of Yakuza style and it generally being faster.

One of the biggest changes in terms of combat is the number of enemies you can fight at once. Some battles (mostly in the Colliseum) makes you fight up to 20 enemies at once. 
After this game, One Man Army Kiryu definitely deserves his title.

[h3] Minigames [/h3]
The main story might be shorter but in terms of minigames and side content, Gaiden has almost as much content as a normal Yakuza game:
[list]
    [*]Improved Pocket Circuit Racing
    [*]Improved Colliseum with it’s own Subplot including Team Battles and the opportunity to control and fight with different characters other than Kiryu.
    [*]A mixture of Judgment side cases and and the classic Substories. It’s presented in a similar way as in Judgment but play out like the classic funny substories we know from Yakuza.
[*]New and old Karaoke songs, including Bakamitai
[*]Billiard for the first time in the Dragon Engine
[*]Hostess Club (They made it worse and more creepy by using real actresses, but it’s there for the people who like it).
[/list]

Additionally, something, that doesn’t really fit into any of the Subcategories: 
[b]You change the appearance of Kiryu now.[/b]
Some outfits from older games return or you can just dress him up as a clown, and it will affect almost every cutscene!


Now for the most important part of the game:
[h3] The Plot[/h3]
In terms of story writing, it's kind of amazing to think that the entire situation of Kiryu, where everything started to go downhill for him, begun in Yakuza 5 or more specifically it's ending.
Before that, all Yakuza games had it's of own concluded stories without any big impact for it's successors, but with Yakuza 5 and successor Yakuza 6, everything changed:
[olist]
[*]Kiryu ends up in prison due the aftermaths of Yakuza 5 (2012)
[*]Haruka leaves Morning Glory Orphanage due unwanted attention by media (sometime between 2012-2014)
[*]Haruka meets Yuta (2014)
[*]Haruka gets hospitalized due her involvement with Yuta (2016)
[*]Kiryu fakes his death to protects his family (2016)
[*]Which leads to Gaiden (2019-2020)
[*]Which then leads to Infinite Wealth, due the affairs in Gaiden and Yakuza 7. (2023)
[/olist]
The entirety of Yakuza 6 and Gaiden could have been prevented, if Kiryu would have been there to protect Haruka. The decision Kiryu made at the end of Yakuza 5 to go into prison were the trigger for everything that took place afterwards. You could even go further back and say that Kiryus decision to let Haruka pursue her dream of becoming an Idol let to all of this, which is impressive to think about.

You could say, that this is all an one big arc and it's still ongoing for 11/12 years now.

If the writers of Yakuza, or Like a Dragon, how it’s called now, planned this from the start, it’s actually really good story writing. Now we will have to see how it continues in Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth

The sum it up, without spoiling the game, this game has definitely the most emotional scene in the entire franchise with one of the best voice acting pieces I’ve ever heard, which would even make the toughest Yakuza cry.

Its events occur at the same time as Like a Dragon's, so it's quite a self-contained game story-wise, but it still took me 20+hr to beat the game and side content (notably, substories and arena, didn't quite never got into Pocket Circuit racing).

As Kiryu's last dance approaches (presumably), we get to see him in action again from the ending of Y6 until the ending of Like a Dragon. This time around, Kiryu's some kind of secret agent with gadgets and all, which give some variety to the combat gameplay. First few hours of combat fell a bit stale and lack options, but variety quickly grows and combat gets funnier very soon as you start unlocking new moves.

We get the same old Yakuza Style, and the brand new Agent Style, which is a more swift, agile combat approach in which you can use Kiryu's gadgets. Some of them felt pretty useless (cigar and drones), but thread and rocket-powered shoes felt like they added variety and added some strategical options, so a nice change of pace. It's not like fights are very difficult anyway, specially since this game allows us to unlock Tiger Drop as early as chapter 1...

Music and voice acting are top tier as usual and the graphics are the same formula as ever: gorgeous for main character models, more modest in environments, and some PS3 sprinkle for NPCs...

If anything, I would complain that unlike in Y6 or LaD, Gaiden's new characters didn't really leave a mark on me. Kiryu and the old dogs steal the show, really. Though I would like to see Akame back, she seems qualified to take over as a new kind of Florist of Sai.

All in all, if Like a Dragon franchise is the kind of game you enjoy, this is close to the greater ones, so don't hesitate to give it a try. Solid 8-8.5 for me.",1701378877,1701378877,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
2375550,149771764,76561198045964937,0,8,1099,0,70,1705684176,"TL;DR: Same great Yakuza game formula. If you're a fan of the series and the developer, RGG Studios, you already know what to expect in terms of presentation, execution, humor, combat, minigames, gameplay mechanics and so on. If its not broke, why fix it, right? If anything, you can expect some innovations such as (but not limited to) the 'Agent' style with its variety of gadgets, going into this game. A must buy for any Yakuza fans, especially if you're a diehard fan that has played every entry because this game panders to people like us with multiple callbacks (moreso than any other previous titles) to previous games. Its like a RGG Studios love letter to their fans, in the form of a game. Story-wise, this takes places during Yakuza: Like A Dragon and you will see references to parts of that game here.

This is likely going to be the last game we will see the legendary Kazuma Kiryu in a good ol' Yakuza beat-em-up style game and as the main protagonist as his appearance in the upcoming mainline entry, Infinite Wealth (which will primarily star Ichiban Kasuga and co.), is going to be his last appearance (heavily implied from the trailers). RGG Studios have gone on record to state that mainline entry games are now going to be turn-based only moving forward, meaning this game is a side entry. Plus Gaiden translates to 'another tale' so that's a fun fact for you. Like any other previous Yakuza game entries, there are numerous callbacks to that have happened in the previous Yakuza games, so if this is going to be your first Yakuza game, expect to be confused.

The game's engine is amazing. This is definitely the same game engine that will be running the upcoming mainline entry, Infinite Wealth. Faces (to an extent, NPCs as well) and facial expressions are amazingly detailed. Lighting and textures has been improved, I dont know how RGG Studios do it, every game they release they just one-up themselves in the graphics department. Simply amazing. Performance-wise, its great too. 4k60fps without DLSS gave me no stutters or performance losses on my 3060. Shame that this has to be pointed out as numerous modern game releases have been plagued with performance issues.

Gameplay-wise right off the bat, even without upgrades, Kiryu feels much more agile akin to Yagami from the Judgement series in his new 'Agent' style. The 'Agent' style battle stance and moves are even similar to that of the detective's. Kiryu is also much faster and lighter hitting and he comes equipped gadgets to play around with, like the wire thats showcased in this game's store page. 

The legendary Dragon of Dojima fighting style that we all know and love, dubbed as 'Yakuza' style here, makes its reappearance too. Although in this game, Kiryu does come with more baseline moves such as being able to charge your attacks from the getgo rather than needing an upgrade like in the previous titles. He's a also tadbit slower than the [strike] Yagami style [/strike] 'Agent' style but hits harder and can now, for the first time in the series, counterattack right after getting hit with either a headbutt, a quick punch or a quick kick. This is exclusive to 'Yakuza' style and it essentially allows you to trade blows with enemies. Kiryu naturally has this new ability without needing an upgrade though its not stated anywhere in the game that he can do this so I'm making a point to mention this in my review. You can also later, get an upgrade to charge these counterattacks. Almost all of the fighting moves and heat actions we know and love are back in this game, like the repeating knee to the face, mashing punch that will lead into a heat action, finishing holds and more. Understandably, some heat actions have been omitted as it wouldnt have fit Kiryu's current personality, such as the heat action where you were able to scrape an enemy's face on the ground in Yakuza 5.

Mortal wounds from the Judgement series are not present in this game. Furthermore, both the 'Agent' and 'Yakuza' styles have their own unique BGMs that will play during a fight, much like Yagami with his various styles having unique BGMs in the Judgement series. Picking up items overworld that are elevated off the ground have been made much less tedious here with the wire too as opposed to how tedious it was back in the Judgement series. Also, finally, you can now smoke on demand as Kiryu (no, the smoking taunt in Yakuza 5 doesnt count) at any of the designated smoking areas just like Yagami can.

For the first time in the series, you are now able to customize Kiryu's outfit as well as equip him with various accessories and not just change into preset outfits (which were only available during post-game in the previous titles)! While technically you could already do this in Yakuza 6, your choices were only between the full iconic grey suit or ditching the coat and just the red shirt with sleeves rolled up. In Gaiden, you are given a wide variety of outfits and accessories to pick and choose from to completely dress Kiryu up in fashion, head to toe.

The Sotenbori locker and finding the respective locker keys to unlock each locker from Yakuza 5 returns in this game.

One of the biggest changes to minigames is the change to the Cabaret hostess club minigame. The Yakuza series has always found a way to incorporate interactions with real gravure or JAV actresses, such as the live chat minigame in Yakuza 6, into one of the minigames but it has never been done with the Cabaret hostess minigames. In the past, the games would have Kiryu interact directly with various actresses with their likeness rendered into an in-game model using their faces as a reference. In Gaiden, this has been replaced with a VR-esque styled gameplay where the hostess addresses you as Kiryu while directly looking at the screen/camera. Personally, this change felt really jarring to me since you could even see the ringlight in the actresses' eyes. It certainly wasn't my cup of tea, though your mileage may vary, depending on if you're into this particular style of interaction.

The graphics look very beautiful and gameplay overall is solid and style switching in this game feels comfortable, though in my opinion Yakuza style needs a tiny bit of a speed touch up since at times it can feel like I could've pulled off very good looking juggles and combos. Agent style is very fun combined with faster attacks and also the gadgets give you the ability to juggle and re-juggle well.

In terms of story, this game met my expectations and hype when it was first announced.

One scene in particular really was something ill remember forever, Kuroda is an talented actor. The final chapter is a lot of fun, and had me so excited for the final fight.

The combat is very good, importing many of the improvements made in the Judgment series and altering it to fit Kiryu's gameplay. Juggling and mortal reversals make a return, while Extreme Heat has become very akin to EX Boost. The only thing I would complain about in combat is there is a fairly low amount of heat actions, but the ones they brought into this game are excellent. The progression is pretty good, returning to using money and the new Akame Points to buy upgrades. Bringing money back into skills make it really fun and interesting to actually earn money, due to its direct impact on gameplay now.

The story is amazing. It ties into Yakuza: Like a Dragon but from the perspective of Kiryu, giving us a fresh look at the events of that game, while also tying up Kiryu's story, since Yakuza 6's bittersweet ending left something to be desired. All of the new characters in this game are to become instant favorites, they did an amazing job with the cast of this game.

Visually this game is beautiful. The game is visually darker than other Dragon Engine titles, but they also use more highlights and brighter colors to offset the darker shading present, giving us one of the most striking titles yet. All the UI and menus look sleek as well. Everything is expertly shaded, animated, modeled, and rendered to the point where they would splice in real-life footage cause they were so confident. The quality of the visuals is so good that there are no more pre-rendered cutscenes, the in-game just looks that good now. 

The game length is about 1/3 of a full Yakuza title. Not the worst thing though, since it bypasses the long, confusing stories of the previous game with a short one that does everything that it needs to. Plus, if you need more game to play, there is still tons of side content to dig your teeth into. All of the side content in this game got an expansion (except for golf, sorry DJ Khaled). The Colosseum is tons of fun, with a huge amount of fights to do. Pocket circuit is back, with more races than ever to do. The Akame Network side content is filled with either well-written personal stories, or silly one-offs to fight homeless guys or convenience store clerks to recruit to your army. The cabaret minigame is all live-action 4K footage, which takes 23.4 gigabytes of space on your computer sadly. 

OST is full of bangers, its on Spotify if you want to listen after you play this game. Game reuses some songs from Yakuza 0 and Judgment/Lost Judgment for substory music, which is kinda funny. All the karaoke tracks in this game are good, some being brand new and some being remastered ones from previous games. 

Overall, an amazing game. Taking the best from the previous games while improving on the shortcomings of previous Kiryu games makes this a must-play for Yakuza/Like a Dragon fans. Can not recommend this game enough. 9/10",1701196037,1701196037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i] You know you love me, I know you care.[/i] The game's narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, and friendship, mirroring the sentiments of the catchy chorus. The protagonist's journey is a testament to the enduring bonds that define us, much like the love Bieber croons about.

[i] Are we an item? Girl quit playin'.[/i] The game challenges players with choices that echo the uncertainty of relationships, keeping them on their toes and urging them to navigate the complexities of alliances and betrayals. The blurred lines between friendship and something more are masterfully portrayed, making players question the very foundations of their in-game connections.

[i] Said there's another and looked right in my eyes.[/i] Like the protagonist facing the unexpected twists of the narrative, players encounter shocking revelations that test their resolve. The game cleverly incorporates moments of revelation, keeping players engaged and invested in the unfolding drama, just as Bieber's lyrics reveal the unexpected.

[i] My first love broke my heart for the first time.[/i] The emotional turmoil of the characters mirrors the heartbreak expressed in the lyrics. The game's ability to evoke genuine emotions speaks to its narrative depth, making players empathize with the characters' struggles and triumphs.

[i] Losing my name, nowhere to go. But I can't stop loving you [/i] Seamlessly integrates with the game's narrative, adding a layer of nostalgia and reflection. The parallels between the artist's reminiscence and the characters' journeys enhance the emotional resonance of the gameplay experience.

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name™ masterfully intertwines gameplay and narrative, creating an emotional journey that resonates with the same intensity as Justin Bieber's ""Baby."" It's a testament to the power of storytelling in video games, leaving players with a lingering sense of connection and emotion long after the game concludes.

with the agent style the game was a little too easy to cheese as you can just use your rocket shoes to zoom around and throw grenades at everyone but with enough upgrading of the yakuza style and unlocking tiger drop swapping styles almost became irrelevant.
still a good game like most of the like a dragon franchise but a notably shorter game. game doesn't feel like it should be worth 80 aud since it reuse a small chunk of yokohama from lad 7 and all of sotenbori from kiwami 2. the whole new area didn't feel like it the game should be that high a price but a excellent story like most like a dragon games.",1701155106,1701155174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay:
An action-RPG at its heart, Like a Dragon Gaiden combines its seasoned-past with their newer IP, Judgment, to craft an engaging and combo-orientented brawler. While there could be room for a little more refining in a specific fight style, gameplay never felt boring and there is always something new to do. Even if the player doesn't love the fighting mechanics, rhythm-based karaoke, pocket circuit racer, shogi, darts, pool, and much more offers a variety that makes this game addicting to play from start to finish.

Graphics:
With AAA games making it harder to stand out from the crowd, LaD still manages to capture the world and its characters with very little infidelity. Facial expressions, pores on a face, and detailed landscapes makes this game still beyond worthy to look at. The only aspect stopping it right now from being more ""modernized"" is raytracing

Music:
Not ""gotta-download-this-album"" worthy, but still music that purposefully matches the tone of the moment,

Story:
Long-time fans will love the story of Kiryu's tale into obscurity. The questions of legacy and if a legacy is worth it if the person cannot witness it all unfolds and proves to be the Dragon of Dojima's strongest chracter study yet

Score: 8/10 (One of RGG studio's best action-rpgs yet, with a story that will satisfy longtime fans and motivate them to see what comes next)",1701063262,1701136486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[PROS]
- STORY: The story picks up where Yakuza 6 ended. I feel like many people might have had issues with the way the story ended, so this one tries to expand on what happened after the events of 6. And the story happens at the same time Yakuza Like a Dragon's plot happened, so if you played that one before you'll be able to piece together pieces and understand better the reason behind some of the plot points in that one too. And the quality is pretty good, without spoiling anything the ending had me fighting the tears off.
- COMBAT: I've heard multiple opinions on the combat of this game, but as someone that has yet to play Judgement the combat in this game feels polished. Again, I jumped from the combat of 6 into this one and it feels so much more polished. Game has two styles: Agent - A style that is characterized for being ultra fast but low damage and Yakuza - Basically the style of 6 where you hit like a truck but attacks are way slower, leaving you open to getting hurt. So, if you liked the combat in 6, it's here. And if you wanted new combat you also get that and can easily switch mid-combat with the push of a button.
- SIDE CONTENT: Lots of minigames to play. It doesn't really introduce a whole lot of new stuff, rather it brings those minigames that were more popular and polishes them, giving us sort of a ""Best of"" selection of things to do. Things like Pocket Racing, karaoke, coliseum battles, they all make a very strong comeback.

[CONS]
- STORY: This game is the shortest in the entire saga. And it's not an exageration, it's VERY short. I don't know how regional pricing might work for other countries, but right now this is the most expensive Yakuza game in all of Steam, so having a game that you can complete in around 35 hours (I took my sweet time to play it, tried all minigames, completed most of the side content, walked around the map instead of running and still finished it in 32 hours) for that price is one thing you might wanna keep in mind. The quality is there, RGG put out a fantastic product, but it's short.
- COMBAT: While the combat is polished, the fact that the game is so short gives us a smaller list of heat actions and all of the abilities are gained with money rather than experience or training. Depending on how much you play the side content you might be super weak the entire game or super strong, there's no really in-between. And the game ends before you can get properly comfortable with your fighting style.
- SIDE CONTENT: Again, the fact that the game is so short makes this part a gray area, while there are plenty of side activities and these are well done you don't really experience a whole lot before the game ends. The number of side stories in this game is surprisingly small, and now instead of getting them by walking around and helping the residents of the city, you are given side stories from a side-quest hub in your hideout which I don't know ... for me it sort of robs the charm these games have. You're not a good samaritan helping people anymore, you're an agent hired to do odd jobs. And I know it's only for this game but I can't not mention the tonal shift the game takes. Yakuza games are always a serious story with a side of silly. This game is very serious from beginning to end, couple of side stories are funny but overall the game mantains a very serious tone which might charm some and polarize others.

[ACHIEVEMENTS]
This must be the easiest game in the series to 100%. I've seen people do it in around 45 hours. The Completion List means nothing, you don't have to finish it on a high difficulty, and I'm pretty sure you can complete all the achievements in your first playthrough if you have the patience for it. Personally, it disappoints me a little, but I also understand how it can be due to the length of the game.

[SUMMARY]
Overall a very strong addition to the series. One that in a way was needed to tie up all of Kiryu's journey on a nice bow and send him for what might be his final adventure in Infinite Wealth. I'm very satisfied with the product I got, but if you think the price might be too much and want to wait for a discount that is a very valid option.",1701120145,1701120145,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'd recommend this if you're familiar with most of the 0-6 games. If you've only played 7 then you'll definitely get a bit out of it but you'll be missing a significant bit of broader context that makes the whole thing meaningful and sometimes emotionally significant for both the main character and the player. Having played most of the series, I was actually tearing up at the ending. I wouldn't really recommend this as a starting point. The story has a few warts but nothing that made me want to stop playing the game.

Aside from that, this might be the best version of the ""Virtual Tour"" component that the series is famous for. The collectibles and side missions really encourage the player to observe the environment much more actively than in previous games. I felt like I noticed more details and there were several instances where the game rewarded me for paying attention to the scenery.

Combat is good but I personally feel like every game has its good and so-so design choices. This one does more right than wrong but I'm not sure that its my favorite iteration of the combat system.

Outstanding game - As someone who's played the entire series, this is a love letter to fans, and those who've followed Kiryu's story from his life as a young punk to his life as a surrogate father to his kids. I am sobbing at the ending, and dear god I am not ready for Infinite Wealth.

You really should wait and play the other games to understand Kiryu's story before this - it makes a lot of the callbacks and some of the fights themselves have just that much more oomph to them. The combat sadly is not as smooth as Lost Judgment, despite Kiryu's style switching and Yakuza style being as brutal and weighty as ever. Thankfully, juggling is back and Kiryu can do it, which is honestly pretty awesome. 

The story though, wow. Remarkable, and while it may have some filler, it was engaging to me from start to finish. The last act was a highlight, and it def shows the writers and whole team are much better at crafting a proper ending to their stories. I don't think I've cried that hard over a game in years.

Will always be a fan of RGG Studios, and hope to see more and more from them as the years go on. Just make the Yakuza style hit slightly faster FFS.",1701090061,1701090061,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Depending on how you look at it, this is either a low-effort dlc-into-full-game spinoff or part of a proper send-off of the Kiryu Era or objectively both.

Part of the reason why some would buy this game is that it is possible RGG will move on from  the older Yakuza action games  as they continue onwards in the Ichiban era, but moving on seems hard for both the developer and the players.

Supporting this game might send a message they should do more action spinoffs like this and Judgment now that turn-based is the MAIN game.

Regardless - the point of this game is that it is intended as a final sendoff for those who were invested into the older games and an excuse to make people pay for Kiryu. You get backstory of Kiryu addressing events from Yakuza 6 and Y:LAD and a linkage + demo to Infinite Wealth.

Spoiler Advisory for old and new players:

To be clear, this is game for the fans from the Kiryu era. It is heavy on references that need most players to play those game to appreciate them.

If you are new, ensure you played at least Yakuza: Like a Dragon before you play this game to avoid spoiling yourself. Knowledge of Yakuza 6 is recommended but not optional.

While you should play this game before Infinite Wealth, but it isn't *strictly necessary* based on the story I seen for myself. Not everything about Kiryu in IW is addressed in this game but if you love Kiryu anyway, just play this game before IW if you can.

Why you should play this game (slight spoilers):

- You are a big RGG/Kiryu fan like me
- A lot of references to older games. Probably most of all the Kiryu Y0-Y6 games.
- You enjoy the fan service, familiar minigames and familiar 4-king-something subplots
- You enjoy dressing up Kiryu
- You think live-action girls cabaret is awesome (meh)
- And you think it's cool to play as an Agent (it's a little absurd and tech superhero-like)
- You want to see the latest Sotenbori (it's the ONLY main map in this game. the rest don't really count)
- You want to try the Infinite Wealth demo (unlocks after completing game)
- You are okay with the pricing

Why you should wait for a sale or skip for Infinite Wealth (again, slight spoilers):

- You expect new and fresh things. There's not much 'new things' aside from agent style and cabaret. The main driving point of this game is just narrative and sentimentalism. No new minigames, just a reboot of Pocket Circuit. And a Coliseum.
- It's quite obvious this game was indeed finished in 6 months. Most of the stuff here are carried from older games. Some parts feel abit unpolished. Just adjust your expectations accordingly.
- There's only one completely new karaoke song. Horrifying!
- There's half of the side stories, and only 1/4 of them is interesting (imho). I never really liked the four-king subplot but here it is, occupying 2/5 of the substories.
- It's too expensive for half the content of any Yakuza game
- You aren't interested in the minigames, sidestories, coliseum, challenges, etc. Then you probably will get even less value of this and probably can finish the game in 2-3 days.

Also the Judgment crossover is one of the bigger sidestories. But it has no dedicated voiced lines for story, just recycled grunting. Google yourself to find out more.

I love crossovers but this one just feels abit meh. Consider it as bait.

Side note on Difficulty:

Dev tries to make the game more accessible through 'action assist' and a 'combat tip' that show things that the game think is helpful. The video is ok (abit annoying) and can be toggled off, but the action assist doesn't work very well, trigger things without your consent and makes you unable to learn the combat, manage your heat bar or fight unpredictably.

Recommend most people to just play normal mode at start. The economics of this game is easy enough for you to eat regularly and prep enough heals.

TLDR: Only Real Yakuza/Kiryu Fans should buy this game. Everyone else should wait for a sale or play any or the older games, or just invest in Infinite Wealth. That game is likely to be rad based on the demo I played.",1700652506,1701089088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is your typical Yakuza charade. It starts strong, falls flat in the middle and gets really hype towards the end. It also expects you to have finished Yakuza 3, 6 and at least LaD, although some Side content is better with the knowledge of 0, 1, Kiwami 2 and Judgment / Lost Judgment.

The feeling of the Combat is on par with Lost Judgment, although the complexety is not. Joryu has access to Agent and Yakuza Style. Agent is a new one, faster than Yakuza, but deals less damage. You also get access to Gadgets in combat, each bound to one of the Face-buttons of your controller. Yakuza style is slower but allows to charge attacks. Its basically Kiryus Y6/K2 style with some additions and removals. 
The game also features a coliseum that allows to fight as the Peapole you recruit, each with their own movesets, but without any heat actions. On that note: Majima, Saejima and Daigo had their moveset severely reduced from previous games.
The game isn't very long. I've finished it in around 30h with all Side content besides Amon.
It also includes a special Infinite Wealth Demo, that is only playable after beating LaDG, but I haven't really played that one.",1701077756,1701077756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But funnily enough this is probably my game of the year despite its length. With my only real gripe being the lack of NG+ for it, as I think the lack of it hurts the replayability especially with its shorter length. A first time playthrough (watching cutscenes and all) would probably take about 7 hours give or take. Hitting the Platinum only took about 25 hours (one of the easiest plats I've achieved honestly.)

The story (without getting into spoilers) takes place during Yakuza 7. And is pretty much the events of that game through Kiryu's eyes. And was far more emotional than I had ever expected it to be.

The combat reminds me a lot of the first Judgment game. With the 2 fighting styles focusing on crowd control and 1 on 1s respectively. Agent is like Crane where it focuses on crowd control (albeit more with gimmicky gadgets and not Yagami kicking everything.) And ""Yakuza"" being the slow, but hard hitting 1 on 1 style. Unlike Judgment though, the CC style is actually really useful in battles with bigger groups what with its speed, bombs, rocket shoes and wire grab. Kiryu can air combo now, and it's actually really cool setting up into them and getting creative with what you can do.

I was surprised with how much they actually managed to do with a game that supposedly only took half a year to make. But with how the studio does really well with their ""less is more"" approach to their open worlds, I guess I shouldn't be too shocked. 

The story is very emotional with good fan service moments throughout, and we see Kiryu in a couple different ways we hadn't seen before. The combat is fluid and allows for a lot of creativity and shenanigans (though yakuza could be a lil faster) and the side activities are like a ""Best of"" collection from the series.

The game is short (by comparison) if you're looking for the usual Yakuza experience but if you are invested in the story of the games, if you want some more context behind a certain character's arrival in Like A Dragon, if you are invested in Kiryu and what he has gone through in his life then this story is really, really good. The ending tore my soul apart in the best way. It really is a must for fans.

You will find a some fun references to Yakuza 2 as well as one or two Yakuza 0 callbacks and while it is easy to become overpowered in combat it does, at least, make clearing the street trash rather quick. There are some fun attacks that combine with the agent style but you will find yourself feeling familiar with the style if you've played Judgment (it is not outright copied but has the same tight feel as Yagami's tiger style). Among some incredible cameos I won't spoil, there is a Judgment character who shows up in a really great sub-story. In fact, I'd say the sub-stories in this game are almost all fantastic and worth the time.

The arena allows you to play as many different characters (including three from Judgment). The coliseum really does feel like the big showpiece of the game and it's a really is a spectacle to be introduced to. Akame, a new character, is also a fun addition to the cast.

Problems:
Your mileage may vary but I found the hostess stuff absolutely weird and uncomfortable (but if you're a fan of Kson, that might be different?), two of the four gadgets feel as if you really could just ignore them outright. While there are many options to fight as in the coliseum there is, unfortunately, no real contest between Kiryu's strength and playing as someone like Daigo, Majima, or Saejima (which, while fun, does lack the upgrades Kiryu has). While the group battles in the coliseum are really fun it does bring out a bit of a grind to level your team which might extend gameplay for some but was not quite for me. I also found the omission of some classic heat actions from Kiryu's Yakuza style to be a disappointment. Also, if you happen to be a fan of grappling attacks in combat you can expect to be frustrated as almost all enemies but the weakest will quickly break free. While the agent style does have a fun way to snatch weapons from enemies or the ground there is something lost in not being able to actually carry weapons on your person like previous titles (though you will be familiar with this if you have played the Judgment games).

Conclusion:
All in all, if you're a Yakuza fan (and have played Yakuza 0 and Yakuza 2 or Judgment) you will find a lot here to like. There are some really great moments where you finally see Kiryu losing his composure and usual cool with where his choices in life have left him and the pain it is putting him through. It's a must for following the Dragon of Dojima and his story and leads into an explanation as to why Kiryu will be found in Infinite Wealth. While it might not be worth full retail price right now, the english dub might be enough to warrant it (if you prefer not to deal with subtitles) but I don't think it will hurt to try and get this game at around 40 or so. If you love the Yakuza storyline, however, the price of admission is worth seeing the emotional ride Kiryu goes through in this title.

General:
I absolutely LOVE the new agent style, you get so many fun toys to play with it makes combat an absolute blast, while dragon style is arguably better, agent style is much more fun and entertaining to throw enemies around, blow them up and move at blazing speeds.
The main story is a lot shorter than your usual Yakuza game, though that also means it's much more condensed, it picks up fast and all chapters have a good bit of meat to them, unlike other game where one chapter can end after just going to a phone booth.
I also liked the Ending-Sequence a lot.

Substories:
Most of the substories are rather short, alltough none of them are the basic ""oh, no. Con-Man"" ones. There aren't really any that are as good as the best ones from other games though but they were still fun to complete.
The requests which are sort of mini-substories were a bit tedious and not all that rewarding even though it felt good to complete all of them. Though they mostly consisted of simple fetch-quests or photograph the thing quest. Though they are pretty optional so it's not a problem.

Minigames:
I really love the minigames in Yakuza and alltough they were only the one's you'd be used to, I had a blast playing Mahjong and finally understanding what's going on since I bothered to learn it for the first time.
Big Minigames: (2)
- [spoiler] Pocket Circuit [/spoiler]
- [spoiler] Coliseum / Hell Team Rumble[/spoiler]

Unique Minigames (Not counting those which are in most other games like Shogi, etc.) : 0
- 

Conclusion:
Alltough technically a shorter game, I did pretty much everything including Amon in this and got pretty much the time I would expect from a numbered entry. I would very much recommend this game and also recommend learning Mahjong, it's actually pretty good once you understand what's going on.",1700943629,1700943629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game takes place in Sotenbori and on a ship called The Castle, a lavish entertainment center, explaining what Kiryu was doing after [spoiler] faking his death [/spoiler] in Y6 and how [spoiler] he ended up in Y: LAD. [/spoiler] The game contains some heavy spoilers from previous titles, hence if you are new to Yakuza series, perhaps you shouldn't start with this game.

As everyone know, the biggest introduction to the game was Kiryu's new fighting style and the new gadgets. I'm glad RGG brought back style switching mechanism. Besides the Judgment games, Y0 and Kiwami had the best fighting simply because they had the style switching mechanism. This game offers not only a new move set and animations, you get to use high-tech gadgets that are best suited for dealing with multiple enemies -needn't to mention they are also super fun. Who would've thought tossing people around with a literal Spiderman webshooter and blowing them up with explosive cigarettes would be this much fun? It's a shame that we will not have them in IW or future games.

Things that are different from the previous titles:

[u] Level up system [/u] If i remember correctly, this is the first game that require money to level up. You need money as well as Akame points to upgrade your abilities. But needn't worry because the Coliseum arena fights as well as the thugs in the streets give fair amount of money for you to spend on bentos and boozes.

[u] Substories [/u] All the substories are available through Akame instead of randomly running into fake Kiryu or Majima dressed as a cop in the streets. And it only has 26 substories total which is super low compared to the previous titles e.g. Y0 had 100.

You can customize Kiryu's outfit FINALLY. There are plenty of outfits as well as make ups for both outside activity and coliseum fights for Kiryu to wear.

Simply a masterpiece. Can't wait for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.",1699886401,1700915670,True,7,3,0.523018240928649902,0,True,False,False

This game was made for fans of the series, and requires a lot of context to fully enjoy. i would recommend at least playing 6 and 7 before this game at minimum. The combat is really satisfying, more so than Lost Judgment which up until now had the best combat in an RGG game in my opinion and the coliseum is a great addition, allowing you to play as different characters with different move sets including characters from previous RGG titles. For the first time in an RGG game, you can freely customize your clothing options without having to beat the game, with options to change everything from suits to shoes and glasses.

The length of the game. Its biggest drawback is its saving grace. At 24 hours I've completed about 80 percent of the game, all sub stories, the main story, the coliseum, im basically doing activity logs and finding locker keys now. that being said, if this was a 40-50 hour game many features would've become stale quickly, for example, the lack of heat actions and the repetitive nature of the miscellaneous quests. I genuinely enjoyed every second of this game except for some of the later coliseum matches which were just ridiculous at some points. The length of the game also makes for a quick delivery of a very satisfying story.

(One hour of play time is the demo for Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth which was also very enjoyable, and will be a day one purchase)

Gaiden is a masterful way of working the Tojo's 4th Chairman back into the franchise after his (apparent) departure in 6 and appearance in LaD. This game, despite being the shortest mainline title, is so packed with content and fun that I took my time taking the sheer amount of side-content in. Being the first mainline game that does not include Kamurocho, you're limited entirely to Sotenbori and a new area, a container ship located off the coast of japan known only as The Castle. Both areas are filled to the brim with things to do, with the best coliseum in the entire franchise being hosted in The Castle. Combat in this game is almost as smooth as Lost Judgment, packing that trademark Kiryu brutality and oomph that has been in the series since day one, making for the best implementation of the Dragon of Dojima style in any game (for me) and the ever fun Agent style is so satisfying to use, thanks to the bond-esque gadgets at your disposal (spider gadget my beloved <3).

The biggest strength in Gaiden is how it bridges between Yakuza 6, 7 and upcoming Like A Dragon Infinite Wealth. The story revolving about Tojo and Omi's dissolution and how the aftermath of 6 made Kiryu a Daidoji Agent are handled really well. Even with short runtime, all the major characters are well written and have their own story arcs. The final boss symbolizes perfectly well about how the dissolution won't be easy for lots of the yakuza, how times are changing and some of them are desperately clinging to their old way of life. It's tragic but also handled with an intense and cathartic action sequences that is both entertaining to play through and make you feel for the characters.

And then the ending, one of the, if not the saddest moment in the series. It's moments like this that make Kiryu feel believable throughout the games. Beneath his stoic demeanor hides an overwhelmingly warm heart to his family. Gaiden is ultimately a direct continuation of Yakuza 6 and that feeling of parenthood and sacrifice echoes throughout the game and especially in the ending. 

Combat in Gaiden feels great and the more aggressive enemies make for more challenging fights. It just feel and play incredibly well in every situations. The side contents, although small in variety, still manages to entertain. Some substories are among the best in the series and tackle Kiryu's past events, some are about current technological dilemma and some are just really funny. The live action cabaret hostess minigame is actually enjoyable, even if it's shorter than the previous games and lack depth that Yakuza 6 had. The fact that you can't ask them out for Karaoke is also a bummer but the live action videos itself are acted well enough, some are sweet, some are seductive and some are funny to watch. Pocket Circuit is back, still great as ever and it does have a callback to previous Pocket Circuit. The Boutique is great, although a bit barebones compared to other games with similar feature. The Castle Coliseum is the best version of the series coliseum to date, it can be challenging, chaotic and just really fun to fight.

Gaiden is mostly about quality than quantity. It comes with smaller package than the previous games but still manages to be one of the best RGG games, especially for longtime fans. Coupled with varieties of great soundtrack, the updated gorgeous visual, the beautiful locations and its attention to details and generally just how much optimized the game is, it's made in less than a year  but still a quality game through and through.

A perfect bridge between previous games and Infinite Wealth that not only concludes one of the series' story arc in a beautiful way but also genuinely telling an engrossing and emotional story.",1700853896,1700854114,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Its a roller coaster ride. Its a kick in the chest. It genuinely feels like a reward for playing the last 7 games and It makes me all the more excited for infinite wealth. I can not wait. 

How in the world did RGG studios make such an incredible game in only 6 months? Hell, they gave us more game in 6 months than most devs give us with years of development. What once was meant to be a DLC side story, came out as its own feature game at a reduced price, that barely feels reduced in any way. There is so much on the plate with this game. Returning to sotenbori was a treat, Pocket circuit us back with a vengeance and the Colosseum mini game is better than it has been in like ever. I thought i was going to hate the agent fighting style, but my god its actually fun. Dont let the over the topness of it all steer you away. Game play is king and agent style is super fun. The story is amazing as i expected, it was great to see the events of 7 from kiryus perspective, but as i stated before the ending of this game takes the cake and is probably the best in the franchise. I would not recommend this one to first timers though. This game is the culmination of YEARS of games and the impact of the story will be greatly lessened by not having played all of that first. go play 0 or kiwami first.

The performance is out of this world. The game Looks and runs incredibly. How does it look better and run better than all the games before it? So many games get released broken these days and get fixed as they go, but i didnt have a single crash or bug in my almost 50 hour playthrough. SEGA remains my goat, and they do no wrong in my eyes. 

I have one complaint. I wish the mid fight cut scenes had more QTEs like they use to. There are like 4 in the game and i think the QTEs made the scenes feel 1000% better and more involved.  

Please SEGA. More of this. More Gaidens between major releases. You have a wealth of amazing characters to make a wealth of new stories. You know a Majima game would sell like crazy.

The story is easily right up there with Yakuza 0 with a very good mix of comedy and serious moments that everyone has come to love. The quality of cut scenes and cinematics have improved so much and it was an absolute joy to watch.

Combat feels nice although it definitely feels a bit lacking when compared to previous games. There's a smaller variety of heat actions which is a shame and combat is significantly easier as extreme heat mode is a very easy way to cheese most fights. Boss fights are definitely much less fun than compared to previous titles where each boss has a quirk; most of the boss fights in this game feel the same. However, the introduction of Agent style more than makes up for it. I've had way more fun beating people up and throwing them all around than in any other previous game. Coming from Yakuza 7, it was great to beat people up in the combini again.

Another change from previous games is that substories are all now triggered from a ""HQ"" location which is kind of neat as it is easier to clear through all of them rather than hunting them around town. I can understand why some people might prefer the older method though.

The coliseum was pretty cool but kind of underwhelming due to the ability to cheese fights with extreme heat mode. The team fights also felt kind of forced in and at some point, they become very annoying due to the insanely high health pool of some of the ""boss"" and ""mini-boss"" characters can be.

Overall it was a really fun game and well worth it's full price. Steam Deck compatibility from launch was also a really neat bonus.",1700839190,1700839190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For those wondering, LAD Gaiden takes place after the story of Yakuza 6, and during the events of Yakuza 7 Like a Dragon, where we figure out and follow the story as to where Kiryu went and disappeared to after the events of 6, and how he ended up in 7 Like a Dragon. 3 Years after the Y6 you understand quick and clear why Kiryu did what he had to do to keep his loved ones safe and erase his name. His challenges and trials during the game to keeping his situation a secret as he's supposed to be a dead man. Only for him to realize Yakuza guys can't take a hint or keep a secret.

The story as always is heaven sent, with clear and very concise understand everything without having to go back. It sucks you in just like every single game they've made for Yakuza. The boss battles and long battles are always a joy to get into, and you feel like a kid in a candy shop just from doing the wacky side quests. And upgrading Kiryu with his Agent and his Legendary Yakuza style was a pure joy grinding for and then taking it into battle with some hooligans on the streets. 

There is only 5 chapters but of course there is no sense of this game feeling short at all. There is plenty to do, as long as you are not in a point of a story where you can't go out and explore. They will make that clear, but you can really take your time with the game without feeling like you have to prioritize anything. Here's just a taste of what you can do.

*Pocket Circuit Racing (Yes it's back for our 50 year old Kiryu XD)
*Fight in The Castle Coliseum (Yes it returns and it's so easy to make money for upgrades)
*Karaoke (Real fan service here with references to the past Yakuza titles)
*Akame Requests (which is reskinned wacky side quests but the wackiness and humor is still here. With a TON of references and special guest appearances from past games and even from Judgment.)
*Buy Clothes for Kiryu (Coliseum, Free Roam and Story)
*Go to the Casinos
*And of course give knuckle sandwiches to street punks

I also wanted to speak a bit on the final chapter without spoiling anything. It was the perfect tie in and ultimate way to finish off the game with preparing for the Omi Alliance and Tojo Clan disbandment. Main reason why I love this so much is because I got to see Ichiban and his friends there, and (in a way) seeing them fighting side by side protecting Watase and Daigo. I was totally fanboying from start to finish, from the moment the camera pans into the room before his speech just seeking and looking for Ichiban like it's Where's Waldo, to seeing Kiryu come in with that punch and remove his glasses to Ichiban, Maejima and Saejima. Seeing this through Kiryu's perspective and seeing the dragon himself meet his successor and equal, along with that heart filling smirk Kiryu gives to Ichiban when he saw him reveal his dragonfish back tattoo really helped make this game for me. And to end it all off with a epic long battle with the Yakuza legends, and then to finish off, a boss battle to end the game that will have you remember the events and villain of Yakuza 5. Just a big chef kiss.

And of course, Kiryu's breakdown and him crying at the closing moments of the game was enough to bring me to tears just like everyone else. We all want Kiryu to be happy and he deserves it and the world 10x over for his heart of gold and influence on others. I'm hoping there will be some closure and happy ending to his story, but I'm already looking forward to Infinite Wealth so much.

In conclusion, RGG has made yet another 10/10 classic for the Yakuza franchise. THIS, is what gaming is about, and what AAA gaming should be. No bugs, god sent story, ultimate fan service, never ending action, fun and remarkable gameplay, and no micro transactions or nickle and diming fan-bases. From the bottom of my heart, thank you RGG. You guys deserve the whole world and more for making incredible games. I pre ordered this game from you guys, took a day off work just to play it, ordered pizza and I didn't regret it not one bit. 

I'm already putting down my pre-order for Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and it's going to be probably the best birthday gift (or in my case belated Birthday gift since my bday is on the 22nd of January) I will ever receive. I'm looking forward to seeing Ichiban and Kiryu side by side together against the evils they will face.

Thank you for all the memories and heart gripping stories RGG! Never change!",1700793090,1700793090,True,2,0,0.553398072719573975,0,True,False,False

This game leans pretty heavily into plot points from Yakuza 3-6 and a little of Like a Dragon 7 so it would behoove anybody thinking of playing this game to play those at the very least. 

As far as the gameplay goes, the combat is back to the older beat-em-up style offering many of the previous moves from Yakuza 6 with an all new Agent style that starts off feeling a bit underwhelming but evolves into a fantastic means of crowd control by the end.  Many of the series' staple minigames are back which serve as less of a healthy distraction in this game and more of the bulk of the overall gameplay. 

Ultimately, I believe that this game may be a bit rough for those who are not familiar with the series already and may be a bit short for those who aren't super into the franchise or aren't one of those who force themselves to complete the game 100% but outside of that, it still holds up modestly well to the other entries that precede it.",1700791487,1700791487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has its highs and lows, and even my least favorite game, Yakuza 5, is still something i would consider a very good game respectfully. Some people still deemed me a bit harsh torwards it, and honestly after playing this i'm realizing how right they were because holy shit.

Like a dragon gaiden is the first game that was made post the departure of its usual game director, Toshihiro Nagoshi, and i didn't think it would make that much of a difference. My bad relationship with this game starts with what i have seen so far of Yakuza Infinite Wealth. 

Hawaii as a setting is fun on paper but in execution? Yakuza is a very political series, regardless of how you want to see it. And the game has made its stance clear by putting how much emphasis on how it is part of the USA and you get to dress up as a cowboy to shoot down the natives while the party has no darker skinned characters to begin with. Oh and you're friend with Richardson now. When in Ishin released this year there was so much emphasis on how colonization was bad and you even slashed the ever loving shit out of his old time equivalent and his men. Its only made worse by having a animal crossing happy home paradise type game set in a real life area and its primarily done for tourists... around a time where a shit ton of natives of hawaii lost their homes. Kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially when you consider Ichiban was literally fighting his own brother for the rights of the less fortunate and minorities only a mainline game ago.

So that kinda soured my experience but i figured ""infinite wealth isn't out yet and this new spin-off is coming soon, perhaps it will help contextualize some things and build my curiosity torwards where the story goes and make me want to check out infinite wealth after... Yakuza is a game i play for the story first and foremost after all... and uh... yeah even on that aspect the game is just not great.

I'll say the game's greatest strenght is the improvement on its combat, besides some weird changes, its good for the most part especially compared to past dragon engine RGG games. Sonic the fighters is fun too!

As for the negatives uh...
-If like me, Kiryu's part in yakuza 5 was your least favorite cause it just felt like kiryu torture porn making him miserable for the sake of it, that's this game's story from the get go. Forget the potential of starting with a clean slate with a new alias as a super agent. That goes out the window really fucking fast for the saaaaame tired shit of 'we need you back in the game'. 
-I figured after 7 we went past the whole ""chinese/korean people are evil"" trope of early game but they really insisted on getting back to this shit.
-Yakuza always had softcore porno stuff that was always exclusively optionnal. And most of it was usually in-universe and in-engine stuff that still keeps you somewhat immersed in the characters and the world you live in. Gaiden really really REALLY wanted you to go through their creepy live action recorded first person cabaret club where you have the least normal conversation possible with a porn actress and then put so much emphasis on how much of a degenerate and pervert you are when you literally cannot progress the story without going through it. That shit felt straight out of trash like 'the seducers' type game it wasn't fun nor immersive like it insisted so much on being.
-There are moments where Kiryu really feels out of character and has the most passive or neutral stance to the most horrible shit happening before him without any hint of disgust or remorse, like straight up slavery. And Kiryu is a christian that goes pray to a church now? Did i miss something?
-Most of the 'positive' of the story is just cheap underwhelming fanservice mean't to go ""REMEMBER THIS GOOD THING THAT YOU LIKED?! REMEMBER IT?!"" but in this case it feels more like a desperate way to keep your attention rather than actually making you meet some old friends

Just... tonally Gaiden (and to an extent, infinite wealth) feels a lot more like how Sega always pushed the marketing of the games rather than how the games actually were in practice/play. No matter how improved the combat or gameplay feels Yakuza is a series primarily carried by its characters, narrative and tone and right now it just feels so fucking wrong and doesn't build me any confidence in the future of the series. I might revisit this game later and i could end up being wrong about 8 but its not particularily looking good for me so far. 

And honestly trying to have any crititism or conversation about that leads to people going ""ITS JUST A VIDEO GAME"" or ""STFU YAKUZA IS PEAK"" which to me translates to ""stop asking questions. Just consume the product and get excited for the next one to come out"". SF6 had some yikes bits in its handling of its story and touchy subject but i did not expect street fighter to be a pinnacle in story telling. Yakuza i know can do better and its not looking this way.

Although, if you are a yakuza fan, the last chapter will probably make up for the all the shortcomings this game has. 

Combat is kinda clunky. I like it better than K2 and 6, but it is still not that fun compared to Yagami from Judgment. The agent style is way too op if you max out everything, but it's fun to look at Joryu using these crazy gadgets. The yakuza style is alright. It's good for 1v1 but that's all I have to say about it. I recommend using mods for this. It's a lot more enjoyable imo.

The substories are on yakuza's standard, but the other main side content is meh. It's just fetch quest and ""go beat this group"" over and over again. Some of them require you to find a certain place and take a picture. Overall it's there to pad out the game time. 

Coliseum, on the other hand, is the best one we got so far. The variety of fights. You can play as other characters (with a very limited moveset.) Also, there is a nice surprise for those who are a fan of this series if you clear almost every fight.

Soundtrack is alright. There are good tracks there, but not a lot imo. Might be due to not many memorable scenes. New karaoke song is good though. 

The only thing I'm super disappointed about is that, there's no new game plus and legend difficulty.  Only recommended if you are invested in Kiryu's story and have played Yakuza 3 and 6 (Although I urge you to play them all before this one.)",1700753144,1700753249,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

TLDR I do not recommend it for current price (50$) and would recommend waiting for sale . Can easily recommend it for 30$. It just feels like a dlc turned standalone game and reminds me a lot of current COD MW3 situation
- There's only one city (Osaka) and it's reused from Kiwami 2/LAD , the first chapter does feature yokohoma for like few scenes and goes unused for the rest of the game. I was expecting them to have 3 cities (Yokohoma, Kamarucho and Sotenbori) but only one goes used.
- The minigames suck for the most part. Pocket circuit racing (I seriously don't get people hype behind it) is just reused from Y0/kiwami with barely any changes and just overall reusing minigames in Like a dragon games IMO is bad idea since most of them are ""oh that's cool"" things that overstay their welcome in the same games they featured in. This includes pocket circuit racing and it's annoying enough that they are mostly tied to substories and you have to play and beat them for Amon fight. I think if you reuse minigames, reusing it more than one time makes it extremely boring and just lazy. One thing I will say that they did good job on is hostess club. The fact they using FMV add to the experience and also they made it not grindy at all like in past titles. Don't even get me started on another fighting ring that's again is boring as hell and has substories tied to it so you must do it.
- The main story is extremely short. Even though my play hours said 20h, 4 h was actual story content while rest was filled with grindy boring minigames. The overall story also felt relatively weak, it did had some good characters but yeah.
- The substories are extremely boring and uninspiring. Again, there are very few good ones but most of them are ""THERES THIS GANG AROUND TOWN, BEAT THEM UP"" and then after you do that ""THERES ANOTHER RIVAL GANG, BEAT THEM UP"" and that's like legit 75% of substories, just pure filler.
- Amon fight sucked ass, but atleast it wasn't as bad as Inshin

I don't know if this is true or not, but to me, this feels like it was made by the same B team that made Inshin remake and it shows. Again, fine if it's on sale and if you are a fan of series, but this is not a good ""entry point for a franchise"" like SEGA is promoting it and honestly, I would skip this one unless you're a fan or wait for sale. I can't justify 50$ for it and probably the second like a dragon game that left me unsatisfied and I just did not enjoy fully (first being inshin)

PROS
>arena/coliseum has royal rumble and tornado tag teams now and is the most refined it has ever been. They've combined the team management from Kiwami 2 / Y6 with the classic arena/coliseum aspect of the old games
>pocket circuit is back
>agent style is fun but a bit weak (changing styles on the regular is recommended)
>fluid combat w/ instant style switching same in Lost Judgment
>dragon engine

CONS
>They lied with the cabaret club ""mini game"" being a manager one
>live action cabaret customer is weird and eerie as fuck and should be banned from Yakuza games. Also, it took a lot more space to have those videos.
>combat progression focused too much on the new agent style
>you have to go to the hideout and access the akame network menu to accept good lengthy side missions
>so far, no ""job"" where you can get loads of money other than fighting in the arena or be a slaving wagie of akame

Not only does it have the most polished version of the combat style we've seen Kiryu use since the old days, and not only is the story very well crafted (what else would you expect from RGG?), but it really delivers for the money. There is SO MUCH content to do, the substories are really entertaining, there are dozens of minigames, and more minigames within minigames (take the SEGA arcade for example), and fighting for fun has never been more true. The spy gadgets also are also a hella fun addition, and you can use them in most Coliseum battles (which are also the best iteration of the Coliseum to date).

I don't care what anyone says, I preordered the deluxe edition of this game and I feel like I got my money's worth. DEFINITELY A 10/10 GAME!

The new fighting mechanics is great and fans will notice the various throwbacks to the previous games here and there.

Still there are lots of contents to go around and looking at how the Yakuza era ended from Kiryu's perspective is rather interesting.

If you know what that is already then you know what to be in for. 
If you don't know then I suggest starting with at least Yakuza 0 / Yakuza 7.
The game also includes characters from Judgement / Lost Judgement.

The game-play starts off mediocre but quickly ramps up once the player gets access to upgrades and can get money easily at the arena. The new agent fighting style very quickly becomes fun to use.

The DLC was worth it for me to play Majima again but it is not really necessary. In all honesty they should have made a Majima game since we kinda know what happens to Kiryu already.

If you do not have cash and / or time available you can skip this or buy it on sale. It is a good game but there are better in the series.

To indirectly quote one of the comical substories - they really went balls out with this one. We get the marvelous, over-the-top combat with wacky special agent/007 style gadgets, which in my humble opinion culminated in the most memorable [spoiler]Amon[/spoiler] fight in the series.
The main story consists of five chapters, which together with requests (substories), colliseum and minigame completion required for 100% achievements take about 35 hours, possibly much shorter if you decide not to take your sweet time with it. After completing the final we get to play premium adventure mode which allows to experience all side content. There is no NG+ implemented (yet).
Once we finish the story we get the possibility to play the demo of Infinite Wealth. The transition from finale to story demo is quite smooth, but once the first combat starts one might realize how bittersweet this demo inclusion is. After hours of having a great time and silly fun with Gaiden's actual combat system we get... the JRPG turn-based combat. Of course it had some major revisions since release of the 7th installment, including combo attacks with party members, possibility to move around during combat (crazy, I know), and area of effect display for AoE skills and attacks. Those changes allow a much more tactical approach, but still walking away from the great active combat style to turn-based one is the saddest part of the series current direction.
So grab Like a Dragon Gaiden and enjoy the action combat, we Yakuza fans all know and love, in its possibly greatest display, as it may very well be the last time we get to see it.

This is how the game should introduce us to what drives the intention to [spoiler]dissolve[/spoiler] the Yakuza gang that we’ve all attached to for the 7 games with the proper explanation.

Not suddenly like, Bam! Here is your new protagonist. It will not be the same man you all were playing in 7 Yakuza games ago. Also, here we also change the game to turn-based. We are sure you all will like it.

NO! HELL NO!

I’m not sure why Yakuza: Like a Dragon got an “Overwhelmingly Positive” review on Steam and everyone else praised and claimed this is “Game of the Year” ""a 10/10"" where it did not really deserve it in my opinion.

“Yakuza: Like a Dragon” is a letdown and a slap to everybody face who play Yakuza 0 to 6. (Actually, it started to slap the player face since Yakuza 6 …with that kind of story 😠)

Did anyone who reviewed that game a recommended actually play the previous installment of the series before? Because I’m sure if they did play those games. They’ll have different opinions about Yakuza 7.

But here, this is what we want. The conclusion to Kiryu's story we all deserved.

Story was very short, but sweet, dramatic, funny, interesting and overall emotional like the rest of the stories in this franchise. Gaiden introduced new characters, who became almost iconic to me, they fit into the world perfectly, are awesomely voiced/acted and they just feel like real people.
Side content wise, it is again stupid how many activities you can do. Fan favourite Pocket Circuit is back, still holds up to this day and it is enjoyable as hell. Substories are not weak at all, I was surprised in how many new situations main protagonist ends up in. Even a few nostalgic callbacks made an appearance. Playing a Yakuza game only for the main story is almost like not playing the game at all. Of course I need to mention customization: hat, glasses, clothes, rings, earrings, gloves, shoes, and so on, pure awesomeness.

Like the original title of the game tells us, it is a side story to Yakuza 7, don't expect Gaiden to have a nuclear impact on the whole franchise, but at the end, you will certainly tear up at least. Thanks to this game, I understand the story of Yakuza 7 more, Gaiden takes you behind the scenes and some things becomes clearer.

No but seriously, this game is among the best, even though it's the shortest mainline game in the series. The story's pacing is faster than usual, which is a nice change. Cast is a 10/10.
I have not played Lost Judgment before this game so in terms of combat it's different for me since I'm experiencing stuff like juggling for the first time. Regardless, it's extremely satisfying, especially once you get all the upgrades and gadgets with Agent style and this is the best Kiryu Dragon Engine combat hands down.

Combat is also very dynamic and fun, which really makes you wish, that upcoming games of the series will pick up this kind of combat system again, because the next title will be a turn based one. 

Well, what can i say: It's a Yakuza/Like a Dragon Game: Amazing story, great setting and combat system and a lot of stuff to do that keps you from progressing the main story, because you have such a good time doing stuff and ignoring the fact, that you have important things to do, that could cost or save lifes...but well, playing Pocket Circuit is mandatory.

pros : 
- gives closure on what happened to kiryu in-between 6-7 
-beautiful graphics. The world are so lived in
-enemies realistically swinging at you in numbers instead of standing around lol
-in later game you get to walk around in main story as your customized kiryu and that include him in pre-rendered cutscenes. Pretty neat
- fight in coliseum as daigo dojima 

cons :
game optimization sucks ass. Its like LAD 7 all over again ( i have nvidia rtx 3060 and it should have run the game just fine ) . The game would lag whenever i encounter random fights
which did not happen in my judgment or not as frequent in my lost judgment playthrough. Lowering the quality didnt help ( i hope they fix this )

this game has so many callbacks for the entire of RGG games.
you need to play the series to appreciate every detail the game gives us.
parallel time line with Yakuza: Like a dragon, and beautiful ending (Yeah, I cried).
banger soundtrack.
Fluid combat.

downside:
-too easy for 100% achievements (similar to Yakuza 6).
-I have a hunch that cabaret club feature is the last one they made and no time to improve it, no 3D model, little depth of hostess story, made for fan service only and impactless.
-DLC game that decided to be stand alone game, so 5 chapters and no new game+

The main story is very short relative to past games, so it is very obvious it is being padded out with Akame side content to slow down the progress. During the early parts it does not affect the pacing that much, but during late game the point requirements forces the player to do all the substories and minigames for points, on top of grinding for stupid amount of money in the Castle, to upgrade abilities.

The battle system is  like Judgement(two styles), one for solo and another for group. Classic battle style is good from the get go but Agent requires a lot of investment in abilities to become usable and eventually very fun. Suzuki Taichi's basic moves are greatly simplified in this entry so being able to call 20 drones to do the fighting instead is great to have. 

On the topic of fights, from a pure game play pov there are no memorable fights nor bosses in the mainline quest, maybe in a longer game there will be more time for character developments to hype things up, but boss fights are shockingly plain. Past entries you have some random guy that bust out the door with machine guns, and chainsaws, and some other . In this entry the most interesting boss is a dude wielding a tanto that gets knocked out before he can even show anything.....

Perhaps the most praiseworthy aspect of Y7.5 is the graphics. On a mid range set up I can max out every graphic setting and still run the game stable at 60fps. The lighting, assets, special effects and detailed character models looks amazing in most environment. Compared to Y7, it felt like there is a greater emphasis on uping the saturation and contrasts to make cut-scenes more dramatic, sometimes it gets too dark to see any details on default gamma settings.

Overall: Amazing teaser for Y8, play it.",1700646797,1700646797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of references to many of the games in the series along with meeting certain people from a certain similar series, shows that they really wanted to solidify this game into the series.

I highly recommend playing this only if you've experienced the game Yakuza: Like a Dragon and the games before, since many of the events that take place in this are related to key events of that game.

The combat feels more polished than what Kiryu was left with in 6, making him feel the best he's been since Yakuza Kiwami. Agent Style adds a new feel to the game, akin to hack and slashes with the way Kiryu mows through crowds of enemies using his new Spider gadget. Yakuza Style felt like a lite version of Kiryu's iconic Dragon style, which isn't bad since it is taking the backseat for Agent Style.

The game definitely feels like one you should complete in one playthrough, since the length isn't as long as the other titles in the series. The game starts off with many cutscenes, but you'll start to see more and more things unlock as it goes on. You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you rush through the game, as you won't get the most bang for your buck. The game has so much to offer with it's coliseum mode. It gives us a chance to experience the game outside of the main Yakuza cast. Not to mention if you beat the game, you can play the trial of the next game in the series.

Overall, the story alone was enough to keep me involved, but the substories and the new content kept me wanting to play more. Real Yakuza play Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name",1700631738,1700631738,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It takes place simultaneous, and shortly after the events in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. It makes me genuinely excited to see what is in store for the continuation of Ichiban Kasuga's saga in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.

Though it is highly recommend that you play Yakuza 3 and 6 to get the most enjoyment out of the story or at the very least seeing a summary of those games (the story serves fine if you haven't). There's a lot of divisive opinion on what everybody's favourite Yakuza game but honestly there is at least something to look forward to if you are just a fan overall, Yakuza 5 fans especially. In terms of side-content, there's plenty to do with the coliseum, pocket circuit, minigames and sub-stories, you'll find yourself putting atleast 10-20 hours into those. It's also the easiest platinum trophy and 100% completion record if you also care about that.

Wasn't sure if I was gonna enjoy it all that much, and I really did anyways. To start off, for newcomers/those who just started with 7, I don't think you should start with this game. RGG did say that this game is sort of tailored towards those starting with 7 to get a better understanding of Kiryu before Infinite Wealth comes out and he returns to the spotlight, but there's enough nostalgia bait in this game (particularly in the substories) to where I believe that it is best enjoyed after playing through the rest of the series. But if the length of the series seems too daunting (because it is), then there's nothing wrong with playing this after just 7 maybe.

For the story itself, it's unique in that it's not the most recent game in the timeline, rather being set at the same time as 7. As the trailers and price tag explained, it's the shortest mainline game in the series. So you would think that hey, we know what's supposed to happen by the end of the game, and we know that they don't have as long of a story to dive that deep into the plot either. So why should play it? And although the story may seem ""safe"" in some regards, it is still nonetheless a very enjoyable one. It does suffer from the RGG signature early game slog, but the payoff is more than worth it. If we're talking about a proper sendoff for Kiryu, then this game does a much better job at doing so as compared to 6 (although I enjoyed that story as well).

The main selling point for me personally coming into this game was the combat. And with 2 extra games of experience (thank you Judgment series) it feels like this game's combat is a true redemption for Kiryu in the Dragon Engine. RGG has perfected the real time combat for this engine, and playing the DoD style from K2 and 6 (which were pretty meh experiences) and it being so enjoyable here nearly brought tears to my eyes. I also liked how different the agent style was, with it's faster moves and the gadgets of course. The scale of the fights are also bigger in the literal sense, with many group fights (even random encounters) having close to 10 or more enemies at once. Some may find this as a negative (and it did get a bit tiring at one point) but nonetheless I can still say that Gaiden may have my personal favorite combat in the series.

I only just finished the game so I can't talk much about the side content in terms of minigames. The main two parts of side content are the Akame Network and the Castle and its Coliseum. For these two I have both pros and cons. The rewards from the Akame Network are pretty good in this game, and my main choice for grinding out money. However, I am still a bit on the fence about the Akame Network itself, being a spiritual successor/replacement for The Florist (and the Castle replacing Purgatory). I do wish that there were actually substories you can chance upon randomly, rather than them all being from the Network. The format of each substory also felt a bit more toned down, with a lot more straightforward ""turns out he's the bad guy and now we fight"" rather than the series' signature goofy shenanigans. This in turn kinda bored me out in grinding them, which sucks because there are a lot of substories requiring previous ones to be completed meaning that I was not able to do them. Maybe I missed out on some of the best ones, who knows.

The Coliseum in this game is pretty damn fun, and I think it's super cool that you can play as any member of your clan. It's the reason why I preordered rather than wait a bit after release, because I wanted to get the DLC and play as some past favorites. Of course their combat is ripped straight out of the previous games with little touchup (so Majima is still awful to play as), but given there's so many new fighting styles you get to use (with most of them being ripped from previous bosses in the series), I can't complain that much.

Overall, Gaiden really surprised me by becoming one of my personal favorites in the series. The visuals and sound are fantastic, with the Castle of course being the highlight in terms of areas. Such a colorful and chaotic mess that I need to spend more hours in to truly enjoy. It's a bit sad to hear that RGG is probably moving away from the Dragon Engine, as it only just feels like they have perfected it. There are some weird omissions from this game, such as NG+, Legend difficulty (although I think the professional difficulty was a good enough challenge), and no premium adventure without beating the game. All signatures of the series, hoping that the future entries bring them back. Also no ""Real Yakuza use a gamepad"" before the title screen bring that back please lol.

One last thing to note, the finale of this game is really damn good. As in like, best final boss in the series good. Character, presentation, and difficulty were all made to perfection, chef kiss. And after all that badassery it still managed to give some really emotional moments, and I was indeed crying towards the end. For a game so short, a DLC-turned standalone entry pumped out in 6 months, it's incredible how I think this might be one of my top 3 Yakuza games.

Gameplay is top notch and nobody can't tell me otherwise, this is the peak of the dragon engine (maybe even better than lost judgment's one), the music I think there wasn't that much bangers compared to other games but it still doesn't disappoint imo. 
Akame gotta be the best female character ever introduced in the series besides Haruka, my ''free thinker'' mind just leaves my body when she tells me something and I'm so glad that her cover of Like a Butterfly made it to spotify in my region (that hasn't anything to do with the game but I'm so fu**ing joyous rn). Nishitani and [spoiler]Shishido[/spoiler] were pretty meh villains but they were fun to fight against, I mean it's literally Nishitani from 0 but korean, I also really liked the personality and the design of [spoiler]Shishido's[/spoiler] back tattoo.

Briefly touching on the demo, from the like 2 hours of it I played it felt like 7 but more refined and with many of its issues I had with it fixed and really does feel like 7, 2 and I cant wait for 8 in a few months

Whilst it only took me 33 hours to 100% the game I still feel happy I bought it at full price but if you arent as much of a die hard yakuza/LAD fan like I am I can understand holding off on it to a sale even though I personally think its worth the price tag.

For newcomers to the Yakuza series or those who haven't played Yakuza: Like A Dragon, this game may is not the best.

I specifically have issue with the story and pacing. I was hoping the story would be a little longer especially where there were time jumps or just small slideshows explaining how the story went. While I understand the game's relatively short development cycle (6 months according to a dev), it's easy to see in the lack of fleshed-out gameplay elements. Going into the game I was really hoping to [spoiler]go back to Yokohama and relive the battle between Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban from Like A Dragon. Unfortunately this only talked about after a massive time jump.[/spoiler] Even an appearance by [spoiler]Ichiban as a Castle opponent[/spoiler] would have been satisfying.

I would recommend the game only if you've played Yakuza: Like a Dragon AND have played most of the other Kiryu games. It effectively explains Kazuma Kiryu's whereabouts and his appearance in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The ending is particularly well done, then transitions into the upcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth game and bundled demo for it.

I do like what's been done with the Castle and think the system could integrate a lot more battles and opponents to make it interesting. To get some of the achievements and skills in the game, you effectively need to grind battles over and over again which loses it's charm pretty quick.

Overall, I think this game exists to ease you into the Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth game coming out next year. It does an OK job at explaining the side of Kazuma Kiryu during the events of Yakuza: Like a Dragon but most of the payoff comes from the ending. However, I would hesitate to recommend this game to casual fans of the series or newcomers. I do not think $50 is a good price for the game ESPECIALLY since you can get Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 for $18 in a bundle right now.

All jokes aside, this game has been a blast. It's rare to see a game nowdays with almost a flawless performance on it's release, yes it has Denuovo, but it doesn't effect the game while playing. 

Kiryu's story after the events of Yakuza 6 is something I always wondered and I am satisfied with that I got, the story is good, it takes place during the events of Yakuza: Like a Dragon so do note that you might encounter some spoilers for that game down the line. The game is short, yes, it only has 5 chapters, but there's load of other side missions and stories that sort of make up for its length. 

The combat is also good, it ain't perfect, but it's fun as heck once you get used to it. The Agent and Yakuza style are good, but both have their ups and downs. From my experience the Agent style is best when dealing with the group of enemies, meanwhile Yakuza style is good for one on one encounters. 

The agent style introduces gadgets that are fun to use and are pretty solid for most part, though upgrading them should be one of the priorities, at least to level 2. 

The Yakuza style is good old fashion brawler style Kiryu pretty much used through out his games, you get to unlock all of the classics, like Tiger Drop- which to this day is still one of the best skills to use.

The one thing I hate about this game is the fight with Justice robot dude during the Coliseum story. This fight is just absurd, dude whipes out your whole maxxed out team within like 40 seconds. 

Overall, while this game is shorter than most games, it gives us enough content to satisfy until Infinite Wealth releases.

Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name takes place in parallel to Yakuza Like A Dragon (Like a Dragon 7) and you play as Kazuma Kiryu (now using a fake name ""Joryu""), the classic protagonist of the series. Planned as a DLC package for Like a Dragon 8 Infinite Wealth, Gaiden is shorter than most entries and feel like a lot of its parts are made with less budget and time.

That being said, this is still a very entertaining game from RGG. These guys know how to make the most out of a small open world and the grounded setting. Plenty of minigames, progressions, and side stories that are worth sinking your time into, not only because they're fun and have depths beyond the surfaces, but they also give you resources to unlock upgrades for Joryu in combat. And trust me, you'd want to have some upgrades.

The combat system in Gaiden is somewhere between Judgement, Lost Judgement, and Yakuza 5. Joryu has 2 fighting styles, Yakuza and Agent. Agent is a brand-new style to the series, it focuses on fast and long combo string, 3 consecutive side-stepping, and sci-fi gadgets like drones, Spider Man web wires, rocket-powered shoes, and cigarette bombs. Yakuza is a combination of Dragon Engine Kiryu's Dragon of Dojima style and some moves from his older games. Yakuza style's attack speed can feel quite slow, but not overly clunky like Yakuza 6, similar to Judgement. This game also features enemy-juggling, which was first seen in Judgement and streamlined in Lost Judgement. Joryu's combat rhythm and capabilities can open up even the stronger foes for some nasty juggling combo. While juggling and gadgets sound fun and powerful, enemy AI in Gaiden seem tampered to be more aggressive and opportunistic in their strikes. Lost Judgement (the latest Dragon Engine game) seemed to have AI's that are afraid to hit the player and often leave you alone while you combo attacks either regularly or while juggling. Meanwhile Gaiden's enemy AI doesn't care where you are in the arena or what you're doing, they will try to hit you and get you off a combo. So most of the time while you're fighting multiple foes, you'll have to utilize everything to create yourself some space or dispatch the weaker enemies quickly. The Heat mechanic also returns, but it is nerfed pretty harshly. The Heat bar that allows you to use Heat actions or activate Extreme Heat goes up rather slowly in Gaiden. So, either you have to stock up on heat-regenerating items or use it very sparingly, either way you cannot spam it like in the older games.

[b] The reason why I can't say this is a must-play [/b] is highly dependent on a player's investment to the series. I'd say that if you only played 1 or 2 Kiryu games, then Gaiden wouldn't be as worthy to you. But if you're invested in the series, the story, the gameplay, and universe, I'd say this is a must-play, implying you haven't played it already. This game tells a very interesting and emotion part of Kiryu's life story but not necessarily required to enjoy future or older games.

One more thing I find weird (and noticed when it got worse) in this game is the lighting. Most RGG games are fine with their lighting, even with Kiwami 1&2's green filter, scenes from those game don't look out of place and offer a consistent imagery experience throughout each one. But Gaiden has a focus on darker shadows and overall color level contrast of the image. This might be to some people's preference but I just find it a bit jarring. Seeing bright particle effects over a dimly lit environment, while contact and cast shadows are sometimes too dark and sometimes too bright that they don't seem to exist, threw me off from the experience a bit. Some scenes nailed the high-contrast lighting perfectly, such as the prologue scene with blue and red lights on each side and the shadows are dark and threatening. While some scenes like the final boss fight has less detailed lighting, overly reliant on baked and static textures and colors. It's a good game for screenshots sometimes, but not most of the time imo.

I still give it a 7.5/10, a good Yakuza game, through and through. Even with shortcomings from short development time and branding as a side-game, it still offers a completed Yakuza experience through good story, memorable characters, cool set-pieces, abundant side activities, soundtracks, and satisfying combat system.",1700601480,1700601480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is great however a little less fleshed out when compared to something like LJ however is pretty nice and bound to be better with mods. There is a surprising amount of content to this game and the fact that RGG is pretending pretending this game is small is really saying something about their future projects specifcally yakuza 8 wich this game is prequel too in a way and leads into some nice chracter development.

Short story with a lot of filler at the start and about 5 actual substories that have any thought put into them, the rest being menial tasks that have hardly any substance. 

They also seem to have regressed in the combat department, it is very clunky and unresponsive, and I hate with a passion that you have to press X to toggle run even in combat. This was a completely braindead decision by the developers. There are a lot of design decisions that I just do not understand. The agent style's most developed gadget, the spider, being that it is the only one with any actual abilities tied to it, does not even work on boss fights in any capacity. The agent style just feels kinda useless in boss fights in general, and the clunky controls do not help at all. The gadgets feel underdeveloped in general, it would've been nice to have some heat moves tied to them, like one where you rush towards the enemy using the rocket boots could've been pretty entertaining. It feels like there aren't many heat moves in general really. The yakuza style doesn't feel great also, but I feel like it's more of a problem because of how the enemy AI works. You have a lot of charge attacks you can use but the enemies seem to block and dodge more often than in the other games, barring maybe Yakuza 3, and they completely block charge attacks, so you can be mid combo and want to go for a charge attack and they will just go into a block and completely negate it. It's fun at times but there's been much better combat in the series and you'd think they'd try to improve it every game, but it seems to go up and down.

I enjoyed the story itself but for the first few hours I was pretty bored. I enjoyed the intro but then I just didn't really care for much of what happened until you [spoiler] rescue Hanawa [/spoiler]. The tutorials and introductions to systems were just not interesting and more grating than they are in the other games. However it does get pretty decent later on, with a nice finale that leaned into 7 quite well.

Absolutely incredible game and a perfect installment to the Yakuza/LAD series for longtime fans. Gaiden is definitely the kind of follow up I desired after Y6 and Y7. ESPECIALLY Y6.

It follows up perfectly on Y6's ending, and really does feel like an important companion piece and closure on a game whose ending is kinda controversial. This game makes a ton of callbacks and connections to previous games across the series with good emotional payoffs, if you've played Kiryu's saga, this game ABSOLUTELY hits like a pink truck.

Normally, most RGG games don't require you playing any prequels, but you'd definitely miss out on a lot of emotional hits if you haven't played Kiryu's games. Not to say it's required, but I feel like this game does a lot that draws on previous games that would be lost on someone starting only with this game.

Also, this game has big spoilers for both Y6's and Y7's endings. Definitely would recommend playing at least Y7 prior.

This game's combat is hella fun, the new Agent style took a bit of getting used to, but omg when it's upgraded more it's definitely fun as fuck. Yakuza style is the best version of the DoD style in the Dragon Engine we've gotten.

The side content is pretty great too. Kinda liked the fact that this was a smaller game. I actually finished every substory and coliseum fight. Even beat the hard super boss fight, which is awesome. Never done that before in a LaD/Yakuza game.

The main story is definitely short, they definitely weren't joking that it was a shorter game. BUT, it has some of the coolest action set pieces and moments I've seen in a Yakuza game. I took, SO, SOOO many screenshots during the course of this game.

The final boss's sequence was actually perfect. Like, the perfect boss, ideology, set pieces, to send off Kiryu's final chapter (as the stand alone sole protagonist). It somehow equals or tops Y5's for me, which is no small feat. 

Might be the best final boss of the main series.

Also, the ending absolutely emotionally destroys you. It hurts so bad. (But in a good way)

for those curious but not fully on board yet, yes, this is canon.
taking place alongside yakuza 7. (think chain of memories and 358 days for comparison)
I recommend playing yakuza 7 first as this game will more or less spoil that game, even if it glosses over certain details.
outside of main story, you're mostly given fetch quests, with traditional sub stories and mini games sprinkled throughout.

this game is notable shorter than the rest of the series. if you B-line it, you're looking at roughly 15-20 hours. that said, the main story is designed to be incredibly difficult in hopes to prevent you from doing that and instead spend time elsewhere in the game.
I did majority of what was there, outside some fetch quests, two sub stories, and a handle of completionist challenges in yakuza fashion (play every minigame, grind out the hostess clubs, etc) finishing the game just a little over the 29 hour mark.
sadly, there doesn't seem to be a legendary difficulty. I like to play as much as I can on normal mode for my first run, then run through it again on legend, but its not here. sure, there is hard mode that will have to satisfy me, but when your series is known for having that extra step up in challenge, it doesn't entice me further when its gone. that said, I do intend to go back and play more eventually, but releasing in the window it did, I can wait till yakuza 8 drops happily.

final verdict: 9/10

For LAD, it was one particular huge difficulty curve introduced in a boss fight that was supposed to be solved by grinding an ""optional"" ladder tower, and the job system whose biggest fault was simply being unbalanced. For Lost Judgment, in order to finish the school stories to their fullest (which, while are totally detached from the main storyline, felt very much like the second most important piece of narrative in the game), you have to suffer through some of the worst minigames ever introduced in this series so far. This catering-to-completionist design mythos is one I've always been mixed on, and I was hoping that RGGS actually takes time to flesh out the more player-oriented mechanics instead of forcing mediocre minigames on us in order to access the best narrative pieces of the game.

And I guess LAD Gaiden is meant to be the answer to that? This 20 hours trip through Sotenbori - historically the smallest and most structurally simplistic city in Yakuza, lasts 5 chapters where the story probably could have been told within 6 hours at most, while the rest of the game acts more like a reintroduction to the city which hasn't been a big focus point since Kiwami 2 and probably will play a role in the third Judgment installment. Gone are the substories that you encounter naturally just by roaming the streets, now they are presented as jobs given by your fixer, a mechanic lifted directly from Judgment's request board. Next to those are the fetch quests/menial tasks that contribute to Akame Network's progression bars and level number. Everything seemingly feeds into another positive feedback loop where the more money, xp and funny looking numbers you earn, the more benefits Kir- I mean Joryu gains. You have much more agency here compared to LAD, no pressure to grind mindless fights, no moment where I found myself being forced to do anything I disliked. 

Even with a better approach towards quantity/quality balance, the act of completing side content remains hampered by a few legacy design decisions. The unnecessary menus where you can't take more than one sub story at once and have to talk to Akame to hear her exposition on the situation.every.fucking.time came off as the most egregious to me. Sotenbori's simplistic layout and bland atmosphere turned exploration into pure boredom after 10 hours of playtime, and the new slingshot gadget that let Joryu grab objects out of reach, while is a nice touch, never got its usability expanded outside of combat and can be safely tossed into ""one-off shallow mechanic"" bin that includes Lost Judgment's parkour. Despite all those relatively mild weak points, LAD Gaiden easily beat out the two last main installments by simply ending the journey before the game itself got obnoxious.

Gaiden's combat shines again, and RGGS even threw in a fighting arena to please players thirsty for brawler bloodshed, an aspect that Lost Judgment did well yet had very little space to unleash due to extremely low combat difficulty. Sadly, the new combat gadgets like drones, explosive cigarettes, and the sling don't spice up Joryu's combat as much as I thought due to imprecise control and extreme heat mode being way too overpowered to the point it thwarted even the best combat moves in the game. Power fantasy catharsis remains high thanks to the much higher number of enemies in each pack which feels like... a Dragon Engine capabilities flex at this point, and hopefully RGGS can polish some leftover kinks to make brawler combat even smoother to engage with in the future.

For fans, the mysterious premise is of course Gaiden's biggest selling point. The main storyline is actually pretty uninteresting and predictable here due to various factors: the Daidoji being painted as a morally ambiguous shadowy organization that feels too mustache-twirling cartoonish in its way of operation to be believable, the two main antagonists are surprisingly cookie cutter in their personality and writing with the only saving grace being their excellent acting performances; the story once again gave Kiryu an easy way out in its midpoint climax and almost became a soap opera. The overall storytelling lacked some of the harsh edges from the Judgment series, or the elegant gut punches that's been a staple in Yakuza's writing since 0, but it nicely filled in some of the missing pieces that led to Kiryu's appearance in LAD which I guess is the whole point of the game. On the bright side, Gaiden introduced some of the most likable allies in the franchise, alongside an ending that both hit you like a spaceship and, strangely enough, teased a continuation of Yakuza 5's unsolved threads. I DON'T NEED SLEEP, I NEED ANSWERS.

While I came off Gaiden somewhat mixed, overall this is still strictly a game for fans and more of a companion piece to LAD and Infinite Wealth first and foremost, so it's easy to chalk it off as an engine experiment for bigger scale combat and preparing side characters for the next installments. Can be placed somewhere in the middle of the pack, not bad but also not very memorable outside of the cast and the ending. Kaito Files still holds the crown for budget short story here.",1700560012,1700560511,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

With no context I think a lot of this might not really hit and at this point, this story is built upon half a dozen games worth of narrative and it's so satisfying to experience it if you've played all the other games. It's chock full of fan service for the earlier games and really hits all the spots you wanted Yakuza 6 to hit, it's a far more personal game for Kiryu and really focuses on him as a character and has some of the best cinematography in the series, so many of the shots are gorgeous and the choreography and spectacle of the fight scenes are great.

This iteration of the arena is so much fun, my only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more content to it because it's so addicting but can be cleared pretty quickly excepting a few of the very high end matches which require pretty set strategies. The team hell rumble matches especially, are brilliant. I loved collecting random characters from the other games and engaging in a massive chaotic brawl with them, gangster pokemon is always fun to engage in with yakuza games. You've got Mr Masochist, Gary Buster Holmes and Sodachi here, just to name a few. 

The new agent style is fun to use, but sadly I found it to be entirely overshadowed by how obscenely overpowered yakuza style is, but it remains very useful for thinning out large crowds. The store pages says you should adapt your style to the situation but you don't really need to... Kiryu has always been a bit of a monster, but he does SO. MUCH. DAMAGE with yakuza mode, especially in extreme heat mode and as a result I found this to be by far the easiest game. It is very satisfying to channel spider-man and definitely non-lethally throw some street thugs into the river though. Jetpack loafers are also good, albeit a bit clunky to use like the bomb cigarette, but it always remained a quirky random style to use for a change rather than a must-use.

I also think this had some of the best acting in the series. Kiryu has always been a very stoic character but his actor really got to show off what an incredible range he has here.

[*]You can change appearance anytime unlike the others where you need to finish the game first. (Eye-wear is a must though)
[*]The coliseum is fun af. Sure it's still a grind but it's way less frustrating.

[h2] This is a spoiler-free review btw :) [/h2]

Gaiden's events happen alongside the events of Yakuza Like a Dragon, here telling the story of a Kazuma Kiryu trying to erase his name under the codename of Joryu. Gaiden relies a lot on Kiryu's past, so a little bit of warning it has all sorts of minor and major spoilers from many games, and also spoilers of the one that happens alongside with it, so do be aware of that. WIth all that said, I was not ready at all for how hard this story would go, main story doesn't beat any longer than maybe 10-12-ish hours but they still manage to pack a whole lot of drama and feelings into this one small package, all of the new characters are memorable, and obviously some good old Kiryu coolness as we love it

Combat throws back to the hack'n slash formula, bringing Kiryu a bit of Judgment influence which is great. Agent style is nimble and tactical, full of gadgets and technical combat, and the Yakuza style brings back the street fighting dragon, full of heavy power and strong strikes. You can't go wrong with either style honestly, both have their unique shine in the right time, combos feel awesome

Side content also goes hard, the Coliseum is the big attraction of this game and the main moneymaker, spending time here experimenting with teams and even playing other characters is mighty fun. Akame Network is quite bulky and important to upgrade abilities, the return of Pocket Circuit is a welcome funsies add, show your charm for the girls in the Cabaret Clubs (this time in live action), visit the Boutique to customize Kiryu's clothes and face, and of course all the usual gambling and sports minigames are present as well. Also, big props for bringing an arcade of Sega Racing Classic 2 (renamed out of Daytona USA 2 due to licensing), that's a first ever PC/console release for that game and I was really excited for it

Dragon Engine had great graphical ugprades, more specifically to lighting, reflections and colors, everything is so much more atmospheric and colorful I love it, and once you have a taste of the Infinite Wealth demo you can tell they meticulously upgraded these departments thinking of this game to deliver a very lively and colorful Honolulu, definitely the peak in graphics for the series

And speaking of, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth Special Trial is an extra gift you earn after beating the main story of Gaiden, packing a short story demo and an exploration demo, it's similar to the same event demo you've seen a few times on youtube but here with even more content and no time restrictions (thankfully!). Needless to say this game is looking and feeling awesome, I could fill another half-review with how many cool details it has but you've read a lot of text at this point already. Can't wait for it now, fueled my hype that was already skyrocketed

Gaiden only has one DLC. Not a huge impact in this one it's more for fanservice funsies, you get three legendary yakuza for the coliseum, obviously they're awesome and strong but if you want to spare some money it's okay, not that much to be lost in terms of content

After you beat the game you can still enjoy Premium Adventure as you always do in the series, but Gaiden unexplainably lacks New Game+ for you to replay the story carrying over your abilities. My theory is that it maybe just maybe could have to do with how Akame Network works, but it's just a silly little theory of mine we never really got word on why's NG+ just missing, but yeah that has to be my only big complaint about this game

[b] To finish this, I want to thank RGG for yet another fantastic release and also make a wish here: a wish that they realize how far Dragon Engine has reached and how great it feels and looks now, please give it some extra thought before moving to Unreal guys, you have a fantastic proprietary engine in your hands. WIth all that said, Gaiden was such a blast, even in a shorter spin-off package they still deliver top quality content as always, and I can't even wait for Infinite Wealth now, crazy how we're just two months shy of it [/b]",1700426872,1700427139,True,39,1,0.77060854434967041,0,True,False,False

It would be best for them to focus more on playing the game, including all the side content, and not rush through the story mode with a clock in hand. Games like this aren't designed for speedrunning. Even though the price is high, I strongly recommend this game.

1) Akame is a great character but ranking up her network often felt like boring busywork which was clearly designed to pad out the runtime of what is a fairly short game. This is especially true of the requests that require you to run all over the map talking to various NPC's placed on opposite ends of the map or fighting groups of gangs scattered across town. These were definitely a chore to get through and they frankly don't do anything for the overall experience. The substories were great though.

2) I wasn't a fan of the live-action hostesses at the cabaret clubs. They felt awkward and forced and frankly unsettling. I had to power through those by skipping through every scene. Fingers crossed they never bring that back.

3) JUSTICE - the Third King bossfight found in the Colosseum - is completely scuffed. Anyone here who has fought him knows exactly what I mean. Not even Amon comes close to the level of bullshit and unfairness found in this fight, almost to the point where I can't quite believe it was intended to be this way. I guess time will tell. In any case, this was the lowest point of the game for me and the only time when I felt frustrated and angry while playing Gaiden. 

Other than that I universally loved everything else. The game is short by RGG standards but by every means sweet and the story is up there with the best this studio have made. I'm more excited than ever for Infinite Wealth and I'm desperately hoping that Kiryu gets the ending we all know he deserves to have.",1700355052,1700356154,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Having finished, here's a breakdown of Likes, Dislikes, and Your Mileage May Vary's:
Pros:
- Brawler combat is back, and so is style switching
- Agent style's gadgets are fun when you get the hang of them
- Coliseum is a lot of fun, and you can play as other characters besides Kir- I mean Joryu
- Story does a great job of bridging 6- Like a Dragon- Infinite Wealth
- Great emotional beats
- Final boss goes so hard
- Infinite Wealth demo is included
- Lots of minigames
- Small things, like the ""in-engine cutscenes"" (that you can skip with the X/A button) feel much more ""cinematic""

Cons:
- YongYea's English Kiryu... not good (from the IW demo. Maybe his Gaiden performance will be better?)
- Some frame drops in the Castle. Also, you can't use your phone camera there? (This restriction is lifted sometime in Chapter 4 due to story events)
- Combat feels like somewhat of a downgrade to Lost Judgment's fluid and fast combat
- You can't change outfits at Akame's office or in the menu-- you have to go to the Castle and do it at the Boutique
-No New Game Plus!!!

YMMVs:
- Story is much shorter than a traditional Yakuza/Like a Dragon game since this was initially planned as DLC for Infinite Wealth before being developed as an interquel
- Not as many skills for both styles for what I was expecting
- DLSS at 1080p makes the game either looked oversharpened or too smooth. Might just be my hardware though (DLSS at 1080p is a no-go)",1699598420,1700339393,True,28,1,0.767395555973052979,7,True,False,False

Yong yea as Kiryu however, he is the epitome of bad American dubs like nothing against the guy, but he can't act for shit he's just generic dramatic moment voice and that's it, he got no range. Like straight up just go play the infinite wealth demo and sing judgement and you'll see what i mean. He William Shatner style talk sings. Jesus Yong I like your show but you knew you were going to be in yakuza hire a singing coach. you can't just say ""I'm going to kill chaos"" in your pucci voice a thousand times and learn to sing. that being said his amateurish performance does add value in a kind of surrealist comedic kinda of way. 

yong if you read this, hire a singing coach and work on a character that's not drama voice, because I'm gonna be real with you. you're only getting gigs right now because you're a youtube guy that's slightly more popular than most anime voice actors, based on that you've done no activism that i'm aware of please evolve. i've seen you're stuff range wise you're still just the ""kill chaos"" voice you were practising when you started. it was either going to be you or ProZD and ProZD decided to sink his career by advocating to race purity in fictional roles, know he was a ""elf should play elf"" guy. 

I'm just going to come out and say it. I think the only reason you got this role is that the American Sega office was drinking the ""Authentic casting"" cool aid. And crappy British rapper/TV cook Big Zuu would of been a more believable Kiryu talking in his normal voice.

That being said you can imagine how good i think the game is overall if that's my only real complaint. just play with subs if you want to take it seriously.

This game was pretty short for Yakuza standards (first playthrough 28 hours without really trying to see everything).
But, by all means, it's a Kiryu game, not a Yakuza game. I don't know how else to explain it, but I loved it. This is really a great game for anyone who, through all the Yakuza titles, grew to love Kiryu and become immersed in his story and life, if you want to play a Kiryu game for once, you now can. See the World from Kiryus eyes, and get up and do some Kiryu things.
One would expect the devs to eventually forget how to properly write an aging, growing character like him, but they don't. At least me, someone who has spent over 600 hours on the Yakuza series now and who loves it with all of his heart, I can only smile when I hear what the big man has to say, it still feels right.
Have fun tiger, get yourself a blind video game experience from Kiryu's perspective, if you can spare the money you should stop reading reviews or looking at content and just dive into this. 
At least, if you liked the rest of the Yakuza series. With this game, I can imagine it will be difficult to enjoy if you haven't played any Yakuza at all.",1700087891,1700321929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You managed to improve upon the classic realtime combat and even give Yagami a run for his money with Kiryu's Gadget based fighting style.

Speaking of Yagami, that goddamn Judgement Crossover meeting with Kiryu in a substory of all places!!!! Made be fanboy cause I've played the Judgement series before this and seeing Kaito and Higashi again made my day!

Also The Fact every recruit you get into the coliseum is playable and they each have their own light and heavy attack combinations, specials and properties just shows how much quality you guys maintain even for a small scale game like this. I can imagine every NPC tough guy I've fought in the main game can actually be playable! 

I dont think its even small scale. theres still so much to do in this game, it could be its own game in the mainline series.

Seriously as a long time fan, I have never cried so loud and ugly as the tablet cutscene with Kiryu. Never even in any film, serie, game or real world event have I cried this hard, beautiful…

This is simply the best story in gaming and my favourite franchise of all time. The music, characters and gameplay all fire. And the fact they told us the story of Kiryu during Ichiban’s story and show then meeting is fucking genius, and going back to the beat-em-up gameplay for Kiryu makes me so fucking happy too.

I can't thank Ryu Ga Gotoku studios enough for their continued release of just brilliant games with god-tier characters and writing, fun gameplay and releasing a Kiryu game AND an Ichiban game back to back!

The only new things in this game are the story(which didn't grab me at all and just felt random even for this series), the secret agent fighting style, and a singular new area that turns out to be a tiny location thats only home to some gambling minigames and the arena. 99% of the game actually takes place in Sotenbori and it's exactly the same as it was in Kiwami 2. Some old minigames we haven't seen in a while, like Pocket Circuit, are back and while it is nice to have them back they are just exactly the same as before. The arcade game selection is pretty choice as well, Daytona 2 rules and Fighting Vipers 2 is cool as well. Paired with Sonic the Fighters, Motor Raid and VF2(wish it was swapped for VF3)all returning its a solid line up. 

Unfortunately the biggest dropped ball here is substories. There are hardly any. Instead they decided to put about a hundred random fetch quests of zero substance all over the map. Give a guy a random food item, pick up kids lost ball thats mere inches away, etc. Many of these do not even reward you in any way either other than filling up a sidequest experience bar that you can get a poultry amount of money from once you fill it and level up. There is a very small number of ""real"" substories but even those do not satisfy. You have to activate them all manually at your base first, where you're then given a run down of whats going on without actually interacting with any of the characters they pertain to, then you just go to where they are on the map, get a little more dialogue and context (if you're lucky), fight and its done. None of them are particularly memorable or funny, but are inoffensive and would all be considered ""low-tier"" in a real Yakuza game that usually has 70+ substories where its more acceptable that not every single one was a knock out. These few substories are quite literally all this game has outside of the insanely short main story so the poor execution and quality of them are immensely disappointing. Had they just ditched all of the nonsense and just made 50 or so classic substories, it could have saved this game and helped make it feel more worth the asking price.

Just about the only positives I have are the new secret agent fighting style and the combat in general. The whip is a lot of fun to use and the explosive cigarettes are absolutely chaotic in small spaces. The drones suck and are worthless though. I know not everyones not a fan of the Dragon Engine combat but I have a lot of fun with it and its no different here. The final boss was great too, awesome choreography and a comical amount of healthbars.

Somewhat unrelated to the game but I'd figure I would mention, the performance on PC is yet again worse than previous games. I really don't understand why but these games have very steadily been running worse and worse with each release despite running on the exact same engine and taking place in the exact same cities and reusing all of the same assets. I have a 3090ti and an i912900Ks. Kiwami 2(which is just about the exact same game as this) and 6 both ran at 4K native and a mostly steady 120FPS maximum settings on my machine. Judgment ran a smidge worse hitting about 80-90FPS and Lost Judgment ran considerably worse barely able to even hit 60FPS most of the time. Unfortunately this game runs like Lost Judgment does just scraping by at 60FPS. DLSS does help tremendously but Ive never been able to fully ignore the smudging and occasional artifacts it introduces, and I shouldn't need it anyway, these games are all literally identical in engines and assets, there is genuinely no reason they should be running worse than they did before.

Overall I wouldn't spend more than $20 on this game, and even then it still wouldn't be all that great anyway. The fact that you can buy just about the entire back catalog of this franchise 0-6 for about the same price(often even less when theyre on sale) as this nothingburger of a game is pretty embarrassing. Each of those is easily 100+ hours if you go for completion and are simply better quality games. Sega really needs to do better because I haven't enjoyed an entry in this franchise since the first Judgment game in 2019.",1699523198,1700305017,False,3,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

This is the standard, pre-Yakuza 7 game (with 2 Kiwami and 6's engine). However, it is much, much shorter than your average 龍が如く entry. This is a gaiden for part 7, so I wasn't expecting it to be long. Still, it's pretty robust. There is lots to do. I easily dropped over 50 hours into it.

To anyone new to the series... this is not the starting point. Go buy Yakuza Kiwami or Yakuza 0 and start there. This is really a series where you had to play the whole thing to really get it. I knew a girl that tried starting at Yakuza 5, and though she admittedly liked the game, she said she felt like there was a lot she was missing.

I would like to begin by summarizing my history of the Yakuza franchise. Being a Yakuza fan, I enjoyed Yakuza 0 and thought Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a masterpiece. But I wasn't particularly fond of Yakuza 1-6. Among my reasons are dull gameplay, repetitive game and level design in every game, similar stories with ridiculous plot twists, boring main characters (excluding Akiyama), same map in each game etc. As you might have guessed, I've had issues with the repetitive nature of this series. I considered the Yakuza series the Call of Duty of the East, even though Yakuza is much better in almost every aspect. But Yakuza: Like a Dragon changed it all for me. Thankfully, the combat system had changed completely. It was extremely well made and we got a main character with actual feelings and one who displayed them. Ichiban is such a likable character and I enjoyed seeing him as the protagonist dearly. I completed Yakuza LaD 100% for the first time in a Yakuza game. That's how much I love the game.

After all this positive work from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios, I had high hopes about this game, so I pre-ordered it. I feel sorry to report that this is a game with the same formula as Yakuza 1-6 and I didn't enjoy most of it. A generic plot with characters that I am never going to remember after beating the game, predictable plot twists, and an undercooked villain. I mostly have no issues with the feel of the combat (except Yakuza 3) but this one feels kinda off. I cannot put my finger on it. One of the selling points of the game, the new ""agent combat style"" looks fun, but sadly is very weak compared to the ""yakuza style"", so I barely played the new style. They couldn't adjust the balance between them.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3079834442

Let me move on to the positives of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. The most important topic of the game: Yes, the cabaret club is very fun just like the previous ones. This one's slightly better because they made it live-action this time. Secondly, I can see that most of RGG's effort has gone into creating the castle. Yeah, the castle looks amazing and has cool stuff in it to spend time with. The graphics are getting better with every game. The interiors look extremely good, but the outdoor graphics need a little bit more work. I won't go into spoilers, but I just cannot skip that finale scene when Kiryu was holding a tablet. Phenomenal scene. It made me tear up! I hope it results in something beautiful for Kiryu in the next game. That sums up the positives of this game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3084505410

Unfortunately, the best point of the game is the playable Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth Trial after you beat the main game. During that hour, I had an absolute blast and it's barely visible that LaD 8 is their focus and this is only a cash grab. Dear SEGA, I know the main reason you made this game was to please Kiryu and the Brawler fans out there, other than making an extra 50 bucks per purchase, of course. But please just let Kiryu and this dated combat system alone. Because it surely doesn't work anymore for me. People will get used to turn-based combat. Look at Baldur's Gate 3 for an example. Just keep doing amazing RPGs after Like a Dragon 8 as well. I am immensely excited about that game!

There's 2 styles you can use, the classic Yakuza style with a moveset you're pretty familiar with at this point and the new Agent style that sports a bunch of gadgets like wires, rocket shoes, explosives and whatnot, It was very fun to use when fighting crowds.

Like stated above, this is WAY shorter then the main line game with a playtime of maybe only like 12-15 hours, but Sotenbori is packed with side content to do and is definitely meaningful as like with 0, money is main source of upgrades, and respects player's time by not having constantly run to and fro across the city. Side Stories, done through the Akame Network, will generally put you in a isolated series of events, cutting down a lot of travel time.

The payoff is certainly better than what Yakuza 6 attempted to do, and it also ties into Like a Dragon (Yakuza 7) very nicely.

Combat-wise, spoiler alert, bicycle meta is back. You improve skills by spending money so you want to get through street encounters as soon as possible, and the fastest way to do so is to swing around bicycles. I mentioned the same thing in my Yakuza 6 review; you want to buy the best skills? Time to swing those bikes! It helps to say ""eat this"" whenever you hit someone with it. Also one of the few games where you can get Tiger Drop relatively early (just ¥3,000,000; do Pocket Circuit a lot and exchange their PP points for Platinum Plates and you'll be good; or you can also get a lot of money from the Coliseum too). The timing on Tiger Drop is very precise; you must hit the button right before their attack lands so it's high risk high reward, but if you pull it off, it's very satisfying and can trivialise any bosses.

In terms of polish, this game is a strange mix bag. The combat is very polished and smooth, but there are very odd design decisions:
1. Many of your side quests must be started by talking to Akame instead of being discovered naturally or by visiting a question mark on the mini-map. As a result, I'd recommend just picking up all the available side quests at once and then work on them.
2. Game actually runs much smoother on my aging PC and graphics card than Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon. I think it's just optimised much better.
3. The cabaret club is a nice change but I'm not sure I like it. They call it ""immersive"" cabaret club because they actually use FMV but I honestly would have preferred if they had spent the resources on actually bringing back the cabaret hostess club minigame from Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami 2.
4. Pocket Circuit is back!
5. You can customise your usual as well as your fighting outfit, leading to the trademark (and hilarious) juxtaposition of a serious scene with you dressing up with literal clown makeup. There are a few side quests that require you to wear specific outfit, but you can only change outfit by going to the Coliseum so that's quite a bore.

For all its flaws, I think it's a must-play for fans of the series who are itching for a non-turn-based-combat entry (please announce Judgement 3!).",1700197012,1700197012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it's a rather short game, only comprising 5 chapters – it's a fun little jaunt that put you back into his shoes and reminds you just how great of a character Kiryu is. I personally think that this game respects Kiryu more than Y6, and truly has a sense of finality – which is funny given how Kiryu is present in the upcoming LAD: Infinite Wealth. Great callbacks, with Takaya Kuroda's incredible voice acting really showcasing just how much Kiryu has changed over the past 7 games.

Combat-wise, it's not as great as Lost Judgment. I'd put it slightly above the first Judgment, but it's still fun to beat up random dudes. This game shines in it's side-content, where I've spent majority of my playtime doing. That's not something I usually do in a Yakuza title, as I greatly enjoy the story content more, but Gaiden incentivizes you greatly for checking off that list, and I couldn't help but continuously support the Akame Network.

I'd rate it a solid 8/10. My only downside would be the humungous file size. I hope RGG puts out a patch to reduce the storage taken up by the Cabaret Club FMVs, and also consider making the LAD8 demo a separate download / DLC install. 98GB is too much space for a 15-30 hour bite-sized Like a Dragon game.

Best thing I can say about this game is to compare it to Marvel nowadays.

It's not bad, but you are starting to feel that grass was greener back in a day. 
This price for this amount of gameplay/sidequests did not worth it at all. I literally got more enjoyment from DLC to Last Judgement. It's sad that RGG at this state thinks that I already loved Ichiban so much (I didn't) that I can forgive them for slowly killing Kiryu just to make Ichiban look better for new players. 

For some new players, who didn't want to read all of this and seeking for good beat-em-up with a good story, just buy Judgement instead.

Mainly because of the storytelling is no effort production line tier and also the Infinite Wealth Demo.

They took a protagonist hero archetype of an defiant self-confident, stoic and bold man and made him into a slave?. My advice you don't like it? just remove it! no one needs your loser iconoclasm. 
Also they are going to replace the old protagonist with the lazy writing ""Stock Shōnen Hero""/""Idiot Hero"" protagonist, showing that the new writers are of-the-shelf cretins, without originality or boldness to take risks, hence they are employees to an stock company. Originality is also an big issue in this game, there is too little and all changes are to the worst, at least in the story writing (replacement of good archetypes, with lazy trope writing and adding extraordinary things to make it less boring). This tier of writing is so bad for a story focused game. Its the type of writing belongs in multiplayer games, where everyone skips it anyway.

Now, that's not an issue bad-business and consumer bros. There is an market for low effort slob superhero movie tier entertainment, but then reduce the price.

Poor Kiryu is never gonna catch a break. If you love the series, you'll love this. IF you haven't played 0-6, well it'll be mostly awkward, I imagine. I'm happy to have paid the launch price. 

The gameplay, I imagine this will be the last game in the whole IP to use the more classic Yakuza gameplay and it's there for those who love it. I like both it and the newer system in 7 and the demo in this game here for the upcoming game next year. This game feels fairly responsive if, perhaps still not quite landing the transition between running and attack often time. I will say some of the new mechanics for Kiryu's new fighting style feel a bit ridiculously OP but, what can you do?

Graphics wise, DLAA and other reconstruction technologies are present and well, it beats not having them for sure. However, even at 4k with DLAA, I still see lots of aliasing and artifacting all over the place. Less so in other series titles without DLAA though, so it's an improvement but, not good enough. Otherwise, the graphics look like a small step up from Yakuza: Like a Dragon--Kasuga's game. Nothing particularly exciting nor modern. Some very weak areas still remain such as reflections barely looking recognizable in the slightest--I'd turn them off entirely if I could. 

The audio--at least in the Japanese track, I have no idea about the English--is great, overall quality is there for me. 

Performance wise, it's doing better on my hardware than say Kiwami 1 & 2 are, so I suppose they figured out some inefficiencies. I can easily lock 60 fps and hit my 120 hz max with everything cranked. I'm not experiencing any sort of stutters which, is special in 2023 for some reason.

Though this game is primarily a brawler-style game, it throws our favorite karaoke singer Joryu into a wide variety of activities besides the street combat you'll find in the rest of the series. You could spend a lot of time on recreational activites Joryu himself may do, such as golf, board games, gambling, pit fighting (best way to grind cash in this game hint hint), and my personal favorite, singing Baka Mitai at the bar.

For those who have played Yakuza games before, this game uses the same engine as Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 2 Kiwami, making for seamless transitions between combat on the streets and roaming Sotenbori. The game devs allow you to progress the story at your pace, and they will give you ample warning when you are going to a long brawling segment (except for the Chapter 1 gauntlet, watch out), so you can either take time to do some other activities or prepare for the long battle. I would recommend doing the side activities, not only because they are fun and provide comedic relief to an otherwise dark story, but because you'll need them to strengthen Joryu's stats and abilities since the upgrade tree requires the currency the side content provides. 

I had a fun time with this game and made it through the story on Normal mode in 33 hours. Keep in mind that I did not go for 100% completion so this number could vary for you if you decide to pick the game up for yourself.

Reasonable for its price?

[list]
[*]This game is much less focused on main campaign content, and more focused on side content. It's got less than half the campaign length of a regular RGG game, and even that's being a bit generous as a significant part of the main story is actually more like mandatory engagement with that side content. If you're like me, you can easily get 60h or more out of this if you like Yakuza minigames or the improved Colosseum, if you're just doing a one and done campaign this is more like ~20 hours. (maybe plus a few more if you want to play 8's included demo)

[*]This game is [b]not[/b] a good entry point for those new to the series, and isn't trying to be. This game was made for people who have played Yakuza 7, and are invested enough in the Kiryu Saga games that they want to know what he's been up to during the transition between Y6 and Y7. IMO Yakuza 0, or maybe Yakuza 7, are better starting points for anyone looking to try an RGG title.

[*]The updated combat is overall very fun and much better than some other Dragon Engine games like Kiwami 2 IMO. I don't think it's [i]as[/i] good as Lost Judgement but that's probably an unfairly high standard to clear. Joryu struggles to earn Heat, but makes up for it by being very good at opening enemies up to air juggling and having perhaps the strongest crowd control in the series' history.

[*]While the Yakuza combat style plays how you'd expect, Agent is a new moveset that gives Joryu a lot of crazy new tools. Some of its ideas, like the ranged grabbing wire are extremely useful tools you'll use often, but some other features like the Hornet drones don't feel anywhere near as useful. It's great for defense and crowd control and so always has a use, but I think most players will use Yakuza style as their default with Agent being a specialist style.

[*]The improved Colosseum is probably the best take on the feature we've ever seen. Besides the usual ability to quickly enjoy fights, you can also assemble a custom team of fighters for giant chaotic teamfights and, finally, play as said fighters to use their unique movesets and abilities normally reserved for NPCs. Because this is still a side game, it's not perfect. For example, Kaito only recycles Yakuza 0's Brawler moveset instead of his full Kaito Files moveset, and Higashi does not inherit his unique Muay Thai moveset from Judgement. But we do get some classics like the joke drunkard moveset, and overall a really fantastic way to make our own fun trying to become world champs with jobber characters. My only real criticism of the Colosseum is that some of its later Hell Team Rumble fights are a bit much, bloating HP to comical levels (seriously some of these enemies have like 50 health bars to work through) because their captains are balanced around requiring an entire levelled team of 10 people dogpiling attacks onto them like an MMO raid boss. Aside from that balancing complaint that only affects a small portion of the Colosseum's content (and will become less of an issue further and further into endgame stats) I think this is a huge highlight feature especially for longtime fans.

[*]Despite how relatively short this story is, it is [b]definitely[/b] worth the ride, for the ending alone, but even the stuff aside from that is extremely fun, especially the final boss.

I still got a good 19-20 hours out of it, but I was also doing most of the side quests. If you rush through the game, you could possibly beat it in 8-12 hours. 

You should absolute NOT play this game UNTIL you finish up to Yakuza: Like a Dragon / Yakuza 7. It feels like this was a story DLC for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth / Yakuza 8. 

It's a hard recommendation. Unless you're super invested and played all the other Yakuza / Like a Dragon games, then I'd say go for it. If you're new to the series and just started with Yakuza: Like a Dragon / Yakuza 7, then I'd say hold off. This game feels more like it was for the long time fans rather than the new ones.

Sometimes, this company can create legendary story game like Yazuka 0 and Yakuza 7: Like a dragon.
Other time, they create this dog shit game where it is completely pointless to play.


Story 1/10
I haven't finish the story but i feel like it close to ending. It is completely pointless  and short story. Nothing epic about. No even worth remembering


Battle 3/10
The battle system getting worse and simpler. I thought the battle system is improved in Yakuza Ishin, but none of it is carried to here. You get 2 style to pick only. It is just a typical hack and slash with simple equipment and skill progress. The battle is also simple, you dodge, you hit, there is nothing special with this yazuka fighting game that they already reuse for 7 titles


Exploration 1/10
This used to be the strong point of Yazuka, exploring the city, doing sub quest, cabaret club etc. But somehow they can mess this up too. Sub quest is now fetch from a Fixer instead of encounter naturally in the city. They reuse Sotenbori, this tiny city which is half of Yakuza 0 is now the only place you can explore. They added one more new small map for casino and Colosseum. It is really boring to explore this town so many times. After they remove the substory encounter, it feel like dead city. You get the subquest from a npc, then go to the quest location. How can they mess this up so badly.



Mini-games 0/10
I remember after doing sub stories, some of the character will join you in mini games. In this game, it only happen in Colosseum and it is the most boring way to recruit. You directly get a sub quest that said there is a potential to recruit this guy. It used to be more natural and indirect.

Colosseum is just a place to battle, nothing really special, we have that in every Yakuza series. The Caberat club is also downgraded. Now you just talk to real video hostess and try to pick the right line. The reward is sexy video in the end. Unlike the Yakuza 0 and Yakuza 2 where you get a good story and gameplay, this is significant downgrade.


Overall: This game is totally not worth to buy. I thought after playing Yakuza 7, this company have second renaissance. They used to milk Kiryu dry with non-stop sequel. I guess this is  their one last milking on kiryu dry tits before they move to new IP.",1699961180,1699961180,False,2,3,0.400018453598022461,0,True,False,False

I want to forewarn everyone looking at negative reviews that this game is not HORRIBLE but isn't on par with the other titles in the franchise. This game should be DLC to Infinite Wealth, and is definitely NOT worth the 50$ price tag. Go buy Judgment or Lost Judgment instead if you don't already have them and want to scratch that kuza' itch. 

I think that the foundation of the Like a Dragon (Yakuza) franchise is that they basically get to reuse assets every two years, so long as they innovate and add to the world they've created. And this is fine. I love coming back to Kamurocho and in this case, Sotenbori, to see what is new. Players returning to new titles in the franchise expect new side content, new fighting styles (or characters), revamped areas of old maps, a beautiful story, and interesting characters to tell that story. While Gaiden does a good job of telling an easy to digest and pretty decent story, it falls flat virtually everywhere else. 

For starters, there isn't a single entirely NEW side activity added. Most of them are just remixed or slightly inferior versions of what we had in earlier entries to the series. I don't think Pocket Circuit needs to see more light-of-day than it has already gotten. (Unless it's made like, substantially different or somehow more entertaining.) I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot in Yakuza 0 because it was my first time experiencing the Circuit racer. But the reason I skipped it in Gaiden is the same reason I skipped it in 6. I just don't feel like it anymore. I already dumped six hours into collecting and racing parts in 0. It no longer entices me, and the last time I played it was over two years ago now. That isn't to say it's BAD, but it has definitely run its course. (pun intended)

My next minigame complaint pretty much falls on me; for some reason the advertising of this game led me to believe there would be a cabaret minigame where you would actually manage your own club and staff, similar to 0 and 2. Unfortunately for all of us, I was wrong. And what there is instead is an almost DOWNGRADED version of the cabaret dating minigame we had in past titles. While it's sort of interesting to see live actors portray the parts of the hostesses, the dialogue and engagement compared to the series' former cabarets is still lacking. 

The coliseum battles are definitely my favorite by far, and I'd imagine the same goes for a lot of people. It isn't without its flaws, however. The Hell Team Rumble mode is basically just a cluster of NPCs beating the crap out of each other. Don't get me wrong, that's very cool! But it's not as engaging as you'd think. It's very hard to tell what's going on until there are a few people left, and even then, it will usually be this giant tank enemy that you and your squad will just roll over. 

Going into this game I was under the impression given to me by trailers and discussions that majority of content in this entry would be on the side. I was again, correct, unfortunately. Substories have been dragged through the mud. Over world side content is now quite literally reduced to giving homeless people bentos, wearing a silly outfit for someone, or helping someone getting ganged up on. While there still are real substories with organized objectives and stories, there's only about twenty of them and they aren't added in the traditional way. Instead of finding people around Sotenbori that need your help, you get a grocery list of missions from Akame. Some of these are pretty decent. I'm particularly fond of the one where ChatGPT tells some guy to jump off a bridge. Every mission ends with you calling Akame and explaining the situation and then getting paid in Akame Points. That's all. The only thing you get from completing substories is Akame points. 

And finally the thing I personally look forward to the most when a new LAD comes out, the combat. Agent style is extremely underwhelming. It gives access to four gadgets. Two are absolutely useless, and the other two are useless but can be used if you really feel like it. I'm ranking the rocket shoes number one out of the four simply because it's just sort of fun to jet through enemies or pull yourself out of a sticky situation. The spider wire comes second because it has two things you may actually want to use it for. The first is swinging objects/enemies into other enemies to deal damage which is sort of helpful for crowd fights. The second and most useful is this attack where by pulling the enemy to you with the spider, you can punch them into a juggle where you keep attacking and they are in the air. That's all for the spider though. You're supposed to be able to constrain enemies but it only works on the weakest enemies. So don't expect to get any utility out of using the Spider during boss fights, or against any ""fat enemy"" type. Also it's nearly impossible to pick up weapons off the ground using the LT button with Spider. It's so finicky at times it's not even worth trying. Finally the last two little gizmos you get are the Hornet and Firefly. BOTH are useless pieces of crap that are activated by disengaging entirely with the enemy and then holding down the corresponding button for at least a whole second. This does not flow well combat-wise, and is definitely not worth the minuscule damage both do. The final redeeming thing I'll say about Agent is that the general combos are fine. In heat mode, it does a very good job of dealing with crowds.

The Yakuza fighting style however is decent. No complaints. Same old stuff different game. And it feels much better than it did in 2 and 6. 

That's pretty much all I have to say about the game. No new minigames, watered down substories, mediocre combat, and an ALRIGHT story. I don't really see a lot of criticism for these games, (apart from people crapping on 3) but there are some decisions that should be questioned more often that aren't.  

5.9 / 10

POST-GAME NOTES: I just finished the game with about 18 hours on my save file. (It's like 30 some hours on Steam, but I was afk a lot) I bumped up my final score from a 5.9 to a 6 after experiencing a fantastic final sequence of fights and cutscenes. So with an amazing final boss, and heart torturing finale, I can safely say that the story carried Gaiden.

POST-GAME COMBAT NOTES: A fully upgraded Agent left a much better, but still underwhelming taste in my mouth. I eventually grew to like Spider more than the other three gadgets as the game progressed. I think what opened my eyes was the crowds of enemies near the end that the gadget just does wonders on.",1699730974,1699953210,False,38,3,0.611998915672302246,4,True,False,False

I can't stand playing as this Joryu guy, he's by far the worst protagonist RGG has ever made. He's just some bland generic agent with no personality, always has the same scowling look on his face. He doesn't come anywhere close to being as charismatic and endearing as other protagonists, like Ichiban and Kiryu.

Speaking of Kiryu, it's wild that so many people in the story keep thinking Joryu is Kiryu. They look nothing alike, aside from the same hairstyl. They're very obviously different people. The way characters in the game keep saying that Joryu is Kiryu, it's like the writers are trying to convince us players that they're the same guy. They are trying to make this loser Joryu ride on the success of Kiryu, and expecting us to be a naive audience who falls for it.

I'm not going to take the bait. Kiryu is my favorite video game hero, probably my favorite character in all of media. There's no way I'd ever buy that Joryu is even half as interesting as Kiryu. If they plan on making this Joryu guy the new face of the series, I might have to abstain from RGG games until they come to their senses and give us a better protagonist.",1699952817,1699952817,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This is a shorter experience than you would expect in most games from the Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, but it surprisingly packed with plenty to do as well as a fantastic story.

The story clears up the gap of what Kiryu was up to after 6 and for parts of 7. This game does spoil major plot elements of both games. The overall story for this game was great, great intro, great characters, fantastic final boss and ending.

Side content surprisingly packed, Colosseum is back with a cool mode in Hell Rumble, Pocket Racer is back again!!!! Not many Substories, but that didn't overall matter.

Overall this game was a great bridge to those who have at least finished 7 and want to know what Kiryu was up to.

To say that I was skeptical about this game's story and the impact it would have on the legacy of one of my favorite characters would sure be an understatement. RGG somehow managed to beautifully tie everything together and also deliver an even better send off to the legend of Kazuma Kiryu than his initial ""final Game"" Yakuza 6.
Everything that was missing from Yakuza 6, due to its rocky development is here.
- better combat
- better minigames/side activities
- better bosses
- more light on the old cast of characters
Some of us were definitely expecting this game to be a cashgrab, a cheap asset flip, just to cash in on people's love for the character. They definitely cut some corners in the very short 6 months of development, but the end product is one I'm more than satisfied with.
I only have a few small gripes with this game:
- The Coliseum (while cool on paper) is very underwhelming,
movesets of pre-existing characters were butchered and really don't offer any kind of depth.
The huge team battles are also just a cluster fuck.
- The Dragon/Yakuza Style is extremely broken and just kills bosses with like 2 combos.
- Small pacing issues in an already short story: you could erase Akame from the plot and it probably wouldn't change a thing. I found her inclusion to be quite useless. She is just a tool for you to start grinding.
- The flow of combat feels a bit off in big groups at times.

But other than that, Gaiden offers basically anything a Yakuza fan could ask for.
Lastly I would like to say:

The game is too short for the price, The story is okay and there was no memorable music.
The only redeeming thing is being able to dress up kiryu and the ending.

Was exited to play as kiryu in the Lost judgement style combat but it was far from being close to the combat of LJ.
There's still juggling and shit but the combat is very stiff and the agent style sucks at the job it's supposed to do, That is to handle crowds and they throw a lot of enemies at you in this game.
All the gadgets you have fucking sucks. 
They barely do anything and it's just better to just use the ""yakuza"" style.
It's Judge's eye all over again like did they not learn anything from LJ?.

And about the game being short, They lead up to yakuza 7 and it just ends.

You can honestly finish this whole game in 12 hours if you just rush the story. So the game is obviously in the short side but I really think this is one of the best games in the franchise gameplay wise. Story itself without going into spoiler territory is a bit slow at first however it then kicks into high gear in the later chapters. Normally I would have a problem with that style of story telling (Kingdom Hearts 3 left a sour taste in my mouth) but considering the length of the game, it's not horrible to deal with. 

Side content there's a shocking amount of stuff to do. Substories wise they're a treat as usual with some great fan service. The Colosseum is easily the best it's ever been with the ability to also play as every single ally you recruit into your team is also really awesome, despite the lack of heat actions for them. 

Gameplay as I mentioned is really REALLY good, It's Lost Judgement combat with even more juggling, and the style switching for juggle combos are really smooth. I'm not claiming to be the sauciest or best gamer in the universe, however I hit some saucy ass combos on some bosses and it felt really satisfying. Agent is a really sick new style and the gadgets are pretty funny to mess around with, and the traditional Dragon Style feels at its absolute best in this game, really shows RGG is improving the combat with every new game they make. 

TLDR tho, I would honestly still wait for a sale, despite all the praise I've given this game. cuz you're paying for a 12 hour game featuring a demo of Infinite Wealth.",1699835784,1699835784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From an overall perspective, the game ties up things after the ending of Yakuza 6 but before the end of 7. No spoilers, but Yakuza 6 kind of ended in a strange way, and Kiryu's unexplained appearance in Like a Dragon/Y7 was pretty weird. However, this game goes out of it's way to explain it in detail, and it's a great time. As it's $50 price tag shows, it's not as long as one of the main series games, but I actually think it's a huge advantage for it. Despite the title, you should NOT buy this game if you haven't played Yakuza 6 and 7, there are major spoilers for both games in it. The new fighting style is questionable at first, but after upgrading some of the gadgets, it really comes into it's own as one of the best crowd control fighting styles in the franchise (also, super broken).

From a story perspective, I actually loved this game. Kiryu is either seen as a standard goon by people which is pretty funny, or has to be adamant that he's not Kiryu, since he's working undercover, and is officially dead, to protect his loved ones. While it's definitely not as tense as Yakuza 0 or as gripping as the first Judgment's story, the first few chapters offer a great and entertaining setup, with the side content being much more streamlined. Instead of running around and finding substories, they're given to you in bulk. There's definitely more of a focus on the main story, with side stuff actually coming secondary for the first time in ages. 

I do believe that's intentional, because the story, especially the ending, are very important to anyone interested to see how Kiryu's story ends. Not since Yakuza 0 has there been such a rough scene as the ending one to this game -- really went for the feels.

Overall, it's a buy. RGG rounded out the year with yet another stellar, cheaper entry to the franchise. If this is the end of Kiryu's story as a main protagonist, I think it's a good one. I wouldn't have minded a meatier game as a sendoff for him, but... he'll be in 8, so not a huge deal.

I'm glad to see Sega's gamble with porting these games is still paying off, 5 years strong. I think it's fostered an entirely different group of fans of the franchise and it was a great decision.

Not quite as fluid as Lost Judgment, but still pretty satisfying, especially when you start getting the upgrades. There are a good amount of substories, with of a few of them being particularly entertaining. The game is shorter than a typical game. You can complete the main story in maybe 12-ish hours if you're just doing that, and you can crank maybe 30-40 hours out of the game if you're going for all the side content. Also the coliseum is really cool and definitely the best iteration of an arena in the series.

RGG Studios continues to be one of the only dev studios that makes games I can be genuinely excited for nowadays. Even if a lot of the substories were quite lacking by Yakuza/LAD standards, and the story has a moment or two where it can drag on, *and* it's arguably the smallest RGG game to date, what's done with the content here is some of RGG's best. Also, probably has one of the best endings in an RGG game to date.

Music was pretty good as always.
Other than some classic dragon engine bodies flying i did not experience a single bug and the perfomance was great for my old graphics card(around 80 fps with fsr 2.0).The visual effects in combat were really stunning even with upscaling.

My only complaint is that if you do the completion(which also felt really good and didnt try to waste your time like some of the previous games) before finishing the story you are gonna be really OP wiping out bosses with 2-3 heat actions but maybe i should have known better since the story ends in only 5 chapters.

Impressive they only made this in 6 months, 9.5/10 definitely top 3 in kiryu's saga.

Its a very short game, only 5 chapters, but those 5 chapters are pretty solid. The mini games are pretty good, many returning from 0.

Gameplay feels like Judgment with two fight styles. Dragon, and Agent.

I dont need to explain Dragon to you, so lets talk about agent.

Agent is very fun, a very fast swan like style. It comes with much fun abilities like holding square to throw bomb cigerattes, holding X to dash around and run over people with rocket shoes, holding triangle to send in drones that attack people over time and circle you while blocking, and of course the string which you can use to pull enemies, items hidden around the map, and weapons to you. It was a very fun style to pair with THE DRAGON STYLE. The unlock system is money based like 0.

The core side missions are little missions you take on for an intel woman. This woman provides many pretty good mini games from what I have played. you will unlock points for her, which allows you to get awards, upgrade your abilities. Not a huge fan they tied this into the upgrades, but fair enough. The upgrade screen is very similar to Judgments also.

THE CASTLE. What a grand and amazingly crafted location that is beautiful to see. Its a major plot point of the game and holds many gambling mini games and the wonderful coliseum you fight in. The coliseum mode is pretty awesome. You can fight as many different characters you recruit into your team, among some being very prominent characters from past games if you got the dlc preorder, as well as a suprise Judgment reference if you accomplish a certain side quest. I thought it was fighting arena done best its ever been done in the series, so if you like that you will like this. There is team battles, your team vs others, 1v1s, 1vgroups, and SPECIAL battles that usually involve weapons and special fights like certain types of bosses.

So, the only downside to this game is its incredibly short, as I said the campaign is 5 hours long. The only thing holding this game back. Idk if its fully worth 50 dollars. I would say more 30 or 40. It definitely shouldve got cut in half Id say. The story was pretty solid and well done despite how very short it was, with an incredible tie back to the moment (you know the one) in Yakuza 7 where kiryu shows up. The story ties it all up in a bow for 8 coming out the beginning of next year, and it was a pretty good experience despite how small the game is. It had a very beautiful end and truly made it feel like this is the last game Kiryu is the main protagonist in.

- 9.5/10
- Worth full price
- Should NOT be your first yakuza game.

Combat is the most refined Kiryu's ever been. A lot of changes that make wanting to learn the combat more fun. Never felt like there were any unfair fights, and you can't rely on heat actions as much encouraging you to master your moveset and new juggle mechanics.

Side content is surprisingly expansive. Best coliseum mode in any LAD game, funny side missions, and tighter systems that all interact with each other. I didn't feel like the Akame network was tacked on and I love that. It's also really well tied-in to the story, which is the best part of the game. 

I loved the story. It's basically a ""mini"" sequel to Yakuza 6, so existing fans will get a lot out of it. Big disclaimer- there's obvious padding in the first half of the game. But its Yakuza padding- used to onboard you to the game's side content. Which is great anyways so I didn't mind! Just when I felt like it was going to ruin the game's pacing, it stopped and the story REALLY picked up during the latter chapters. 

I don't want to spoil, but you can only fully appreciate the final hours of this game if you've played all the previous ones. It has the most bittersweet but cathartic ending I've experienced in media. It actually ruined me, and pushed my score for the game wayyy higher.

So yeah, Gaiden exceeded my expectations. Play it please. If you're a longtime fan you owe it to yourself to.",1699778845,1699779092,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many mini-games and the quirky side quest that these games are known for. Exploring 2020 Sotenbori is pretty cool too, just made me realize how much the city changed from Yakuza 0 to now. This is a really great addition to Kiryu's story and I'm so glad RGG did this. To anyone who is going to play this game, I'd say just take your time with ti and explore and enjoy what this game has to offer. Explore all its nook and crannies. I've played the Yakuza series from 0 - 6 at least 3 times now on the Ps4 and I've always enjoyed going through them over and over again, just seeing Kiryu's crazy story, and realizing that this will be the last game where I get to play Kiryu like this is a little sad so that is why I am taking my time with this game.


Update: So I have been playing this game fore about 32 hrs now and so far im noticing something. I came to a conclusion that I think this game is a farewell love letter to Kiryu. Through out the story, Kiryu is being reminded of the past. All the people he has met over the years, All the things that He went through and you can see how much he tries to protect the memories of those people. With just the mini games like the kareoke, you're reminded of all his past experience when you play them. I think if you are new to the Yakuza games, and want to try to get into them, Hold off on playing this game. Play it from Yakuza 0 - Yakuza 6, before you play this game because when you play this game and see all that you see here, it'll mean a lot more to you as the player who witnessed it all play out.

Both fighting styles available to the player are fantastic and gradually become more fun to use the deeper into the game you get. Agent is the style that the game is definitely pushing harder than the Yakuza style, as it has all the new goofy mechanics and gizmos that were advertised as a selling point for this game. Oh, and Tiger Drop is an ability you can use in combat as well.

The soundtrack is, as expected of a title of this series, great. My favorite track has to be Cold Fire.

The story... I have feelings about it. It takes place after Yakuza 6, and leads up to the halfway point of Yakuza 7/Like A Dragon. Playing both titles before this is absolutely required, I think; there are flashbacks and references to events of both games that spoil their respective titles. For the sake of not spoiling anyone who has yet to play it, I will not say anything further. 

There's a lot of side content available in this title, and a little somethin' somethin' for the Judge Eyes/Lost Judgement fans as well! The game also includes a special trial version of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth available right away from the main menu upon launch.

For 50 dollars, and with how much extra time you get out of the side content in these titles, that's well worth your money. I powered through the story mode and it took me ~22 hours, with a bit of grinding on the side for abilities. Give it a go.",1699764304,1699764304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like a Dragon: Gaiden is an absolutely phenomenal entry in a series that I've grown to adore. The gameplay continues to be refined with each entry, and I'd say this is about on par with Lost Judgement in regards to combat. Though there are only two stances, the insane gadgets you unlock for Agent stance more than make up for it. The extreme variety of side content is here as always, with most everything being an iteration on existing minigames to make them a bit more engaging, most notably the clan battles from Yakuza Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6 are actual battles you participate in instead of that weird tower defense thing. On that note, this is one of the best iterations of The Coliseum in the entire franchise, though there is one specific substory fight that you'll need to level up your clan for. The map size isn't particularly large, roughly the size of the Majima Saga from Yakuza Kiwami 2, but there is considerably more content and variety packed into here than you'd think. If you're a fan of these games you can buy this with no worries, you'll be satisfied for sure.

Story is shockingly engaging for something that's filling the gap between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon, I genuinely wasn't expecting to be as interested in anything outside of Kiryu himself but that wasn't the case at all. Akame is an excellent addition to the cast and is a joy on screen, pretty much every character punches well above their weight in terms of what you'd expect from a spinoff entry. I cannot recommend this game enough if you're a fan of Yakuza and Kiryu in particular, longtime fans will have an absolutely ton of references that they can pick up on. On top of all of this, there's a demo for Infinite Wealth included so you can get your feet wet for that entry.

I am a big fan of the Like A Dragon series and although initially excited, was also skeptical of this game since LAD Gaiden follows a more different structure than other mainline games and follows similarly, according to some developer interviews, to The Kaito Files, a special DLC for Lost Judgment. I actually like these shorter Like A Dragon experiences since the mainline LAD games, even the old ones, are very lengthy and have so much stuff to do. So this is a nice break and spin of the usual formula and opens more potential for more stories that can be told in the LAD universe if the devs wishes to do some.

Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name is a LAD game that focuses on an undercover Kiryu Kazuma being an agent of the Daidoji faction, assuming the name Joryu. This game being a Gaiden (side-story) tells a fun and simple and somewhat interesting tale about this new side of Kiryu Kazuma. Being an agent means he will always fight and do combat (as he always do) and enables him to have a very new and unique style which is Agent Style that gives him alot of spy tools and gadgets.

The story is okay and simple but I will say my criticisms for the story is that there are really no stakes. This is mainly because the game takes place at the same time as Yakuza 7 and the whole goal of Gaiden's story is to reach a crucial moment that will impact the overall story in Yakuza 7. So any moments where Kiryu and his friends are in danger, never really feel like actual danger since they all are in Yakuza 7. Another criticism I'll give is on a certain antagonist that I was kinda hyped due to how much backstory he has but ultimately, he's just another generic villain that is evil.

I will say that this is the most chill Yakuza or Like A Dragon game. Kiryu in this game is somehow the best he has ever been. Kiryu Kazuma has always been a very interesting and very well-written character starting from Yakuza 1 to Yakuza 6 with the sixth game being tying a neat bow to Kiryu's saga. That's why I was skeptical towards this game's release since for me Kiryu's tale is already done, but fortunately Kiryu has a great comeback and he comes hard. While there's daddy Kiryu in Yakuza 3, depressed Kiryu in Yakuza 5, and angery Kiryu in Yakuza 6, LAD Gaiden has peak, Dragon of the Dojima Kiryu Kazuma.

In some way it is brilliant to have Kiryu being an agent to showcase his pure intelligence, raw skill, talent and charisma, that really presents why Kiryu is the Dragon of Dojima since in the past games, there was never really a moment of that part of Kiryu's life other than being mentioned and told by characters countless times. Even Yakuza 0, the prequel that shows his origins, only presents the period before his tenure as the Dragon of Dojima. 

All the characters in LAD Gaiden are likable as there always banter between Kiryu and them. I really love the more quiet moments where they are just chilling out eating, or just complimenting each other, or just..... talking. Although Kiryu and his peers are mostly out of the norm, being a Yakuza and all, the writing and the dialogue makes them all very grounded and very relatable.

Combatwise, it is okay. I am still getting used to Agent Style and found myself using it when fighting larger crowds, but ultimately all the tools you use as an agent like whips are very fun and crazy as they always been. Kiryu has two fighting styles with the other being Yakuza Style which is the classic traditional Kiryu combat from past games. There's also the juggling system from Lost Judgment so Kiryu can finally juggle enemies too. I'm not an expert when it comes to Like A Dragon combat but I've lot of fun with it here.

Being a shorter Like A Dragon game like Kaito Files, this game is obviously short. I finished the main story in 20 hours and there are two big side-content which are the classic substories (but in a unique spin) and the fighting arena (which also has unique spin). My only criticism is only on the substories with the gang related substories being very repetitive and tedious as hell. But that's just my only main complaint since the other substories are bangers as all things should be.

Music for me is also kinda okay. There some bangers that kinda mixed in with not so banger ones. Some of the not so bangers are kinda generic, trailer musicish, but the banger ones are great like Deadly Struggle, Un Altro Appasionato, and the Yakuza Style theme.

When comparing between Kaito Files and LAD Gaiden, I ultimately prefer Kaito Files first mainly because of how high the stakes are there. Not to the discredit how high the stakes can be in LAD Gaiden, but LAD Gaiden is also a fun time with Kiryu and I'm kinda glad he's somehow back. Comparing to the mainline games isn't really fair since this is a much smaller game and different direction, but LAD Gaiden does takes elements from mainly the Kiryu Saga games and offers abit of homage to them.

I recommend those who have played the Yakuza games to play this. For newcomers are also welcome since this game is great at recapping some aspects but mostly in Kiryu's backstory.

Overall, a solid and short Like A Dragon experience.

Akame's network provides a good balance between fetch quests, side content incentives, and some fun stories in Sotenbori. The new coliseum is really fun, the ability to play as new fighters is novel, and you really need to max out your resources hear in order to beat every possible fight. The castle itself is a great way to grind money, fool around with customization via the boutique, and overall just have a good time. 

All in all, the only bad part of this game is the cost, but beyond needing to wait for a sale to justify this game's purchase, it is a great entry for series veterans, and proof that RGG can do anything and do it damn well.",1699761453,1699761453,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

but man... it was amazing.
gameplay: the devs stated that this game is smaller than the average yakuza game but its quite large despite that.(i'd say about 50-60hours to complete?)
story: i would give a 10 out of 10 but i will give it a 9 instead because we didnt get kasuga encounter(we only see a cutscene that mentions it) before the final showdown.
combat: the new style is very cool to use and although its quite weaker than yakuza style in terms of raw damage output it is often too useful in its own way (im still learning how to properly use it) 
substories: they seem to go pretty deep but i havent gotten far into them yet
overall a great game

However, with that being stated! I still would recommend you play this game because it's a fantastic installment to the Like A Dragon franchise and gives some real emotional payoff that has been in the making for seven installments with our remarkable stoic protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. 

This game is best consumed after playing Yakuza 7: Like A Dragon. 

With all that being said my biggest complaint with this game is how incredibly short it is compared to other games in the franchise. I completed the story in about eleven hours and got the final achievement right at the eighteenth hour mark. 

The basic plot summary for this game without getting into many details is that after faking his death at the end of Yakuza 6: Song of Life, Kiryu is roped up into a plot to protect the people he cares about most, while some shady individuals try to reign control of the Dragon of Dojima to benefit themselves.

Outside of the main story you can partake in many side activities that are not forced. There is a collection of accomplishments you can do if that sort of thing strikes your fancy. You can also partake in little side missions to help people's issues that just give a cute little slice-of-life feel to break up the pace of the story if you like. However, within this game, the big chunk of your time outside of the side missions that you get through this woman named Akane is that of the coliseum. The introduction to this game's gimmick that being the Hell Team Rumble was very enjoyable for what it was and I wish there was more to it. 

The game is beyond beautiful, runs perfectly on my computer, and sound quality is great! The change of just two fighting styles instead of just the Dragon of Dojima style we got used to over the course of the games is a nice change of pace. Agent style is stupidly not balanced, but! Balance isn't really an issue in this single-player experience because the combat is utter perfection. 

With that! I would recommend you buy this game, maybe at a discount if you can... However, if you're willing to spend 60 on a 12 hour game go ahead, you'll have a fantastic time.

As far as story telling goes, it not very exciting. It really doesnt get exciting until Chapter 4 (out of 5). Of the games in the series I have played, this really felt like a DLC - A Colosseum game with quests and a lot larger gambling space really is what this game sums up to be. 

Youre mainly stuck in Sotenbori. Have little to nothing to do in Ijinjo and you dont even get to touch Kamurocho. They do tie in their Yakuza Like a Dragon game and the upcoming games in the series and it does cover the tiny interaction Kiryu had with Kasuga and thats it. 

They bring back some of the  references and players from their previous titles which kind of gets me engaged just a little more, but the face value it brings falls below my expectation. In perspective, I spent more time finishing the Cyberpunk DLC alone at 100% achievement than this game also at 100% achievements. Ill get more into the game details towards the end. 

Fighting feels a little sloppy. Im glad they brought back the button mashing brawl way of fighting. He doesnt really reach to hit the next enemy so there is a lot of air combat. You get 2 fighting modes: Agent mode where you can use your weapon arsenal which is great to use for anyone who is not a boss. 
Then you have Yakuza mode that is good for bosses which is pretty much it. 

As far as using or finding weapons, you cannot keep or equip any weapon. The weapon you use in that fight only last until the end of the battle scene, until you use a heat action or until you are knocked down. \
Unlike other Yakuza games, you can stack similar items and have compounding stacks. Here, you cannot. 

They got rid of the food combos for more effective healing and they also removed item sets for boosted stats. When youre swapping out gear, the equipment screen does not tells you what stats the current item gives, but it will indicate what stats will change when you swap it out. They dont show duplicates which makes equipping gear much simpler and easier, but its also very limited and shrunken down. 

Im so glad that the golf mini game has gotten so much better to play. The golf mini game is actually fun to play and enjoyable. The Karaoke game feels like an actual rhythm game now because the buttons match the beats but you can only sing with Akame- no one else.

The achievements are realistic to accomplish. Unlike the Kiwami versions of the game, the achievements are impossible feats of perfection. This one at least, you dont have to play the game up to a certain level to be able to get the achievement to pop. 

Its cool that there are quests you can do depending on the outfit youre wearing. I would like to see more of this in future titles, but make it where you can change your outfit in your home base or even use your Colosseum outfit out in the open like a regular costume. It also shows the change of outfit during the cutscenes. This game only allows you to change outfit in one place, and its troublesome to access sometimes.

POCKET RACING - even with guides, you really have to work for your wins and you do really have to utilize your boosts and stabilize abilities at the right times. Its so much more fun. 

They did try to do something unique with their cabaret club interaction where they make it more like an interactive movie instead of the usual game graphics. Its unique; like the photography studio sidequest on Yakuza Kiwami 1. 

As for the overall game, the writers did a great job with the ending. It portrayed very strong emotions and does tie in Kiryu (in this case, Joryu) with the whole reason he had his name erased in the first place. Its just THAT ending scene alone is what makes playing thru feel a little rewarding. Still, all things considered, I still felt more disappointed than satisfied (or even just ok) with this game as a whole. 

its really difficult to justify paying for this game at full price. Its fun, but it just felt lacking - unfinished even. Im really hoping that they get to add perks in the next game for people who bought this one because it really doesnt feel worth it.",1699740492,1699741449,False,1,0,0.444015413522720337,0,True,False,False

I also love the Judgement series with Yagami. For the games with Kiryu as the MC? I've not been as enthusiastic. I've tried multiple games with him it, including Ishin....but I wasn't able to get ""in"" to previous games with Kiryu as the MC, because of how stoic he is as a character. I bought this game as something to hold me over until Y8. THIS game? I'm starting to like Kiryu. Is he stil stoic? Yes, but this time it feels better.

First things first, the ""movie"" cut-scenes?  *chef's kiss* It's amazing, and considerably the best that RGG has ever made. It doesn't take very long in order to get to the action and getting you invested on wondering what's going to happen next and why people are trying to get Kiryu back into the fold. Kiryu's fighting is smoother than ever and ""secret agent"" style is definitely my go-to choice when in combat. At first glance, you might think the blue rope attack is stupid.....but on the contrary....it's very useful at times and somehow never loses it's appeal as you progress through the game. 

Speaking of progressing, you may notice that in chapter 1 that your exploration in the city is limited to the direction of the next cutscene. Don't worry, this is done away with by chapter 2. 

The story introduces a new character to the Yakuza franchise. This character is the one that offered Kiryu money to ""die"" at the end of Y6. He is back and he is Kiryu's handler. On top of that, he seems to be a pretty honorable guy. I've not yet finished the game, but I hope he stays true to the end. 

If there is one thing that I DON'T like about the game? It's that to get new moves or to increase your health/stats......it's not done by experience of battle, but by money. What this means is that when you are spending money on clothes/armor, food, etc....you're also having to use it to upgrade Kiryu. This will mean that you will need to grind more than ever to improve Kiryu.

Loved the story, it really broke my expectations of what I thought it would be, a very classic and satisfying yakuza story with great characters and hype moments, the ending in particular gave me Yakuza 5 vibes, except even better.

The minigames are a good collection of everything from the series, but I actually found the new substories to be extremely engaging, even moreso than the old games, they felt very focused and well curated, albeit at a numerical cost, but that's fine though, since I think it could be easy to get burnt out on them due to how it ties into progression (also a good thing)

So for 50 dollars in 2023 you're already getting a really decent bang for buck in regards to the actual quality of the game even if it's not that crazy long, I felt it was similar length to Anno Mutationem (25 bucks), it's awfully nice having a fun, polished, gorgeous, optimized game on launch in this day and age, so I still recommend it regardless, this game is about quality over quantity.",1699699709,1699699709,True,0,0,0.484848499298095703,0,True,False,False

The ending also gives justification for why Kiryu ends up in Hawaii at the beginning of Infinite Wealth. I wouldn't consider this game a must play but it is a great send off for (what I assume) will be Kiryu's final game in which he is the sole protagonist.

If the price wasn't a giveaway, Gaiden is a short game by modern Yakuza/LaD standards. That's no bad thing as the developers made it clear that the scope of this game is that of DLC, rather than a full fledged Yakuza title. I managed to finish the story in about 22 hours, if you include a copious amount of side content. The main story is about 14 hours or so, which would put it closer to Yakuza 1 or 2's main story if you want some idea of how long this game is. You only ever have access to Sotenbori which is one of the tiniest districts in the series history, as well as the ""Castle"" a large sea container turned into a makeshift playground for societies richest and most depraved individuals. 

A shorter experience is no bad thing if the game is made with this in mind and Gaiden mostly sticks to the same successful formula every other Yakuza entry has followed since the original in 2005. Kiryu plays similarly to how he felt in 6, but this time he has a brand new style (Agent) alongside his traditional Yakuza style. Agent is a technique style, combining fast punches with gadgets that can take out multiple enemies at a time. It has a lot of versatility for both single and multiple enemies once you've upgrade it. His traditional style isn't weaker because of how strong Agent is, but it is very powerful and there isn't a huge reason to use his Yakuza style outside of one-on-one encounters. The combat is almost as fun as Lost Judgement's. You can combo and juggle people while switching styles on the fly. If you enjoyed Judgement or any of the Dragon Engine combat in previous games, you will love the combat here.

Side content in Gaiden is generally strong but can also be very repetitive. Not unusual for any game in the series, but it might feel like padding if you consider how short the overall plot is. There are several returning minigames, but nothing particularly noteworthy outside of Daytona 2 being available in the arcade for the first time ever. The cabaret club minigame from the first few games makes a return (not managing a club, just the experience of visiting one). The main draw here is that it uses full motion video using real actors, instead of in game models simply using their likeness. 

I'll be real here: it makes for a pretty uncomfortable and awkward viewing experience. I'm not the target demographic for this content so I'll avoid saying that it's outright bad, but I think it would be in everyone's interest if this went the way of the pachinko minigame for future games. I have no problem with this minigame returning if people want it, but I think it should just be an optional download if the FMVs are going to eat up several gigs of data. 

The Hero requests from Like a Dragon also make a return, which are about as interesting as they were in that game, by which I mean they are pretty underwhelming. You do whatever a random NPC asks of you and you are rewarded with currency to upgrade Kiryu. The side content here is fine for a game of this size, but outside of the Coliseum which is the best in the series history, it isn't much to write home about.

The story deals with Kiryu having to live a double life after the events of Yakuza 6. He is isolated and is effectively stuck doing jobs for a faction he doesn't truly care for. It's entertaining but like most Yakuza games, last few twists feel a bit forced and if you think about it too much, you will question the logic and motivation of any given character. It's not unusual for a soap opera and if you've played virtually any game in this series, you're used to a few contrivances here and there. That being said, the new characters introduced in this game are excellent and the final boss is one of the best in the series. I really loved the Omi crew and Akame quickly became one of my favourite side ladies in the series. She's peppy and a bit boisterous but not annoying or ""quirky"", just a high spirited woman whose personality clashes with Kiryu's stoic and reserved nature. Despite the colossal difference in personalities, they work well together. I hope she returns if the series ever heads back to Sotenbori. 

And without spoiling anything specific, I will say that the ending to this game may be one of the best in the series. It was incredibly cathartic in a way that 6's was not. Especially if you've played Yakuza 1/Kiwami and Yakuza 3. While I did enjoy 6's ending, Gaiden's last few minutes give Kiryu closure on events that were only ever hinted at and it successfully shows the passing of time in a really painful and tragic way. 

Gaiden also has a bonus demo after completion for Infinite Wealth. I didn't play too much of it because I don't want any major story spoilers, but you can roam around a sizeable portion of Hawaii (whilst riding a segway!) and do a few substories, minigames and battle. The English dub has also been provided in that demo and you can listen to Judgement being sung in English if you want to punish yourself.",1699689709,1699696293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the time of writing this i have completed main story and a lot of subquest (but not all of them)

-The Combat feels underwhelming and feels like there's so many limitation on Kiryu himself , let me be honest LAD:Gaiden might actually have the second worst combat among the Yakuza/LAD games available on steam right now , i'm saying second worst because Blockuza 3 existed 

Yakuza and Agent style feels like un-refinded version of Judgment Yagami Crane and Tiger where one side is clearly are better to use on every aspect while other is underwhelming 

which makes me think that this LAD:Gaiden would've feels okay to play if this were released in similar time frame as first Judgment game not after Lost Judgment which arguably are the best combat Yakuza/Judgment series has ever been

maybe if this combat gets improvement in any future game it might have work out like Lost Judgment but highly doubt we would get another action game with Playable Kiryu as protagonist

- The Character oh boy , they actually trying to brought back character from old entry and it doesn't work out very well , the final boss of LAD Gaiden actually reminds me of Final boss of Yakuza 5 a lot in terms of characterization as how this one character characterization and development are all over the place and boom he just become final boss , but the fights are cool and engaging (credit where its due)

-Music (not the karaoke)  i don't feels like there's any track that worth remembering at all aside from final boss theme that stand out the most , which kinda makes me sad that at least Yakuza series would've done Music right and there would be few tracks from every game that definitely stand out 

that's all the bad thing i could think of , let's talk about good stuff
-good optimization , this game runs better than Lost Judgment for me at least
-Character customization 
-Kson and Kaname Ai is in the game.

that's all i could think of 

I love Yakuza series , i have play almost every entry that available on steam (haven't play Ishin yet)

The story is quite entertaining for Kiryu fans, but feels quite fan servicey at times, such as bringing back previous bosses like [spoiler]Ryuji & Kiryu cosplayers as bosses[/spoiler], and naming a character after one from 0. One of the Special Coliseum battles is even a gauntlet of robot versions of the previous endgame bosses w/ their respective themes playing.

The nice thing about this entry is that 100% compendium completion isn't required for all achievements, so you can get them all without being good at Mahjong or Shogi. I did it in about 29 hours.

The combat feels less polished than other entries, and has design choices that sometimes make me wonder what RGG was thinking. 
- When not locked on you can't dodge in a direction, meaning if you want to create space from a crowd you have to first lock on which easily throws off muscle memory for longtime fans. 
- Bosses are given grab attacks that are inescapable once they connect, other games had this but never to this extent, as someone else put it, it often feels like you're fighting Zangeif in SF. 
- The rush combo speed you're given is also incredibly slow, and since there's no combo speed upgrades you have to use Agent as your fast hitting style or play like you're always on the lowest heat level in Y0. It's mostly a problem for the Yakuza style, because if you're used to the Y6/K2 moveset, the contrast in speed can throw you off since it takes so much longer for the combos to come out. As such I recommend mods to increase the speed so that you're not literally always slower than who you're fighting. 
- Bosses are given insane hyper armor and no sell your attacks unless from behind turning some fights into Resolute Counter/Charge light --> Spam heal fests. 
- Tutorial pop-up telling me to guard vs. Nishitani who has a knife.
- The lock on is also inconsistent, so much so that this's the only Yakuza game I've had a problem with it. It can make the Spider gadget harder to use than it needs to be since you'll lock on to whatever boss or strongman is in the crowd and be unable to tether them, or in general when it targets random enemies nowhere near you and you whiff every hit until you release and actually get who you want.

Despite all the issues I have with the combat I enjoyed most of the story and especially the final chapter and have to say the final boss and section before it was incredibly hype. The ending makes me hopeful for Kiryu's character even though RGG should really make Ichiban the new head of the series and put an end to Kiryu's story.",1699498524,1699687813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

after finishing the game, i gotta say: just wow.
the coliseum is one of my favourites, with the ability to play with different characters (majima, saejima and daigo if you got the pre-order dlc), and agent's gadgets are fun as hell.

some nitpicks are that dragon's speed isnt upgradeable, it doesnt have komaki parry or that DE block parry (not komaki knock back), i also feel that gaining heat is somewhat tough.

money is easy to obtain and styling kiryu is fun.

As a long time fan of the series I had my fun with the game but at same time I couldn't help but to feel like I was playing through a glorified expansion sold at a premium and one where it might be a little difficult to justify the price tag unless you plan to do most of the side content as the main story is really short.

Combat system is a fun iteration of the older brawler combat which is a welcome improvement after the somewhat lackluster combat of Kiwami 2 and Yakuza 6, although it isn't without its flaws and the more you level up the more those blemishes start to show especially in terms of balancing. In addition to the familiar fighting style of Kiryu game introduces a new agent style which focuses bit more on finesse, stylish counters and utilizes some rather hilarious spy gadgets that you unlock as you progress through the story.

As expected of a Yakuza title there is a plethora of minigames and a chunk of side content, minigames could be described as a sort of ""best of"" collection of various things you've seen along the years with some new things sprinkled in here and there, side content on the other hand felt like bit of a letdown. Substories for the most part are rather generic and a far cry from some of the more whacky and memorable ones the series is known for, combine that with some bland ""fetch quests"" that the game introduces - I think the best way to describe them would be disappointing.

That being said I had my fun with the game and enjoyed the roughly 26 hours it took me to beat it on professional difficulty while doing all of the substories, almost all of the fetch quests and a good chunk of the minigames.

This is a game about Kiryu ending a lot of conclusions of the mainline history of the games, if you are the kind of people who didn't like the JRPG, this is the other side of the history of Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon and summarises all. Nevertheless, both games are great and made with a lot of care.

[h2]🎮Gameplay[/h2]

Remember Yakuza 0? and the EXP system that is fixed with money? This system is similar because you upgrade using the money made in combat, exploring or doing side-quests but in addition to a point system of doing little side-quests and secondary quest to Akame.

The combat has 2 stances, there's a Spy one that is focused on using gadgets and AOE to the enemies, with tools like the ""spider whip"" to toss the enemies, unarm them, etc... Rocket boots, Drones and my favourite one, the exploding cigar. The other stance is Dragon, it's all the normal combat you should expect if you played this saga.

Finally, there are some mini-games and Pocket-Circuit returned once again. If you played the saga like I am, you should be able to exploit all the systems and have fun. The only thing is that the game is a bit shorter than the mainline ones, make sure to know it if you want to wait for a sale.

[h2]📕History[/h2]

We are a few years after Yakuza 6: Song of Life, Kiryu is working with the ""Daidoji Faction"" and it's like the ""Deep State"" of this fictional Japan. Also, this game happens at the same time as Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon with another perspective and more insights about the resolution of the ""3K Plan"" of the dissolution of the Yakuza/Gokudo.

[h2]🎨Art [/h2]

This game is made in UE5 but still feels like all the Yakuza games, even if the same assets look a bit recycled or refurbished, Sotenbori looks awesome with all those billboards, neon lights, etc... beautiful scenery with tons of details and little things. As always, the character models and expressions are top-notch, great and expressive, even the NPCs look great.

Pros:
+Great story, despite only being 5 chapters long
+Introduces cool new interesting characters like Hanawa, Akame, Shishido, and Tsuruno. Some of them I wish we got to see more of.
+Combat is the same as the other Dragon Engine games. I still personally prefer Lost Judgement's combat.
+Plenty of side content.

Cons:
-Some of the side content can be extremely repetitive, but that can be said for almost every Like A Dragon game.

I absolutely recommend it. It tells a very important missing part of the Like A Dragon story very succinctly, despite it being very short. 8/10",1699611371,1699611371,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, make no mistake, this is probably one of the best games in the series to date, with solid combat, story, and setting.

The combat is by far the most fluid and fun in the series to date, beating out Lost Judgment as it takes all the strengths from that game and combines it with new and interesting mechanics to make it more interesting. Kiryu has 2 styles, Agent and Yakuza. Yakuza is very similar to Kiryu's Dragon of Dojima style from 1-6, with a few extra moves added in, but the Agent style is completely different, with 4 different gadgets to use during combat, and a moveset that is more suited to dealing with large groups of enemies.

The story, without spoiling too much, perfectly bridges the gap between the end of Yakuza 6 and the end of Yakuza: Like a Dragon, showcasing Kiryu's perspective during that time. It also gives you extra info about what some characters (I won't say who) from a previous game are up to in the present. 

The game itself is set in Sotenbori (with a brief section in Isezaki Ijincho towards the beginning of the game) now expanded to include the park which was noticeably absent in previous iterations of Sotenbori in the Dragon Engine. It may seem like a small change but it really makes Sotenbori feel a lot bigger and more lively with a wider variety of places to visit.

Finally, there's the part I was most excited for before this game released, which is the trial of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth included after beating the main story. I haven't played much of it so far but it's an amazing reward which offers a sneak peek into what the next game will be like.

Overall, if you enjoyed Yakuza 6 or Yakuza: Like a Dragon, I'd definitely recommend purchasing this game, as there is so much that's offered in addition to a preview of the next game in the series before it's released.",1699597329,1699597329,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spices up the combat with unique gimmicks, adds the best Coliseum the franchise has seen so far, really nice outfit customization (mods are gonna make it wild 100%) and a nice variant of Part-Time Hero for things to do in Sotenbori. 

Having finished the story, it is definitely more entertaining than a lot of story beats of other games in the franchise, that's for sure, and there's nice references to previous games scattered across the main story and substories. It ties into the events of 7 really nicely and the finale is amazing.

[b]Do note:[/b] for best experience you'd have ideally played all of the previous games, but in general here are the recommendations:
- 6 and 7 are absolute must-plays: Gaiden goes into the story beats of 7 a lot and connects the timeline between 6 and 7 and doesn't hold back on going into all details of what happens in 7. It doesn't go into much detail of events of 6, however, other than the one reason why Kiryu is The Man Who Erased His Name
- 3 and 5 are next on the list of must-plays: to fully grasp the emotional side of Kiryu's experience throughout his journey in Gaiden and to basically feel the feels for the man. I felt many feels, ok, and I didn't enjoy 3 at all but ngl what they did here kinda made my suffering of playing 3 on Hard worth it
- Kiwami 1 and 2 aren't a must-play, but it's good to have played them both to understand a few references and callbacks here and there
- 0 and 4 are kind of not really relevant at all, surprisingly, other than for Pocket Circuit I guess",1699546181,1699573243,True,2,2,0.543676674365997314,0,True,False,False

Incredibly uninteresting main story, with hours upon hours of pointless exposition. I'm sorry, but if you can't provide a SINGLE hook in the first 5 hours of gameplay, it's a bad story.
Lackluster minigames that have been done already a million times in previous titles, not to mention false advertising from the developer: 
""Developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has confirmed that the fan-favorite Cabaret mini-game will make a return in Like a Dragon Gaiden.""
Turns out, this is NOT the cabaret management minigame from Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 2, but just an utterly cringy, live-action ""conversation"" with hostesses that are 5s at best. If they think THIS is the ""fan-favorite Cabaret mini-game"", then they don't know their fans at all.

Combat and character development definitely took a step in the backwards direction. Just plain, uninteresting purchasing of mundane abilities and stat increases.
Not much else to say. This whole ordeal felt like a cheap knock-off of Yakuza 0.

I'd definitely refund this one, if I could.

And the ending of the game was really emotional and good as most of the Yakuza game endings. It was really nice seeing Kiryu being able to see all his kids he have been taking care of and cared about seeing them all grown up and Kiryu being proud of them all.

The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to sixteen players. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps with a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km), an Advanced course with 4 laps with a distance of 2.5 miles (4.0 km), and a long Expert course with 2 laps with a distance of 5 miles (8.0 km). The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an ""ending"" and see the game credits. An addition to the game was the ""slingshot"", corresponding to advanced NASCAR drafting techniques.
