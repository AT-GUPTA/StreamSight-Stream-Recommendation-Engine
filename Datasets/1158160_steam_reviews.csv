It's super ambitious, but it falls flat because the game mechanics itself feels half-baked.

Stardew Valley is created with pixels, but the creator used most of their time making sure the game was intuitive and mechanically well put together. Coral island is not that. It looks great, but does it play great? that answer is up to the devs.

Artists are self-centered, I say that being an artist myself. And it's easy for us to tunnel our focus and obsessions into the look of our work. But were not talking about a canvas here. It's a video game. When you neglect the other properties of what makes a game, a game, you end up with this.

Started playing the game on Steamdeck shortly after the 1.0 release, which brings me to the first problem. Game is incredibly unoptimized at least for the deck. Frequent screen hangs, game runs really hot and fans don't really slow down, this is with the frame rate capped at 60.

Second major issue with the game is there is a ton of content that is just missing. This game features a ""community center"" in the same vein as Stardew but at least one reward is just not in the game. After checking the roadmap after playing for a few hours and noticing some stuff looked like it was missing, the Savannah is indeed planned for release this year, which is one of the rewards for the community center bundle.

Beyond that the underwater aspect of this game, which is one of the big thing that sets it apart from Stardew, also seems to be half finished. The entire diving experience is currently very tedious. It has a similar feel to cleaning up the farm when you start one of these types of games, except your movement speed is extremely slow and the amount of area you need to clear is gigantic. There are also several underwater caves that work as areas to farm trash, but looks like they were intended to be something else? There are a few different caves but they all just feature respawnable trash and nothing else.

There are also a few other smaller things that seem to be unfinished, like the recycling center.

Beyond the missing content there are a few additional problems I have with the game that I don't really think will be addressed. First and foremost I find the ""mine"" content pretty lackluster and a step back from Stardews mine/skull cavern which is saying a lot because that wasn't exactly riveting content to begin with. Also the progression feels really weird. A lot of the qol upgrades you can get are pretty expensive so they don't really come into play until after they would make a ton of difference. Almost all of the upgrades need batteries and batteries generally come pretty late game unless you know how to get them and make a strong push to unlock them as soon as possible.

Final nitpick about the game and albeit it's a small one it's still there. Most if not all of the farm equipment (e.g. furnace, recycling machine) can't be rotated. Its a minor gripe and one that is purely aesthetic but I find it to be pretty problematic in a game that is largely about aesthetics.

All that being said, that doesn't mean I hate the game and the game does have some aspects it has improved upon for the genre. The skill system feels pretty good and while some of the skill choices don't have a strong impact, being able to unlock all of them as well as having so many skills feels pretty good. The additional content in terms of artisan equipment also adds to the experience. Rather than throwing everything into a preserves jar or keg, there are quite a few different types of artisian equipment which is nice. Also the cows are adorable so that's a plus.

It's not a bad game and I think there are many people that would enjoy it in its current state, I am just not one of those people. I will likely take a second look after most of the content that is missing is added and update my review accordingly but as of right now I think the game very much still feels like an early access title.",1708737790,1708737790,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But you have to be aware that it has incomplete storylines, and Ive had the game start crashing randomly when interracting with characters since i hit year 2. Ive also had some issues with objects in the game randomly disappearing.

Personally I still recommend the game and still enjoy it immensly, but it is something to absolutely keep in mind if youd rather wait for more updates before buying :3",1708542709,1708729226,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I'll start with what I enjoyed.  What drew me like many others to this game was the amount of NPC's and their diversity. I loved that there are so many cultures and ethnicities that are represented here. I was such a breath of fresh air.  I love the amount of character customization that is available. The Mini-games and purpose in the festivals, and the general aesthetic of the game is fantastic.

Now with the bad. It's clunky, extremely clunky for a game that's been in early access and full release this long. Combat works a bit like Stardew, you have to be facing a certain direction to hit mobs, and if you aren't well versed in that type of combat it can be a bit frustrating, especially when it comes to some of the mini games that are in the festivals.  The sound design needs some serious help, I have to play this game while watching something or playing music in the background because this game is lacking a lot in the sound department, some things just don't have sounds at all. The NPC's while diverse in their stories and their backgrounds are all extremely surface level, and this game struggles with lets just let the farmer fix everything. The writing is lacking in this department, its the tale of ""Oh wow look at that it fixed itself"" syndrome.   While I am only 60 hours in to this game and still within the first year I've come to the point that I can no longer play because of the CONSTANT crashing. It's not well known unless you do some digging into their Reddit posts but there is a known ongoing issue with AMD builds having a massive memory leak. So for me, with an AMD build, the game will crash consistently after about an hour or so of play loosing an entire days' work, and on top of it all my entire computer freezes up and I have to completely restart my computer. I found a bit of a work around by cleaning out my cache and temp files after each time I play, but that shouldn't be something I have to do. Not since this has been an known issue for a little over a year now.  

That being said I still have hopes that this game can turn it around, given a little bit of time an patience. I would rather they dug their heels into fixing some of the known issues with the overall game before they tried to port it to other platforms or worry about adding new content or DLC, but that's more of an over all issue with the gaming industry as a whole.

Farming, mining, fishing, catching, etc  It's got it all!!  The visuals are stunning!  The island is breathtaking, and you can see the fine details when visiting NPC's houses.  

That being said, it is not complete.  The storyline is nowhere near done and there are far too many bugs.  Don't get me started on the inability to save as we want to.  It has crashed on me multiple times and I lost a full day's worth of work.  It crashed even AFTER saving and did not save the 10K I had made.  Things go missing when trying to decorate the house.  Mermaids have no storyline.  You can't interact more with your husband.  The baby's room cannot be decorated.  Babies can't be held and interacted with.  They do not grow beyond being a baby in a crib.

Even though it had these many problems and frustrations, it is still a delightful game if you are willing to put up with it.

PROS:
- Graphics are decent (UE4)
- Obvious influence from Stardew Valley everywhere, but still has it's own identity.  Some mechanics are better implemented than in than title.  
- Lots of content
- All of the romance options are really really really ridiculously good looking. 
- Fishing is actually fun unlike Stardew Valley which is tedious. 
- Devs seem to interact with the Community a lot

CONS:
- Doesn't seem to have the same cozy 'charm' like Stardew Valley has.  It's not a bad game, just doesn't feel the same. 
- There's quite a lot of dynamic music, it's not bad but it's forgettable and generic compared to the quite memorable music of Stardew Valley.  I always played with the music on in SD because it was just so good especially with the different seasons, I mostly turned it off in this game.  
- The changing of the seasons just doesn't have the same visual ""punch"", even if there's far more detail for each season in this game.  It's probably because the colors in Stardew are over saturated and stylized as a pixel art game. 
- Yuri hated the osmium bar I gave her, but she apparently liked it enough to keep it of course!
- Text chat with the NPCs is sorta boring and forgettable, but they're hot so it makes it more bearable. 
- The town bar in the game has more 'events' that happen in it, but it's no Stardrop Saloon.
- Does really have that small town feel to the game.

Final verdict: It's trying very hard to try and be a better Stardew Valley, and it mostly gets there but still won't overtake the OG.",1708560111,1708560111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Right now, I tell my friends who have Coral Island on their wishlists to not buy it.
The game is 'released' as in: I assumed it was playable in it's entirety, play the whole story and expereice a FULL game.
I, we, you can't do that right now. (I'm writing this right after Hotfix v1.0-945 came out)
The story can't be finished, there is no [spoiler]Merfolk[/spoiler] Storyline (and they are an essential part of the mid to late game), some romance scenes are not implemented - you can't marry certain characters yet and there is no indicator for that.
Quests are marked WIP in the questlog because they are not implemented. 
The game crashes regularly (for a lot of people, I only encountered this since the recent Hotfix).
Character illustrations are not implemented yet or sloppily cut out with white edges where they should not be. 
Some of the Achievements are at 0.0% rate because: they can't be completed at this point in time. 

Go look up the 2024 roadmap for Coral Island and be surpirsed by all the things not included in the FULL game release and decide for yourself if you should buy now or wait if and when they will finish their fully released game. 
They also release 2 hotfixes a month since releasing the game, trying to very slowly unbreak their broken game. 

I will play further, if my savestate let's me and might edit this later on, but rn I'm not happy with the state of Coral Island at all.",1708553251,1708553612,False,21,0,0.73992687463760376,0,True,False,False

This game is a Love Letter to the Genre of ""Farm Sims"" made popular by Harvest Moon and reignited by Stardew Valley. It wears its influences on its sleeve (theres literally a Hat-mouse equivalent called ""Concerned Monkey"") but has its own distinct identity. It is genuinely a lovely game that I wish I could recommend.

You play as a Person fed up with being an office worker and who is now moving to their Grandfathers old farm. You plant crops, explore mines, forage and talk to the townsfolk. You even get to engage in lovely festivals and the like. The overall Gameplay-loop is really enjoyable.

The game really captures what is great about the genre but has its own distinctive feel. It manages to be cozy while having genuinely flawed characters in sometimes difficult relationships. The characters are varied in appearance, background and behavior.

So why am I not recommending this game? The clue is, as you likely expected, in the fact that this game claims to be finished. It simply is not.

There is a bunch of missing content. Questlines end prematurely, festivals don't change after year 1 (with one exception), the Halloween festival gets you hyped for costumes and everyone is in their normal clothes (The characters literally ask you how their costumes look), the new years festival does not even have an intro or the advertised mistletoe kiss. The underwater caves (there are 5 of them) are the exact same, just an empty square room with literal trash on the ground and nothing else. These are just a couple of the issues and basically no aspect of the game feels finished.

The balancing is completely screwed.

And there are so many bugs. Gamebreaking bugs. Delete your tools after 20 hours bugs, crash to desktop bugs, having buildings stuck on your farm bugs, visual bugs etc. I literally cannot decorate my house since the flooring does not work, the wallpapers don't line up etc. And this is constant. After hour 10 you will likely run into multiple bugs per hour.

This game is nowhere near finished but insists it is. And as a finished game I can simply not recommend it. Wait a year and buy it on a discount. Do not support this behavior. 

P.S

I would like to add that I believe that these issues lie entirely with the publisher. The Developers are super responsive to bug reports, get back to you with issues and seem quite aware of the discontent in the community. Definetly watch out for Humble Games and dont buy from them though.

This game is very much similar to Stardew Valley, which is another top fav.. There are ALOT of similar things and events that happen in it.. it is pretty much the same story, just a different theme, being aquatic...
Things like... going to the town center and seeing something magical happen like the jumo in Stardew, in this, it is the giants. The evil company that wants to take over the island is the same... Love the Karen meme name for the villain.... LOL...

There are also some fun references featured... On the TV, Claude Strife from Landslide who lives in Midgur... Cloud from FF7.... One townie mentions this other island that gets excited over the price of turnips.. an obvious Animal Crossing reference, love it...

It contains a lot of Stardew Valley elements (maybe too many, at times), but it takes its own unique spin and even improves and expands on some of the concepts. There's traditional farming, like planting crops and taking care of barn/coop animals, but you unlock new animals and craft items over time, which makes it more challenging since you can't do everything at the very beginning. Exploring the ocean is fun and is a lot like the No Place Like Home game where you clean up trash, only it's more like mining in the sense that you can get treasure chests and resources like you can get geodes and monster loot in the mines. There's a museum to donate fossils and gems and fish and even bugs to (bug catching is fun) and a place to give offerings to the goddess, like the bundles in Stardew at the community center. You can also free ""giants"" in this one, though they look more like No Face in Spirited Away than giants. You can adopt pets, including a lizard, and new areas unlock and likely will be developed more later, so there's room for the game to grow. 

It's a really lovely game, and there are a lot of characters with interesting dialogue and interactions. I think people who like Stardew Valley, No Place Like Home, Harvest Moon, My Time at Sandrock/Portia, and even the Sims would enjoy this game very much and get several hours of playtime out of it.

The game is not worth the current price!
As an Early Access player, I thought this would be a really good game in this genre.
Yes, development was slow, but it was always clear and communicated what would be implemented in the future and when.
It could have been the ultimate game of its kind, it was so much fun.
So much so that as a review grouch I actually feel compelled to write a review and vent my frustration after more than two months of waiting and hoping.

Then the ridiculously early release of the 1.0 version, lots of missing content, bugs and crashes to the point of unplayability wherever you look, both for console players and us PC players.
Advertising of game features that don't even exist is also part of this, for example mermaid romances.
The majority of players have game crashes or crashes every 20-30 minutes during important events or activities.
Or even better, the complete destruction of the savegame at the end of the day.
Without manually saving the savegames in some kind of backup space, you always run the risk of losing everything.
Just have a look at their Discord server in the bugs and crashes section, it's crazy!
And all this and much more for only 30 Euro, such a bargain lol

Currently simply unplayable for many players.

And the developers don't have a proper Q&A department yet!
That's why hotfixes take so long to be released, regardless of whether they don't help or even break more.
I was a big fan of the game, I promoted it to every friend who likes to play games like this, but right now I wish I could still refund this!

If you're okay with what is effectively still an Early Access game: Coral Island is great, and very promising.



Don't be fooled by the big banner that tells you this game is in its ""1.0"" release state - for all intents and purposes, this game is still in Early Access. Is it still good? Of course! It's tropical Stardew Valley with a large, interesting map, a metric fuckton of characters, and promising storylines. But the major storylines aren't finished and the game is frankly too buggy for what is supposedly the official release.

There's nothing inherently wrong with the current state of the game, but disguising it as a full, finished game is misleading. I made it only about fifteen hours into the game before I started noticing how unfinished it is. Missing character portraits, placeholder dialogue, the entire Merfolk Kingdom quest that currently goes nowhere. The underwater Merkingdom was initially one of the final Kickstarter goals for this game and intended to be added later on - so why add it now? It seems like something that should be added in a major content update when it's *finished*. That happened to the quest I got hooked on and to find I couldn't finish it was disappointing.



That was a lot of negatives, but this game is seriously, genuinely fun. 

If you loved the social aspect of Stardew, you'll have a ball with this one. There's probably fifty characters, about twenty of whom you can date. Unfortunately, you can't romance Sunny (the best character), but to be welcomed in his presence in any capacity is an honor. His wife is cool but I would treat him better.

If you loved filling in the museum in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, bingo again. Fishing and catching bugs is super fun, and genuinely difficult (gave me a healthy dose of gamer rage, not going to lie), and the completed museum is gorgeous. I'd say a solid fifth of my time so far has been dedicated to scouring the map for critters.

And exploring the island is awesome. There's tons of cool spots and hidden areas to uncover. I had a blast just checking out what the inside of each character's home looked like. A ton of thought has gone into the physical world of Starlet City and it pays off. Plus what makes up the current underwater portion is fun and pretty exciting to explore. I can tell it's going to be incredible once it all comes together. And it'll be even greater if they let us marry Agung. PLEASE, I am begging.

Coral Island is a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing farming sim in the vein of Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, and honestly, I have really enjoyed my time with it. The art direction is beautiful, the game play loop scratches the farming sim itch, and I even really enjoyed the grind of cleaning the oceans fully. 

However, it is [i]not a finished game[/i] despite being taken out of Early Access, and I am very borderline now on recommending it until Stairway completes it, despite my enjoyment of it. I am keeping my review as 'recommended', but buyers beware: you need to go into the game with eyes wide open at the state of the game and what transpired here.

Coral Island was held in Early Access for ages, then released as 1.0 with many of the promised features still missing, and no clear timeline as to when they'll be released except to say it'll be in '2024'. Though the game is definitely [i]more[/i] complete than it was in Early Access with some of the most egregious bugs ironed out, there are some key things missing. 

The entire Merfolk area under the sea is largely incomplete, which is mad given how much time you have to grind clearing out trash to even get to it. Merfolk, and relationships with them, are still locked without a way to increase them. Children, when you can have them, don't have portraits, dialogue, and don't age up. There's an [b]entire area unavailable[/b] called the Savannah that's meant to be accessible after completing certain turn-in achievements in the later game.

Sadly, there are definitely still bugs. My husband in-game sometimes speaks to me like our ceremony happened the day previous (even though it's been a full season ago), the Warp Sesejan map glitches out when making selections as to destinations, the cursors on the tool upgrade screen sometimes don't respond to controller movement and input, and the hotbar sometimes randomly disappears after trying to cast a fishing line. Those are just the ones I can think off of the top of my head, but there is - at the time of writing this - a bug where the farm's computer is partially broken, with its critical shopping feature currently removed from the game despite working previously...

And to top it all off, the game started via Kickstarter; I can only imagine the frustration of some of the backers at [i]still[/i] not getting the game they financially supported when Stairway have said this is a 1.0 version. They also increased the price between Early Access and 1.0 release, which I would understand if the game were finished. However, it's not, and it makes me wonder if the push to 1.0 release was governed by concerns over finances and capital. I don't think we'll ever know, but it definitely wasn't a good look.

-----

In terms of the mid-to-end game, I have very much enjoyed my time with Coral Island, but now having got my island to rank B, I don't feel like there's any more content for me to complete other than to grind to rank A for, what I understand, is very little reward!

The content dead zone between B and A is all about completing the Temple turn ins, which requires specific bug catches and fishes at different seasons and time, and getting a few rare seasonal and animal crops turned in. If you didn't use a guide to check out some of these fish or bugs, too bad, you may need to wait a whole year to get the chance to catch them again and complete the game. And in the meantime, all that's now left to do is grind out and make money for the sake of it. 

But if I'm brutally honest, there's not much to [i]do[/i] with the money that interests me; the largest cash sinks would be in decorating your home or farm, or purchasing clothing. And, one negative about Coral Island is its decoration system UI is dreadful. I usually play on controller, but I HAVE to switch to Keyboard and Mouse to put down any furnishings in my home. I shudder to think what console players have to wrestle with. Even then, it's unintuitive and more work than it's worth. Outdoor furnishings are a little better, but not much. The personal clothing is 'okay' but there are few pieces that make me want to grind and sink money into fashion. 

I'm at a point now where I'm putting down the game until there's more content. For my critiques about the Early Access/1.0 release debacle, I will admit I have had a lot of fun with the game. However, if you are going to purchase Coral Island, be completely aware that as of February 2024, it's still not finished, despite the 1.0 tag.",1694894049,1708007449,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

When I first started [i]Coral Island[/i] (2023) I thought it might be one of the best looking farm-sims ever, up there with [i]Doraemon Story of Seasons[/i] (2022). Now, after more than 60 hours of taking in Stairway Games very detailed graphics that impress in every season, I can comfortably say that this game is, graphically, in its own category.

And this is a great thing, because, judging by the stats in the Steam trophies, most people focus on the farming aspect of the game. An here, the game excels; the level of customization is indeed exciting, though the chores one's farmer will have to do get a bit repetitive: from bronze to silver to gold to... you get the point: it takes a while to progress, and the road to progress is boringly straight, but not unexpected for this genre.

What is an unexpected disappointment is the depth of the game. Back to the Steam trophies: while 26% of players make over 100 000 coins, only half of date go on a date. And I don't blame them, because the bachelorettes are as a shallow as the corals surrounding your farm. Where there is a whiff of personality, it evaporates quickly by zero development. The romancing cut-scenes mostly indicate that there needs to be a restraining order against the player, who is a passive voyeur of most of the action. Think of the heartfelt moments lived in [i]Stardew Valley[/i] (2016), devoid them of any trace of a soul, and that's what you get here. And I play these games for the connections with the characters, so for me this grievance has really detracted from the experience: but if all you want from a sim is to decorate and develop your farm, this might be the one for you.

I currently have 4 girlfriends in the game, and can't decide who to marry because none of them have given any indication of being aware of our relationship. Well, to be honest I only started dating Suki because I thought it would be hilarious to date twin sisters, but while Alice seems nice and Lily seems like an interesting character, I can't really tell; I'm going for Leah, then, as she seems to be vaguely aware of our relationship and its progression. But I've had enough, and I'm moving on to something new. While the form of this game is without par, I wish the developers, who are obviously very talented artists, would have paired with better writers, as Coral Island is without depth. If meaningful connections are not your priorities (more power to you!) this game is awesome; otherwise, I'd wait for something better to come along, or for discount, as £25 is a bit steep for this game-play loop.",1707996513,1707996513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Large chunks of game play, items, characters, textures, spawn points, and even some basic functionality are missing. Hold off for the 1.0 release. Till then there is no reason to purchase this.

Edit: After this ""1.0"" announcement I would like to change my stance to wait till 2024 to even give this game a chance when the actual 1.0 game will be out and not this fake 1.0 we get next month. This game is leaving early access but I do not believe it will be in a 1.0 state based on previous updates.

Edit 2: Spoiler warning for this. I have played through the game to the end of year two twice now and I can say with a degree of certainty that I want to love this game but the number of unfinished parts of the game kills it for me. The patch before the 1.0 only went to Fall, and the fake 1.0 stretches just barely to include winter.

Mermaid City you discovered? Empty Shell.

The Mermaids themselves? You can't even talk to them.

Giants you freed from the cave? Yeah they have no events and no story beyond being unfrozen.

The offerings for the Goddess? You can finish them, but the Savannah doesn't exist. 

The Goddess also doesn't have any lines or story.

Dating? Ha, the characters barely acknowledge it.

Marriage? Enjoy the same 3 lines from your spouse till the end of time, and random npcs saying how happy they are to be married to you. 

Children? They legit do not do anything. You cant even interact with them. Also enjoy those ugly nursery rooms. 

On top of that tons of typos and bugs like Jack and Kira for some reason don't have birthdays? I don't know that's a bug, but if its intentional its weird.

Coral Island definitely still needs that last 20% or so of polish, but there's more than enough to love in the meanwhile.

As someone who's spent much of my life in the tropics, I cannot even begin to explain how happy this game made me wandering around and seeing the sorts of plants I'd actually see day to day - gingers, figs, epiphytes etc. It just feels very homey to me and breath of fresh air to the more generic tropical settings in other games (eh, just slap some palm trees around and we'll be good). Never have I spaffed all my money in a farming game faster than I have to buy a jackfruit tree or paused to have a quick moment over getting klepon in the mail (it's my speciality for family get-togethers ahaha) 

There's also such a wide variety of townies with interesting personalities and backstories to get to know - though at current implementation, certain characters have a bit more love given to them than others, but the devs seem to be getting around to implementing more dialogue and events for everyone so watch this space (you can't just have a reclusive but good-natured ginger who's married to their profession and NOT expect me to want to know everything about them! That's my favourite flavour of farm sim NPC!). 

I quite enjoy the environmental aspect of the game, but I found myself wanting a bit more in terms of details. Some times it feels a bit 'if everyone stopped being mean and came together, we can do anything! Yay team!', even though your farmer is hard-carrying for the town. For example, early in the game there's a tree-planting event to re-forest an illegally logged patch of rainforest that's totally barren, and an NPC is telling you it's a great place for saplings cause it rains a lot. Unconsolidated soil? On a hill? With tonnes of rain? Girl, that's a recipe for landslides, and something tells me being buried under a pile of dirt is not optimal growing conditions for any tree. Another NPC talks about bringing oak saplings to plant, which don't sound like native trees in the slightest given what else I've seen growing on the island. I guess I just think it could be a really good opportunity to discuss the flow on effects of logging (nothing is supporting the soil so land subsides faster in the wet, lack of competition lets weeds come in and take over, changed plant types can lead to higher risks of bush fires etc.) and how to do a good re-wilding project with respect to the needs of the animals who used to make the area home. But that might just be a me problem...

If I had to make one complaint about actual game play, I'd have to say hitbox detection can be a bit hit-or-miss (full disclosure: I have been playing with controller, so that might have something to do with it). The amount of times I've talked to my chickens while trying to pick up eggs or interacted with the scarecrows when trying to harvest crops is slightly maddening. I've tried being really delicate with it, but I can't seem to find a sweet spot yet. This also causes issues with watering crops, cause I can swear till I'm blue in the face that I watered my whole field, but yet some buggers are almost always missed. It's partially the hit detection but also that the crops take up the whole square - don't get me wrong, they're very pretty models that do a good job representing the real plants, but I can't tell if I watered them or not for the life of me. There's already a system in place to show if you've watered multi-tile crops, so maybe we could have this for 1x1 crops too?

All in all, I love this game and I'm looking forward to playing it for a good while to come :D",1707952603,1707953916,True,0,0,0.49768519401550293,0,True,False,False

The game does what it sets out to do well: it's a great farming game, with unique doses of its setting that are quite interesting, both culturally and in terms of the diversity of creatures, and the part about cleaning up the oceans is quite interesting... at least at first.
You don't have to play much to see how shallow many things have become during the game's development, most likely because the game is still quite incomplete.
Unlike other games, where completing challenges (in this case the altar of offerings, equivalent to the community center in Stardew Valley), unlocks new content and features, many of these are incomplete here: When you unlock npc's like Pandazen, it's a beautiful region, but empty and with nothing of interest beyond the first glance.
Likewise the ocean is the same frustration: the mermaid kingdom is interesting at first glance... and then you realize that you can barely interact with the npc's, or there's nothing to do there.
In the end, the game leaves you with the feeling that it could have been excellent, but it's mediocre due to the large number of incomplete things.

The game copied Stardew's systems way too closely, yet at the same time, the changes it did make kept me invested for much longer. 

I'm not someone who enjoys the social sim aspect of farming sims, so no comments on it (though there's a lot more bachelors I like in this compared to other farming sims), but the progression system in Coral Island is just so much more enjoyable than Stardew. The ocean cleaning is such a soothing activity, and the fact that progress gets saved unlike mining made it more enjoyable. Plus it helps that unlike Stardew, the resources are very cleanly split in areas (one cave has exclusively copper ore + misc items while another exclusively has silver ore, etc) so it's easier to remember where everything is, and the split between ores and kelp for upgrading and crafting is nice. If I get bored of ocean cleaning, I can go back in the mines and work on different upgrades, I'm not forced into doing just one activity to get any progress.

Also the computer is definitely the best addition in this game. I absolutely despised Stardew's community center, but Coral Island made the altars/museum so much better by having a way to visually see what fish and insects are available as well as where they are on the map. It's so much better and faster than cross-referencing the wiki when there's still a lot of items missing.

Biggest gripes are just the same universal complaints I have about every farming sim I've played. Crops are one-dimensional. There is just one objectively best crop to grow each season, the variety is completely pointless. Also the combat just... exists. It's just a lot of mashing. Coral Island somehow managed to make combat more boring than Stardew, and the bar was already in the ground.

Overall a fun, chill game. It wasn't some amazing experience or anything, but it was a great time waster. It's still incomplete, but for the price, I got a ton of mileage out of this game, though I don't really see myself likely to come back when more features come out.",1707688199,1707688199,True,0,0,0.463638067245483398,0,True,False,False

As per now, most of the bugs are getting fixed. So far, I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs like what other people mentioned. There are still minor, inconveniencing bugs but they won't affect much of the gameplay imo. 

Main quest is still in development. You'll progress quite far (enough to get you hooked), hit the ceiling, and make do with weekly errands for the time being as you wait for the next update. Based on their 2024 roadmap, though, this game seems very promising but you just gotta have the patience to wait some more.  Still, honestly this game is quite addictive so waiting feels like torture (is it good or bad lol). 

There are some things I'm not quite fond of though, but maybe it's just me:
1. Heart events for some dateables don't really have anything to do with us. It's okay if it's for other NPCs, but for bachelors/bachelorettes, it's a bit awkward how our chara will just stand there🧍‍♂️ without interacting. It feels kinda disengaging in a way. Good thing there's an option to skip😅
2. As a nosey person, it's a bit disheartening that there's a chat limit (gift limit is understandable, but talking? come on). Characters, even those with 8 hearts or more, will just straight up ignore you after like 3-4 bubble chats (ngl this is hilarious in a way). I don't mind repeated text lines, I just wanna see them talk more😣
3. We can't save other than after going to bed. So it's all or nothing for the whole day. We can't even have multiple save files. One chara, one save file, and it automatically saves once a day. That's it, take it or leave it. (pssst if you tinker with your local save files you can still get the backups)

Overall, this game worth your every cents. I wouldn't say it's a blatant copy of Stardew, cause let's be real even that is also inspired by harvest moon, no? This game may be inspired from Stardew (idk), but this game adds a lot of cultural points native to Asia (esp. Indonesia) also design and style are ike apples and oranges. Scientifically speaking, this game spots the gap and room for improvements and they Delivered, so I see no issues. Other mechanics, of course they'd be similar. What are you expecting from a farming sims game? You wanna solve math each time you harvest a crop or what? Lmaoo

Can't wait for more updates (literally I'm on my edge I'm keeping tabs on their socials). Keep up the good work, dev team! Semangat Mas Mbak bakoh♡",1707667185,1707667185,True,0,0,0.495207667350769043,0,True,False,False

It's a less great Stardew Valley but in 3D. I'm going to recommend this game because it adds a few things I really liked that weren't just taken directly from Stardew Valley. Otherwise it offers basically the exact same experience as Stardew, just a bit shallower. If you think I'm being unfair by comparing it to Stardew, I will ask you to play the game and point out 10 unique things about this game that Stardew didn't do almost the exact same way, first.

I'm 2 years in now and it doesn't really feel like there's a story I'm supposed to be progressing. You've got 3 tasks to 'save the island' which are:

> Mine to level 40 in the 4 different mines that are shamelessly ripped directly from Stardew's mine system. This game added absolutely nothing to Stardew's mining system. They just make you do 40 levels 4 times. In fact I'd argue it's worse because you can only ever find one type of ore in each of the 4 mines. Very rarely there's a weird other kind of rock that gives you a random gem, but they don't appear frequently enough for me to know why/when they appear. Each floor only has a maximum of 5 ore nodes, so 90% of each floor is just rocks. It gets dull fast.

> Clean the ocean by collecting many of [the shiny objects] by shearing thousands of garbage piles. I actually love this part of the game as the ocean is a very interesting place to explore, gather unique materials and all the other stuff that would be a spoiler. I also really liked this part as it's possibly the only unique feature this game has on Stardew Valley beyond festival content. Though I do think the kingdom bit is very unfinished as almost nobody will speak to you, even just to say they're busy. I don't consider the date-able people there to be finished yet either as 9 times out of 10 they will not converse with you.

> Donate crops/insects/fish/animal products as bundles to 'heal' the goddess of the island. I think this part was a step down from Stardew for 2 reasons. 1, it's not optional. Stardew had the temptation of the megacorp as an alternative route to spending a massive amount of time repairing the Community Center. Pufferfish (the capitalist clone) as an entity basically ceased to exist after maybe 3 cutscenes about it and 2 years in it hasn't come up since as anything more than a 'consequence' of not increasing the islands ranking system. I have no reason to believe that there actually is a consequence  for it mechanically or narratively. No 'lose' condition, if you will, Secondly, several bundles feature 1 or more items that are arbitrarily kept from you until a certain level of town-upgrading occurs. I.e. the snowdrop seeds only become available as a reward for a ton of donations to the museum or when the town reaches C level (Begins at E level). Working towards affording a barn to get animal products to later get artisan products is fun. It's an organic goal and the equipment you need to achieve the goal becomes possible as you naturally progress. These seeds, which are not sold in stores before rank C, are the last thing you are going to need to complete the first set of bundles. It took me 2 years to get those seeds and grow them. This was for just 1 set of bundles. It was very frustrating. I'm basically done everything else the game has already except these bundles. I've ranted too long about this aspect though.

Pros:
- Very pretty, I love the tropical island theming
- Several quality of life improvements I wish Stardew Valley had. An example of this is the ability to jump over fences you have on your yard.
- Garden decorations are extensive and lovely. In stardew I felt no real need or desire to decorate my farm plot, but in Coral Island it looks lovely.
- Everything about the diving aspect of the game is great and feels fresh. It does make me wonder how much better the game could have been if it took more of its own creative ideas than Stardew's.
- Expansive town makes it feel like a real place where people actually live.
- Some of the characters grow on you after a while
- Festivals are the best selling point of the game over Stardew imo. They're fun and creative in a way Stardew Valley never achieved. 

Cons:
- The mining system in Stardew wasn't great, but in Coral Island it is straight up bad. Mining is a boring experience, you will never be surprised by anything you encounter on any floor,. This is compounded by reusing a mining system from a game I've already played extensively, so it felt extra dull to be back at the same dang grind, but somehow worse. At least in Stardew the enemies are a threat that means you need to pay attention while mining.
- Too many villagers. There are so many people in this town I barely remember half of their names/faces and they all tend to blur together. Everyone's generally happy and chill with a few exceptions. The social system doesn't really make you feel like you're building a relationship over time, you just stumble into cutscenes randomly. Gift giving is random as far as I can tell. I have no idea what anyone likes or dislikes enough to give better gifts (Another unfortunate rip from Stardew Valley where you're basically buying everyones friendship with many many many daily gifts). I think the cast could easily be cut down and I doubt many people would even notice. I do understand this is meant to be a selling point that you can date one of many people, but I've yet to feel like more than a few characters actually have anything in them behind their creepy huge smiles. (Notable exceptions include: Randy -> that robot arm HAS to have a good story behind it. Raphael -> just his character art alone makes me think he's not the tough guy you'd expect a blacksmith to be and that's something. Pablo -> His smile looks too fake, even among the group. I feel a people pleaser vibe here... Axel -> He's the hot edgy guy I wanted this game to let me date but no, sadly he's undateable :( Leah -> She's rich, she's a b*tch, and yet I want to know more. Pufferfish lady -> I haven't seen her since that introduction cutscene, literally where is she???)
- Fishing is fine, better than Stardew's though because upgrading your rod actually makes it easier for myself who sucks at the mechanic. I feel like I can reasonably catch every fish I've encountered with the gold-rod. I won't even bother until gold-tier though. Definitely better designed than Stardew. I rarely enjoy fishing in games anyways, so feel free to write this one off as pure bias.
- Sea people are a great concept with an unfinished execution. They don't leave their city so you have to go out of your way to ever see and interact with them. I wish you could recruit them to come help you. They really should be helping you somehow. After finishing the ocean cleanup there's really no reason to ever visit the kingdom. Nobody talks to you (but in a way that feels like they will in later updates), shops exist (I'm so excited for the tattoo shop) but there's no way to buy from them (beyond 1 clothing shop). The signs advertise tattoos, rare crops, and an 'inn', but it only sells clothes at this time and the inn is locked. The Oracle is the only sea person who feels like they have a personality at this time beyond 'trusting' or 'distrustful' mostly due to the once again excellent and expressive character art. I want to advance my relationship with the date-able sea people but they literally will not interact with me, even after saving their kingdom. Overall the ocean kingdom is just unfinished.

TLDR: A satisfactory Stardew clone with a handful of improvements and new features. Many characters makes it hard to remember them all. Diving is cool, wish there was more reason to interact with the sea people. A good casual grind game if you don't need a big payoff during/at the end.

I have loved playing it and will continue to enjoy it for a long time to come I'm sure. It's been a long time since I have played a game, especially a farming sim, that just feels so loved by the creators. 

I can understand, overall, people's frustrations. However, my opinion on the game being released as a 1.0 without all its promised content is this: they kinda had to. What I mean by that is I can't explain how many times I came across articles and social media threads accusing the developers of this game to be scamming people, simply because it was taking a long time to come out. I'm not a game developer but I can't imagine how scary it must be to have tons of people accusing you of stealing your Kickstarter money and claiming your game is never actually going to come out. So I personally don't at all blame them for releasing it as it is and just doing updates as they finish them. 

So is the game perfect? No. There are typos and some glitches and a couple of incomplete story lines.
Do I fully believe that the developers are doing their best and the game is going to just keep getting better? Absolutely. 

Tldr; there's a lot of harsh criticism of this game, but if you want to see a game with an environment that has a lot of love, is very cozy, and has wonderful characters then I fully recommend it.

really unfortunate to watch stuff be called ""fully completed"" when it's..... lmao this
i hope they plan on actually continuing to update/patch/fix stuff and don't just abandon, i don't mind playing early access games, but this feels like an EA game flat out lying about being completed to push a bigger price tag, which, i mean, is whatever, the game feels like it could be 30$ on launch, i really don't mind, it's just......... yikes........... uncomfy practices
_______________________________________________""lAuNcH"" edit^

lots of bugs and getting stuck is obnoxious but game is coming along great for EA
just hopefully they'll fix all the ""snappy"" animations in the game, there's lots of fluid motions (like just walking, stopping, and moving again), but then you turn around or change direction in 8 way movement and it just... looks awful, and some NPCs just straight up moonwalk because their animated moving cycle is like... too fast or slow for their actual movement speed? and animals just snap and flip around with no animation
also hopefully more zoom later on, more tilt on zoom would be nice, too, because there's absolutely gorgeous scenery that i feel gets lost on zoom distance and camera angle, but tilt is probably not an option depending on how the actual game is designed unfortunately",1665804486,1707356889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, with Coral Island, I'm absolutely bewildered that people find it lacking. While yes, there are still bugs (typos, getting stuck running in one direction, and sometimes just a complete controller disconnect) I still think this game has so much to offer.

As an avid player of both Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town, Stardew Valley, and a skimmer of all other farming sims- Coral Island just adds to the goodness of these beloved games I think. 
I write this review, not for those potentially seeking to buy it, but for the creators.

I want you to know how much I love the attention to details that have been given so far in interior design, fashion of the characters, the amount of ITEMS that can be made from your farming!!! and the dialogue!!!!! 

The dialogue is my favorite I think heh. From my understanding it's come a far way and for some it's lack luster, but if any of them have played Stardew or Harvest Moon (and no hate to either there) but most end at two lines at most with very surface level lines in my opinion. Or perhaps I lose interest in their conversations faster because they're only a couple of lines where as with these characters I feel it's an actual exchange. And they certainly make me feel things, which is more than I can say for the others. Whoever is writing the dialogue, I think is doing amazing at developing these characters personalities because I can actually tell who I'd want to be friends with and who I'd give major side eyes to (Mark, Bree, and Walter 💀👀)
In fact instead of putting relationship building off like I usually do in these games, I felt pulled to actually go out and meet these characters and learn their backgrounds even if I'm not trying to date them. It's a huge bonus that everyone is so well designed 😂 I'm legitimately torn between three bachelor's rn. 

I love the acknowledgement of Asian cultures both in the food you can make, artisan goods, clothing, and storyline!! Wakuu's cutscenes made me feel seen despite not having super similar issues but that type of struggle is just not seen most of these farming sim games. 
Also the general nods to pop culture is kinda fun too and I super appreciate them ☺️

I love how much there is to explore and it seems there are parts of the game that maybe I have unlocked yet or are in development still, which makes me excited that there may be more hours to come. I'm on year three now, just made it yesterday and the overarching story of pufferfish is progressing, so I'm interested in seeing how that plays out. I've yet to beat Bobby who ALSO boils my blood 😭 (well done writer/character developer(s) once again). 

That being said I've intentionally tried to not complete EVERYTHING as quickly as possible the way I feel I start to do with Harvest Moon and SDV in the past, so that might be helping me enjoy the experience even more, but truth be told. I think it's just how thoughtful the game has been designed so far that makes me want to settle in and really appreciate the details you've all put in it. Instead of becoming a money making hog trying to accumulate mass amounts of wealth 😂 get married, have two children and be done with the game.

Anyhoo, well done so far, I cannot wait to see how this game continues to improve. Thank you for this beauty.

To get into some detail, CI is a direct copy-paste of Stardew Valley. Yes, I know farming simulation games are all ""𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗿"" but that doesn't mean devs can just mimic everything and call it a new title. From crafting to museum donation this game is Stardew with HD graphics. Let me list the direct copy-pasted features that I consider major:

• There’s a museum with the same significance as it was in Stardew where you have to donate certain items.
• There’s an altar with categorised bundles that you’ve got to complete, exactly like in Stardew community center.
• You get your smelter blueprint in a morning cutscene, just like Stardew where Clint drops by your farm in the morning.
• There are of course magical island spirits that only you can communicate like Stardew junimos.
• You can’t read some of the ancient writings in various locations but these spirits help you decipher them.
• You are again fighting against an evil corporation like Stardew’s Joja.
• You can give 2 gifts per week.

CI is not similar to Stardew Valley, it is Stardew Valley. Yes in every farming simulation game you get to grow crops, go fishing and build relationships etc. but these are the raw gameplay mechanics of this genre that devs can improve and expand, not mimic.

Another major downside of CI for me was the characters. They are incredibly shallow with nothing differentiating one from the other, except typical modern diversity parameters. Plus, there are so many residents but you don't feel like you are missing out on content by ignoring them because they are so bland.

I would recommend playing Stardew Valley (or modding if you've finished it) instead because its just not worth it at the moment.

The environment is great, having no mini map is ridiculous, speed of the character even with the 15% speed boost seems gimped, I understand nobody wants to be able to run the map in 2 minutes, but the speed of my character felt like he was just jogging instead of actually sprinting most of the time. It has elements for fans of games such as Harvest Moon & My time at Portia/Sandrock, but it lacks most of the things that had me playing for endless hours. Character's have cool backstories, but at the same time seem dull as you are locked to being able to talk to them a few times every day (From my experience, not sure if that's different for anybody else) Overall, I played this game when it was released for early access, I refunded it then as it felt boring, the game has improved tremendously, but it's at the same time not something I can say will have my attention for much time going forward if this is the state they release 1.0, I've also been reading that they've stopped paying attention to fans feedback, although they were funded by fans to make this game, quite cheeky if true, hopefully not. 

My feedback is not to torch the game, even if it seems it, but at the end of the day reviews should always be reflective of ones experience and 3/4 of this is my own experience and therefore is for people debating buying it, just read more about it and look into actual gameplay before you purchase, if you're a fan of the mentioned games in my review.

Frankly for a game that came out in November 2023, it has a /lot/ of rough edges. Most of those that i'm encountering, luckily, are either cosmetic issues or mechanics that need to be signposted better.

Aside from those things there are a couple things that annoy me:
-The aiming for what square to use a tool on is a little fiddly and makes it easy to hit the wrong spot
-Some heart events feel sequential (as in, take place one right after the other) despite it taking lots of time to get that next couple hearts. Connected events is a great idea, but they could play out better.
-The festival minigames don't feel rewarding/worth the time.
-The halloween festival references costumes and a haunted house that aren't implemented yet. Ultimately this isn't a huge deal but it feels sloppy.
-The skills available to pick when you level up feel like uniformly small steps (i.e., some milestones with bigger benefits would be nice) 

The good stuff?
Set and setting: 
-The island setting in lots of ways feels much more real and grounded than the typical ""small town farm"" 
-The character portraits are gorgeous, as indeed is all the art. 
-The characters are diverse and have depth and personality
-The heart events are humanizing and often surprisingly impactful
Mechanics:
-The time in a day feels generous enough to feel like you got something done each game day
-The collectibles aspect of the game is engaging and happens at a rate that feels satisfying
-Fast travel available early
-Universal inventory access for crafting (i.e., craft from anywhere)
-Different types of implements (e.g., scarecrow and sprinkler) complement each other in a way that feels intentional and helpful
-Most if not all of the ""bits"" you find (foragables, drops, fishing, etc) seem to have either a use or a way to improve their value, so nothing feels like 'vendor trash'

If you do decide to buy (and play on P.C), I would recommend resetting the game every few days of in-game play, and to not skip any dialog that unlocks anything (any time I hold f to skip the thing that should've been unlocked isn't until the game is reset), and there are quite a few dialog mishaps.",1700801782,1707122664,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's more or less Stardew Valley 3D. Everything you expect from a game in this genre is there, and you won't regret it. Main story/late game quests are still a little unfinished, but the game will be updated in 2024 (check their roadmap).

A very addicting and chill game similar to Stardew, Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or Portia. You got your usual crafting, museum collection, fishing & mining. You can plant crops & fruit trees, take care of a variety of animals & befriend/romance a ton of town folks (including LGBTQ+ relationships). There are 4 seasons, each split into 28 days with a buncha festivals and events sprinkled in between. Pretty standard stuff as far as this genre goes. 

However, it's all executed really well & the mechanics are very solid. The only really unique activity is the ocean clean-up. There's an evil corporation that polluted the ocean around the island (Joja vibes) & your job is to dive below the surface to clean it up. You clear out trash & discover the ocean's mysteries. 

After 75 hours, I feel like I engaged with or completed most of the content on offer, besides the grindy stuff like filling out 100% of the museum collection/offerings. If you truly wanted to 100% this game, it'd probably take you 150-200 hours. I fully cleared out [spoiler] the mine, cleaned up the ocean, completed all main quests + all available Merfolk quests, got most of my skills to 10 & went through all seasons & festivals. I'm currently in Fall of the 2nd year [/spoiler]

The only minor negative: At the time of the review, the very late game main story is still a little unfinished, and there's even a quest with ""WIP"" left in the quest log. Kinda sucks for a full release/v 1.0+ game, but at least there's a solid roadmap with rest of the updates coming in 2024. Other than that it's a complete game with a ton of content. If you were craving another life sim or Stardew-like - you're gonna feel right at home! Definitely the kind of game you can play forever, at your own pace & relax. <3",1707078865,1707079760,True,1,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

I still suggest this game for people who enjoy the farming sims, but want a different style than Stardew. While I agree with many other reviews on how the game doesn't feel release ready and that there are many things still missing, it's still fun enough to pay for and play regularly. I've enjoyed getting to play new major updates and continuing the story with everyone. It's nice to see a game go from an idea to one of my favorite games I have every gotten to play.

I love the focus on saving the coral reef!! There's also diversity in what animals you can take care of. Love, love LOVE all the poc representation! ALSO like the pet diversity?!!?! 

Compared to most farming sims I play, here is like a list of things that I care about and noticed ( that were like different )
-pet diversity
every pet is unique and has their own name :3

-different farm animals
just a lil diff from the normal cows, sheep, and chicken

-SEASONAL OUTFITS
i love farming sims with seasonal outfits it just helps it feel more immersive 

-main focus, saving the coral reef
this also plays into using trash! most of your important crafting items comes from using trash, i like the mechanic of using trash because it also helps out the environment

-diff cooking
the way you cook in this game requires you to have different pots n pans which i really like

mining system
-it is still split like a typical mines BUT it plays into like your island spirits and each section is based on an element :D i think its cute and neeto

-MER FOLK
need i say more 

note this is review is not me 100% the game btw....... all my hours comes from the early access... and a few more from the legit launch..... im very slow...

base line for my review is stardew valley. stardew valley is an amazing and solid staple!
compared to the staple, i love all the different things coral island does ^_^

other farming sims that differ from the staple that I liked are
-sun haven
-kynseed

What I find most enjoyable about Coral Island are its people and relationships. The people of Coral Island are diverse - not only in ethnicity or background (which is a striking improvement over Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley), but in their personalities, their families, and their interpersonal relationships across the town. I love Harvest Moon and all its iterations, as well as Stardew Valley, but what Coral Island does that a lot of HM-likes don't is create real, authentically adult romance options. As a person in my thirties, it feels like the romance options are actually my age, and not budding late teenagers or 20somethings. I sincerely appreciate and enjoy that, and it truly makes me want to replay the game and pursue romances with different people.

Farming and ranching are acceptable/adequate. To be fair, in most similar lifestyle sims, they're nothing especially spectacular. It's fine! I don't have any issues with it. I just don't have anything stellar to say.

I also do enjoy that you have three main ""stories"" to pursue in the game. Revitalizing the town, the giants, and the ocean. HOWEVER, at the time of writing, only the revitalization is actually finished. 

That's where we get into the ""not quite finished"" I mentioned at the top. As someone who has been invested in this game since Early Access, I am astronomically disappointed that this game released at 1.0 unfinished. Both of the latter story options are not done. Areas of the map are open, but NPCs and creatures are just there with no way to speak with them. It feels like you're wandering into a part of the map that shouldn't be there yet. I stopped playing this game midway through Early Access so that I could come back to it in 1.0 and play it from start to finish. It is incredibly frustrating to come back and discover that no, actually, it's still not done, and I have yet more waiting to do.

I won't even get into the bugs, especially if you're unfortunate enough to play this on Xbox. We're lucky as PC players to only run into one or two issues here and there.

If my playtime is any indication, I do love this game. I enjoy it. It's fun. But I cannot look past this game coming out unfinished and buggy. It would have been right to push 1.0 out by another year until these pieces were finished, rather than release with so many pieces unfinished and trailing off into nothing.

Initially when I first started, it was honestly amazing. Coming from Stardew Valley, I really appreciate how beautiful the graphics were and how the story developed. Similar to any farming game, we start off with our farm but if I were to compare difficulties, I would say Coral Island is pretty easy. I started playing it on 100% gameplay time and as usual started grinding to unlock certain things like waypoints, map area, etc... Unlike the farming games I played previously, Coral Island was the first game to include a diving aspect. Then again, I only played Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon so I can't compare much with other games if they also have an underwater feature. I was once again amazed with the graphics when unlocking a new area underwater and even got envious for not supporting the game sooner during their kickstarter program. 

However, the moment I hit Fall, things just fall apart. I never faced as much bugs as other players but I did notice things started feeling unfinished. The cutscenes when unlocking new areas were... not there.. trees that I recovered.. nothing.. To be honest I didn't even notice it until I walked pass the tree I recovered and was like, ""Oh.. this is new.."" but it did turn a little underwhelming as a lot of features promised were not in the game.. 

I remember when my friend asked if they should play this and to be honest, if you are not someone who grinds to end game, and take their time, they can change the game speed mode to 50% (which is what I'm doing now to pass time). That allows them to do more in the day and explore during the first 2 month of Year 1. However, if you want to play the game to explore all seasons to it's full potential, then maybe try to hold back until things stabilizes.

I honestly enjoyed my time playing Coral Island and am still addicted to it because of it's graphics but in terms of game content, I think it's pretty lacking once you pass Summer Year 1. The only thing that worries me as I'm close to Year 3 is that if new contents were to come out now, I may actually miss it because I've already pass those moments..

But, despite the fact that the game had it's ""full release"" last November, the game is not finished. It is still in Early Access. They've just dropped the Early Access tag. I don't know why. Especially because it is SO obvious that it's not finished. There are NPCs with missing scenes and some with no scenes whatsoever. Multiple festivals and events are unfinished. A few NPCs use placeholder dialogue/outfits. The game seems to perform worse the longer it's open, has a whole slew of bugs (which usually require a restart to fix), and just generally feels unfinished.

If this game was still an Early Access title, I'd recommend it. If this game was actually finished, I'd recommend it. But if this what Stairway Games considers a complete package? As much as I love this game, I cannot recommend it in it's current state. Too many games have had a ""full launch"" when they are clearly still unfinished.

TL;DR: As absolutely brilliant as this game is, it is not finished. It is absolutely STILL IN EARLY ACCESS.",1706589359,1706589359,False,3,0,0.532258033752441406,0,True,False,False

This game is very well done. The character customization is on par and to me a bit better than stardew. It still does have some bugs in it and there are some moments where it does lag. But there is so much in the game I don't fully hold it against it. The story of starting out is pretty standard. Where you leave the big city to start a new life. The main purpose of the game is to raise the Island grade from an F back to an A. You do that by healing the ocean, donating items to the museum, and give offerings to the Goddess to help her get her power back. You also help bring back some other interesting characters by going into the mines.
-To some this is a negative but it didn't bother me; the mines are not that deep, they only go down 40 levels. But there are 4 different mines, so it breaks it up.-

I will say it does take some figuring out and it's not as straight forward as Stardew Valley is. It took me some time to figure out where to go to get a fishing pole and net. Catching insects are a bit harder than I expected; what I mean by that is the insects have time wheel that appears above them when they detect you and you then have a short amount of time before the run/fly away. Butterflies drive me nuts! The mini game that is for fishing is more fun for me than Stardew valley! It's more fun because I don't have to worry about keeping the fish that keeps moving in a small colored rectangle in order to catch it. This one is much more like reeling it in.

The NPCs are very well designed. Each have their own personalities and little stories attached to them. To me, they do not seem similar to each other. I will say when you are dating an NPC (I have only dated one and married the same one, Pablo) the dialog gets to be a bit repetitive and doesn't really change when they become your bf/gf. I just got married to him before closing the game for the night so I will have to see how the dialog changes.

In game controls becoming unresponsive and/or the game outright crashing resulting in having to replay complete days due to the game only saving at the end of each day.
This is a single player game. I am not sure why the logic to limit game saves in this way. If it is to prevent 'save scumming', the question becomes 'Who cares?' as it is a single player game and whoever does this is only affecting their own gameplay.

Conversations with characters occasionally show variable strings rather than other character names.
Most any game releases with bugs. In time these sort of errors will get fixed if the developers put the time into it to fix them.

Oddly disappearing characters (Turtles in an update), removed conversation opportunities (various creatures) though to be fair when previously attempted it would result in 'You do not understand', and removed features (e.g. shopping from the sturdy computer in the latest Hotfix).
It feels that as much is being removed from the game with each update as is being fixed and what is getting fixed. I guess that if you did not know that they were there in the first place, you would not view that as a problem. So that too is a 'fix'. 

Tutorials are sparse where they exist but usually non-existent.

Even 100+ hours into the game, there are place holder spots in the journal where I am uncertain if I have just been lucky/unlucky and I have not seen things like certain monsters or artisinal goods or they are not in the game presently. I have not searched much on Steam, a Wiki or Reddit for answers to this. Nor have I joined the game's Discord. I have seen references to a Discord, but have not looked for it and have little interest in joining it. If the game is truly in a state where it is fit for 1.0, I should not need any of this to play it.

Interactions with pets and NPCs relatively meaningless as nothing comes of them.

Lengthy cut scenes which are often stacked. An example - I walked into the carpenter's shop to have three cut scenes play one after the other, taking enough time that I forgot why I entered the shop in the first place. This has also happened in the bar as well as Sam's Shop. The only bright side to this is that you can hold down the F key on a keyboard to bypass some of this at the expense of missing some storyline.

Rewards often are nice but pointless by the time they are given. They would have helped complete the task necessary to get the reward. But after the fact, they are meh (Temple offerings) 
or well past the point of where they would be 'nice to have' (most Museum rewards).

Festivals - most of the interactions are button mashing games. The exception are the end of the year quizzes. 

Some of the achievements do not seem to work or are not as described - cooking for example. I know that I have prepared 20+ items, but have not received that achievement.

Levels of randomness - each category of item (fossils, gems, fish, insects) has some items which are rarer than others (fair enough). However getting those items can be problematic. To get something which is only available during a certain season, during certain weather, during a certain time of the day and even then is rare... Remember this is if you know these conditions. Two examples
Gems. Gems are divided into four categories: Earth, Water, Air and Fire. Gems appear to come from nodes which are related to these categories plus a fifth type of node (Mystery). Though the drop rate from the Mystery nodes are much more rare from the specific category nodes due to them covering more things. Whether you find a node is a random chance from hitting rocks. Then what you find from an individual node is again a random chance. To get all gems of a specific type, you have to grind the appropriate mine and get lucky to get enough nodes of the correct type to play the gem lottery. As stated previously, some are less common than others. So you may not wish to be in a particullar mine, but you need to find enough appropriate nodes to try for those gems.
Fossils. These are equally bad as gems but in a slightly different way. The actual fossil nodes seem more plentiful, but are equally random and differentiated in type and the drop rates for specific items are equally rubbish.

This is a game released too early. Given some of the obvious issues with the game, either the QA team is small and/or is ignored. Heaven help them if the programmers are also the QA team. It has the feel off being rushed to 1.0 due to publisher or management decisions. I speculate that this might be due to Microsoft not wanting beta games on X-Box Live. However that is merely speculation on my part. I feel for the developers. They have shown a great deal of love in certain aspects of the game, but so much of it is currently half baked. As a result I would say steer clear of it until the game reaches a true 1.0 or better release.",1706549713,1706549713,False,10,0,0.596765100955963135,0,True,False,False

Honestly however the worst part of this game is the endless grinds and completely awful material drop rates. Unless you somehow find hitting rock after rock after rock after rock for hours and hours and hours and STILL not having a single one of the resource you need to be fun?.. yea... no. The grind in this game is HORRIBLE and the mining and diving aspects are miserable and boring. Having combat in what is supposed to be a cozy game is also yet another factor that ruins this game for me. I don't play cozy games to have to deal with combat there is nothing whatsoever cozy or relaxing about that - nor is there anything cozy or relaxing about grinding for hours and hours and hours on end to yet still not have the items you need drop.

[list]
[*]Great aesthetic. It’s a very pretty game with some beautiful character art.
[*]The setting is awesome and its particular cultural voice makes it unique in the genre. 
[*]I was surprised by how well the character dialog is written, with some genuinely funny and sharp interactions.
[*]Works surprisingly well on a Steam Deck!
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]The game isn’t finished. Full stop. As in; main story quest lines fizzle out at a dead-end. Certain character interactions are impossible right now. Etc. 
[*]It’s buggy. Because of the save system, you can lose an entire day of progress because you had the audacity to gather some grass in the evening. A crash during a cut scene means you won't see the rest of that content.
[*]Because it apes off of other games (like Stardew and AC), it’s weirdly and inexplicably beholden to ideas that don’t make sense in the setting. Why are we chopping down maple, oak, and pine trees on a tropical island? Likewise, why in the world does it snow there? Seeing caterpillars and butterflies roaming around a winter wonderland just kinda takes you out of the world.
[*]The combat system is an absolute chore and feels like another holdover from a different game.

However the game is no longer in early access. So I thought I was buying a complete game. I did not. There is just to many issues. I am going to list a few here:

1. Getting stuck on terrain both underwater and on land. As well as between machines. This by itself would not be a problem for me. However the way the game deals with it is. There is an ""I am stuck"" button. What does the button do? Does it teleport you back to your farm or maybe the town square to unstuck you? No. It ends the day pretending you passed out and gives you a stamina penalty for the next day. This game has teleports. Just let me teleport back to my farm if I am stuck. It's a single player game. Are you afraid of people abusing it? I feel like I am being punished for errors the devs made.

2. Both the town square board as well as the adventurer quest board generate quests literally impossible to complete. I have had it happen that the adventurer board generated a quest to kill a variant of a monster that does not exist and I wasted 2 in game days looking for it. The town board generates quests for produce at the first day of a month with a deadline that is a fraction of the growth time of a plant. Cool. Literally impossible to complete unless you get an extremely rare farm event that instantly grows your plants.

3. A lot of the festival mini games are literally impossible to win during your first year. Nothing to do with skill. You just don't have enough stamina yet to beat some of the villagers. If I lost due to skill issue that is one thing. But just being set up to fail is annoying

4. While on the topic of stamina. You have way to little early on. I usually ran out of stamina by 1 PM during spring. And food restores way to little in my opinion. You unlock the hot springs at some point but they are honestly not worth going to because the regen is to slow. I play on slower game time and this affects the stamina restored by the hotspring. I would have to just sit there and stare at the screen for several minutes to recover all of my stamina. By this point several hours have passed in game. The rate needs to be increased at least 5-fold in my opinion.

5. Fruit trees. Oh boy where do I start. Every other farming Sim I have played does it better. You have to water them every day. And they die when out of season. They are very expensive and produce very little. As far as I can tell most of them last for 2 months. And I am not sure if they are even worth getting if you don't plant them literally the day the first season starts.

6. Context sensitive input would be a god sent. I play this game on steam deck. But the controls are way to fiddly sometimes. Context sensitive input would help with that. What do I mean by context sensitive input? Well if I am holding a watering can. And I click to water. Chances are I do not want to water the spot that is already watered but the not watered spot right next to it. Same with the pickaxe. Chances are I do not want to hit the ground but the rock next to it. I could go into more detail but just look at Sun Haven. They do it well. It would genuinely make the game a lot more fun to play.

7. Build menu. Please just either flip the zoom function and the movement function or reduce the sensitivity of the movement function. It feels like trying to place blueprints on a soaped up sheet of metal. It is very fiddly on controller

There are some other minor inconveniences but these are the big ones. And I am sure the game will be fantastic if they get addressed. But the game left early access. So I am reviewing it in it's current state.

Btw it is not complete content wise either. There are still entire story lines or item functions that are not implemented.

Again. Great potential. And if they finish it and fix the issues it will be fantastic. But as is I would sadly have to say to let it cook a bit longer.",1706166151,1706378504,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Fun day to day play, and a lovely island setting. I enjoy the diving mini game, and enjoyed the slower pace, this is a game that there is no rush to build your farm and tools. 

So why the bad review, after 35 hours of play? 

I got to an October festival in the first IG year, found the Halloween festival costumes not in place, yet NPC dialogue references them? Hit dialogue bugs, weird underwater cave diving bugs and then heard repeatedly from other players that the main story isn't finished. 

Placeholders, TBC, unfinished..... I specifically waited until this was released as a 1.0 version to avoid the early access experience. Wish I'd waited before buying as I feel that the state of the game was not communicated more clearly. 

I enjoy it but don't want to play a half baked game. Avoid the false advertising and save your pennies till this is game is done.

I love the how the NPCs look and act, and the idea of the game sounds amazing, I love the idea of saving the ecosystem of the island and making a cute farm and going diving underwater and  talking to mermaids. but the gameplay in the beginning was so boring that i couldn't really get to anything cool (this could just be my lack of patience and short attention span) It was so similar to a so many other games I've played too, if I wanted to chop trees and clear weeds so I could build a little farm that's to the left of a town with shops and a bar, making money so I can upgrade my house and grow crops and raise livestock while I try to date everyone in town, I would go start a new Stardew save.

I know that's not the most important part of the game but character customization is always my favorite part of any thing and I was disappointed to see I really couldn't even just make a character that looked like me.

If the game really is more than my weird looking character just running around a knockoff pelican town and trying to clear trash from the ocean I genuinely wouldn't know because I can't get through playing it enough to see anything more interesting.

The game was frustrating to play in early access too, because it was often hard to tell whether you were doing something wrong or it simply wasn't coded in the game yet. Instructions and quests were often confusing and in general I found the size and scope of the game a bit too large to be immersed. Maybe it would have been easier if some characters got introduced over time but having to find and meet all of those villagers and get utterly lost at first was pretty overwhelming. You also get front loaded with a ton of quests of people you barely just met and I wish they were more staggered. 
Having to go through all of that in Early Access to then lose that save file and not be able to play it with the update just hasn't motivated me to go back to the game and redo a lot of the work I had already done. 
I also agree with other reviewers that the dialogue is very weak. i didn't find myself gravitating towards any dateables because the parts of the story and dialogue that I encountered was very surface level and I really wasn't interested in learning more. 
Hard agree on comments about how the ocean just getting dirty again after you clean it is sad - I think it's because of how we view trash different than things like wood/rock/etc. 
I also found the sizing of items very confusing in the game for machines or even while carrying various objects and that also broke my immersion. 
However, the graphics and art in general is absolutely fantastic and I did like some earlier parts of the game. Some of the dialogue in the first museum scene was good and I like some of Mark's cut scenes as well. I think there's absolutely potential.

My initial review was very favourable as this is a very fun and engaging game with a lot going for it. But in November 2023 this game was released to the public in a very unfinished state.  Despite being a very beautiful game it was buggy and very unfinished. The game also still crashes very often on both the PC platform and the console version. BE WARNED! There is NO IN GAME SAVE OPTION for this game.  The game only auto saves once a day. If you crash, you will lose all your progress and this can result in you having to repeat 20 or 40 minute sections of the game over and over again.  This can become VERY frustrating.  Users have been requesting a SAVE feature from the DEVS for months now, but so far, this has fallen on deaf ears.

There are also many other bug fixes and QoL improvements that have been requested from the Devs, but so far all have been ignored. They do have a Discord channel where you can request these features, but after posting on there frequently over the last few months I have come to realise that this is just window dressing.

There are better alternatives (like My Time at Sandrock) that are far more polished and finished and have far more content. I'm not bashing this small indie development team, they have a great product here and I really do love Coral Island, but they were wrong to release this game in its current state.  It's nowhere near finished or ready for general release.

And now at the end of January 2024 and after another massive ""hotfix"" I'm realizing that there are actually far more features being broken or removed from this game, than what there are actually being improved or fixed.

I know, I completed the game and have 100+ hours, but thats only because I at least can get by on the generic farm sim formula. I believe this also gives my review a bit more credibility. The core story of the game is to heal the ocean and figure out the town history with a certain company. You can heal the ocean, and you can see certain flashbacks that help try to explain the town history and said companies involvement with things. HOWEVER, you go through all of that just for the game to stop progressing - mind you this game is OUT OF early access. It's riddled with grammar issues and typos, very easy for you to get onto things that you then get stuck on with no way off. Your only choice at that point? It's to either exit the game and lose progress or use the built in ""I'm stuck"" option which, also penalizes you buy making you lose money/items and the entire day. The dev literally penalizes you for the bugs they cause. Theres also a chunk of story dedicated to freeing the giants that are responsible for magically influencing the land. After you free four of them, the last and final one is spoken about once and thats that. That story is also left unfinished. Wanna use bombs in the mine? Don't use too many or the game will crash and you will lose progress. The way you use tools to interact with the environment is janky (both combat and farming) but it still will cost you energy. Enemies can hit you even after dying -they follow through with an attack animation and IT STILL hurts you even if their health is zero BEFORE committing to the animation. Collecting ranching items from inside coops/barns is a nightmare if you have animals in there and are doing it by hand. They will hover on it and will not move. They  do the same at the feed station when trying to place hay. The game isn't very balanced either. By the time I could afford a horse, I could teleport everywhere I needed - leaving the horse useless. Sprinting isn't really sprinting in this game - you'll find yourself abusing the dodge mechanic to get around as fast as possible. Cutscenes would get stuck upon start and you have to skip them and therefore miss out on them. The last one I remember is when expanding the museum.

I could go on and on, but this game just should not be out of early access - and it definitely is not worth the price.",1706215605,1706215605,False,3,0,0.540709793567657471,0,True,False,False

Enjoy the graphics/animations, love the little details and touches you notice while playing the game, festivals are enjoyable (though after you experience each once it doesn't change from then on), NPCs are fairly interesting and unique (though after awhile they just repeat the same dialogue) and I see how there is so much potential for developer to do more with the game and make it into a GREAT farm game.

Minor annoyances will be discovered here and there while playing the game in the form of small bugs and minor spelling/ grammer mistakes, but in the big picture doesn't detract too much from overall enjoyment of the game. As some have rightfully pointed out, the game content isn't exactly complete, and after 1st year and a half, most of the enjoyment will just come simply from building your farm to how you like it to look rather than completing tasks or interacting with NPCs. Combat is kinda pointless and could be improved to be more challenging (rather than annoying) with better rewards. If constantly improving your farm's design isn't a thing you look forward to, beware you will get bored after a certain point till new game content is added, which hopefully won't be too far away.

Pros: 
- VERY inclusive cast of romance-able characters. Black/white/asian/mixed, including interesting characters like a single mom, a guy with a prosthetic arm etc... you name it, they have it. The game even has mermaids are also available for choosing 
- Beautiful graphics. You can't help but pause to admire everything inside the game. 
- You can customise how long each in-game day lasts!!! 
- Devs are very transparent and responsive to criticism and feedback in the official discord channel. They frequently update their progress with bug fixes and have a clear outline about the overall roadmap and plans for the game 
- Not p2w. You pay once for the game and you farm/grind the rest yourself within the game. None of the microtransaction bs that you see in many games nowadays 
- Fishing system that makes sense 
- Clear message about conservation / environmentalism without being overbearing 
- Overall, happy and friendly atmosphere on the island. NPCs are fun to talk to and there are some genuinely funny cutscenes. 

Cons: 
- Game-breaking bugs and crashes that makes the game just unplayable. This is what brings down the entire game, unfortunately. I'm talking about non-stop game crashes that forces you to restart the game Day, over and over again. 
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️The worst part is that there is a chance that your ENTIRE save file will mysteriously be deleted or disappear. Say bye bye to hundreds of hours of gameplay!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
- Storyline is still incomplete despite being a v1.0 release. This game should still be in EA and should not have been released that early.

the downside of this game for me is, less voice acting coz i love to hear villager to speak to me more often, and theres many bug even after 1.0 i still found one or two bug but its not game breaking i can always restart game and its fix it.

Sidenote:
A lot of reviews like to disparage this kind of comparison, but from the kinds of crops available, to having a hot bath open later on etc. events from stardew, it feels rather infuriating that the game dev made modifications in these areas to avoid copyright and IP infringement (how difficult would it have been to research and include appropriately different crop types instead of a copy paste from Stardew?). Fun to play but from a game design point of view, this behaviour should be discouraged

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Edited Note - 1/23/2024]
Full 1.0 version out and everything I stated below has come to pass, struggling to fix old bugs and constant request for video/images for even the smallest bug. The devs are squeezing as much free testing as possible from the poor customer who have to pay for it with their time and effort EVEN after they paid for the game with their money (its a premium priced game as well). Till date buggy as hell, you cant use many of the provided features like auto chests since it screws up inventory and need to reload ENTIRE game with their updates. 
If your looking to buy, try other farming simulators, 3d or not. Their less buggier and dont need deleting entire playthrough's.

I've stopped playing the game now.. dont really trust the game to be stable enough for the next year or two

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actual Review:
1. Underwater exploration: A lot of potential here and everyone loves the mysterious oceans so scavenging and hunting here is quite fun if limited in content for now. This is the one and foremost extension in coral island from Stardew valley 

2. Cave Combat mechanics: Still a lot of work in progress. Content is limited, monsters combat is wonky and seem static in movement (very little animation to the 3d bodies of enemies). It is EA so keeping that in mind

3. Game Development progression:
I want to fully express my scepticism to the direction the devs are taking here. A big game progression tree over several months (which would extend several years looking at the way things are going) with the devs constantly pushing cosmetic updates instead of content. Everything is incomplete and a lot of future additions would make life easier from the start of the game. 

This just means you need to restart your gameplay everytime they provide content or avoid the game altogether for many years just to get the proper experience. It gets boring real fast.
There is always a chance to abandon the game or end the game updates with an incomplete full release, or a full content game with no funds for bug fixing resulting in a poor end user experience.

4. General Gameplay/Design:
Other than combat, if you liked Stardew valley, you would like this game since the character designs are very well done in 3d. Not for folks who dislike disney like character designs. 
The game does suffer from the need to grind resources and sometimes purchase stuff from the shops for upgrades. Can be easily resolved in future updates


Verdict:
3/5
WAIT for the full release to get the game since the way the game content progression is going, I feel like we are going to be disappointed. Too big a risk for this big a price this early on in EA. 
By the time it has content worth the price, I do not know if I would still have an interest in it or be swayed away by other game titles that provide the higher entertainment versus price.",1676810312,1706000390,False,43,3,0.515243947505950928,0,True,False,True

The game was pushed to full release too early. Main story quests are unfinished. There are still tons of typos and bugs. I am disappointed in Stairway. Will update this review when the game is actually polished and complete.

Early Access Review:

This is the game I've been waiting for.

Mechanically, it borrows liberally from Stardew. Farming, mining, and upgrades are extremely similar. But it also has a brand new diving mechanic. And, most importantly, all the romance-able characters are SUPER attractive.

The town is beautiful, but quite large, which is tedious at first. But you unlock a travel network in the first season, and that helps a ton.",1666022359,1705965554,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

HOWEVER, I have to reiterate what others have said about it being unfinished. I like having a quest-storyline to follow, or at least a general direction/goal. But I actually had to google whether I was missing a quest trigger or had to wait for a certain in-game day etc (I hadn't) because the questlines just run out before they've reached their intended conclusions. Don't get me wrong, there's still a considerable amount of content, but it winds up a bit lacklustre and unsatisfying after so much effort and involvement - and annoying that it's not even made clear when you've come to the end of the current story content. Because the content that is there is great! 

My only other tiny irritation is they really need a proofreader! Because oh my god if terrible grammar annoys you avoid this game like the plague! I hoped being asked to ""give papaya's to Emma"" was a one-off but it was the first of many XD

I really do think this game is great, and I'll definitely be coming back to it when the content is more fleshed-out.

To me, this is what seemed to be giving the game its own unique spin, something that wasn't just a new version of stuff other games have already done, and....it's not finished. I mean it's there....but that's kinda it. The ocean caves are just resource girding zones that are clearly placeholders for something coming later. You can't go into any of the buildings in the kingdom. You can't talk to most of the Merfolk, the ones you can you can't even give gifts to which means you can't date them.

I think what makes it more of an issue is that the things that are missing are pointed at by the game. NPCs that you may be able to interact with exist, you just can't interact with them. You can go to places but those places are empty. You can get items that do nothing. You ""unlock"" things that are not in the game.

Edit: Additionally the main storyline is not complete (It simply says WIP at one point) and the steam page has lies about content that is not in the game as of yet.

Don't get me wrong. The game is very good. Coral Island is obviously heavily inspired from Stardew Valley and it doesn't deviate much from what made that game great. Where it really surpasses SV is the graphics. The world and characters are so beautiful. I think I would love this game even more than SV... if it were finished. 

I don't buy games in Early Access, but this game caught my eye and had been sitting on my wait list for awhile. When it did fully release, I had been really enjoying it. Despite that, there are some areas that are obviously not finished. A good example is Pets. All the animals on the island have their own behaviors, routes and personalities, just like the npcs. When you adopt them, however, they will sit in their animal bed and do absolutely nothing. No unique dialog. No pathing (except moving maybe 10 feet). No nothing. They are essentially now a piece of furniture. 

It gets worse when you start diving and especially when you get to the Sea Kingdom. Diving animations are awful. Underwater Caves have doors that just appear and disappear without any animation. On the front of the steam page, it says you can befriend and romance three of the merfolk, which is a blatant lie. This is not yet in the game, but since you won't encounter them for a number of hours (only 28% of players have progressed this far), buyers will not know the game is not complete until it is no longer refundable and many have given premature positive reviews. 

The team says they are working on this, and I believe them. The game will probably be complete in a few patches. However, I cannot recommend a game that pretended to be out of early access in order to collect an early paycheck.",1705782135,1705822209,False,4,0,0.53694838285446167,0,True,False,False

     I have played this game for over 1.325 hours and still counting. I first played in Early Access, then continued, by keeping my money and started a new second game, where I married Raj. I was trying to wait until more updates arrived, but I just wanted to get married. I enjoy all the colors of Coral Island, the scenery, the characters, the attention to details, the crops and flowers are so pretty, and the music. I just go to the furniture store sometimes, just to listen to the music. I don't know the name of the song, not yet, but I really like it. Of course, you can farm (raise Peafowls, Llamas, Pigs that leave you truffles, and Luwaks that leave Gesha Coffee Beans) , ranch, mine (for Gems), fish, enjoy festivals and Town Events, change your wardrobe, upgrade and decorate your farm house and buildings, forge, craft, and go diving (for Treasure).
     Now, with this latest version, there are so many romanceable characters. It's really hard to just pick one. You can date, romance and get married. Having children, I think will be another update). There is one thing all the other games do not have and that is the Merfolk kingdom. The Merfolk Kingdom, where you can date mermen and/or merwomen and even marry, what more do you need.
      There is still so much more story that needs to be told and discovered.  I would say, just don't get disappointed while waiting for the updates, etc. I believe the wait will be worth it.

I will start by saying that I do recommend this game to anyone looking for a farming sim. While I appreciate that Stardew is now the most comprehensive farming sim out there, I just don't like the retro graphics style. And the last main-line Story of Seasons was absolutely underwhelming... so, Coral Island is the best I've seen for me at the moment.

Pros: 
- Haven't encountered any system or mechanic that is flat out annoying.
- Short loading times between areas. 
- The game pays a lot of attention to quality of life and making sure gameplay feels smooth.
- Good balance between things to do in a day.
- Fun festivals, with lots of attention to making them seem like actual special events.
- Nice range of crops, animals, decorations, with potential to keep growing cos.. why not. 
- Potential to make this game even bigger and grander if future patches have more content and characters and areas to explore. 
- Nice real world references on the TV, events, characters, etc.. The developers have fun with their game :) Please keep adding more!
- O.G. Farmer Hat is probably the best item in the game. Thanks. 

Cons/criticism (constructive):
- Horse mount feels a little clunky, from riding to dismounting. Would also be cool to see other options like a bike, etc. 
- Cave fighting seems a little underdeveloped. I don't expect a full fighting game, but it's weird that there are so many weapon types when the actual fighting is so plain. I just feel like it needs a bit of work. 
- Would be cool to see fighting implemented while diving too (and any other future biome/environment).
- I sort of agree with other comments saying that the game shouldn't be called a full release if it clearly isn't finished yet. It's not the same to leave things unfinished and patch them in later, than to tease a future expac. 
- Quests could be developed a little more.. maybe making them so they're not only 1-step quests. 

Other:
- After 1 year of in-game playtime, I have no idea how to buy or make batteries or gather hardwood (other than the skill-up point which is like 5% chance? or something..)... and I refuse to look it up online. Hopefully they'll show up as I keep playing...

To the Dev Team:
I hope Stairway Games keeps developing the game with sincere enthusiasm! it's got so much potential to last and not be a play-once-and-ditch game. Keep your head high when haters say you copied from SV. You haven't copied nearly as much as SV copied from Harvest Moon, and in any case, I don't see any problem at all from taking what works from other games. This is how games get good. But I will say this: try to figure out what makes SV players keep playing SV for so long.. THAT's the main feature you want to learn (and probably copy) from SV. 

Ok, thanks to anyone who read this whole thing. In the meantime, I'll keep playing the game, and I hope you do too :)",1705784389,1705784389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here are a few examples. The first two points might be a design choice but I don't understand why you go into full release when these ""teething troubles"" still exist.
- Inventory controls have not been thought through yet. you click on an item and it goes directly into the open chest. you click on an item in the chest and you're able to place it where you want in your inventory. But you cannot swap it with an item already in your inventory. you have to put it on an empty slot. Also you cannot split stacks. If you want to grab half of the trash from your 999 trash stack, you have to press a button 500 times or pres and hold it for a minute or two.

- hitting an enemy three consecutive times makes you stagger them which means they get pushed a few meters away from you and stops them from attacking for a moment. Weirdly, the pushing back also lets them glitch through obstacles which you then have to circumvent to use the staggering to attack them

- flickering textures on the edge of your screen as well as flickering shadows in general

- filling a machine with resources does not work with click and hold. you always have to click 20 times to fill up the recycling machine for example.

I love this game and I'm not sure why people are complaining about the full release being unfinished because I've played for ~50 hours and still have a lot more to explore. My only issues are the repetitive dialogues, which only occur when you talk to the same person every day to increase their hearts, and how their dialogue doesn't change after you begin dating them. 

Long version:

Not sure why people are upset about this game's full release. Although I just started playing it about 20 days ago, and I don't know it's history, I feel like this game has a lot of content and I love the art style. I've got around 50 hours played right now, and I'm not even through the first year yet. Mainly because I changed the setting for how fast each day goes by to the lowest it can go at 50%, which is my favorite feature. Obviously I haven't made it to the end-game which people seem to be upset about, but I reckon it'd take me another 50 hours to get there at the pace I'm going. The only downside is dialogue gets repeated often when you're talking to the same person every day, but people you don't talk to much always have interesting things to say. I also wish people would act differently once you start dating them with new dialogue instead of things they said to you as a friend or even acquaintance. Even if the game is unfinished as people keep complaining about, I'm hopeful that the developers have more to come. Not to mention I want to restart once I've done everything possible so that I can pursue a new spouse and see how well I can do with more knowledge in the first year compared to the first play-through.",1705639055,1705703757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
+ Better Graphics than Stardew Valley
+ Larger roster and more accessible barn/coop animals
++ Early game access to teleportation
+ Lots of Collectibles
+ Great Art for characters
++ Fun Festivals with mini-games for each one
+ Large roster of characters and equally large roster of romanceable ones too
+ lots of pet variety
+ Costume/Clothe Variety

CONS:
- Less variety in decorations
- Currently, there is no way for barn/coop animals to breed
- keeping track with the game's stardew valley community center equivalent is troublesome
-- Currently, Barn & Coop can only be upgraded 1 time to have a total of 8 spaces
- collecting Hardwood is very difficult in the early/mid game and it is possible to soft-lock yourself if you don't prioritize upgrading the axe. 
- skill upgrades are bland and uninteresting except for a select few.
- Combat is more boring than Stardew's and enemy variety is just a fancy palette swap (you can clear all the mines using the sword you receive at the early game)
- Too many collectibles
-- lots of missing content/unfinished story
- there is only one farm map
-- Planting crops/petting animals feels awkward and slow (you need to individually click to plant and pet, no holding the mouse button)
-- lots of bugs (not the collectible kind)

as of now, I cannot recommend this game as is.
there are too many issues and missing content that really ruins the game and bugs that are still being fixed.

I recommend keeping this game at your wishlist though as the above issues may be fixed in future updates.

As a farming sim, it's great. The mechanics are similar to Stardew but I like the fishing in Coral Island so much better lol. The range of seeds you can get is great, there are many different animals you can raise, and your farm is huge.
There's a Find NPC button that is extremely helpful and I love it.

It does get a bit boring at year two since there is no story to progress, no major quests, and nothing to really work towards.
The tutorials could use some work, and the machine descriptions need to be better. How am I supposed to know that putting sugarcane in a cheese press makes syrup?
The button to quickly move items from inventory to chest doesn't work at all, the shop at the mermaid city is bugged (for each clothing item there are different colors but those color options don't work), and I'm not sure if it's on purpose, but the Ocean Rank won't move once I hit A Rank.

Social concerns ; It also presents and tackles several social concerns - broken families, wanting to be ""adult"" in an Eastern/Latin family, recycling, election, twins with different personalities, family dynamics, pet adoption, and so much more. 

Challenging : You have to be wise in earning money.  On the other games I have played, I'd be able to have a steady medium income by summer of the first year. In this game... well... let's just say that even at spring of year 2, I'm broke. You won't really be raking in money since you can't fully focus on farming.  The story is very interesting and hooking. You really have to divide your time wisely. Balance your time and stamina.

Graphics: Although chibi versions are cute, this one is like anime/Disney. Very colorful.

There is a lot to explore whether on the area or social concerns or even personal development.  Come get hooked with us guys.  And no, I am NOT PAID to write this review. Don't be discouraged by the price - it's WORTH it.

P.S. Developers, please, can we have a ""horse"" underwater?",1705478868,1705478944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Without getting into too many spoilers, I will say that there are three main quest-lines and in the state that the game is in now, it's impossible to fully complete any of them.

Some nit-picky things: There's an abundance of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in both dialogue and the user interface. The way to craft the ropes to go down a level in the mines makes absolutely no sense. The combat is awful and the rewards that you find in the chests in the mines are a joke.

To put it simply the game is unfinished. Main story lines are clearly incomplete, areas of the game are labeled as ""WIP"", and marriage and dating dialogue is barely there.

If you think you will play past the first year, care about romancing villagers, or enjoy having children in farming sims please wait to buy this game you will be disappointed. If you are mostly here to decorate go ahead!

However, I did enjoy the game, but it feels like I've been lied to. Is the game that is out of early access should be at least ready in every part of the game and later added? Right now, the under water world seems like a lifeless world. You 90% cannot interact with those NPCs and cannot do any relationship with them yet (full game?) I've tried to talk to them and they respond that those NPCs have nothing more to say to day (it cannot say any shit right now, so please edit it out and not let us speak to them yet.)

edit as of November 29th: still a great concept and I'm loving the gameplay still, but buggy right now. This was not ready for a 1.0 release so treat it like it's not fully released and expect bugs. Don't get too attached to your first save and consider it something to explore more than anything. 

minor thing to remember: this game is in full release even though it's not necessarily ready for it. Expect some glitches throughout gameplay and weirdness as things work out. I don't blame the game devs for this when the publishers pushed for a release before the game was ready. It's still worth playing the game, though! 

It's really fun and cute. There's a bit of a slow start and the energy at the beginning can be meh but if you're familiar with the genre then you know that's part of the game so it didn't bother me. Graphics are nice and character creator has nice options with lots of cute hair options and a body slider option which was a huge plus for me. All the artwork for the characters is really cute though the dialogue is a little limited currently--I keep seeing the same few lines from people, but there's so many characters that it's only noticeable for the ones you hunt down so far. I imagine this will change as the game progresses, too. 

I'm only in spring year 1 so I can't speak for later gameplay yet, but I've found everything so far fun to do and creative. There's lot of little things you can work on so I haven't had a single bored day. There's also an option to lower game speed time which makes the days feel longer! Right now, I don't have the energy to make it super useful yet, but it will be down the road.

The big problem is that there's too much to do. This game's design suffers under the weight of all the content that they delivered on from their kickstarter.

the writing is better than games like my time at xxx, and stardew valley, however the soundtrack is subpar where i think stardew take the top there. Like for instance this dramatic cutscene between selfobsorved Paul and his wife that is made he missed her anniversary and doesnt pay attention to her anymore. anyways you have to fix it buy giving pual 1 green tea.

if the developers were allowed to record some male and female grunts and mumbles that would be nice. like for instance hydroneer's voice acting however minimal was very nice.

WHO doesnt love a good sob story? LETS CLEAN UP THE OCEAN hahah that got me hooked but i still dont know how merpeople make merbabies. 

the art direction for farming and crafting and such was VERY cute, however at times it didnt feel cohesive. 

plot and character arcs definitely could use some DLC in terms of the giants who im not sure they took the giants character arcs seriously. ther merpeople who were very interesting but it i hope it continues to be dramatic. i will update this review at the end of year 2 where hopefully i can complete the game.

I bought the game in early access and had a blast. Loved the art, the location, the characters. I was ready to give this game 5 stars on release. Key thing to note here is that I heavily focused my gameplay on repairing the ocean, finishing the mines, and talking to all npcs. For this reason, the full release felt like a cut back version of early access to me. While some aspects are expanded, like the mines, events and some previously locked areas, the parts that I most enjoyed were cut back or left the same, and the number of bugs exponentially increased. 

You can no longer interact with the merfolk or sea creatures aside from the main storyline. Character dialogue for our land-walking friends has felt pretty much identical. My game crashed several times after full release when it never did so in EA, and bugs like my pet saying other npcs dialogue have been happening with increasing frequency. Don't get me wrong, the added content is fun, but to me it feels like more tasks and mini games while I wanted more story. 

All that to say, I feel like if the developers had waited a little longer before 1.0 I would've really loved coral island. I'm not saying avoid the game, but maybe let it cook for another few months before paying full price. I hope I can come back and say I love this game again, but in the meantime, I'll be turning to other games in my library.",1705133898,1705134406,False,7,0,0.562628805637359619,0,True,False,False

I don't think (as some comments do) that your kids growing up is a measure of completeness in a farming sim. For one, that's often not a feature in many other farming sims of this ilk - Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons kids only grow up in one or two games of that series, I don't think Stardew Valley kids grow up, etc. If Coral Island kids never grow up, then that's a design decision the devs make that is actually pretty standard for the genre, and I'd have no problem with that. (If they decide to give us more, great! But that's just gravy, not the meal.)

It's the merfolk where I have to take issue. Don't get me wrong, the actual story aspects of the merfolk area seem to be done - you can do the whole plot down there, it's all functional. But you can't interact with any of the merfolk meaningfully - you can't give them gifts, their hearts are locked so you can't earn affection, and either most of them have no dialogue or they're suffering from a known bug that occasionally afflicts the main townies too(""[Character] has nothing more to say today""). Either way, you can barely converse with them. (Also, this is my personal nitpick, but I'm not pleased there is a very eligible bachelor in Agung and he's not romanceable. If we only got one male and one female merfolk romance option, I could understand that, but two female options and one male option feels like people who want the masc romance options are being cheated a bit for no reason. Especially when Agung was used to advertise the merfolk, alongside a female character who IS a romance option - it feels like we were built up for potential merfolk romance with a character who was never actually meant to be on the table.) Compared to the above-ground stuff, the sea feels pretty empty.

None of this would be an issue with an early access game, and frankly I trust the devs to put out the rest of the merfolk content in due time so I'm not too worried about it. I just find it blatantly incorrect to advertise a game experience as complete when you knowingly have incomplete aspects in the game. I would either have held off the 1.0 release until the merfolk were also finished, or I would have kept the merfolk area locked off until it WAS finished so that everything in the game was actually complete. I feel like the dev team went with a compromise that unintentionally makes a false promise of a complete experience while there are still incomplete aspects.

I love this game, and I think everyone should play it. I think the only real issue here is the advertising of it, not the content that's currently in the game or what hasn't been completed yet. The devs have been working hard and releasing updates regularly; I have faith the game will be in a state that can GENUINELY be called complete in a reasonable amount of time. I just wish it hadn't been labeled that way earlier than it should have been, because it's forced people to have to add asterisks to what could otherwise be whole-hearted recommendations.

(Note: as should not be surprising when major content is still being worked on, the game has a number of bugs that need crushing. Again, I have faith in the devs that these will be dealt with, but part of the reason these are shocking to see in a game labeled 'complete' is that normally a complete game would have full attention being given to bugs, while again, Coral Island still has major updates being worked on so bug-catching is not yet the main focus. I personally haven't run into any really bad ones; others have. If this concerns you, you may want to hold off a few more patches to get it, or at least back up your saves occasionally. But I've got nearly 130 hours in this game, both before and after 1.0 release, and I haven't run into any major bugs, so it's very possible to play without problems even in the current state. Just be aware that it's not as guaranteed as it would be in any other game marked 'complete' just yet, and make your decision accordingly.)

ETA: After checking more into the game's content, I think I may have misconstrued the complaint about kids growing up. I thought this meant kids growing into adults, which only a few farming sim games (most notably Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life) do, but looking at Coral Island, I think the complaints may have been about having babies that just...never leave the baby stage. That is definitely NOT standard and genuinely a little disappointing; seeing the unique sprites for your children with specific spouses is one of the only real draws to having kids in these games, since child-centric content in farming sims tends to be pretty sparse. So I would agree with the complaints after all, in that I would at least like your kid to grow up enough to have a distinct appearance/personality. (Maybe even enough to go to school with the other kids? That'd be kind of a time paradox, but let's be real, I don't think any of us as players are going to care about that. Plot holes < better in-game content.)",1704699146,1705129732,True,54,1,0.843358099460601807,1,True,False,False

I enjoy farming, exploring sort of games that are mellow and you can play at your own pace, and this one ticks those boxes. I've only been playing for a few days, but play as often as I can.

The graphics are good. The game has run smoothly for me.

The energy is a issue for me, easiest way to make money at the beginning is plant crops, so I planted a 100 crops, by the time I've watered them over half my energy is gone, the energy doesn't go down one at a time, it seems to have its own pattern, don't get me wrong I've played a lot of games that involve energy, but I feel losing over 300 energy watering 100 plants is an extreme amount.

*EDIT* I've been playing for another 30 odd hours now, an i'm still enjoying the game. Another thing that i think would add to the game is the relationships with the other islanders. When you speak to them sometimes they make a statement or ask a question, but instead of giving you an option to reply it sort of just ignores the question and moves on, and the dialect is the same responses in order ( i've restarted the game a few times due to me finding out new things and wanting to do things differently) it would be great if you could mix the conversations up and actually answer them with your own response.

If you like Stardew Valley, this game is basically that but with 3D graphics. I might even be understating how much this game is like Stardew Valley wearing a mask, but that's not really a problem for me as the setting is beautiful and unique. No, my issue is that the game is unfinished and had no business being launched into 1.0 in this state. Usually, when something is launched as Version 1.0, you expect a complete experience... but there's scraps and threads of unfinished content all over the place. Multiple times now I've went and looked up something that didn't make sense only to see the best explanation be ""the developers haven't finished that yet."" Which like, fair, but why release into 1.0 then? Why have all this dangling plot threads that don't go anywhere still in your game? All it does is make me excited for something that doesn't even exist yet, but maybe that's my fault for expecting things to be fully implemented in a fully released product. 

Aside from the unfinished content, there are so many bugs. Character portraits are bugged on the in-game map and sometimes just show empty squares. The game gets really laggy around certain times a day (like 6PM) as a bunch of stuff is triggered simultaneously. It sometimes freezes for so long I think it's going to hard crash. Filling machines causes the game to hitch. My characters head was completely broken during the only unique romantic cutscene you get with your romantic interest. The game still needs some polish, and hopefully it gets it eventually.

If the content currently in-game is finished and the bugs are ironed out, then I'll change my review. Until then... yeah.

EDIT 1/12/23: They released a hot fix with so many bug fixes and it somehow barely moved the needle on the amount of issues this game has. Turns out I've been really lucky because other people have lost progress, saves, and tools due to bugs (and if you don't have tools, you can't get them back, making the game unplayable). I also reported a bug and the developer told me to my face ""this is intended"" so my hope for this game getting better is starting to wane. I'll keep my eye on it, but all of this has really soured what was a game that made a great first impression. It needed at least another 6 months of polish before being officially ""released"".

Also, I have another issues with the NPCs. NPCs can run out of stuff to say and just stop talking to you. They don't even recycle old lines. Every romantic interest uses the same lines when you ask them to be your partner, and this affects nothing in-game outside of unlocking a special additional cutscene, if it even plays at all cause almost all of them are bugged in some way. My partner in-game has not once acknowledged that we're dating outside of the one date we had (which was also bugged, mind you). I love these characters, but there's just so little to them I don't actually enjoy being friends or even dating them. Stardew Valley is just pixel graphics and text on screen and even those characters seem more alive than this.",1704840320,1705045617,False,7,0,0.599130094051361084,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy this game for its farming, ranching, and artisan producing mechanics. You can get earnings easily. But, the downside is that there is nothing more goods to be spent on. It's become boring when you've became rich, because you will find nothing expensive.

At this state of the game, I have no will to play it even further, because I have a lot of money, and have completed anything necessary. Maybe I would play it again, if the major update is released.

I still have not been pursuing love in this game, because it's really buggy. Some heart event of certain NPCs won't trigger, even you have completed the previous event. The one thing I'm still disappointed in loving mechanic is that the dialogue of the NPCs is too bland. There is no different dialogue when you reach certain hearts on someone. Having boyfriend/girlfriend makes no difference, you will get the same dialogue as if you were still stranger. There is no progress difference in relationship, like being friend, then being boyfriend or girlfriend. I've completed 10-heart event with certain NPC, but the day after that, the dialogue makes me just a townsfolk again, not a lover.

The main storyline is still unfinished, although you've completed everything in this game. I agree with everyone else complaining this game was released, but the main story have not been finished. Some story could be completed early, then it's become boring again.

There is so much potential to this game and it could become the most anticipated farming game.
BUT. There is long way to go there, and I think devs patched it kinda slowly.

Recommend this game for:
1. Farming, ranching, and various artisan production mechanics
2. Good and hot NPC models

Not recommend this game for:
1. Unfinished story line
2. Boring relationship progress
3. A lot of bugs

I'm totally the audience for this sort of plot and game-play and have sunk lots of hours into it. But I also found myself wanting so much more out of character related decisions and dialogue. 

TLDR: It definitely itches the cozy game scratch, but I have more reservations than I'm comfortable with. If you are more interested in the farm, collecting, and cozy side of things (or are already the audience for this genre), pick this up. If you are more interested in character building, RP, and getting to know a unique cast of characters, I would say... Skip this one.

Nitty gritty bits:
Pros
- So. Much. Content. Massive list of characters. Land and sea map. Long list of produce and products. Plenty of farm animals, critters to catch, and other NPC animals.
- Laid back play where you can go as fast or slow as you want. No stress here!
- With plenty to do you can avoid that nasty ""race to the next day"" feeling.
- The character illustrations! Animal, spirit, or human they are full of personality and really elevate the experience.
- Quests are well balanced and, since there's also so many, you have tons of opportunities to feel successful.
- Unique decor and lots of visual choices for characters.

Cons
- If you're into RP, this is not a game to do that. Many of your reply options when interacting with characters are fluffy and sweet and not varied. They all kind of go the same direction (that is to vying for a positive outcome for the relationship). Even the ""funny"" replies are lacking some bite.
- To that end its very,  v e r y  wholesome. You won't come up against hard decisions (or really any). Characters tend to fall flat with similar friendly personalities (even your grumpy or egotistical characters have soft edges). 
- The illustrations are wonderful and were my main draw to begin playing in early access. But, if I'm honest, the game-play visuals (specifically related to the human characters) are not for me. Not because they aren't good or well crafted, it just falls a bit to squarely into a Disney style for me.",1705013723,1705013723,False,3,0,0.521300375461578369,0,True,False,False

I've been gaming for many years and the one thing I can say about ANY game that I really get immersed in, are the DETAILS.  Any game that I've enjoyed over time, the devs have paid attention to the details, the minutiae that really suck you in.  There are a few issues with Coral Island.

     - All of the animal and character models are fantastic...except for the cows.  Where everything else appears to have a 
       ""cartoonish realism"",  the cows are ridiculous.  They're like a newspaper comic version of a cow.

     - The walking animation needs work.  Some of the characters walk like they have soiled themselves.  Where you would 
        expect a more feminine walk on some characters, you get something that resembles an ambulating version of the 
        Elaine dance from Seinfeld.

     - When a character (including the player) or animal changes direction, it snaps to the other direction.  There should 
        be motion involved in the change of direction, not just...a change of direction.

This is what I've noticed so far in my short time playing.  I, obviously, really like this game as I've spent time writing this review and gave it a positive mark.

One last thing I will say, is that another attribute to some of the greatest games I've played, is when the devs take the time to listen to the players and make reasonable adjustments accordingly.

Update 1/11/24 - I still think the game is ok, but I do have some gripes with it.

1. The writing is bad. Besides being terribly corny, it feels like it a shoddy google translate job most of the time. Often the wrong word is used (like an instead of a), or stuff just doesn't make any sense. Townies will also often lose their train of thought between instances of you talking to them back to back. Jumping from one idea to another in an instant, with neither idea connected, and the poor writing making both of the thoughts confusing. It needs an editor.

Multiple times I've laughed out loud and had to stop because of the absolute nonsense that came out of characters mouths. Most of them don't speak like anyone I've ever met, or anyone I've ever read, and the work a rounds for some real life institutions they don't want to use are hilarious. I understand where Pickstarter came from, but besides rhyming, it doesn't work. Kickstarter works because to kickstart something is already a thing. Sure, you could argue that you are picking a project to crowd source, but you still wouldn't call that service Pickstarter. Also, I don't remember exactly which it was, Navy or Air Force, but it became something like the Air Military, or Water Military, and I cackled. Navy and Air Force are generic terms for those types of military groups or whatever. Just tack whatever country you want on the front and it's fine. There comes a point when you are creating your world where you take your audience out of it more by coming up with a corny name for something that exists. You don't need to reinvent the wheel.

2. The grind is real. There are so many machines, and so many machines that need so many extra parts to make them work. You need glass for some of the machines to make a thing that can make some of your seeds better, but I think only one at a time. And don't worry, you have to grind to get both of those things. Not that I'll use that machine, or that part of the lab, because I've better things to do than farm glass and kelp to make some seeds a tiny bit better. The extra 10 bucks isn't worth the hassle of all the hoops you have to jump through to get there. Want to cook? Hope you don't mind buying utensils for your kitchen, because even if you learn recipes and upgrade your house to have a kitchen you still can't cook in it until you go to the store and buy a bunch of different utensils. And I thought I hated mining in Stardew (I'm a farm girly), it has nothing on the underwater sections of this game. Holy shit.

3. You lack agency. You can ""talk"" to the villagers a couple times, but sometimes they just accuse you of saying something rude. Which is wild, as while the game does have a handful of dialogue choices in some cut scenes, you don't get those options when your just talking to people on your daily rounds. And it actually sucks to be told by a character that I was rude to them when I didn't have the option to not be. It's a poor design choice, and I actively hate it.

4. It feels hollow. Heart events often happen without your character being involved at all. It feels like the game is happening to you, and your farmer is just there. And I get some of this might be because it's early access and still being worked on, but I played it a year ago and wasn't having these feelings. I was playing prior to most of the heart events I've seen recently being added, and I felt like more of a member of the community then than I do now. It's really weird.

In one instance you walk into the bar and they are having a trivia night. No one invites you to sit with them, and I honestly am not sure you even appear in the background. What does happen is you watch an agonizingly long scene plays out where two characters have a poorly written argument, and then they actually start playing trivia and asking questions. Again, you are not involved in this at all, and no one even acknowledges that you're even there. Why am I seeing this? I get that we are getting to see these two characters interact, and learning about them, but there has to be a better way to do this that allows the player to be involved. It is a game after all.

In conclusion, I think all of this is because it's trying to do the Stardew thing without trying to do the Stardew thing. So many times while playing it would make what felt like digs at Stardew in dialogue in desperate need of an editor, and during an event or cut scene that Stardew did better. And here's the thing, it's all Harvest Moon, bb, and we love it all. Do it good and we don't care if it's more of exactly the same in a different skin, but don't insult our intelligence or drag your inspiration. There's plenty of room for every farming sim out there. And with so many of these games out there, and with so many amazing ones that have come before, there's really no excuse to do so much of it worse.

Anyway, there are too many characters for what it's trying to accomplish, and it's just spread way too thin. It needs to be tightened up.

Is it fun? Yeah, it's a farming game. Will I keep playing it? Sure, probably. While I have my gripes with it, it's pretty fun despite how grindy it is, and even though most of the characters don't feel like they have a character, there are a couple I'm fond of, and am invested in. And one decent character is enough to keep me invested in something longer than it probably deserves. All this being said I went a whole year without playing it and forgot about it completely before remembering it was a thing, and I feel like that says a whole heck of a lot.",1672038776,1704966952,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I believe the devs were very excited to launch their product and did not manage the expectations of the community correctly, leading to a lot of disappointment in the unfinished storylines and the numerous bugs.

1158160,155707139,76561197997332239,0,5,10297,0,10297,1704866416,"I've played this game for awhile after buying it in early access when there was only one month's worth of festivals available and then shelving it until the 1,0 release. I was a little disappointed because I expected a more complete game. A lot has been implemented, but not quite enough. I figured since I've played almost 200 hours, I'd leave a review on the worst issues. Some minor spoilers ahead about heart event contents. Also, I had to choose between recommend or not.. So I will say recommend, but not until it's complete. 

Romance & Marriage:
There's not enough in terms of romance events. I wasn't sure if I wanted to choose Mark or Theo, but was kind of taken aback that many of their heart events did not include my character. It was basically like being a fly on the wall and seeing what they were doing. There wasn't really any relationship building. Even with Mark, many of his events revolved around a stray dog and it left me wondering how I was supposed to fall in love with someone who was so obsessed with a dog... unless I was a serious dog person who perhaps rescued animals myself. It was just over the top. There was one scene where he opened up about a past teammate that he felt guilty about and how that connected with the dog. I thought that was good storytelling, but then it went right back to the dog..AGAIN! And it's not like I don't like dogs here folks, but it was literally about how Mark accidentally fed the dog something it was allergic too. And the rest was all this kind of nutso response to feeling guilty, the dog going to the vet, the dog running away, mark hunting for the dog.. I didn't feel like it even made sense in terms of US building a relationship. I would rather Mark take me out to fight monsters in the mines.. or maybe take me camping.. something that actually builds a romantic relationship between us! The dog does not do that at all. I just sat there thinking, damn.. if you weren't so hot.. I would not put up with this! 

Theo's mission to find and fix his mother's piano was a little better.. but only because my mother has passed too and I could relate to what that's like. Butt I still didn't feel super involved. Theo and Mark both asked for time alone without me after dealing with their big issues which kind of felt weird.. like i'd rather get closer.. not rubber band! 

So the romance specific cut scenes would be ok.. IF.. they added more in terms of the player and the romance actually starting to get intimate. To know each other in that way.. instead it feels forced and weird. Like.. I asked Mark to be my boyfriend at 10 hearts, and somehow within a couple of days.. also asked him to marry me and saw a scene where we went on literally the first romantic date we ever had (10 heart event) and then the next day got married. It felt... weird.. and I wasn't even trying  to rush it.. It just happened that way. I thought you had to be at 10 hearts to go steady.. Anyway.. More events to get towards a romance would be nice. 

Another huge problem was that on the day of my wedding, I was wearing a stupid farmer's outfit and looked ridiculous. It would have been nice if someone had prompted me to go buy a dress beforehand.. or if there was a default simple dress given to me automatically. I seriously felt like a scrub when Mark was all dressed up. 

Town Rank: 
There's no clear idea of what actually leads towards improvement except for things like Museum and the Ocean. I had no idea what heritage even was and had to look it up. So, you can easily improve rank by just clearing the ocean.. but then once you're done.. and you're at A rank ocean.. it feels like there's no way to really go any further. By this point in the game, I've reached C rank, but can't get to B rank.. New fossils, rocks, fish, insects, all the things that help with the museum are not super common anymore since I've cleared the ocean and cleared all the mines. When I do find a new one, it's only 3 pts or so. That's not enough to get anywhere. There definitely needs to be more in terms of earning. I'm stuck now waiting for festivals and trying to win merit that way. But, by now I'm sick of playing since there's nothing to work towards. These games do well when the player is working on other more mundane features, while working towards a goal... like mines/ ocean/ etc. Those grinds were good.. but there needs to be more.. Perhaps the dig site or the savannah is meant to add this next level.. but without it available, I have nothing to do and have grown bored. 

Merfolk:
I was super disappointed the merfolk weren't available for romancing. I actually finished up cleaning the ocean and Semeru just repeats that he has nothing more to say to me. I can't gift him.. and there are no heart events obviously since I wasn't even able to gain a heart with him even talking to him every single day. I also don't get why there are two females and only one male to romance.. Why not open up Agung? 

Festivals:
Some of the mini games are evil and I hate them. The burlap sack game? Evil!! I managed to win it once, and then got beaten in the 2nd round.. I'll never get the merit points for it! Also, after making it to the second year, I was sad to see that the npcs all say the same things again. Adding new dialogue for each new year would make sense and will add more appeal to these events. I didn't even care to talk to anyone the 2nd time through once I realized they all said the same stuff. 

Overall:
The game has a lot of promise, but I'm annoyed I'm going to have to leave it and come back to whenever the full game is available. The problem with putting it down after investing so much time into my game is that when I do come back.. I won't have any idea what's going on.. what I was doing.. what new stuff is available, etc. It would have been much better to get the full experience on the launch playthrough.. That said, the game has a lot of promise and I like the direction it's headed in. It is the best farming/ romance sim I've played since Stardew Valley and that's saying something because I play the heck out of these types of games. I really like the attempt at improving the graphics too. The people working on the game really just have to work at adding some more soul to the game as there are definitely times that the characters feel empty. 

That is the one thing that SDV really holds the candle for with me.. Making believable characters that had stories you cared about.. Getting to know them.. and ultimately falling in love. There was even a better feel after marriage. As it stands, I probably won't touch Coral Island for another year, because I really don't want to play again without everything being there. I feel like I got bait and switched with this release because I expected everything and only got about half or so it feels.

TL:DR: I think this game is better than stardew already and hopefully will become even better after further updates

let's get straight to it, almost everyone i've seen thinks this game is basically stardew, and... i have to agree, to an extent anyway.

be aware that this review is from someone who was utterly burnt out from stardew and farming games in general.

[h1] better than stardew: [/h1]
[h3] it isn't pixellated [/h3] yes, yes, i know. it's a matter of opinion and this is mine. it's easier on the eyes

[h3] faster travel [/h3] i haven't used the horse yet but travel is generally faster and there are a bunch more fast travel points you can unlock through playing.

[h3] variety of acivities [/h3] there's a diving component to the game, it provides upgrades to certain items and generally something else to do aside from mine and run around your farm/town

[h3] more romance options [/h3] fairly self explanatory, i'd be truly surprised if there wasn't something for everyone with the amount of characters

[h3] built in character locator [/h3] at any time you can zoom into he map to find any character at any time, or, find them though the relationship tab directly

[h1] neutral to stardew [/h1]
[h3] everyone in this game is nice [/h3] personally i like this, but i can see people calling them one dimensional, or saying there's no variety or something like that. 

[h3] combat is hard to level [/h3] i'd managed to finish the mines storyline before i'd gotten past level 6 of combat, at that point all my skills were higher

[h3] there's nothing to do after you max skills [/h3] again self explanatory, hopefully by that point you've found something to fixate on doing

[h1] worse than stardew [/h1]

things that i know are being worked on have (W) next to them

[h3] can't romance mermaids [/h3] (W)

[h3] impossible achievements [/h3] (W)

[h3] unclear fast travel unlock requirements [/h3] 
they may reference giving offerings to trees even though it's the lake shrine and aren't clear on which they mean

[h3] ""name"" has nothing more to say today [/h3] 
while the game has tonnes of unique dialogue, once they run out of dialogue this is all the game will say. this is especially evident with the giants

[h3] you cannot access the savannah [/h3] 
the savannah is a reward for the most difficult bundle to complete and as of now are inaccessible (W)

[h3] unfinished areas [/h3] 
there's a recycling area in the game which is unusable, and the area where the big bad™ is kicked out of, as far as i know has nothing going on, ever. (W?)

[h3] unmarked quests [/h3] it is possible to forget to do things as some aren't marked


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
frankly i think this game is great, and will become better once it's finished. probably better than stardew but that's my opinion",1704891194,1704891194,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can go a few days without talking to people and not see a dip in your friendship with them, which I personally love.

The cons: 

I wish that there was more variation with at least some of the festivals - specifically the Winter Market. There's really not much reason to go beyond one day considering that it doesn't seem like the stock/products actually rotate? 

I look forward to the 2024 road mpa for the spouse interactions, but as it stands now, there really isn't that much? I would like to go one more dates when we're ""dating."" Theo makes references to inside jokes when you marry him but that kind of struck me as odd because we really only had one ""date"" and that was our 10 heart event, if you can even call it a date lol.

The game has a tendency to lag when I dash. I don't know if this is a problem for everyone or just me? Either way, it's frustrating but lowering my overall graphics has notably improved it.

Like I said, things are unfinished. You can't currently romance any of the mermaids and aside from grinding for kelp, there's not much more reason to go down after you heal all the coral. The 2024 road map, however, promises a lot and I look forward to it!

Finishing the altars is... slow work. Even dedicated focus makes it a pain and that's specifically because of fishing and bug catching. Catching bugs is easy, but it requires so much running around and trying to spot these tiny things on the ground. It's easy to miss stuff. Fishing, on the other hand, is just... slow, and kind of boring, even with an upgraded rod. I've never loved fishing in games, but I do wish it was slightly faster paced with a lower likelihood of grabbing garbage instead of a fish.",1704488294,1704859903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But overall nice graphics and cozy atmosphere and vibrant colours. Very Cute :-) 

But... who on the team actually came up with the glorious idea that, for example Pear-TREES wither every season? Sure, they only bear fruit seasonally, but disappear completely? I think that's pretty ... stupid and very confusing for relative new Players like me.

Or let's say - rather... unfavorable design decision. I also like to use fruit trees in games like this as a design element for my garden. I can forget about that then. A great pity.

I also miss the option of being able to save at any time, as my house electrics have often failed me here recently, but that's just by the way. An absolute must in a modern cozygame, if you put aside the traditionalist aspect.

The Controls are a little ""clunky""

But all in all, just a thumbs up, even though I still see a lot of potential for improvements and fixings.

The farming aspect is well implemented though mining is very boring since you have to find just the right rick to break in order to move down a level. 

Ocean exploration is much less of a chore and far better implemented. I found myself cleaning the ocean during any free time.  However, the merfolk in the ocean are only implemented in the main quest right now. You have no access to increase relationships or visit shops in the village.

Building relationships in town is pretty standard fair with gift giving and encountering certain heart level events. However, once you get married the game gets pretty buggy. My spouse ran out of things to say 3/4 of the way through the year and for the rest of the year I just got a message ""Leah has nothing more to say to you"". Even the birth a child didn't generate any novel or new dialogue. Leah's behavior AI also broke down. She first would stand by the bed for a little bit then read a book on the front steps before going on to the rest of her schedule. Now she is stuck by the bed till noon and has zero interaction with the baby. My character also has zero interaction ability with the baby so it just sleeps or lays in bed awake just as a placeholder. Also there is no post heart date/hangout interactions so there isn't anything you can do with your wife or friends beyond the heart events which is sad since this is becoming more of a standard in newer life sim games.

Also I have avoided sprinkler attachments and auto chests in my play through because you can read plenty of other review talking about how they are bugged and don't always work or at worst the auto chest has caused some crashing.

With all that aside the festivals are fun and some of the characters are well written and fun to interact with. I do hope the developer sticks with the game and really builds it out into what can become a great sim. I would just advise either buying it knowing your getting an incomplete game or waiting and keeping an eye on the updates until this is a more fleshed out experience.",1704653023,1704653023,False,3,0,0.556962013244628906,0,True,False,False

* * *

:: STORY ::
Coral Island has your farmer returning to Starlet Town where a recent oil spill has wreaked havoc on the surrounding beaches and seabed. On top of that, a big corporation wants to move in and ""clean"" things up. Like in Stardew Valley, you'll be working against The Company while tending to your farmland, mingling with local deities and wooing the townsfolk. I've not noticed any instance of being able to side with The Company, and I don't know if I'm missing something or if it just isn't there.

:: GAMEPLAY ::
 It's here where Coral Island shines the brightest in my opinion. It's difficult to explain exactly just what it is about the way you go about your field chores that clicks so much with me when compared to other indie titles like Stardew Valley; Perhaps it's the not-so-snappy way in which the process goes down. You're not running across tilled land dropping seeds at lightning-fast speeds. Harvesting has weight to it. Watering crops takes time. Depending on the size of your crop plots, watering can take up a large portion of your morning/stamina and doesn't feel like an afterthought that some games tend to make it feel. 

I also appreciate the variety of crops and things to grow. For example: In addition to the usual crop seeds and fruit trees, there's a new type of crop in the form of starters, which I admit I initially thought WERE trees and was quite surprised that I not only had to water them daily, but that they also died at the change of the season. These starters require a 2x2 plot of tilled soil to be planted and typically take 10+ in-game days to grow, so it's best to get them started at the very beginning of the season when possible.

Love it or hate it, crafting is a mainstay in the farming sim genre now and here it is out in full swing. Much like Stardew Valley, the majority of outdoor decorative items and other miscellaneous farming tools are crafted within a menu ala Stardew Valley and Minecraft. I don't really mind it too much, but this feature has gone on to create an issue that began in Stardew Valley and has infected just about every new farm sim that has come out since.

Makers. Mayo, cheese, kegs, and specifically for Coral Island, plastics, and kelp. Whatever by-product you can think of, a dev has likely made it a separate item that can be crafted and placed on your farm. I hate this sub-system with a passion as the makers are ugly eyesores that take up space on your property. I appreciate that Stairway Games has made it so one maker can process five products at once, but you still need to plop the machine down onto your land somewhere that requires you to - if you're like me - remember where you put it to claim your metal bar/byproduct once it's done its process. Gone are the days of pricey luxury maker items that get tucked away in the barn or needing metal ores to upgrade your tools. I loathe this trend with a burning passion and would rather see the majority of these tasks locked behind in-game paywalls again and NOT have to litter my farm with big, gaudy makers.

Combat feels like an afterthought. It's lightweight, loose, and isn't overly deep or has any real impact beyond being a nuisance while traversing the mines. I've honestly just been ignoring that whole thing and have changed it so that the monsters won't bother me unless I antagonize them first.

:: ATMOSPHERE ::
A separate segment of an Advrik Review that is reserved exclusively for games with seasonal cycles. I feel that this is something a dev needs to nail down in games like this as the seasons are at the core of the gameplay loop. 

So does Coral Island nail the atmosphere? Kiiiinda. While I am only just approaching the last two days of my first autumn season, I can say that of the three seasons I've experienced thus far, only summer and autumn have felt unique. The color in the game world wasn't as lush as I would have liked for the summer season, nor was there a whole lot of environmental touches that helped to differentiate between the spring and summer seasons. Some more background noises and maybe some sun rays or different droning insects between musical tracks could have helped in this regard. The autumn season has faired a bit better with leaves occasionally flowing through the air, but those staples of autumn are sadly absent from the atmospheric background noise. Rustling leaves, chirping crickets, wind chimes. A lot of little things like this can go a long way in making each season feel more alive and authentic. 

:: MUSIC ::
The soundtrack is solid. Solid enough that I bought a copy of it after ten hours of gameplay. The seasonal tracks are all catchy, though I would have loved to have heard some more instrument variations between the seasons. Considering the game takes place on a tropical island of sorts, I would have expected the summer tracks to be more Hawaiian-sounding. That's my only real grievance with the soundtrack however as everything else is fantastic. I appreciate the effort the Yugo Pratomo put into composing not just four separate tunes for each of the four seasons, but also nighttime variations for each! Above and beyond right there, and the more season-themed music I have in my playlist, the better. 

But you know what really screamed ""BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK RIGHT NOW!!!"" to me? The theme for the Cherry Blossom Festival. Beautifully composed piece that would not have sounded out of place in Okami. 

I love to listen to farm-life soundtracks as I write, whether it is reviews like this or my actual books, so getting such a meaty soundtrack in lossless format for less than $10 was a no-brainer. I am listening to it right now as I write this review!

:: STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE ::
Here is where I'll hand over my Steam Deck LCD settings and give the readers an idea of what kind of setup I'm running and the battery expectancy

In-Game:
Display Mode: Borderless
Resolution: 1280x800
Render Scale: 100%
FPS Limit: No Limit
VSync: On
Anti-Aliasing: Low
Temporal Upsampling: On
Textures: Epic
Shadows: Low
Post Processing: Low
Visual Effects: Epic
Foliage: High
View Distance: Low
Plants: Medium
Ambient Occlusion: Low
Motion Blur: Low

Steam Deck "". . ."" Menu:
Use Per Game Profile: On
Frame Limit: 30FPS
Disable Frame Limit: Off
Allow Tearing: Off
Half Rate Shading: On
TDP Limit: 8
Manual GPU Clock: Off
Scaling Mode: Fill
Scaling Filter: Linear

On the Steam Deck LCD, you're going to get around 3 to 3 and a half hours with these settings, more if you reduce stuff like Foliage and Visual Effects further. The game isn't as well optimized as it should be and so regardless of what your settings are here, due to the devs making it so the entire island is loaded all at once with no zones to speak of, the game will stutter from time to time as it attempts to load NPCs and whatnot. Hopefully, this is something that the team can work out in future updates.

* * *

:: FINAL THOUGHTS ::
Can I recommend Coral Island? Yes, absolutely. I am largely ignoring NPC interaction as I don't care for that aspect of these games, nor am I overly fond of the game's overall art style. But the core gameplay is solid and I am very much appreciative of the fact that the team took the Back to Nature approach with the cooking system and allowed us to discover recipes on our own rather than requiring the recipe beforehand. 

Could it still use more work? Definitly. There's a lot of little technical things that need to be smoothed out. But as it stands, Coral Island is a blast to play, especially if you're in it just for the day-to-day, season-to-season farm life aspect of it.",1704649111,1704649111,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Regrets. 

This game is absolutely NOT done. It's not just a matter of waiting for DLC or something, there's literally things missing from the game that are actually advertised in the store page. 

The main example is that at least 3 people, that are advertised as dateable on the store page, aren't dateable. Not only are they not dateable, you cant even give them gifts, progress friendship with them or anything. There isn't even a planned date to make them actually dateable, as advertised, its just ""some time in 2024"". 

Another annoying thing is the mini games in festivals are very unbalanced, making some of them almost impossible to play and absolutely not fun because if it.

The thing that makes me the most upset is the pets. There are adoptable pets in the game. Exciting right? Except the animals, who all have adorable personalities in the shelter, turn into robotic decorations in your house. They don't play, like they do at the shelter. they don't lay anywhere for naps, not even their bed. You can't interact with them any differently than you can with the farm animals. There is a purchasable doghouse, yet the pet can't go outside. And worst of all, you can only adopt one pet, and the rest just stay in the shelter. Forever. Its just so messed up.

I would not recommend this game in the current state, unless you are okay playing half baked games.

I'll probably wait yet another year to try it again. Definitely a disappointment, and it feels a bit underhanded to advertise it as having things that it doesn't have.",1704605893,1704605893,False,7,0,0.572625815868377686,0,True,False,False

Coral Island (to me at least) is a souped up version of Stardew Valley in pretty much every way, and while it does add some things to the pile, they're either not to a significant degree or simply unfinished to be of any value. Now I do love Coral island, the vibe the characters the fact you meet ACTUAL FISH PEOPLE :D! However with all of these things noted down, the game is unfinished and quite grindy VERY early on. Money's hard to obtain because everything requires it (which makes sense but still) and it's equally hard to try and stockpile for a good while into the game. Add in the fact that the current story lines aren't finished and well, I'd say wait. Wait for the game to either go on sale (which was what I did) or simply wait until there are less bad reviews.

In comparison to many farming sims, Coral Island has a solid story-line, and added a lot of new elements that feel innovative and fresh in the genre. ( Diving is incredibly addictive! ) You can tell the devs have a real vision with this game, and it makes a genre that can feel generic incredibly unique and memorable. This game is by no means finished, but for the first 20-30 hours, you really don't notice it. It isn't until you start to get mid-tier gear and build deeper connections with some of the villagers that has you feeling the content is less than whole. 

I hope that as development of this game continues they can work on better writing in regards to the townsfolks relationships with your farmer. A lot of the cut scenes feel lifeless, and often times you only have one choice for responding during these interactions. I think most people come to this genre for the dating-sim like elements and intimate feel of living in a small town. I just asked Raj to be my date mate, and every cutscene before that was related to their business with no indication of interest in my farmer. One of the best aspects of games like Harvest Moon is the subtle change in interactions with your farmer as their heart events progress. 

As the game currently stands, the elements I find most enjoyable are mining, diving, and crafting. I appreciate the innovation in crafting by having universal chests so you can craft items without having to have it in your inventory, and I can tell by many of those small things that as Coral Island develops, it will be an incredibly solid and great game.

For real, I do enjoy the time i have spent so far. It feels a lot like stardew valley. That isn't my chief complaint but it is both a positive and negative. At times it feels almost a carbon copy of stardew, like the turn ins and some events have been. but it feels enjoyable to make an empire within. 

however, as of now with ~2hrs of afking I have encountered times 3 have been soft locked and forced to restart either because I was unable to control the game or because I was unable to progress.  

if a dev or a qc person sees this I was softlocked but trying to use a food to restore energy after running out while diving and returning to the surface. The game just stuck on using a food which it wouldn't use and rendered me unable to interact with anything; By passing out while diving and instead of being sent to my home i was sent to an inn (? not sure where i came out of I'm not sober rn) underwater without meeting any realted NPC and being stuck inside the merfolk area with no one spawn or able to leave through what I thought was the front door; And after the scene with Sam and the mayor about scarecrows in front of his store I just couldn't do anything and was stuck in a blurred out screen until I saved the game with the stuck command. For real I'm super sad about these bugs and WON'T recommend with current state but I want to play more.

comeon. this game is mostly a slam dunk copy of stardew, but it is NOT clean enough from bugs to call it a full release. I saw this from the yearly ""sit back and relax"" game section and I do not agree until more bugs are sorted. 

This is a frustrating section that is enjoyable but too buggy in the same respect. please continue to bug fix and add free updates like stardew did.

I will change my review if that can be done <3

While it's clearly still being improved upon. It feels like it's 1.0 release was pushed more by the publisher than the developers. The developers clearly have a lot of love for the game. I wish that they were given more time to the full release but understand that ROI and bottom line for publishers can make time constraints hard to balance against best laid plans and all. 

Over all the game is charming, and refreshing. It has some story-lines that really hit close to home and I recommend checking out the Reddit a bit if you'd like to get a better feel for the game in it's current state. 

You can adjust the in game speed time and there's a ton of fun aspects to the game that feel refreshing. I really enjoy what the under water area could be. It's not fully fleshed out so I wouldn't buy this for the mermaids just yet.
This game feels like a more updated version of Stardew Valley and it even pays homage to the creator of stardew valley. That said, it does enough to differentiate itself from others in the genre. The sheer number of datables is really fun, when I rarely have more than one that falls into my type. This game has 6 which is really fun to me. 

Areas I wish it could improve upon: 
The interior decorating. 
Give players better ways to interact with horses
Offer a bike as an option
Show wheelchair users in the game and create a more accessible feel to the town. 

Obviously these are really odd things that I don't think are needed to make the game amazing. They just feel like they could offer more dimension to a game that already has a lot of unique aspects to it.",1704440202,1704440202,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am just now wrapping up the first year of the gameplay and while I have overall positive opinions of the game, the more I play it the more cracks I have noticed. The map is large, the graphics beautiful, the characters are numerous, and the gameplay has a generally good feel to it. However, the actual story (which I know is the largely important for people who like these genre of games) seems definitely lacking to the point of feeling like a v0.9 early access release instead of a full game. For clarity I will bullet point some of the issues I've noticed so far.

[list]
    [*][b] NPCs knows more about your character than you do - [/b] You arrive from a big city but apparently you have visited the island before so while you know nothing about characters or places around you, your character supposedly does. This makes for an awkward disconnect in knowledge and in some of the dialogue.
    [*][b] The story seems to be disjointed/missing - [/b] Based on what I've seen so far in the year I've played, the story is split into 3 parallel stories so I'll split this up for clarity.
    [*][b] Town Story - [/b] The town's general antagonists have done next to nothing other than a brief cut scene early in the game solidifying themselves as the antagonist. They show up for every holiday/festival but you cant even interact with them making them little more than just a background.
    [*][b] Ocean Story - [/b] The ocean is interesting and has potential to the point where you can actually sleep there instead of at your house but the characters rarely have any dialogue outside of scripted cutscenes that mark your progression instead giving you a common default message. There are numerous animals that you help in the ocean that you cannot actually talk with. Its structured so I would assume you can eventually talk with them, but the fact that it hasn't happened despite clearing the entire ocean is odd. And the only store there is locked until completing the ocean and the only items it sells are clothes items despite the sign directly outside listing more items. Additionally, all of the clothes are bugged to only show the default color variants regardless of what you buy.
    [*][b] Giants Story - [/b] The only story so far has been thanks for freeing the *element* giant and alluding to some threat. Definitely seems like the most complete of the 3 story lines but sadly that is because it is likely also the smallest of the 3. (Also small personal gripe on giants not being giant when there are so many other fey naming options available, but who actually cares)
    [*][b] Various Bugs/Glitches - [/b] These may be recent bugs per the latest patch notes, but I have had entire cutscenes that I've missed because the dialogue windows were missing (the one where you get access to the fossil brush). Regions of the map have been unlocked without any sort of notification or explanation as to why/how and when exploring them having little to nothing actually be in the new areas.
    [*][b] Risk free mining/salvaging - [/b] Despite having in game health, the mines re barely populated with monsters and those that do exist barely do any damage to the point where after reaching the end in the four mines I have never died once. The weapons you use also seem to have no difference other than appearance.  You can buy what appear to be upgrades, however they only reveal to have the same damage values after you buy them. There may be some differences but after buying a hammer that was theoretically 2 stages better and having it have the same damage value I just didn't bother, especially since it wasn't really needed. Also the only ocean you face in the ocean is the clock and your stamina. I would appreciate some enemies to break up to monotony of breaking down trash. There exists small dungeons in the ocean for grinding loot that could specifically have monsters if no where else but unfortunately nope just more boring grinding.
    [*][b] Weird festival mini-games - [/b] The games themselves aren't bad and actually are quite entertaining however they rarely tell you how to play the game, instead opting to throw you into it and letting you play it as many times as you want to try for the high-score and corresponding reward. Which inevitably means you end up playing the same mini-games multiple times to figure out whats going on and then to win the prize, taking away any real feel of accomplishment of actually doing well. Even the large events like the harvest festival aren't free from this as they tell you to bring six items but don't tell you the grading scale for them so you can still lose with 6 of the highest quality rank items.
    [*][b] Icons Missing - [/b] Character and location Icons are missing on the map.  
    [*][b] Can't Report Issues - [/b] This one may be on me but I have looked and could not find an option to report issues in the game as you find them. It may exist, but it's at least not obvious.  
[/list]

All in all, I truly do enjoy the game but it overall feels like its missing that last little bit that makes it complete. Hopefully these type of issues are fixed in the coming days/weeks/months as I do truly enjoy playing the game and would definitely recommend it once they have been corrected but until then I would say hold off or wait until its on sale.",1704424024,1704433575,False,2,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

My pros:

* You can make a lot of Artisan products 
* There's a lot of insects, fish, and forageable stuff
* Cute aesthetics and a lot of customisation to play with! You have indoor and outdoor decor.
* Animals are very cute
* Mini games and events!
* I'm 150 hours in and there's still so many things to learn and farm!
* Mermaids! How often do you see them in farming games?

Cons:

* Consistent crashes when I customise furniture in certain buildings. (I do understand that the game is still developing and will have future updates.)
* Combat and mining: It isn't as engaging, the cave systems may be randomised but can get boring after a while. 
* Pets: Can't have more than one and you don't really get rewarded for building a relationship with them.

I played about 21 hours so far and did not run into any (at least obvious) bugs. However, as already mentioned, there are many situations that break the immersion cause the game isn't finished. Poorly translation for German (don't know about the other languages). It is often a mix of both English and German in dialogues and item descriptions alike. Sometimes a direct translation of an English sentence makes no sense in German and sometimes an English word has multiple tranlations in German and the game uses the wrong one. NPCs also sometimes speak to you formally and sometimes informally (German Du/Sie).

There are no animations when you order a new building for your farm from the carpenter. The building or the construction site is just there. No workers there hammering or something as we know it from other games. 
Fences do not connect to buildings and also can't be placed right next to a building, creating a large gap between them. Animals can't pass it as I assume but it just doesn' look right.

I also face a bunch of performance issues. The game is often lagging.
In general, it feels too much like stardew valley to me to really enjoy it as a new game. Of course there are similarities in farming simulations, but I would like to see more differences in the basic elements of these types of games.

The game has potential for sure and I hope the developers will make use of it, so that we can truly enjoy that game as full release title!",1704394835,1704397165,False,5,0,0.541089415550231934,0,True,False,False

Why am I not recommending this game?

this game is not in early acess anymore, and witha price to match.

I got this game after 1.0 came out, I rather finished games, and don´t mind paying more for a good complete game.
This is not it. This game has no right to call itself anything other than early acess.

there are shops with nothing implemented to be sold.
the combat is stupidly easy (you basically can't die)
The joystick controls are horrible, the minigames that require speed are a mess.
I have an immovable chest on my farm that I just gotta live with.
When diving I got stuck multiple times.
 The diving part has no dash and feels very empty (they have a lot planned.... again, not a 1.0 release.)
It´s really hard to eggs or milk or feed the animals because you keep accidentally petting them (way worse than SD whitout holding the hay, you can use a pickaxe, which feels weird and it´s worse than with the hay trick in SD), 
design of everything is hard to see, most notably some plants like sweet potato, you never know if they are regrow and just spam click is not a soluting because the joystick controls are bad.
More often than not the character lines have no translation in Portuguese, so all the characters keep changing languages.
when they do have a translation, words that have no gender in English but do in Portuguese get a randomly assigned gender
(for example ""cute"" can be ""fofa"" or ""fofo"" but the game uses both seemingly at random)
the game is a hole soo grindy, with different caves for every mineral (so when you progress you still have to go to weaker caves to get lower-grade minerals)",1704337404,1704337404,False,3,0,0.509536802768707275,0,True,False,False

Wait until at LEAST 2025 or 2026 before getting it because there's still tons content that needs to be added (there's a HUGE chunk of the story that is missing & the unuseable empty buildings, animals, and scenery just sit there), the duilogues are shallow (and buggy, and if you romance someone, they don't feel like your partner at all), and I suspect that every time they release a BIG big update, you'll need to restart the game again to experience it the way you're supposed to.

As someone who spent hundreds of hours on Stardew Valley on switch, this game has perfectly copied Stardew's basic gamplay loop. The farming, mining, tool upgrading, house upgrading, meseum, offering, and so on are quite literally the same from Stardew. This is beyond just ""oh they're both farming game so they're similar"", this is they're literally the same with how the gamepaly loop, the endgame and the leveling structure are. I was quite astonished how is this game even allowed to be this similar to Stardew as I was playing.
With that said, I don't really mind it because it copied Stardew so well that I can sort of relive that Stardew magic back when Stardew was the only thing I binge play for days on end. If you like Stardew like me you're gonna enjoy this game to a certain degree. 
My only gripe about this game are the event mini-games. They're the worst part of the game as of the moment. With atrocious difficulty spike that I had to look up ways people deal with them after failing dozen of times. It's frustrating knowing there's an event to come and the only thing I'm thinking is ""welp, guess I'm gonna sit at the screen retrying some bs mini-games over and over again.""",1704283003,1704283003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like this game a lot, and I am quite invested in it. But it is not yet ready to be received. I am not sure why it happened but as of now, 3rd of january 2024, it is not ver 1.0 as it is promoted which is a blatant lie. 

First of all it is a beautiful game, it is clone of sdv in more ways that one (no point in hiding that) but it is not a bad thing and never will be. You start as a farmer on a tropical island and you immediately fall in love with it. Visuals are great and activities are engaging. A lot of customizables and variations so you will be hard pressed to be bored with aesthetics. 

Pros:
- As it is mentioned above, it is a Stardew Valley clone but it with mods. Chests are linked so you can craft items from materials from separate chests wherever you are, you can see all of NPCs on the map and see what their preferences are, and a lot of other perks that makes your experience better;
- Festivals are much more eloquent and there are a lot of activities that keep you engaged;
- Very nice visuals. You actually feel like you are on a tropical island and you can even go diving (to clean trash though but it is not bad);
- Characters are great, they are interesting, charming and/or aloof. They have a lot of things to say and they can even hint on other characters preferences so it is good thing to check in on them when you bump into them. Worth mentioning that each and every one of them has different set of clothing for different ocasions;
- A lot to do and a lot of time to do so. You can go mining, foraging, fishing, crafting, farming, ranching, catching bugs and dive into ocean where you can meet some more NPCs to befriend. You gain access to fast travel early and you can dip into hot springs to restore energy.

After all of that there are still some bad things that can and will happen during your gameplay:
- BUGs, a lot of them and of different scale. You can stuck and you will have to end your day shortly, which is not bad but still sad;
- Some quests, even story related, do not finish as intended and you will stuck with them for some time without a possiblity to progress;
- Some artisan products will not finish until you reset the game;
- OST is just bland if it is playing but it is still better than not playing at all and that happens often. Ultimately I decided to put some ambient or lofi music on the background instead;
- Some characters' story lines are not finished and some lack heart events at all, due to that fact you are not able to marry some bachelors;
- You can adopt a pet. Dog, cat, fox, rabbit and even lizard but it will be stuck at home and never leave. Why??;
- Not happened to me, but someone mentioned how they stuck underwater without being able to return to the surface and they had to abandon their progress;

There are a lot more but this is current state of the game. I love the game, really do and if you are a farming sim fan, you will probably like this game as well, but you should wait until the game is fully playable as it was intended.",1704273047,1704273047,False,3,0,0.536978363990783691,0,True,False,False

In short: 
This is, bordering on objectively better to Stardew at this point for me. There are some rough edges with ongoing dev, but the QOL improvements make for me an amazing experience.

Bad:
There's still ongoing dev, they have some obvious things missing like a few character portraits. There are a few characters that likewise have inferior portrait art. Likewise I'll say like, the romance line stuff is a bit stilted so far for me. The variety is nice and whatnot but there's just not as Much emotion here? Like it feels a Bit more sterile.

Good:
There's multiple resource mines to go to, places where like as alternatives to farming you can go do things? So in Stardew that was mostly the mines. Here we have mines, we have underwater areas (Which, is like a fully fleshed out underworld like the above world, all it's own), and we have a dig site.

On the story, even while I'd say parts are undercooked right now, overall I just like the story beats it tries to cover. It does a good job at talking about single parenting, it's human interactions feel more considered, and each character so far has a distinct vibe to them. You'll start talking to someone, and really figure out more about them as time goes on.

All of that pales beside: You can slow the day down. In Most cozy farming games, the day speed is About 20 minutes. Give or take 3 minutes. In Coral Island, you can have it at 20 minutes OR you can slow it down to 30, it's just a toggleable option. And the difference between 20 and 30 minutes is just Wild, the pace of the game totally changes.

This game was not ready to come out of early access and it is disappointing to see them label this 1.0 when nearly nothing has changed from the early access.  Objects you still cant interect with, promised minigames still not existing, areas you can unlock with nothing to do....

This is a fun game dont get me wrong I enjoyed my time playing but this is not a 1.0 game its still early access and my biggest hiccup with this game:

ROMANCE AND HEART EVENTS:

from the 3 bachelors I romanced their heart events are boring and empty, I romanced Mark Raf and Raj and the heart events in this game are weird, you fallow 1 story ,n episodic format that continues with each heart so you do not feel like you are getting close to them at all, heck half of the events dont even HAVE YOU IN IT.

With raj while I am not at 10 hearts from what I have experiance till his 6 heart  [spoiler] You watch him make stupid decisions with his coffee shop that you do not even participate in, you dont even drink the coffee half the time ur in line and watch what happens and don't interact afterwards, there is no cute picnic date or talking about his life  [/spoiler]

With Mark my main romance  [spoiler] he follows around a stray dog with all his hearts you don't even help him find it nor talk to him or get close to him (except in one last scene where you comfort him a bit) and his demeanour towards you don't change till you bf him so it feels weird to ask him to date when he acts like he hates your guts.  [/spoiler]

With Raf  [spoiler] he was the only bachelor I thought the story moved his feelings a lot, he tries to find a rare ore DOESN'T asks you TO MINE IT, and orders it from a sketch guy but at least you get to encourage him and he opens up a bit and actually thanks you and his demeanour changes  [/spoiler]

NON SPOILER

the heart events don't move the story along the character's demeanour hardly changes and till you get to like bf-level hearts, they act the same, For a game that advertises its romance and dating so much most of them feel empty and lacklustre with barebones and they plan on adding more via merefolks when their human romances aren't fulfilling yet.

EVENTS AND FESTIVALS:
The Halloween event has no costumes when npcs talk like they do... 1.0... need I say more... Half of the minigames don't have tutorials so you are thrusted into it blind when some of them do.
Other than that they are enjoyable...

FARMING:
not much to say pretty ok except for THE METEORS THAT FALL EVERY OTHER WEEK AND DESTROY EVERYTHING, I've had 2 falls within a week and 1 destroyed my 4k tree the other destroyed a 1k one, they targeted farmland and never the empty plot.... lower the % of them spawning dews...

MINING and diving:
surprisingly the most fun part of the game so no complaints there

The game is good but it's empty and not a 1.0 they are rushing this game needs a year or atleast a half to be fully playable. You can easily spend 30 hours in and be fine but after that, you will notice the problems and lack of content where there was clearly supposed to be one. so do not get it now if you plan on playing long term wait a year at least.

I'm also sad to find that it is almost entirely a stardew valley rip-off with very few unique features of its own.  Despite the game literally copy and pasting stardew  valley into shiny and new graphics, it still falls short with its terrible story, lack of depth and buggy game play.

This is great, as a lot of titles for the Steam Deck will take some controller tweaking as most are meant for mouse/keyboard playing.

I was watching for this game to come out of pre-release to enjoy. i was ecstatic when they announced the 1.0 release. this game is truly a successor in a long line of farming simulator games and gives players many quality of life improvements and lots of options for how to build their farm and interact with the community.  

most of my negative feedback can be summarized as this game is not as complete as they would lead you to believe. completing many of the shrines is suppose to grant you access to new areas that are not implemented yet. i personally encountered many bugs in this play through including difficulty triggering cut scenes for community interaction/romance  stories and in some cases even triggered the same cut scene multiple times. Its also annoying that you have to talk to your spouse everyday and most days you get a text box saying ""they have nothing more to say"". The lack of these promised rewards lead to a disappointment and a lack of accomplishment. 

I will be excited to play this game in about 6 months to a year from now when they release updates to finish the game so i can fully complete a play through and truly experience all this game has to offer.
Please Wait to Purchase/start playing this game.

P.S. Please fix the drop/spawn rate of many of the items that need to be donated and offered. fir example it has been the bane of my existence to get 2 red beryl, the one was offered but i am in fall year 3 and haven't gotten a second yet.

I like the game play loop and it looks beautiful but not only is it unfinished but the characters are just so bland and boring. it boasts a huge romance roster but there's allot of characters who just aren't finished and the ones that are don't even remotely peek my interest. this is the first time in a game like this where i really don't want to romance anyone (which is the main reason i play these games.) 

a big gripe i have with the characters is that you'll have random cut scenes that are pointless and don't develop the them AT ALL. In stardew when you got a cut scene it revealed something about a character so you could get to know them and warm up to them. only a few of the cut scenes do that and even those are just not well done. just as an example, there's a short one where this dude and his kid are on the beach looking at crabs. he tells the kid to not scare them and the kid says ok. THAT'S IT. like, what was the point of interrupting my mad dash to the store that's gonna close in 10 seconds? It didn't develop the characters at all. Just pointless filler. with such little depth to the characters i am just sooo tempted every time to skip scenes which is something i never do.

another gripe is when the characters say the most redundant things. i had one tell me 'planting trees is good for the environment' my guy, who talks like that? why are you telling me this? and this particular character almost every encounter with them was like this but they did have a few bits of interesting dialog and even some of their cut scenes so far were kinda good and relatable. so i do feel like it's possible for them to be better but i'm just constantly thrown off when a character starts speaking like an automated robot. 

TLDR: the characters have little to no depth and it's very hard to really like them. gameplay loop is fun and there's allot to do. game is unfinished. looks very beautiful. Do not recommend mainly because it's unfinished.",1704130734,1704130734,False,5,1,0.543899655342102051,0,True,False,False

NPCs daily dialogues are often missing, the Lake Temple completion rewards aren't fully implemented and the whole merfolks kingdom isn't very functional - after cleaning the ocean there is nothing left to do there, as there is no additional storyline with them, gaining friendship points or romancing still isn't available and there are only stubs of functional shops. There are also a lot of placeholder NPC models, like merfolk guards being used as shopkeepers. Being halfway through year 2, I feel like there's nothing more to see in the game.
I'm also not digging many of the NPC heart events. I feel like observing their lives, not like actually building a relationship with them, especially because sometimes my character either isn't really saying anything or straight up is not present in the scene, which is crazy. Often only 8 and 10 heart events feel like relationship building ones, which is wayyyy too late.
I'm disappointed and left feeling like I was scammed, as I was waiting for the game to be fully released to buy it with main storyline and mechanics finished. When I realised that the game is half empty, I was already way past the time that would allow me to return it, so I kept on playing, but I'm really not happy with how it looks. 
This game has a lot of potential, so I'll happily change my review to positive after seeing ACTUAL full release.

i do wish 1.0 had more content than the early access, nothing 'really' changed or got added on from the early access beta... kinda sucks but they did fix a lot of QOL stuff. 

right now the game feels like its still early access ,a tonne of quests aren't finished yet and im not sure why they chose to release it anyway? id have waited patiently. .0 should be a complete game in my opinion but i digress.

the characters and their interpersonal relationships are fun to see and get to know, the animals are adorable as heck, even the non romance characters are deeply enjoyable. i try not to miss anyone but Luke's birthday...(has nothin to do with the fact im tryna steal Bree away from Walter. nothing at all) 

hey... a lot of Npcs (the ones outside of the main town roster) are smokin and im begging on my kneeeeeesss.

The game is beautiful.  Graphics are detailed and gorgeous and the ""townies"" you can interact with are almost too attractive.  But no one is complaining.  Lol.  The game has not yet progressed to the phase where romance and marriage are possible, so can't say how that will play out.   The items you can purchase to decorate your farm are nicely done.  There is a lot to do in this game, in addition to the standard farm sim activities of planting, harvesting, fishing, bug catching, collecting things for the museum, and raising animals.  Diving is an interesting feature and will no doubt play a large part as the game development proceeds.   I do like the ecologically positive vibe of the game, and there are mysterious island inhabitants to help and a ""goddess"" to assist in bringing Coral Island back to its former grandeur.   The museum was thoughtfully created , much in the spirit of the Animal Crossing New Horizons model.  You can't get as close to the detail, but it is well done.    I have the impression that there is much more of interest planned for the final release, but we don't yet have access to it.  

On the negative side:
One is that you cannot save this game until you go to bed every night.  I find this very annoying, and really hope they change it.  Two is that the movement in the game is WASD, which I am totally comfortable with in a first person game where your view is over the shoulder.  But in CI, your view is from the side, so your character is constantly bumping into things and movement can be quite jerky.  They have finally implemented game controller access, but that does not help us keyboard players.  I don't know if they will ever address this. 
 
This game is very much ""early access"".  There are many features which are gated as they are not yet completed.  Quests just die in the middle.   Skill trees  have been capped and even some of the items that were accessible before the last update have been removed.  You can only progress half way in your relationships with townies, so gifting them is useless after a certain point.  Portions of the ocean are inaccessible or have vanished entirely.  The last update provided some really great QOL improvements, such as crafting from storage and decreasing the time it takes for a fish to bite. But the game also became unstable afterwards, and many players are having crashing issues now.  The devs are having an apparently difficult time balancing the challenges of the game with the rewards.  The most recent update nerfed practically everything.  Prices were increased across the board,  and the artisan goods makers you can build on your farm had their production rate slowed to about a third of their original speed.  This has resulted in basic produce and animal products building up as you can't process them.   Some fish became ridiculously difficult to catch.  Profits on artisan goods were dropped.  Basically, pretty much everything players could do that was profitable was seriously diminished.  I am assuming this was done in part to slow the players down as they were getting ahead of the game's development or making too much money in the dev's opinion?  But it took all the fun out of the game for me and for others who have commented on the forum.

I am not into maxing out cash in a relaxing sim game.  But I found this game so frustrating after the most recent update that I've stopped playing for now.  It has made me rethink early access purchases in the future.   I do think that Coral Island has a great deal of potential to be an amazing game.  There has clearly been a lot of thought and love put into it, and at some point may be well worth the price of admission.  I am sincerely hoping that the development team can work out the bugs, re-balance the production and pricing, and finish out the intriguing possibilities in the questlines.   I am looking forward to the marriage and family aspects of the game whenever they get there.  But for now, I cannot recommend buying the game in its current state.   I'd wait for the final release.

So update:  I picked up the game again after the 1.0 release to check out the devs progress.  Hmmmmm.  Well, they improved some things and fleshed out others.  You can get further in the various plot lines than before, and it seems they finally adjusted fishing so that certain fish are only very difficult to catch instead of impossible.  I can tell that pricing and artisan production have also undergone at least some balancing.  It's still a rough go in the beginning for new players.  I was fortunate to start my new game with the cash I'd made during early access play. 
 
The game is still all the positive things I mentioned earlier.  The decorations in the town during certain holidays and at the elaborate festivals are just gorgeous.  It runs smoother as well, although there remain some significant bugs especially on consoles.  However, it is still very much not done.  There are plot lines unfinished, areas inaccessible, dialogue unpolished, dating, marriage, and family aspects not fully developed, the list goes on.   Some of the cut scenes still seem to have no real purpose and the responses your character has the options to make can be ...awkward.  I have made it through my first few seasons and it took until late fall for my farm to start being profitable.  I did have the advantage of not having to worry about initial cash, so it will probably take longer for a new player.   

All this said,  I am going to change my recommendation for purchase from no to yes.   No, it's still not done, despite the ""official"" release.  And yes, they still have a lot of work to do with this game, which I sincerely hope they do in 2024.  But it is a very addictive, very beautiful game with many hours of worthwhile things to do and a few truly shining moments.  My favorite so far being the ""[spoiler}giants[/spoiler]"" attempting to do yoga.  :D  The game is currently on sale for $24, and I think the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of it is worth that price, even though the game isn't finished yet.  If the devs don't bring everything this game could be to fruition, it would be a crime.",1674708555,1704052469,True,0,0,0.623458147048950195,0,True,False,True

However, the game is cute and fun, and as an Indonesian living abroad, the Indonesian theme made me chuckle and missed home. I love Joko and his blangkon, I love the cleaning-the-ocean part, I love the Indonesian festivals and food sneaked in, I love the penjor (decorative bamboo poles) during festivals.

However with that said, there are part of this game that made me roll my eyes thinking the game doesn't know their own identity and too much copying Harvest Moon game, and I don't mean the farming part (OG farmer hat? Hilarious!). For example: 1) the bath house is very Indonesian themed from outside. Weaved bamboo walls, green hot spring, and proboscis monkey watching you in the bath. Ha! But as soon as you get in the building, oh dear.....

Why the katana, geisha picture, etc? Indonesia has a lot of very awesome looking bathhouse or spa in Bali. Where the katana currently sits, I could easily imagine a Balinese statue there. I suggest the developer team go to Bali for the ""inspiration trip"" and relaxation time at the same time. I'm a Japan-o-phile myself and I would be okay with a complete copy of Harvest Moon with Japanese style. However, the developer already did a really great job with all the details and beautiful theme/artwork. I think it would be better if the game sticks to this theme. 

2) The location is a tropical island. It's practically Indonesia. Why is it snowing in Winter? Constant rain or storm would make more sense, no? If the developer hasn't try it, I suggest try playing Dinkum, also in Steam. It's Australian-theme and they stick to the theme weather-wise. Winter doesn't only mean snow! Indonesia also has a subtle change in light and weather condition during our rainy season aka our ""winter"". Please please please use it.

Gamer would find it easier to get lost in the game when the theme is cohesive and the world makes sense. This is how to attract repeat and loyal players.

The romance was a big draw to me, and they do have a large number of choices and it feels like you could replay it a lot to explore the various characters, but the romances felt lackluster and some of them didn't act any different and even seemed indifferent to the player when dating them. Over all, it feels like they rushed the release and still have a lot of elements to polish and add. I hope they keep working on it and updating, cause it could be something really fun in the future, but right now, its just kinda boring and monotonous.

If you are familiar with this type of game (farm, fish, mines, etc), it doesn't do anything completely out of the norm. The fishing mechanic is a bit unsatisfying to me. Diving in the ocean is AMAZING and I love it.
Farming is as expected, but the beginning does feel quite slow. Maybe I'm jaded from learning how to make money early in STV. The cavern is fun and not stressful. I have never died and don't see it happening with the ease of defeating those monsters.
I've gotten to the point that I am making good money, have a boyfriend and am making more friends and offers to the Temple. It's a ton of fun and I've enjoyed all 80+ hours I have put into this game.
That all being said, the game is not fully completed. You can farm to your hearts content and it will not make a difference.

Currently, there are so many game-breaking bugs that I am choosing to delete my game of 8 hours and wait for several of them to be fixed...if they will be. Really, do yourself a favor and read those pages and pages (65 at present) of bugs, complaints, advice, warnings, etc...you get the point. 

The game itself is very beautiful and the soundtrack is pleasing, even after several hours of play. However, the conversations with the townies seem flat and don't engage me at all, and I've no idea why but it is so with many other players. In the same weird way, farming, harvesting, foraging and fishing also seem to me unenjoyable. The festivals are boring, the mini-games are an awful mess and BE WARNED! that the winter festival has a HORRIBLE BUG that will make all your basic tools disappear, yes, as in permanently. Do not place any chest you make too near any buildings or when you upgrade you will lose them, also permanently. 

Possibly the most awful of the game-breaking bugs I've read about is where you will spend massive amounts of time and energy to get yourself married to your preferred character, only to wake up one day and learn that they have nothing left to say to you. Yes, you read that right, as in literally, you will be told they have nothing left to say to you. And it will heartbreakingly continue...and it can and will eventually happen with other townies as well. Now, I don't know about you, but there are other ways in a game to deal with coming to the end of a character's original dialogue. Maybe randomly selecting already heard stuff? What kind of a developing team ever thought that telling a player So-And-Such has nothing more to say to you was a good idea!?!?  Ever hear of rude? How about insulting? Maybe hurtful? Mean? Listen, if my real world wonderful spouse ever said that to me I'd be thinking, ""WHAT!?"" Nevermind day after day. No. No. And NO!!!

Gaming companies need to smarten up and stop releasing their products before the buggy-as-hell play has been sorted out.

This game shouldn't have been out of early access yet.

From spelling mistakes on upgrading items (unlock previous uprgade first!) being the line to what seems to be an introduction of evil (Pufferfish Corp) that doesn't do anything.

There's a lot, I grant you but 10 different fishing spots (not counting the mines) 11 different bug spawn locations that you have to visit if you want to complete the museum.
Next to museum there's offerings to a goddess, cause you're magical.tm and ey you can even turn into a mermaid- thanks Ursula, I mean Cho Oyu.
There's no repercussions no moral dilemma's, you just Farm, Mine/Dive (you either dive in the ocean to clear thrash or go into the mine to clear rocks) with both having their own Copper/Silver/Gold/Osmium resources (Ore and Kelp), Fish or Catch bugs that need to be either put in the museum or offered to the goddess.

there's... a bit of story, some cutscenes seem unnecessary some can be seen as world building.

Oh and supposedly when I met the Merfolk for the first time I was unable to understand them, though the text was plain English.

I want to like it, I just don't.

edit: 
biggest flaws for me:
- Seedlings are trees that you need to water to grow, so plants, these only grow for 2 seasons then they die, making them a bad thing to get without a greenhouse.
-- Saplings are actual trees
- Inability to split stacks of items in inventory
- When shopping and using ""Buy Multiple"" the sound used is considered not an SFX, and if you're going for a large stack you will suffer.
- Auto SFH (Seed/Ferilize/Harvest) has menu's in menu's and are clunky as heck to use)",1703900862,1703936886,False,5,0,0.527616918087005615,0,True,False,False

Longer explanation: Obviously this kind of game lends itself to ""inclusion"" of people that can be otherwise excluded from life and things in general. It does a good job of including all kinds of people and age ranges. The game is a cross between Animal Crossing and The Sims games. More detailed and difficult than than Animal Crossing; but in some ways not as detailed as the Sims. Not quite a fair comparison to The Sims since the The Sims is not a farming game. That being said there is a lot of detail in this game and I found the ""Halloween"" activity to be very enjoyable and you can tell the makers put a lot of love into the details at the activity. The game still has some bugs. For example: I did have an odd thing happened where I was locked in the craft menu and I could do anything so I had to restart the game which meant I lost all that I had done within that day. Which brings me to my biggest complaint is that you can't save the game whenever you want. The game is saved when your character goes to sleep. So I have gone to sleep at times to make sure I don't loose my progress if something significant happened that day which meant I also lost a full day of stuff I could have done. Have played for over 30 hours so far and I have really enjoyed the game; particularly the romance mechanic since it is fun to see if you can get a character to become your significant other. There is a good portion of the map that is ""fogged"" out. If the fogged out area represents the full map that gets revealed as you play than the full map is huge. Also besides the bugs there is room for improvement for example the NPC only reveal a few things that that like and just keep repeating what they like rather than revealing other things they like as you talk to them. You have to do a lot of talking with them before you even scratch the surface of what they like so it becomes a guessing game and there is no way to ask them what they like either. But besides any negatives I have mentioned I would buy the game again (if I had too); because I have enjoyed it that much. oh one more thing the game does not hold your hand and tell you how things work; but thankfully there is info on the internet.",1703919901,1703919901,True,1,0,0.522332549095153809,0,True,False,False

The game has a really great art style that's similar to Animal Crossing and the character portraits in dialog remind me of Disney characters it looks super nice!

QUICK PROS
- Has everything from Stardew that's good.
- Has a museum system and bug collecting and fishing!
- 24 Love interests!! (And it seems you don't need to date in order to progress in the game!)
- Huge island to explore, though at the costs that it sometimes feels like a drag to get somewhere. (Rarely though)
- Has a good message about oil spills and polution, thoughhhh most people I would assume don't care for that.
- Good character customization
- Music is great
- Sound Design is great
- The characters within the town are really interesting. I like encountering that 2 out of 5 men are looksmaxing and on the mewing grindset when you talk to them.

QUICK CONS
- Has the bad Stardew mining system where you mine rocks and pray RNG will give you a exit before you lose all your energy.
- A lot of things are not polished. For example, exiting a area with music will simply just stop the music. There is no fade to nothingness. Fish will pop out of nowhere while fishing which is awkward. Some animations don't loop correctly or clip into other models.
- Bug Catching feels a bit awkward thanks to perspective and the range you are given for when a bug can detect you.
- The lack of head shape customization is a bit disappointing.

Summary

I would honestly pick up the game if it's on sale or at full price. If you aren't sure you can always try out gamepass and play it a bit there while supporting the developers. I hope in the next updates some of the cons are fixed/revisited.",1703871566,1703871566,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coral Island is a very different take on a Farming RPG. The PC has history there, the town and its stretch of Ocean have been heavily polluted with oil and trash... Heck, the cause of the spill and pollution wants to turn the town into an oil town even though it was a paradisical tourist town before. So you've got your work cut out for you, especially considering that the NPC's of Starlet town and environs depend on you to help turn things around.

[b]It's good[/b]
Coral Island plays phenominally well on PC, though there's the occasional bug still to be squished. Taking a leaf from Stardew Valley, the game both respects the player's time and strives to keep things interesting in unexpected ways. Without spoiling too much, there's Merfolk and other non-humans, you can increase the base quality of crop seeds and things, you do have to clear a literal metric ton of trash away and you can research/craft/etc. a lot of tools to make your farming efforts easier. Also, you can choose different styles for your house and adopt lots of pets.

[b]The gripes are mostly minor[/b]
The game does sometimes have a bug or two, but the devs are hard at work fixing them. So my only major gripe (so far, y1-s3 at time of writing) is that ore is rare in the mines and most exit hiding stones give you nothing in return for the spent stamina. A lesser gripe is that some of the skills/boons you can obtain, like Rock Domino, are useless in practice. And another is the fact you don't have much choice in character creation in terms of facial features. A bigger gripe is that not all npc's have all their dialogue or romance options implemented, especially merfolk. 1.0 release is a bit of a lie.

It's solid, but I haven't been able to figure out what really sets it apart from the rest of the genre.  It just seems like a straight-up Stardew Valley knockoff with more supernatural elements, and I've never really enjoyed the supernatural angle in these games.  Even Stardew built on Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons' foundation, it wasn't just a straight clone.

The ""cleaning up the island"" thing would be a very cool hook if it felt like they did more with it, but as it stands, Portia/Sandrock did more with that in terms of you actually doing something.  Instead, you just leave offerings (the Community Center from SV crossed with the Harvest Goddess from HM), dive into the mine with something good happening at floor 40 of each area, donate to the museum, and clear trash in the ocean to activate relics that clean the ocean for you, and the improvements just sort of happen on their own once you do get a certain amount of ""town points"" for doing those.  The diving is pretty weak too, it's not appreciably different from the mines except you use the sickle instead of a pick.  Using kelp for permanent passive upgrades to seeds and crop quality is cool, though.

Character-wise, the LGBTQ representation is obviously great (the character artist clearly favored the G part more than I'd personally prefer, but that's not a flaw, just not my personal orientation, and even that may say more about what I generally expect male/female character designs to look like), but none of the characters feel like they have much personality to me, and several of the designs kind of blend together.  It doesn't help that despite the 1.0 release, it's clearly not ""finished"" finished.

Overall, like I said, it's solid, and I haven't stopped playing yet, but I can't tell if I actually like it or if I'm just addicted to the gameplay loop.  Another recent Steam review said ""I wish there was a Neutral option,"" and that's kind of where I'm at too.

If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon series before they had to split into Spirit of Seasons (Which is the original name) .. You'll enjoy this! It's like a tropical version.

The game is.. Mmm. .It feels polynesian more than Hawaiian. It reminds me of home though. 
The npcs form groups that feel dynamic.. The town actually has schedules including work schedules without the feeling of robots. 
The Music.. oh god the music. It sets the tone so well! That person gets #1 raise in my books. 
Farming is fast animations without feeling choppy, they flow and can get faster with trinkets or food boosts.
Crafting is simple, there's a global chest for doing it.. 
Merchant is .. cutthroat in a way that makes you think he's smart. 
Personality of the characters makes you love or hate them all the same.. 
There's a karen named Karen which you love to hate. 
.. There's underwater adventures. .. Okay so this part's a bit bulky at first but they capture the true essence of being in a tropical coral reef down there..
Alot of Eco themes and actual knowledge from islanders give it an informative feel. 
The date-able people are fucking hot, on both sides. 
The Elementary school teacher is a big guy.. with a robotic arm. 
Instead of spirits you get polynesian Giants.

----------------------------



I very much love this more Asian twist on the farming sim. I love all the characters and enjoy that I can play this at a much slower pace than most other faming sims, built-in. I like how the game looks, and all the different aspects of gameplay, like the ocean areas and the multitudes of mini games during events!

I like how the fishing minigame is played. Not too challenging, but not too simple either. The battle in the mines aren't particularly tough, and the sfx can be rather unsatisfying, but I don't think that combat really is the focus of the game. Personally, I enjoy this.

I can't wait to see more of what the game can offer with the full release, I'm so very excited and really happy with my current playthrough thus far (middle of Spring of the first year) and I'm just looking forward to more.

From Harvest Moon to Stardew Valley, from My Time in Portia to Animal Crossing, I have found these games to be a worthy distraction that, sadly and eventually, causes me to run out of steam. 

Coral Island is deeply entrenched in the farming (you inherit a farm and you have to keep it running) and dating (you have a plethora of singles to choose from and they're all hot), but it also comes with an important message: pollution and what one can do to make things better. Sure, the solutions are far from reality (hey. it's a game), but the first time my character took a dive into the ocean, I was surprised by how disgusted I felt when I saw the ocean floor so horribly littered with garbage, as far as my GPU can draw.

Time and again I find myself losing myself in this game WITHOUT experiencing that anxiety attack so familiar to anyone who played games like this (Have I missed an important date? Does cooking recipe A make love interest No.14 go off and burn down the entire village? Did I water the plants yesterday? Did I feed the animals?).

The single most disappointing aspect to the full release, on Steam, is that IT IS MISSING DETAIL and NOT FINISHED. There are so many dialog moments that are blank,  or out of context. Gameplay is unbalanced. Overall shoddy work. I can't recommend the game until it's fixed. For those on XBOX the situation is so much worse - the game is completely unreliable with crashes and disappearing game saves. The Dev response to the numerous valid complaints is pitiful. They need to eat a big slice of humble pie and ""announce"" a well-considered apology, shut down the xbox game until it's fixed AND offer some decent compensation - either a full refund OR inGame collector items or such for those who will hang in and wait. 

[b]Review edited @ 172 hours[/b]

Shortly after posting my first review @ 47.7 hours --- my experience changed. My response back then to the questions: [i]Would I recommend this game? [/i] was ""Yes, for some people"", and ""No, for others (me)...

I was showing the game to a friend when the game action turned a corner and got a bit more interesting. YES I'm really enjoying the game, although I've reached the ""early access"" limitations of certain items not yet implemented. This is an EDIT of my first review, which highlights some of my early frustration... that disappeared after levelling up. It probably helped that I ""relaxed"" my expectation :-)
[hr][/hr]
I'm more an ""occasional"" gamer than a daily or even weekly enthusiast so I found starting out a bit non-intuitive. Initially I fumbled around Coral Island's beautifully detailed environment a bit lost. I tried out the ""tools"" and mostly ignored the ""residents"" since the conversational interaction seemed shallow, limited... early-access version perhaps? I wasted time and resources and didn't learn much. See my ""getting started"" tips in ""guidelines"".

However, once I did engage with the residents, a story unfolded which helped to steer me into the game's objectives. So far these seem rather linear but the developer's ""roadmap"" on future content suggests what we're seeing now is merely an interactive snapshot of the full game. As many others have pointed out the current game [i]setting[/i] is similar to ""Stardew Valley"", which I found too pixelly, it seems more a hybrid of Animal Crossing and the Sims (to me). The similarity to Animal Crossing includes a diversity of characters to engage with plus collectable items to craft, sell or donate to the ""museum"". The difference is the characters are human, not animals, and many are ""romanceable"" like The Sims... I've not yet discovered where this leads? But winning-hearts with any of the characters brings rewards.

The graphics in Coral Island however are delightful in their detail, it's a luxurious and exotic setting. I've rather enjoyed spending an in-game-afternoon/evening just exploring the island's features and following NPCs antics. 

Levelling up introduced more compelling Quests where I came to ""accept"" the tedium of performing the  [i]idle-tap[/i] tasks needed to fulfil them. Overall the bar is not set too high, the balance is pretty good. At this stage Coral Island offers many-hours of light-hearted easy-gaming, so [b]I can recommend the early access version of Coral Island as reasonably satisfying from that perspective[/b], although the interaction is somewhat limited and there's little demand of your creative input other than choosing your clothing and organising the layout of your farm.

In my first review I did find the idle-tap tasks a bit of a grind, but it makes more sense as you level up.  The exchanges with various characters did develop as I levelled-up – they drop important hints re. their interests, and since I'm now into my second year I'm now pursuing the task of getting to know the characters better. 

So there it is... at first I thought, ""not for me"" since I found it just a bit too banal. BUT now, I'm looking forward to future updates and hoping they deliver a bit more oomph.",1676370849,1703719928,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

""No, we have Stardew Valley at home.""

To anyone saying, ""Stardew Valley was based on Story of Seasons, etc, etc, etc, ""this is just another iteration"", well yes but also no. Want me to prove it? Fine.

Remember the stone staircases from Stardew that allowed you to skip levels in the mines? They required an insane amount of stone? Right, well those exist here, except they're called ""Rope."" Guess what you make those ropes out of? You guessed it, a ton of stone... stone rope, it's so much better than regular rope! Please let how that came to be a thing in this game sink in. 

The true issues with this game, however, are not how it is alike SDV but how it is unalike. The hitboxes for tool usage are awful, and you'll spend more time than you care to imagine trying to not select a scarecrow while harvesting your crops. You'll also run back and forth innumerable times trying to get the hit box to select the proper crop, etc. This is frustration is compounded by the fact that you are penalized (lose energy) for missed strikes... say your hit box is off and you accomplish nothing whatsoever with your axe/pick/etc swing, yes, you still lose energy.

But wait, that's not all! Remember how in SDV, and in every game like it, you're penalized with a hospital bill/etc for passing out/expending all of your energy? Seems reasonable. Sure, fine. In this game? Oh, you get that bill, but not before you spend the entire day (however much is left of it) unable to do literally anything. Let's say, for instance, that you expend all of your energy by 11am, and one of those accidental misfires of a tool puts you in at 0 energy. You don't black out and wake up the next morning to Harvey standing over you with a glint in his eye, salivating over your bill, no, you get to wander around town unable to speak to anyone, unable to open any doors, yes this includes your house... you can walk to your house from the entire map away but you're too tired to open the doorknob to your house to fall asleep. Whoever designed this is either malicious, incompetent, or both. Why would you want to make a player sit through this? Because remember, just like SDV, the game only saves when you sleep.

Okay... onto other issues. Want to sell a few pieces of wood to cover the cost of an upgrade at the carpenter? Whoops, you clicked the wrong button (the easiest to click btw/your normal action button) and you've sold the entire stack. Want to undo that sell? No. Did you get a warning message that you're selling more than one item? No.

Can you sprint? Sure, but only for 1 second spurts. Does it take energy? No. Can I spam it? Sure, but you'll need to keep clicking the button over again. Why isn't this just sprint? Because we hate you, that's why. 

Joja Mart is back in town, wait, I mean an oil company... they've come to corporate your town, but don't worry the nature spirits are there to help you resist them... Pierre, I mean Sam wants you to grow more vegetables so he can sell local, find the holes in the mine to advance to deeper levels, Don't forget to check the community tasks board... is it in the community center? No, it's right next to Pierre's, I mean Sam's.

The fishing mini game is the worst thing I've ever experienced, apart from maybe this game's sack game mini race. You fall down even when you don't mess up. Yeah... 

This is a joyless remake... it's too similar to call it an homage, and rather than introduce qol improvements, it introduces the opposite.

Okay... I am going to say a few nice things... because I feel like it's important to recognize this games, albeit, few achievements. 

The diving/undersea exploration is pretty nifty. Other games have done this to an extent, but I genuinely appreciate that it's 1) another biome, 2) you have an established reason/motive for being down there--saving the island's fragile/devastated eco system. 

The 2d artwork is pretty great, and I appreciate how, seemingly (I haven't delved very far into it yet), they included a relatively diverse interior decoration system--ala Animal Crossing. The island is vibrant and lush and the design is pretty involved. 

I'm not recommending this game, for the above reasons, but I will grant it this: it is playable, and I have not as yet experienced any bugs or glaring issues like save game corruption, etc. It's pretty solid.  

UPDATE: Additional axes to grind. 

ALL of the minigames are universally miserable and depend on RN Jesus to ""take the wheel."" Whoever designed these should be thrown in a gulag. 

Though I've no issues on my own desktop, my wife has experienced regular freezes and CTD on her machine every time she attempts to leave the ocean/diving area transitioning back to the dock. 

If you make the god awful mistake of placing chests in your home, apparently, there is no way to remove them. If you pick or axe them as you would outside nothing happens. It doesn't matter if the chest is empty, it still doesn't work. There is no way, seemingly, to accomplish this from the interior design mode feature either. So enjoy those tier 1 trash chests you churned out to accommodate your pitiful inventory early game because you'll have them for the rest of the play-through. 

I've begun to notice a trend... all of the cut-scenes are tear-jerkingly boring, as though they were written by AI. They lack any substance or nuance, absolutely no personality bleeds through on the part of the characters you interact with  and the pacing is all off. It feels uniformly drawn out and insufferably dull. I don't like or dislike a single character in this entire game because they're all so insufferably boring to interact with. The closest you get to a personality is Li being excited about your diving discoveries, or maybe Leah treating you with the same level of disdain/disgust that Haley would have. It's bad. 

The more I play this the more I come to grips with the fact that this is a loveless, tedious remake of SDV with absolutely no innovation whatsoever. The art design continues to be the only decent thing about this game.

Yes. Yes it is. Some of the charackters have very well known arcs and issues but there are some things are not that common: conflicts between children and parents about their way of life, money issues in higher ages, the feeling of not-being at home at you own home and so on.

I love the ranching part as well.  another big plus on the game is the message about recycling, reusing trash, and cleaning up the environment/ocean etc...   my favorite part of the game though is cleaning the ocean and meeting the mer folk.    
the only part i don't like is the movement wasd method.  i see what others have pointed out about how some things seem undone but the developers are still updating and working hard so that doesn't bother me.  over all this game is fantastic!  9/10 at least.  heading to 10/10.",1703702102,1703702102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many bugs still exist in the game and I have gotten 'stuck' multiple times in festivals and in npc cutscenes. The frustrating part of this is that the game only saves at the beginning of the day so if I did anything before the festival or cutscene I have effectively lost that progress.

There is no progression for the merfolk and no way to split stacks in inventory. After a certain point, there is no more progression on shrines which is one of the main collectables. Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot to do but the game still feels like early access rather than a full fledged 1.0 release. The game is good, the soundtrack is idyllic, and a lot of the people you can meet on the island have great storylines even if they aren't necessarily romanceable which I really appreciate.

Its still in early access. There are many problems that exist. Missing content, incomplete content, bugs, crashing, etc. The game is maybe 60% complete. By time i realized this It was too late for me to refund.

You wont be able to complete the story because its not done. The merfolk kingdom and related content like datables are not finished. The giants and related content are not done. Notes that help you know what the townspeople like/dislike arent in the game. You will encounter game breaking bugs, there is a high chance you will lose your save file.

Theres too much of an agenda the devs are trying to push here, Its pointless to go into specifics because it affects everyone differently. Me personally, i dont much care for agendas in the video games i play.
The characters are all so generic and forgettable its sad. They ALL have 0 personality, whoever is responsible for the characters writing needs to take a page from other farm sims and just start over from scratch.
Almost all of the datable men are super fit with 6 packs and attractive, while almost all of the datable women are average looking at best. For a game promoting an agenda it doesnt take much to see the double standards. This bs doesnt belong in a video game.

This game is mostly a complete stardew valley clone, like to the point of plagiarism, and i dont mean that by copying the farming sim genre, i mean almost everything is point for point stardew valley. Not harvest moon, not sun haven. The problem i have with this is generally if your going to copy someone elses work you should at least try and match the feel of that game or make it better. Coral island does neither. Its a soulless game with prettier visuals.

At least the new paintjob via the graphics department is a nice improvement but everything else? The music is boring and uninspired, the townspeople are boring and say weird combinations of things that just dont make sense, theres no consistency or cohesion. Coral island never makes your feel like your part of the town, it actually feels like your playing a game and the townspeople have been taken over by aliens learning how to act human. 

Stardew had a jamming soundtrack with songs i still remember to this day. The townsfolk and datables were all more ""alive"" and interesting. The pacing of stardew was better. EVERYTHING about stardew valley is better except for the graphics.

If you dont encounter a game breaking bug you'll get a lot of hours out of this game. Coral Island is what you get when the kid behind you copies the answers off your test but copies them wrong and gets a bad grade.",1700712925,1703458088,False,0,0,0.458811283111572266,0,True,False,False

I'd give the game a thumbs up and say it is worth buying but I would give that suggestion with some reserve.  The game is now ""released"" and you need to know it is not a complete game.  There is a fair deal in the game that is not finished.  No, it is not like the stuff is completed and waiting for a DLC to expand on it.  It is flat out incomplete.

For example you can have children in game but they do not grow up.  I consider that complete.  Them growing up can be a future DLC or patch or something.  However things like the merfolk who are in game are incomplete.  You meet them, they show up in the list of people you meet, but you can not gain any affinity with them and none of them ever really seem to have anything to say.  They really seem to have no purpose in the game (outside of some story line progressing) and there is no real reason for them to even be in the game as it is.  This is an incomplete addition to the game and one of many examples where I say the game is still in beta and is not ready to be called a ""release"" game.  Can't have an entire ""city"" in the game with mostly nothing to do in it and call the game complete.

So with that said, buy the game if you like farming sims, it is still enjoyable as that.  But it seems like the game is only 80% finished so understand it is not a complete game in any sense.  Buy the game as a beta game and consider it early access, because that is what it is.  And being it is only 80% complete I suggest only buying it at 80% price or lower if you can.  Pay for what you are getting and not what they are promising you will come later.

Example of things that are incomplete: (maybe the devs will read so they can get some ideas on what needs to be worked on)

Sprinkler attachments:  Only works sometimes.  Seeds it is better at and gets most of the time but fertilizer, it is 50/50.  You always have to check to see if it did what it was supposed to.  I have never, repeat never, had it add fertilizer to every patch.  I always need to clean up after it.

Auto Chest:  Another 50/50 addition to the game.  Works awesome 3 or 4 days in a row and then suddenly stops working.  Leaves completed items in the machine and you need to fetch them yourself.  Does not reload machines when it has materials.  Only used 2 of the 4 aging barrels.  You get it, they never work completely.

Speech:  3 times I had someone refer to me as ""PlayerName"".  Macy on more then one occasion has told me how much she loves being married to me.  While sweet, my actual wife Lily might be upset about that.  Lily one morning asked me what she should bring to the fair tomorrow when the fair was next week.

Cut Scenes:  Only happened once but still.  When the town reached rank A I had the big cut scene to celebrate reaching rank A.  About 7 days later I had the same exact cut scene celebrating the town reaching rank A.  Didn't we do this already?

Writing:  It seems at times it is incomplete or they hired an overly emotional teenager with no real life experience to write the parts.  For example in one cut scene Leah professes her love for me and I am given two options to reply.  Option one, I feel the same and option two, I don't feel the same.  There is no option 3 that there really should have been one for, even more so that when asked this from her I was already married.  When I say I only want to be friends she runs off crying.  Where is the third option, you know the one that should be in game because I've been married to Lily for 2 seasons.  One that says something along the lines of ""I really like you but I love my spouse.""  Now you see why I said a child wrote the options.  No adult option to let the person down easy.  Not convinced?  Many times in cut scenes you are asked things to give your response and the only options you are given are disrespectful answers or smart ass answers.  Like one with mark and a dog, your only 2 options are be rude and be really rude, how about one to be supportive of someone trying to help a stray?  Only crappy disrespectful answers that a kid trying to sound ""cool"" would give.

Speaking of writing:  Every errand you do gets the responce ""Thank you.""  Seriously?  You could not write a few random responses for it and cycle through them?  Back to letting the kid write this?  Where is the, ""I've been looking for this"" or the ""I can now make the soup I've been craving"", ""... build the trap to catch that butterfly"", ""... make the wine"", etc, you get the idea.  Something instead of a basic and bland ""thank you"" every single time would be nice. 

Basically writing as a whole is incomplete and not completely proofed.  Also letting an editor look over it would have told you some responses are just completely lifeless. The writing is basic and incomplete in a great many parts of the game.

NPCs:  There are so many that have nothing to say.  If they have nothing to say stop with showing me there is something to say.  Nothing more annoying them clicking to talk to someone and getting ""they have nothing more to say"" or ""you don't understand what they are saying""  If they have nothing to say or I don't understand what they have to say do not give the speech option at all.  You are wasting the players time and no one likes that.

Useless areas:  The deep forest with the monkey.  Outside of finding some scavenables and a lot of hardwood it has no reasons to be there.  It is completely unfinished.  The peak at the top you can get to somewhat early breaking the boulder.  I've run up it at least 30 times.  Nothing to pick on the ground, no insects to capture, can't even fish off the edge, why is it there?  The dungeons in the ocean?  Maybe I just missed something but what the hell is its purpose?  Just to collect more trash once you clean up the ocean?  

Pet peeve time:  We live on an island with the dirtiest most disrespectful of the environment type of people on the face of the earth.  I clean the beach, it is dirty the next day.  I clean the ocean, the next day it is cluttered with water bottles and tires and all sorts of trash.  How the F do these people produce that much garbage every single day?  We do no need those ocean dungeons when the pigs on the island will make sure there is always garbage all over the place.  Seriously, once you open the otherwise useless ocean dungeons trash should stop appearing in the ocean and on the beach.  At least that would give those dungeons some reason to exsist, even if a lame one.

There is more incomplete about the game, but just wanted to point out some of the larger ones I've noticed.

There are numerous activities to engage in, providing hours of enjoyable gameplay. While some reviews suggest that the game is still incomplete, reaching that point would require a ton of gameplay hours, which wasn't a major concern for me.

I went into Coral Island with clear expectations, seeking a cozy and relaxing gaming experience, and that's precisely what I got. However, there are a few notable aspects that deserve attention:

1) The main quest is repetitive, often requiring the player to perform the same activity multiple times.
2) The combat system is relatively weak.
3) There are minor bugs and glitches, but they are not game-breaking. For instance, I encountered issues where my furniture and livestock multiplied randomly in quantity.
4) The world feels somewhat small.

Despite these points, it's a good game if you're in search of an experience akin to Stardew Valley.

This game is a mixture of Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. And I love those 3 with passion.

You know what else that made me love Coral Island even more?....

It has Indonesian food, aesthetic and a bit of the culture, too, in it. I'm an Indonesian by blood (US citizen now since 2016), whom hasn't gone back to Jakarta since I moved to the US in 2008. And this game makes me miss home, my family, and friends. 

It was a surprise that this game was made by Indonesians. I didn't know about it until I started noticing NPCs' names and seeing Batik in the game. So, I looked up the developers. 

I had the game on game pass earlier this morning. Now it's almost midnight. And the game is now on my Steam library (I prefer to have my games on Steam, instead of Xbox).

However, the game felt very mismanaged during early access, leading to it being released 1.0 while missing major content. The devs almost doubled the price to catch the holiday sale number, with an unfinished game. That alone can tell you more about the project than anything else I'm going to say.

But besides being unfinished, the game feels lacking in many crucial aspects that are not easily fixed. The writing for instance is subpar. Many key characters I was excited about don't really have any character arc. Take Kenny and Rafael, for example. (Some early spoilers, be warned.) From the moment you meet them, you know they are nice guys. But after several personal events about them, and more than halfway through their heart progression, what more have you learned about them? Nothing. They are still nice guys without any nuances. Their stories are focused entirely on something besides their personalities. I still don't know why Rafael wants to forge this magic hammer, or why Kenny wants to decipher this scroll. It feels completely random. Compare this to Stardew Valley, you learn so much about each character's motivations and dreams, and you see their growth with your own eyes.

The game also fails to capture the gravity of ecosystem problems. Basically all you need to do in the game is to find some kind of magic altar, donate random plants to the goddess, and the ecosystem is fixed? It sends a wrong kind of message. Oh the goddess will revitalize the island, and the mermaids will fix the oil spillage. No? Lessening damage done to the ecosystem requires knowledge and a lot of work. It's not easy and not ""magical"". I almost wish they haven't put the focus of the game on this topic, when they aren't capable of getting it right.

One last thing, the game classified tomatoes as fruit. Tomatoes are the fruit part of the plant, just like cucumbers, pumpkins, chili peppers. But if you try to classify it in a culinary sense (fruits vs. vegetables vs. grains), it's a vegetable. This ""tomatoes are actually fruits"" thing needs to die. It's a misunderstanding of the double meanings of the word ""fruit"". Literally unplayable.",1703335415,1703335415,False,22,3,0.625771105289459229,0,True,False,False

But as it stands I must say it does feel like they took stardew valley and did a face lift on it. I love stardew valley and was hoping for much more, also the mini games are honestly super boring or so hard due to both the mechanics and the game creators not having the idea of how some of the mini games even work. And also the RNG of some of the games, for instance I am currently as I am writing this on my 15th try in a row of getting 410 points in the smash the skull game during the Halloween event, now yes its just a mini game so move on? Well yes and no this game is super grindy to the point it forces you to get first place in these events to level the town. so when the first place is getting 420 points and because it wastes the first 2-3 seconds out of the 20 you have giving you nothing to work with it is so damn frustrating since you cant even start over if you get F'd over in the first round, you must wait a full minute before trying again. Also the ring toss mini game is BS how do you play it? How would anyone know since there is zero instructions. I had to play practice mode 3 times before I kinda understood wtf was going on. 

As it goes I plan to play the game all the way through I should be about halfway ish in the game.

You slowly cultivate your large but rundown farm. You plant and reap, sell and process. You can also fish and catch bugs and scavenge numerous resources. You mine and descent deeper and deeper into the mine where you find not just resources but also monsters and ancient secrets. You clean the sea from garbage and discover secrets even deeper. And you also get to know the local people, form relationships and even find love. I personally find this game a mix of Garden Paws, bit of Harvestella and a bit of The Sims. But with a bit of more and a special warm touch. 
Few negatives: 
Saving the game is possible only by going to sleep and end your day. Not very convenient.
When moving structures around your farm you cannot move your building ""just a bit right"". You can only move it to an empty space, so fine positioning may require few days and a lot of patience. 
Pets don't really have options to interact and they are basically just stuck indoors or in pet bed if you have one.

I bought the game after the 1.0 update. The game was advertised as a finished game, the price increase was meant to reflect this.
However, the game very much still feels like a WIP title; some areas in the world are not fleshed out (Merfolk Kingdom) some are straight-up empty and clearly still in development (path north of the town), the dialogue is repetitive and shallow (bordering to non-sensical in some cases), the heart events for the NPCs feel lifeless and are not able to give the characters substance, the combat is not engaging and feels like it was an after-after-thought.
But most of all, the game has a multitude of bugs and crashes which I'm not going to list here (the subreddit and steam forums provide a good overview). [strike]The worst one IMO is that talking to your spouse after marrying them causes the game to crash (it doesn't matter who you married either, apparently)[/strike] Edit: they fixed the spouse crash.

However, despite the official release of version 1.0, it seems like they rushed it. The game still has some issues, and it doesn't feel polished; it's more like an improved test version rather than a final release.

Here are the aspects I appreciate:

1. *Transport System:* I absolutely love it. Once you unlock the transporters, it easier to navigate between different locations without constant running.

2. *Graphics:* The visual style is fantastic. The game's cuteness and vibrant colors, along with details, make it visually appealing. 

3. *Characters:* All the characters are so cool, and I find it challenging to choose a spouse among the charming bachelors and bachelorettes. The character designs are fantastic, although I haven't experienced many character events to comment on the stories.

4. *Character Map:* The feature displaying the characters' positions on the map is awesome! I've always missed this in other games.

5. *Ocean Cleaning Theme:* The concept of cleaning the ocean and constructing things with trash is great.

6. *Create Stuff*: Crafting things without having everything right there is great! Specially bombs in the mines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the flip side, here are my concerns:

1. *Random Crashes:* The game can crashes randomly, which is frustrating. Losing progress, especially after achieving something rare, can be annoying.

2. *Translation Issues:* There are some translation missing in dialogues, and some character images are missing on the sea map.

3. *Animations:* The animations need improvement. They currently fall short of expectations..

4. *Lack of Challenge:* The game lacks in challenge. Completing the mines quickly due to easy monsters and simple strategies makes it less fun.. It needs more difficulty to maintain interest.

5. *Ocean Cleaning Challenge:* The ocean cleaning activity lacks depth and becomes monotonous. More variety in events, dialogues with animals, or additional challenges would enhance the experience. Just find the gem and follow the glowing path is boring.

6: *Create Stuff* I really like the idea. But it would be even better if it's possible to use the stuff in the chests at the shops too. Why do I have to bring the items to the carpenter,when normally I can craft everything I want without have the items in the bag?

In summary, the game feels unbalanced concerning purchasing items, receiving rewards, earning in-game money, and combat. While the game is functional, I believe it's not yet ready for purchase.

I would fully recommend this game as Early Access, but I can't recommend this as a full release game because it isn't one. This should have stayed in early access for another year at least with all the issues the game has right now on top of the fact that it's incomplete. I'm not sure I can even call the game half finished with how much content is missing and unpolished. 

While the team is very open about what they're working on in the official discord, the developer diaries are Concerning. Nothing that is in their task list is something that should still be there for a full release game: game models, textures and animations are still being worked on, NPC romance scenes are still being worked on, basic music and sound effects are still being worked on. They didn't finish the heart scene scripts for the merfolk until December 12th, and there's no telling if they're working on implementing those because there's no more merfolk topics in the dev diary now. 

I think if they were set on the November release, the game would have benefited greatly from being released in a chapter/season pass system with content about the giants, the goddess, your farm and the town being chapter one, ocean content being chapter two, and savanna content being chapter three. At least then we would have at least one completely polished aspect of the game and it wouldn't feel like the publisher is trying to scam people.

It's incomplete and i'm not blaming the studio or the devs for the rushed release because that's how it always is in the industry. But like I said, the game is incomplete, there's still many bugs although none are game breaking just annoying and there's too many things that have yet to be implemented in the game. It's frustrating because IT IS an absolutely beautiful game that has the same spirit as Stardew Valley but right now it feels absolutely unrewarding. It's nothing but a massive grind and it gets boring fast once you're done cleaning the ocean and going through the mines. I was especially excited for the many dateable characters but it's so hard to make a real connection with any of them and most of them are so damn boring. Take Raj for exemple, the man has to mention coffee in every dialogue. Like we get it, can we talk about something else ? And the few cutscenes we get barely involves our character. There's so many things to unpack like how boring the mines are and how there's so many zones we don't have access to because it hasn't been implemented yet. The monsters in the mines are a joke and there's absolutely no challenge there. And yeah you're there to grind for some ore but you can go a few levels without even encountering a single one which is pretty frustrating... Also for the clothing, every single hat will make your character bald.

Performance is worse than it was during Early Access even when I have the recommended system requirements. This does not bother me as much as it should. Some people in the official discord have it way worse though. 

Romancing a dateable character feels uncanny due to the lack of dialogue and general things you would expect. Also, looked forward to romancing the merfolk but that feature has been locked after EA. 

Some cutscenes have been omitted due to dialogue bugs. Which adds to the uncanny nature. 

The farming aspect is great and I have been having fun investing time into learning how to do things like ranching, catching bugs and more recently fishing. Diving and the merfolk story is fun until it lasts (as it is also unfinished).      

This release was clearly rushed. The Devs haven't given reasons as to why they did this since it was initially hinted at a 2024 release. We could make assumptions why but there hasn't been an official statement yet.

The island, the mermaids, the people and their stories, THE MERMAIDS, the cute animals and great farming and of course the underwater part with MERMAIDS!!!!

HOWEVER.
There are a few bugs and details in the story that just make it hard for me sometimes. I think the worst thing for me is how loveless the cutscenes feel. I get that some do not contain the players presence to show how life on the island goes on - even if we aren't part of it. Those are great and I appreciate them. BUT the ones where we partake, especially the later heart scenes just feel weird?? Like nothing in these scenes makes me feel like I form a bond with the characters. Nothing even insinuates that they started to develop feelings for me until I ""proposed"" and gave them a locket. Then the heartscene before marriage arrives - absolutely wonderful (go for Mark because HOLY F). And then? No cute interactions? No further dates? Nothing? Why? I am DATING them. They said they liked me. Why does it not feel like that? At all? Where is the worry Mark has for the player being safe IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK TO ME SOMETIMES?
And why is this a supposed full release if there is no completed story?

It's just really sad because I play games like these primarily for the villager interactions. And they just have no consequences for my life on the island at all. Even after being married my partner can stop talking to me or get angry for no reason. What is that supposed to be about? 
Also, the thought that all those issues will be fixed one day just for me to have to restart the game because I did not get to experience those improved things...frustrating.

I love the game but I have to think of it as early access. This is not a full experience. Play it if you wish (and have fun bc it is really fun!) but do keep in mind that it can be disheartening at times.",1703029807,1703029807,True,27,1,0.750980257987976074,0,True,False,False

So many aspects that would make it seam so much fun.  But it isn't.  I want to love you Coral Island, but I'm bored.  I'll wait till the EA is over.

1.84 Review: I had originally played this game on the Steam Deck, and although I found it boring, I had no issues with lag or in-game bugs.  But now the game has been officially released and I wanted to give it another try.  Well the game is much less boring but I still can't recommend it because the lag is harsh.  I lowered all the epic settings to ""not even pretty anymore"" and still froze or walked facing only one way and no dash.  So I decided to try it on PC.  And after the waiting forever for it to download and update, I was finally able to play it on my computer.  And it played great... I was really having a great time.  

And that brings us today:  back to facing one direction walking and no dash.  But when I stop playing is when my little person tip-toeing like she was holding the bug net (even though the pick ax was highlighted on the tool belt) and when I finally made it home from the blacksmith, I couldn't open the front door and I had to wait 2 in-game hours for 2am to auto send me to bed.

Context:
I have been playing this since it was still in early access, and I'm surprised that the two bugs that made this unplayable are still here. First, is the bug that doesn't allow you to start the seasonal festivals. I come within the time frame, only to not be able to partake. Secondly, When you stay underwater till the time limit, you cannot interact with any of your items, crops, or your house. It's almost as if your player character doesn't exist, because nothing in the game reacts to you when you approach. I'd like to give this a better score after I've gotten through the game, but ONLY if these bugs get patched out.

That said, despite being listed as a fully released game, it's far from complete. There are unlockable areas that aren't accessible. Once you complete the merfolk quest line you can't speak to any of them or access the shops. The mechanics for marriage and building a family aren't complete.

But I am worried that they consider this full release when it is clearly early access, and again, that is just a deceitful way to go about selling this game.
 
Since they consider it full release, does that mean they are cash grabby and planning to start charging people for DLC to complete the game like many other farming sim developers end up doing? Since they consider it full release, does that mean they think the game is fine as is and just plan to put out small updates and bug fixes going forward? Because that is just not enough and if that is the plan the game is not worth $30, or really worth my time. 
What they have here is promising, and leaves you wanting more. But frustrating when you grind to hit a certain goal and realize it feels underwhelming and unfinished.

There are is a story for pretty much everything you do, even if it isn't done quite yet. The devs certainly seem up to the challenge, but the game has ended up much bigger and more in-depth than their timeline was ready for I think. What is in the game, is fantastic. I have personally encountered very minor visual glitches and I can't recall any major bugs even in the year of early access I played. In general from my experience, if something is broken they just don't add it yet. That does mean there are a lot of incomplete or absent features, but it gives them room to grow and continue updating the game after release. Its already got a lot to do, so you can just do something else if you hit a roadblock or see something unfinished. 

 It takes elements I love from many other cozy games and rolls them into one! Bug catching definitely feels more like Animal Crossing, as I haven't encountered it in other farm sims that I recall. I love that the mines have their own story line that help me stay motivated to keep going for more than just the materials. I love filling the museum and completing the Offering collections. Having pets will be great once they are fully operational, and I can't wait to talk to the characters whose dialogue isn't ready yet. The Merfolk kingdom also helps the game feel more lively and less isolated in comparison to some other farming games, where you feel a little trapped between your farm, the wilderness, and the single town. In addition some events take you to new locations, and the townsfolk come along! In the future there will also be more of the island to explore which I am looking forward to.

 The game is currently 1.0 but it feels more like 0.6. Actually, if I remember correctly, the last update I saw before 1.0 release was 0.5 so yes, this must be 0.6. The game is perfectly playable; It RARELY crashes, small glitches here and there but nothing game breaking, and finally some missing dialogues/events are the only flaws at the moment. So don’t worry. Farming and all that are perfectly thoroughly playable.
 I believe they pushed this game out at this stage because they had some money issues or something, which means if you have interest in this game, want to see this game to be really fun, now is the time to show support; buy them. (how else?) 😮‍
 I really hope to see this game transform and reach its full potential. I am thinking of coming back to this game at 1.7. I believe that will be when the game reaches its supposed launch state.

I have played the game on pc and on Xbox Series S, in both versions constant crashes are still happening, many bugs, incorrect info, more than 5 weeks after release and after so many players reporting issues. On Xbox Series S, I had to start several files and on all files have played most in-game days twice (at least) because of the many crashes. In all files, at different points in the game, I am forced to stop because the game keeps crashing at a certain in-game day and I can't continue further on.
In this incomplete status, the game is just annoying, however the biggest issues is the lack of respect the developer team is showing: despite many players reporting so many issues, the team is writing some standardized responses, and are reporting working on new stuff for the game in the developer log instead of dealing with the fix of the base game.

The absolute only gripe I have with the game are the minigames. They absolutely suck. Controls are super difficult to learn and difficult to utilize without having a ton of practice. Some of the minigames use a different movement grid than the rest of the game that doesn't work with controllers causing them to be absolutely impossible to play. Secondly, the AI is super difficult. Like I just got to the winter festival and did the match game. I couldn't even get to set a square before the AI won. Plenty of other minigames are either too hard to play or the AI makes it impossible to win. Like I did a swimming minigame where I pulled it off perfectly but still lost to not 1 AI, but 2. They both finished with the exact same time, milliseconds before I did. 
 
I think there either needs to be a difficulty option for minigames, or make the AI a little dumber. They're too perfect.",1702717752,1702717752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, as of mid-December 2023, despite bearing the 1.0 version number, it feels neither content-complete, feature-complete, nor sufficiently polished. Overall, I'd say wait a year before buying this, and it'll probably be excellent at that point.

For example, although the character has an armor slot and an NPC mentions wearing armor as ""common sense"", to my knowledge and from checking online there is no armor actually available in the game. More generally, the combat system is IMO very far from done. The monsters do laughably little damage, and at the end of the first mine you're given a (war)hammer, the most powerful weapon in the game. I think the intent was to give a mildly-powerful hammer, but presently all hammers have exactly the same abilities and stats except for price. However, you don't initially realize that because the place that sells weapons [i]doesn't give their stats[/i] or any other indication of what they can do.

Additionally, I've noticed several places where text is missing (an item with ""TBD"" as its description, meaning ""to be done""), incorrect (text for revealing fossils is actually a duplicate of the text for opening geodes/coffers), or oddly worded (in a way that feels like it was translated). I'm playing in English, and other languages may vary.

Finally, I'm most of the way through the ocean and it's outright boring. You hit garbage with a scythe, over and over. When you finish one area, you advance to another area where you do the same thing. When you gain access to the city, it's pretty lifeless. Then more garbage, and then access to the sea caves, where all I've seen so far is more hitting garbage with a scythe. Various bits of NPC dialog make it sound like there's more to be found, but I've struck something like 10k pieces of garbage with a scythe so far and would like a little more variety by this point.",1702687103,1702687246,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some cons;
 - Merfolk cant be romanced or even made as friends even though on the store page it says some can. Their hearts are locked and cant be unlocked.
 - Grammatical/spelling errors come up every so often in dialogue and messages, which is odd for a full release game to have so many.
 - Many features like pet adoption aren't fleshed out or completed. An example, you can adopt one pet and that pet will sit in their bed all day in your home and do nothing else.
 - There are many graphical glitches and game glitches in general that I've run into throughout my play through to the point that there is a ""I'm Stuck"" button on the menu screen that teleports you whenever it happens. A full release game shouldnt need that. 
 - The story isnt complete. Once you get to a certain point you have to wait for further updates before you can continue.

Some pros;
 - The fishing, bug catching, farming, and diving are enjoyable. I found myself diving in the ocean more often than not.
 - NPC's dont lose hearts over time. This makes the game more relaxing since I don't have to run around and talk to everyone everyday just to keep them from disliking me. It allows the player to enjoy the day their way without having to stress. 
 - I love the differences between the NPC's. They seem more realistic and authentic. Suki, for example, has stretch marks from having a child. Subtle characteristics like this make the NPC's memorable.

Granted, it establishes its own identity by being a mature take on the farming sim genre but falls flat by being unrewarding to the player in general.

If you're looking for a farming sim fix, stick with vanilla or modded Stardew Valley or Rune Factory 4 as those are the definitive titles in the genre. Hopefully, this game will get better over time but as of now, if you didn't get this during the EA period - wait for a huge sale before buying.

The devs has since released several bug fixes but content-wise, it is still far from complete and should not have been tagged a 1.0 release.

I am now in Y2 Spring and my thoughts about the game remain the same since my original review (which I will just keep concise below).

- Romance feels flat and shallow and dating is yet to be implemented

- Mining is still fairly horrible even with skill/tool upgrades, mostly due to horrendous appearance rates of valuable ore nodes; looking for the floor exit will push you to just craft ropes to save time

- Resources are oddly segregated to specific areas only which is rather questionable if you take into account ecosystems

- The overworld is beautiful, intricately handcrafted but is difficult to navigate due to slow movement speeds (even with consumable buffs)

- Ocean cleanup is downright uninteresting - you'll only be doing this for the collectibles",1700568849,1702567231,False,2,0,0.4792899489402771,0,True,False,False

This games amazing, especially if you're a fan of games such as Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon. However, while it improves upon the others in the genre in many ways, there is still too many issues for this to have been fully released in my opinion. I never played the beta, but from what I can see, there are a lot of bugs. This is anecdotal, but on a day where I'm rearranging my entire farm layout, my game, and PC once, has crashed 5 times causing me to lose ALL of my progress of adding decorations and making pathways and everything. After the fifth time I just said, ""fine, if you don't want me to play, I won't."" I immediately came to write this review. The games good, but imo, wishlist it and wait a few months, then wait for a sale.

The game has a few bugs,  but almost every new game released is that way now, you cant fault the developers who clearly put a lot of time and passion into this game for publisher deadlines. I myself have only encountered a couple and all it required was a quick restart of the day, inconvenient but not detrimental to my experience.  If you cant handle that i would not recommend the game, however for those whom that's not a deal breaker for: 

There is plenty of content currently in the game for an enjoyable experience, the festivals are fun and engaging ( while some mini games mildly irritating.)  Farming seems to be fully implemented as i would expect and you can fish, catch bugs, build relationships, dive, all without major issue in the current build of the game.  

I haven't reached the end-game story but I've read other reviews stating its not been implemented quite yet, I think they may have jumped the gun on calling it a 1.0 release if that's the case, but i haven't run into a story bottleneck as of 45 hours of game play. 

Overall a fabulous mix and tribute to/of animal crossing, stardew, harvest moon!

lots of decorative items for customizing your house or your farm 
lots romance options each with their own heart events and cutscene  (hats-off to the dev's)
the  problem the game has i think is the progression system which is fixable (starts off good but gets annoying ) 
and combat is suuuuper easy and pointless in the cave (you have ton of hp and the mobs deal low to no damage )

It's clear that they've taken heavy inspiration from their predecessors like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley and it's been done well.

The cast of characters in town is well varied and the same socialisation options are available that players of these sims have grown used to.  Each towns person has a well fleshed out personality and as you get to know people, you'll be clued in to their likes and dislikes through the eyes of the other towns people.  The game map is large with a lot of exploring to be had, but some areas are gated off until you reach specific milestones either by time passed or in-game achievements obtained.

There is a lot to do in Coral Island.  Farming, Mining and associated combat, Ranching, Fishing, Diving, Bug Catching and enjoying the festivals, each of which have a number of mini-games which allow you an opportunity to earn various rewards.  The festivals also include on which you can bring your farm animals or family pet to which was a nice touch.  There will not be an 'errand' (usually a produce request) every day which is fine because you will have so many other side quests to keep yourself occupied with it won't be a necessity.

Earning money in game can be a challenge for a while as you slowly unlock crafting items, different areas and gain mastery points.  You can add special perks in each of your required activities skills which will help you to become better at them, make more money from the sale of products and more.

While Coral Island doesn't reinvent the farming sim, it's a genre that really doesn't need to be reinvented.  It works well as it is, when done well, and Coral Island is done well.  I would definitely say this is worth a purchase and playthrough or several if you enjoy these kinds of sim games.  The game is carefully set up to discourage racing through particular aspects and it is the better for it.

If you like Stardew valley and like the art of this game you will love it, the gameplay feels good, refreshing in some ways like the bug catching and fast travel (Which you unlock pretty early on and is super useful with the size of the town)

The below is me nitpicking somewhat out of what has been a great 14 hour start, when I have time I will definitely be returning to the island to expand my farm even more.

The moments where it feels forgotten for me are mostly underwater, a couple of the NPC's you meet first (Who only give you a reward for freeing them so far in my playthrough) have a white box instead of a map marker which feels very placeholdery. There is also a temple like structure with buttons which play a note, I thought it was a music puzzle, but literally doesnt do anything... there are also placeholder boxes under each of the tiles under closer inspection. 

This did standout to me alot and made the rest of the area feel slightly rushed, I do have more to explore underwater however this just let the wind out of my sails somewhat.

The bugs that I've encountered have either been funny, pretty minor or frustrating but fairly easily worked around.

Once it's finished, I WILL. I will update my review and do just that. However, I had waited for the game to exit early access FOR A REASON. I wanted to buy the game in a complete state. It is not done. I bought it assuming it was. That is supremely deceptive, and it seems like it was done under pressure from the publisher to drive holiday sales. 

I am enjoying it so far! The writing is pretty good; considering the volume of characters in this game, the fraction I've put time into befriending don't feel as flat as many of the characters in similar games I've played in the past couple years and that is nothing to sniff at!

I am so happy I did. I am now 70+ hours into the game, and loving it. So many parallels to Stardew Valley, but adding in so many additional layers and components that make it perfect for me. I love the graphics and art style. The cows are SO cute! 

I feel like it took some time to get the farm off the ground, but as I complete the Spring of my 2nd year, my farm has come so far! 

I know there are still updates they plan to make with new content, but it is so cozy and fun. Being able to explore the ocean has been where I've spent a good chunk of my time already. 

I think some cons are that at times its a bit buggy, and I dont love that NPC's run out of things to say each season, so they often say ""X has nothing more to say today"" which feels a bit cold. 

The heart events also are extremely platonic, even for your intended love interest. I wish there was a bit more flirty or even friendly dialogue.

One reason I'm marking this game as not recommended is because of the many bugs (for example, got to one of the festivals after getting mail about the festival and having NPCs talk about the festival, but go to the assigned place at the assigned time and there is nothing there.  Checked date/time/location of festival, went back to farm and returned to festival area but still there was nothing there.  Another reason to not recommend this game (as of NOW anyway), is that it is just not finished and the developer was dishonest in marking this as a released game and charging full price for it when it is definitely in an early access state.  Unfinished parts include (but are not limited to) the MAIN QUEST, romance, pets (you can get a pet but they don't leave the house or do literally anything), etc.

I personally like the feel of this more than Stardew Valley, and the graphics are nice (plays very well on Steam Deck on medium graphics settings, and looks fine), but it's just too buggy and UNFINISHED to actually recommend.  If this game is completed at some point I'll probably change this review to recommended and re-write (although, how will I know when it's finished since they already marked it as a full-release game rather than as early access?).  There are fun times to be had in this relaxing little game, but just know that you're looking at an unfinished and buggy product, and not an actual full-release quality game.

EDIT* - I'm not sure why this says I received the game for free, since this is just not accurate.  I looked and the check box for, ""Check this box if you received this product for free,"" is not checked, so I have no idea what's going on there.

Even though the game shouldn't be labeled version 1.0, I still enjoyed my time. For instance, one of the offerings (similar to the Community Center in Stardew Valley) isn't playable yet, which is Savannah Access (basically Calico Desert in SDV). Once you get to the end game, it also feels a bit under-cooked & like content is missing but up until then, it feels fun. 

I'm eager for new updates, I just wish they would have wait to label it version 1.0, I would have waited a little longer to play because I want to play the full thing @ once, versus pieces at a time.

I started two farms in Early Access, and thus had to start for the third time in 1.0, but I think I'm going to finally go through the story in this play through. Even though I hadn't finished the story due to its EA state, I find myself enjoying each part of the game I encounter. It's a fun farming sim, calling back to the mechanics that made Harvest Moon so great. There is so much to do and many customization options that make the game even more relaxing, something I've come to really appreciate. It strikes a balance between frantically managing all my resources (which I low-key enjoy) and a genuine cozy and laid-back experience (which I really enjoy). Is it a revolutionary farming sim? Probably not.

Bad: As others have said, it should not be advertised as a 1.0 release. We knew there would be lots of things still to add in the future, but the main story line is not finished.

The graphics are so pretty, I liked the concept Stardew so when I saw this I knew it would be my type of game, the graphics and diversity are so much nicer in Coral Island, but the basis of the whole game is that of Stardew so if you like that you will definitely like this game. It's really nice that they continue to put in so much effort and really listen to feedback they get and improve the game. I'm really loving it and would definitely recommend the game if it's something you enjoy although I do feel like it is a big expensive the game personally but it is worth it so if it's in your budget definitely get it. The only real cons atm is bugs and they do not have any other save option than go to bed which is a real let down, I really hope they implement a way to save during the day without it going to the next day! The combat is okay but not really improved since early access except you can buy things as the guild and there is more enemies but takes ages to level up and is very unsatisfying the combat imo, they should add where you can buy weapons how much damage it does because unless you buy it you won't know and since the 1.0 release it's a bit better they have added a few more things and fixed the many many bugs there was there isn't a many now but imo shouldnt have been any with the release as this should have been tested. Also, the languages are a bit messed up so unless you speak English some of your translation will be in English which is disappointing and messy because if you're offering  language you need to have everything in that language, don't just assume people speak English, for example the Portugese a lot is in English and from what I've heard the words they use aren't right for the context so I highly doubt they hired a brazilian portugese speaker to translate which again is disappointing as they have the budget but other than that the game is amazing, definitely one of my top 2 games ever.

Now, it's hard not to compare it to the main top dog of cozy games: Stardew Valley, but if that's what initially drove you here in the first place, then you are going to love this game! 

This game is a beautiful blend of Stardew Valley meets Animal Crossing with it's own twists in game mechanics here and there. So far, the story is so cute and fun and I canNOT get enough of the NPCs and dateables in this game. This game is truly exceptional in that category. For Stardew lovers: mines to explore and fight monsters in, people to meet (and date or marry), cute little cutscenes that allow us to see into the lives of these characters, plus your good ole trusty farm. For AC lovers, there's a museum that you can donate to (in which these donations are things you fish or catch). 

Any downsides so far you might ask? Currently: nothing egregious. I will say it feels like your character moves INCREDIBLY slow and also my stamina runs out FAST, but I'm also early game. I noticed that you might be able to have a horse just like in SDV which will help foot traveling immensely. I also don't like that sometimes you can accidentally can loose energy. For example, you have your axe out to chop logs out of the area, you accidentally hit an open square with no log there and you still loose the same amount of energy as if you had chopped a log.

While I do like this game, there is a lot of things that this game falls short on. There's a very noticeable amount of bugs and a lot of things that are yet to be finished. There's a large amount of invisible walls that keeps the player getting stuck. 

Some of the stories fall short and seem rushed as if it was added last minute. There's a lot of tense scenarios where I feel there should've been at least some dialogue, and yet all there is, is a skip in time or nothing at all to follow up on it. (Ex. The Sea People/The Giants)

The caves in the under water levels are just filled with trash. I initially was excited for it, alongside the musical puzzles but was very disappointing to find that it was just rooms filled with more trash that don't do anything more than provide what was already given beforehand. There's quite literally no reason to go in there considering trash respawns outside the caves regardless.

When romancing the characters or building hearts, there is absolutely no romantic events until the very last one. There's no build up to the relationship and there's no scenes of the player actually really interacting with the character on a romancing aspect, some not even a platonic aspect in general. It feels awkward and hard to want to even romance characters when all we get in the form of interaction is just watching them reconcile with their parents or getting over their issues. Which, I admit is nice to see but very much not in a romantic aspect.

I would love to give this a higher ranking or invite my friends to give it a try, but at the same time at this point in time I can not give it a higher rating than I have now.

There are a number of things that make I really love about this game, and that it makes it different that any other farming-sim I've played for example:

[b] Diving: [/b] It's one of my favorite things to do in this game. I actually feel like I'm doing something amazing for the community by cleaning out the ocean. In my opinion, it's also one of the easiest ways to make money. I don't want to say too much without giving away spoilers, but it's like, a whole other world. 

[b] Town/Town Rank: [/b] Tying in with diving, I really feel involved in the community and that all my hard work is paying off, not just for myself, but everyone in town as well. They do the ""you're one with nature, and you have these magical abilities"" in such a beautiful way. It feels authentic, in a way that a lot of other games couldn't. 

[b] Bug Catching: [/b] I am an avid bug hater, not only in real life, but in games as well. I always find catching bugs, not only difficult but tedious (I'm looking at you Animal Crossing). This games makes it more enjoyable, and the more you level up the easier it gets. 

[b] Characters/NPCs: [/b] I love them all. Even the ones that I hate, I love. Their art styles are beautiful. They all have unique personalities and stories, the diversity is so refreshing. And THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM. Some come and go, others are there to stay, new characters move in. It really gives me that ""small town"" vibe.

One of the most important aspects of this game, to me, is that I don't feel like I'm ""falling behind"", I don't feel rushed to play the game and get everything done within a certain amount of time. It's refreshing, and honestly one of the reasons I love the game so much. I can just chill, play, and enjoy every aspect of it, in my own time, in my own way. 

There's so much more I could add, and go on about, but I really think people should pick the game up for themselves to really find the magic in it.",1670369824,1702307079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

(BTW I've invested over 150h hours  until now, I don't know why it only registered 40h game time, I put in at least 15h this week alone)

BUT

Even though it is fully released with 1.0 it definitely is not complete and it's more buggy than ever:

- the relationships with merfolk are still locked in a way, where I'm confused if its on purpose or a massive bug (Talking to merfolk results in a ""This person has nothing more to say today"" even though it's the first time talking to them)

- I've had more crashes in the ""fully released"" version than ever before, mostly when I just finished a day, went to bed and the game was unable to save, resulting in me needing to redo the day all over again.

- restarting a day because of this crash also results in double items (good ;D) or glitched and thus unusable farming tools (not so great), which means I need to restart the game again

- The animations of critters are still buggy and make recognising a critter by its looks complicated

- The drop rate for monster loot is terrible and very frustrating - I had to farm for the silky fur offering for a whole in-game month every day the whole day and it wasn't even that I did not encounter enough monsters but rather that they more often than not dropped nothing at all 

But I overlooked all these points because I still had fun hanging out with the characters - until today. Yesterday I was nearly done with Winter (Just finished day 25 I believe). Today I opened the game and my save file reset to early fall for some unknown reason. 

Not only am I pissed, I am disappointed. Why is the full-release version so much worse than the beta in early november?? I did not have any problems with glitches, bugs or crashes then? 
I will stop playing until they provide the necessary patches to make it playable again and release the promised Desert and merfolk extensions.

Edit: Did not stop playing as they released a hotfix to patch some bugs - some of them were fixed while new ones emerged (example: can't fast travel to the farm anymore for some reason) Will continue playing because I can't rid myself of my farming addiction but I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING at this point unless you're willing to approach this game as a beta instead of a full release",1701598686,1702293395,False,3,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

Skim through the forums and you'll see quite a lot of bugs being mentioned with certain things being unfinished - and the fact that a base functionality almost every game has, namely saving whenever you need or want to - is absent and you'll probably come to the same conclusion as me; This game needs to cook for a bit longer and get polished until everything's there and worthy being called a 1.0 release. Don't get me wrong though, they are patching and stuff in the meantime. But right now I'll wait and see. 

If they added the ability to save at your whim, which is important because otherwise you'll have to run to your bed and sleep every time you want to save (This also wastes the rest of the day) and sometimes that's just not possible when reallife butts in and you can't just leave the PC on. That's just absolutely unacceptable for an otherwise solid game. I shouldn't have to think about ""If I save now, how much will I miss out on the day what I could've done otherwise?"" ""Crap, reallife calls and I've just started the day/I can't get to the bed in time so I'll miss the progress of a whole day (If not more if you didn't sleep for a few days)) I'd give it another go despite the shortcomings with unfinished stuff, because until I get there it probably will be fixed.

It did annoy me that I had to restart my whole farm though, but it was no problem as they gave you $$$ to make up for it. It is similar to stardew valley and harvest moon, almost like any other farming/dating games however this game does have their own personal touch to it with a unique story line and mermaids! 

PROS:
- There is so many things to do in this game: from mining, cleaning the ocean, fishing, catching bugs, decorating your house and farm, customizing yourself, maxing out all your farm equipment. 
- SOOOOO MANY CHARACTERS TO INTERACT WITH. 
- I love that the island changes depending on the season and they offer so many decorations around the island and even the characters change their clothing depending on the season. 
- The events are really fun.
- You can slow down the game in the options which helps a lot.  
- The fish mini game and fighting monsters are balanced as well. With stardew, that was a little challenging so I appreciate this game easing off on this and making it more casual. It doesn't feel like a nightmare having to mine for ores and getting destroyed by monsters. 

The cons: 
- still so many bugs and the game crashes a lot. It gets annoying having to restart a day.
- the one bug that is aggravating me the most right now is that some of your aging barrels and artisan equipment will be done but you cannot grab the item. You have to constantly restart the game for it to go back to normal and apparently it has been a known issue for months now. 
- I love that you can have a pet but it is lame that you can only adopt one. ALSO the pet does nothing but stay in the house all day. You can't play with it or the pet does not go outside to interact with the pet house you had to buy. What was the point of having to own a pet house if they don't use it. 
- Although I enjoy so many characters to interact with, I also feel like there is a downside to that. The interactions with them are sooooo limited. It was really disappointing story wise. A lot of the cut scenes are just me hiding and listening in to other villagers interacting.. OR I was not even in the cut scenes. It was disappointing. I feel like I am not even a part of the village and it would have been great if there were better cut scenes that INCLUDED me. It does not feel like I am actually bonding with them or there is some sort of connection with the villagers. 
- Which leads me to the bland romantic aspect of this game. IT IS THE REASON WHY I LOVE THESE TYPES OF FARMING/ROMANCE GAMES. THE HEART SCENES DO NOT FEEL LIKE HEART SCENES in this game!! There is barely any interaction with me and the person I am trying to romanticize with. It is one of the most disappointing aspect of the game. Most of the heart scenes had almost nothing to do with you. 
- I wish they stepped away from the child-like aspect of these marriage candidates. A lot of them felt too teenager-y (which is with almost all of these farming/dating games). It's always like ""wahhhh my parents don't understand me!!"" and then you bond over that. It can get very tiring. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game just yet as it feels so incomplete still. I would wait it out until there are more updates.",1702236006,1702236006,False,12,0,0.599889397621154785,0,True,False,False

Although there were some bugs and crashes at times, they weren't frequent. When the game officially launched in version 1.0, I was really excited to play, and I didn't mind starting over. I tried speedrunning, attempting to achieve success as quickly as possible, but then... the game started to crash repeatedly. I had to replay the same day up to 10 times because I didn't know what was causing the crashes—it seemed to happen randomly. For example, just walking around, opening the storage chest , or even opening the craft menu would lead to a crash. This forced me to skip the day, and stop playing for a while.

When the Hotfix was released, I didn't hesitate to go back and play, but the crashes persisted. I felt quite frustrated. The game's content, graphics, and characters are adorable and engaging. Currently, I'm married and have a second child, playing into the second summer in the B rank town. I want to start decorating the farm and expand the production process, but with the game crashing repeatedly like this, I feel discouraged and think I might need to take a break from this game for a while.

I've reported crashes before, but the responses were somewhat slow (which is understandable due to the large player base). After some time passed, the responses disappeared, and it seems like the problem was swept under the rug. I understand that my bug might be a minority, but it still leaves me with a sense of frustration. However, this might be specific to my save file, possibly due to an excessive amount of Auto Chests or something else. I really don't know! It creates such random and massive bugs. Meanwhile, my friends experience some crashes but not to the extent of needing to start anew like me.

In terms of gameplay, I highly recommend it—it's a great game, enjoyable and fun. But when it comes to the current bugs and crashes, it's beyond what I can tolerate. It's version 1.0 now, but it feels like the game is unfinished. If there's a major update that comes out, and the game has fewer bugs than this, and when I can play normally, I won't hesitate to update this review.

Btw, I'm not a big farm sim player myself. The last farm sim game I play was Harvest Moon A new Beginning on the 3DS. And here's my opinion about the game so far.

PROS
- Farming, Ranching, Mining, Diving, Foraging, Catching, Fishing, Romance, you have it all.
- Big farm to work with.
- Good story. Evil corp vs People + Magic.
- The girls characters are all cute (but the boys look like they skipped leg day. LUL)
- NPCs have relatable personalities.
- The festivals are great. Lots of fun mini games too. And oh boy that kid Archie is so good at everything.
- It's nice when you're walking around the town and seeing the NPCs are actually doing something. Make the game feel ""alive"".
- I don't know if it's just me but those giants are kinda adorable.
- It's nice to explore the whole town without loading screen. With exception of when entering a building ofc.
- You don't need to have the crafting recipes in your inventory to craft stuff.
- Automation (can't comment about it yet as I haven't really try it).
- Instant delivery online shopping.
- Blew my mind when I first discovered Architect Desk. You can re-arrange everything in your farm.
- I'm married to Lily and also a mermaid now.

CONS
- The only cons I have in mind right now are the bugs and crashes. I haven't experienced game-breaking ones, but I have seen people experiencing them. In my opinion, in terms of content, this game has good enough content for a ""full release"".

The characters are fun, diverse, and there's an element of authentic/genuine cultural identity that's been well represented and upheld in the game. There is a lot of potential, a lot of fun to be had in this game. Honestly, the modding scene is going to be amazing. 

THAT BEING SAID - the above is what makes a good visual novel. This, unfortunately, is a video game that has been presented as a complete, finished package. It is not. 

The amount of little glitches and bugs in almost all the mechanics of the game is lowkey embarrassing. The more hours I play, the more I question the quality control process. The characters, storylines, and features start to feel more like an empty marketing gimmick, valuing quantity over quality - which feels a lot more upsetting in this game than it has for me playing other similar games in the past. I think it's because I'm subconsciously upset at seeing how much love, research and respect for culture went into the character and environmental design, and then constantly noticing how the poorly tested mechanics of the game let that love and care down. 

I'll continue to play it, if only because I have paid access to WeMod, and I like doing little tasks that give my ADHD ass that tasty, tasty dopamine, but I also see myself getting bored of it pretty quickly if an update doesn't come out before the end of the year.

From one side I have great time playing:
- nice characters, 
- really nice graphic, 
- tons of things to do
- work very good
- Devs writing every day on Discord about what are they working on

And then comes other side, which sadly is reallly big - game feels unfinished on every step regarding content.
The more I play, the more I see like something should be there, but there is not, ot not working as should,  like 
- unlocking some space, and nothing behind it, 
- you see empty bookshelfs, but now way to fill them
-  or some music puzzles doing nothing. 
And most of this things when I read discord were done partialy and future of those in uncertain.

Why it was released to 1.0? Probably money for development from sales, because for me, it should stay in Beta longer, especialy when I see what is on Roadmap for 2014 .

So is it worth to buy? Depends how much you need new game now. If you can wait, then wait for those future updates.

Dont get me wrong, game is fun and in final state probably will recommend fully to every farm sim enjoyer, but in current shape not so much.

Best would be here neutral score, but as not possible, giving tumb up.

Update. And I found bug crushing day at the end, so 1h of game was lost. If you dont want to have similar feelings like me now (rage quit mode), then wait till next year at least.
I am so close to changing to negative right now....

Update 2 after almost 100h: 

Don't buy this game now. It should be beta still!!!!

So many things literally show you in the face that should be, but it is not there or not fully. Someone rushed 1.0 release too much.
I will still leave it with thumbs up, as I have/had nice time (except 3 crashes, 2 happened on the end of day, sooo....)

Update 3 ~130h, finished almost everything.

Definitely Do NOT buy this game now. I felt so much like early access, I reported countless bugs and inconsistent solutions,1.0 is scam actually, even when game itself it good. 

If something is not ready in game, there should not be even any indicator that it is there, like whole region suppoused to be unlocked per fountain information , but this is not in game, and a lot of other staff.",1700871240,1702134464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found out after a few days that it was launching but only after I had logged in and had to restart everything. My farm earnings carried over though and I was able to catch up quickly. 

I've really enjoyed my time on Coral Island. It does share many elements with other games like Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia (and now Sandrock), and a bit of Animal Crossing. I liked the elements of the game that incorporated cultural heritage unfamiliar to me that I was able to read up about to understand more. 

I made it to about mid-winter of the first year before hitting a grind for finding fossils, artifacts, etc. and began to encounter the quest walls for like the giants, but was able to finish all the underwater content so far. 

The fandom wiki is an invaluable resource, especially if you enjoy cooking and aim to be a completionist for insects, fish, and ocean critters. But I don't think this game was ready to fully launch. Another similar game that is still in early access that I enjoyed and played several hours is Dinkum. I would say Coral Island is more complex storywise and ambitious with the type of world it wants the user to experience. It needs a bit more polish but I love that the development team is actively engaged in collecting and fixing bugs. 

I look forward to picking this game back up once a bit of time has passed and a few more wrinkles have been smoothed out.

But it always had this amazing potential that had me coming back time and time again and I think with the 1.0 release it has fulfilled that potential fully. There is just so much to do and to explore, with even more to come! I'm a big fan of the diving, it is incredibly relaxing. I LOVE the characters, they're all so fleshed out and I actually enjoy talking to them and gifting them. The cooking is incredible, with interesting dishes and I enjoy the mechanic of buying the appliances one by one and then either waiting for the recipes the NPCs send you or also manually cooking them. (A nice mixture of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley). With almost 500 hours in Stardew Valley and a deep appreciation for it, I must admit that Coral Island is just as enjoyable as SVD, maybe even more so due to the higher complexity. It has takes some downsides of SVD and made it just... more convenient to play (e.g. harvesting multiple crops at once with sythe, crafting from everywhere with all your items...).  I can see myself playing that amount of time on this as well, and perhaps even longer.

The entire game basically copies stardew valley, adding a 3D visual but with isometric gameplay. They do make some changes to plot and some changes (like enchantments or diving). But it's otherwise extremely similar in how it plays. Honestly? I don't think this is a negative of this game. It's a good implementation of the concept.

Now... here's the problem. The game has a bad technical implementation. What I mean by that is constant crashing, constant bugs, and a waste of your time. There are sections of the game that is entirely unplayable as of this writing. It's not uncommon for crashes to occur during the only time you can save, meaning you lose an entire in-game day worth of gameplay. NPCs disappear for seemingly no reason. Underwater caves will literally corrupt your game and make it unplayable until you go to the next day or even have to leave the game.

Also, a personal pet peeve, controller support is awful. The deadzone is too large and it makes it impossible to aim correctly with no way to work around it.

Coral Island is a pleasant farming sim that takes ideas from other similar games, most commonly ""Stardew Valley"" but others included like ""Story of Seasons"" and ""Rune Factory"" to name a few, and give it its own twist.

The premise of the story is very cliche for farming sims, you inherit your grandparents old farm that has decayed over the years and aim to bring it back to fruition and make a small living from it as a escape from your previous work life, all the while mingling with the townsfolk hoping to get to know them better. At roughly the same time, a corporate business is moving in with aims to turn the island into a thriving worktopia for oil rigging, led by a lady named Karen after the island community center reports its lowest grade ever. The island in question has also decayed over the years, with oily thorns growing from the sea, trash rotting at the bottom of the ocean, even certain areas locked off from nature.
Ultimately, your goal is to try restore the land to a thriving self sustaining paradise with the help of many of the islands unique people. You will plant fruit and veg, raise livestock, create artisan foods and drinks, gather and chop down wood, go digging in mines, fight wild monsters, catch bugs, go fishing, attend festivals and (possibly) get married to a possible love interest.
Most actions you do ingame will raise your level with the action and eventually make you better at that role while raising your stamina to continue working throughout the day, with upgrades you can select down the line to cater to your needs.

And with the premises all talked about, what about my opinion on the game:
Its fun, as it feels like a calming experience, and clearing away rubbish and expanding my farm to push out more growth just feels right, however its not without its issues, some of which were addressed rather quickly, while others still feel like it has some troubles. Such as some characters A-posing during some events, some people who are meant to be in a cutscene not appearing at all, some scenes not even loading text and making you skip the scene without any infomation with said scene, or even minor changes to characters costumes during events. 
Ultimately, i feel like this game was pushed out of Early Access a bit too early, like it needed some time in the work oven to fix out any odds and ends to make it a easy transition, rather than push it out due to deadlines and in a faulty position, and hope to fix it down the line. However since the main basis of the game does work, i will still continue to play it as i enjoy playing it, and pretty much i just hope for more patches to the game to fix any troubling issues affecting not only myself but others also.",1702076266,1702076266,True,1,0,0.503128707408905029,0,True,False,False

My initial experience with the game has left me genuinely impressed, thanks to its distinctive concept and a host of promising features that truly distinguish it within the farming simulation genre.

The visuals in Coral Island are nothing short of a visual masterpiece. The underwater world is rendered with striking vibrancy, showcasing a diverse range of marine life. The meticulous attention to detail in both the aquatic and terrestrial landscapes creates an immersive atmosphere that elevates Coral Island above and beyond typical farming simulations.

Navigating the farming mechanics in Coral Island is an absolute delight. It skillfully strikes a balance between the familiar aspects of traditional farming, cultivating crops on the surface, and the intriguing concept of creating an underwater Eden. This dual approach fosters a profound connection between the land and sea, introducing a level of complexity that adds depth to my agricultural endeavors.

Beyond being a mere farming simulation, Coral Island champions an eco-conscious ethos. I find myself entrusted with the responsibility of cleaning up the ocean, protecting marine life, and restoring balance to the ecosystem. This emphasis on conservation not only imparts educational value but also instills a sense of environmental responsibility, enriching my virtual farming experience.

The cast of characters in Coral Island is a diverse tapestry, each contributing their own unique stories and backgrounds. Building relationships with the island's inhabitants feels natural, and the inclusion of a variety of personalities enriches the social dynamics of the game. The tantalizing promise of evolving narratives and character arcs as the game continues to evolve adds an exciting dimension to my overall experience.

In summary, Coral Island is proving to be a tapestry woven with innovative gameplay mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and an unwavering commitment to environmental themes. As a fan of farming simulations seeking a tranquil escape to a meticulously crafted world, Coral Island beckons, offering me a unique and captivating experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming.",1702073022,1702073022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-While I absolutely love the art style and character portraits, personally the characters feel flat and I find their dialogue to be generic and I don't really feel like the characters are that different from each other. 
-For a game that touts the biggest variety of dateables of any other farming sim, I find it a very poor choice not to have the option for dates/hangouts available upon release.
-There are long stretches of gameplay that there is literally no music unless you go into town. This may be a small issue for some, but for me the music of farm sims contributes to the aesthetic and the feel of the world and to go long stretches without any music at all makes the world feel hollow.
-I'm not sure that others may feel this way, but as a veteran of many farm sims, I feel the cost of everything vs how much income you bring in is off balance. In most farm sims, by the time I hit Fall (Winter at the absolute latest) I'm making plenty of money to buy most things and work on expanding the farm. In this game, I've just hit Fall and am struggling and having to spend almost all my money most days. This also makes it hard to do anything but grind and I have to go days without interacting with the townsfolk which is like half the game.
-There are hardly any tutorials for anything. Granted, I've played many farm sims and a lot of things are easy to figure out/common sense, there are many things that should at least have a short explanation. I've had to look up quite a few things on google because there was simply no direction from the game. (The swimming contest at the beach cleanup festival had me seeing red in particular)
-Probably one of the most frustrating things for me is the fruit ""plants"". In most other farm sims, the fruit trees are much more expensive, don't require watering, and stay year round while only producing fruit in certain seasons. The first point is true here, they are expensive, but not only do they require daily watering, but because they take a 2x2 plot, the sprinklers won't cover them unless you want to have 2 next to each other. Also, they [i] wilt after their respective seasons [/i]. For some reason, they are considered ""plants"" and not trees. I find this to be a ridiculous mechanic because they cost so much and take so long to grow that you're lucky to get 1 or 2 harvests before they wilt! What a waste of money.

I really had fun getting to know the characters, farming and the events are very fun I find! But I finally reached Fall and got 10 hearts with a character and it seems so...empty. There seemed no romance after 6 hearts even, you just feel like good friends even after giving the locket and want to start dating the character, it seems so empty and boring.

As the farming is fun and the variety of farm animals is nice, one other complaint is that I finally got a horse and it seems more of a hassle than helpful.

Not to mention the pets and disappointment there: I really thought you could at least have the pets follow you,but it just sits at home and you can interact with it, which is cute, but that's it.

Now, if you got all excited like me for a mythical pet and saw pictures of the dragon, It will disappoint you as well! Though the pet dragon is a kickstarter gift, I thought we would at least get a different type of dragon or maybe a mythical pet like a unicorn!...I won't spoil it but...it was very disappointing.

Though the company is great and active in fixing the bugs, as a game I lost interest after 36 hours and haven't even completed a year.

- Good Graphics
- Good Music
- Excellent Characters
- Good Story
- Good Farming Sim / Life Sim
- Fun to Play
- Relationships and character stories are surprisingly complex, BUT... (see cons)


CON's:
- Game isn't finished despite being 1.0
- Combat is very basic (although admittedly not the main focus of the game)
- Bugs. Lots of bugs. (They do crush them methodically though. They constantly update almost daily on their discord)
- The story is incomplete. Thier is clearly going to be more, but currently you hit a certain point and it just stops.
- Their is no real endgame (such as these games have anyway). You will reach a point with not even fully upgraded tools and farming equipment, and earning lots of coins (gold), but their is no point upgrading to max tier of anything because the game isn't finished. Upgrading past a certain point is useless.
- as regards relationships mentioned in PRO's.... developing the relationships is interesting and the back stories are cool, but when you get to the end, they are a little thin and not much to do. Probably because, like other parts of the game, its unfinished currently.

This game. I cannot stress this enough, this game is the best farming sim genre I have played since Stardew. In fact, I dare say that it goes beyond that. 
I have put a lot of hours into this, and still I am happy to feel like I have so much more still I need to do. This game feels balanced, packed with content, I find the story quite interesting. It's got something for everyone.
My husband prefers the mines and combat, and they gave plenty of that here.
I fell in love with the diving aspect, like a ton. 
The characters are plenty, they feel more real, as do the romances.

The best part? This game is only going to get better as they continue to add content! I am sooo hyped for it!! Their road map for future content is super awesome.",1701978462,1701978462,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The mines enemies are MUCH easier compared to Stardew valley, practically night and day difference I've personally never lost more than 100 HP in a cavern run and that's after completing Earth, Water, Wind and the Fire mine. So if you're looking for harder/challenging combat definitely not gonna find it here. The NPC events are kind of lacklaster and don't feel as personal as Stardew valley NPC friendship/romance events but the characters look much nicer so oh well. Some pretty annoying bugs and only one game breaking one. Using the mill to process anything, sugar or flour causes a HUGE stutter like a good 3 second freeze. Using aging barrels will sometimes complete the production timer but not produce the artisan good and the only current fix is restarting the game which can be really annoying if you only notice it after harvesting all your crops or caring for your animals which means you either have to skip to the next day to save your progress and then restart fresh at 6am or sacrifice that progress and restart right away so you don't waste a whole day. Both of these seem to be fairly common across the board for all players, the mill bug which seems permanent and happens EVERYTIME. Finally the game breaking bug I experienced was during the winter parade/festival I was diving and I entered into one of the diving caves I believe it was the one where gold kelp appears, and the diving caves rooms/layout combined with the above ground beach where the winter parade was happening and then when I got out and went above ground to join the parade it was so horribly combined even after leaving the diving cave and going above ground that I could not enter the parade or get back to my farm to sleep so I had to use my sickle to completely exhaust myself so I would pass out.
Regardless of the bugs I've mentioned the game is still amazing easily a current 9/10 for me and by far the only farming game I've loved since Stardew valley first released. Once they iron out these bugs it'll be a 10/10 for me and if they continue to add content or add meaningful DLC the game will become even better and I will be continue playing and enjoying the game even with the current bugs because they aren't game breaking or in my case the one I did experience seems to have really specific conditions to happen.",1701977648,1701977648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is straight up incomplete. Both in terms of content and in terms of stability, I've played this game for 100 hours now and I've encountered innumerable amount of bugs and crashes, while some are kinda funny a lot of them can be obnoxious and for some people you might even consider game breaking.

For example when the game first came out, there was a bug that would duplicate all your tool/items in your primary tool tab and those tools can't be deleted, sold or destroyed. So I had to make a chest especially for those duplicated tools or not *upgrade the tools at the giant's place*

Another bug would cause the game to crash when moving buildings and in the newest hotfix, items in chests would get duplicated even when removed multiple times. 

Despite these issues however I would still give this game a recommendation, the game is fun at the end of the day. The game has a lot of ideas taken from other farming games like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon/SOS, etc and refined them here and there. My recommendation is to wait a while maybe until the next content update because at the moment It's kinda frustrating to play especially when you've played better polished games.",1701952840,1701952840,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay and controls are very mushy, even basic farming actions are frustrating.

Somewhat common for these games to have lots of loading screens, but even the cut scenes in this game have an average of about 4-6 mini loading screens (and some of them have a dozen or more).

Aesthetically this game has what I'd call a mobile quality - screenshots and individual assets look great but actually playing the game you discover that animations are all floaty, camera cannot really be zoomed or rotated, so it actually comes across pretty meh.

This game is really fantastic and I haven't minded having to start again from the beginning. If you played early access, just make sure you go into your original save file and you'll keep all the money you had to start the new version. It makes a huge difference, as I've been able to upgrade my bag straight away and buy other items too. 
This game has everything you want from a cosy farming sim. I can see the Stardew Valley influence in the offerings at the temple, the greenhouse, the oil company threatening to take over the island. However, there are many things that are unique to the game. I love the environmentally focused festivals. There is a tree planting one and one that focuses on cleaning the beach. They are really fun to take part in. There is so much to see and do. You have the usual staples, farming, cooking, crafting, mining, fishing, and bug catching, but there is the addition of diving too. I really love the mermaid kingdom that has been added. It has it's own cast of characters and I'm looking forward to future updates that will add more to this next year.
There is combat in the mines, so do be aware of that. This has additional monsters added since the full release and is more challenging than it was before. As anyone reading my reviews knows, I suffer with anxiety and combat in games can trigger me. Thankfully, Coral Island has an option in the settings menu under combat called Hit to Aggro. If you select this option the monsters will ignore you unless you hit them. This means you can avoid combat completely or fight the monsters one at a time and avoid being swamped all in go. I find this a fantastic addition and am very grateful it has been included. So if you have the same problem as me, I highly recommend changing that setting from default to hit to aggro. That way you can still enjoy the game!
The graphics are colourful and beautiful. There is a huge list of characters to get to know, a large amount of which are romance options. You can decorate your farm inside and out, as well as raise animals in your barn and coop. There is so much to do in this game, with an engaging story running through and plenty of quests to fulfil. Well worth every penny as there are so many hours of content here. This is one of the best cosy farming, life sim games out there. If you love this kind of game, this one is well worth picking up.

Overall, I enjoy playing this game, however, the music stops and starts quite randomly when walking through town, which is annoying, hearing the same music start from the beginning like 3 times in 5 seconds. Also, the theme played in the museum is the ice cave music from Stardew Valley - it's nice to listen to, but feels like a theft considering it's now being heard in a different life-sim title. The controls are dodgy from time to time and sometimes irresponsive or just make no sense (why keep switching from left and right clicking when filling or using the watering can???) and having to dash for quick movement is quite annoying on the long-run - I'm 11 hours into the game and got no horse. Some conversations just make no sense, like having a cutscene with - I think Lily - who I'd spoken to before, giving me a mission, then introducing herself to me as if we'd never spoken before. The biggest downside of this game - in my opinion - is that the hottest male char (Derek) is not dateable and doesn't even appear on the social list.

Still, the above-metioned hasn't put me off from playing this game yet and I would recommend it to those who've enjoyed Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon / Story of Seasons.",1701880249,1701880249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like Stardew Valley, you'll enjoy this gameplay loop. I do feel that some of the game mechanics are simpler than what I'd expect in a game like Coral Island. For example, the monster AI in the cavern is not challenging at all. They basically stand there while you wack them with your sword. But the farming and gathering mechanics are the main attraction that I'm sure many Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley players will enjoy. Most of the marriage candidates have a lot of personality and interesting conflict. The setting of Coral Island and the focus on environmental restoration is really interesting. I personally love the mystical elements.

Now for the bad. The 1.0 version is almost untouched and indistinguishable from Early Access at this point. I thought that more merfolk content would come with the full release, because this game was funded by kickstarter and reached the goal set to provide merfolk marriage candidates. That is NOT the case right now, and I had to dig on the game's website to find out that these features are on their 2024 roadmap. The game still has a considerable amount of bugs. During the Pet Race something in the environment glitched and I had to restart my day. During the Halloween festival, all of the characters kept talking about costumes that they weren't wearing. And sometimes dialog is completely broken with characters saying ""WIP"" or ""X has nothing more to say"" indefinitely (as is the case with the merfolk, who you can only talk to for a small period of time before they're locked out of dialog forever).

As it stands, I wouldn't recommend the game to new players because I think you should wait for the complete content release. Buy this game sometime in mid to late 2024 when they release more patches, bug fixes, and the rest of the content outlined in their kickstarter.",1701875111,1701875111,False,2,0,0.541939318180084229,0,True,False,False

They took every single thing that made Stardew Valley and just copied it with slight changes. In some they also added another version, like in SV you have the mines. In Coral Island you have the mines and the ocean. In SV you have fruit trees, in CI you have fruit trees and fruit seedlings. You get the point.
That's not in itself a bad thing and it certainly gives you plenty to do. 
I'm not sure if I'd call this game in 1.0 already. There's plenty of bugs, terrain issues, clipping and even some things that still say WIP and TBD. 
In spite of all of this I still recommend this game for those that loved SV and just want more of that.

EDIT:
Ok I had no idea about the extent of missing content when I wrote this review. Yes the base of the game is really good and the art style is amazing.
But come on! It's missing so much stuff. Half of the temple offering rewards are just not in the game yet. There's whole areas of the map that do nothing. The amount of NPCs that have no dialogue is staggering. There was a quest that is literally still saying [WIP] at the end of it before they patched it out.

- Make a better tutorial.
Somehow i did not know that pressing Space (dash) is a thing, thanks Youtube. Also the game never mention time speed as a setting, so it's better to show the time setting after character creation. So after all the game should've either a book or option in the menu for reviewing tutorial like ""Coral Island Survival Guide"".

- Make a better navigation system.
I'm not talking about Waypoint (it's cool). I'm talking about how the game give you information of the location where to go. If you track a guest that specifically tells you to go to a certain location, the map should've added a dot on it. This also extend on the mail.

-Make a better mailing system.
My biggest issue is with how the game handle mail. If you open your mailbox and read a mail, the mail is just gone. The game didn't tell you how to reread them (unless you pull a wiki). It's even worse with mail that tells you a certain location. The mail just said ""Go to this location"" (Lele's black market & Chieftain's house). For new player that just fresh into the game they'll be confuse and most likely ignore it. So the suggestion upon checking the mailbox, the player should be able to review all mail sent in 1 season time frame (game deletes it after season change) and for location email the mails should've added a a piece of map with X on it (the dev can use the Waypoint map to save on resources)

- Make Errands reasonable for 1st time player. i remembered one townfolk asking for a plum with 2 day deadline the moment my town goes to rank E

- Let the player to Upgrade & Enchant the Blunt Sword. The moment you get Gold-Encrusted hammer (Earth Mine Lv 20) the sword is practically useless and you can't sell them (even though you can buy them from the blacksmith).

-Let the player use their Sickle to harvest Fruit Tree. Why oh why do we have to shake them (i get the 3 tree seend needs it).

-The Makeshift Scarecrow is practically useless the moment you can buy Ordinary Scarecrow from Ben

-I just checked the wiki, you can either increase 5 lv of Diving/Foraging/Mining or just buy Wooden Chest in Furniture Store. I just hoping i can buy them in the Blacksmith with them amount of Coffer i gave them

[i] I'll just play an hour or so and- oops it's 4 am [/i]

I love Stardew Valley and I think it's obvious the developers took some inspiration from ConcernedApe's take on the farming sim, however, from what I've seen so far this game takes those elements and has improved on them. The addition of bug catching, perhaps influenced by Animal Crossing's mechanics, is one thing that comes to mind. I also like how they've improved the collection display for all those nerds who will try to 100% this (like me, I am nerds). It does sometimes feel like they hired someone specifically to sit in a tree outside a certain developer's house and take notes. That being said, this is more of the thing that I like and like any good farming sim you can lose yourself in it for hours at a time. Coral Island's addition of an underwater area in which you can collect trash and clean up the ocean is genuinely very good, and I enjoy it a lot. It adds a bit more whimsy to what would otherwise be just another Stardew clone.

The world and characters are very sweet. There could be more interactions with the date-ables, but I understand why this hasn't been the case. The game has an amazing array of products and produce to farm and sell and the environment is beautiful. I love this game and if you like farming/life sims then you will too.

It's not.
Storylines are unfinished (we knew well ahead of time this would be the case for launch), and there's issues that should have been resolved before hitting 1.0. It's maybe disappointing for EA players, but it could straight up be misleading for anyone who wasn't following the game during EA or who at least hadn't seen the roadmaps.

If you [i]love[/i] farming sims and are okay with playing something that isn't going to be finished for some time still, then buy it. It's a great game despite it's issues, but I can't help but feel they rushed 1.0 out just to justify a price increase and console launch.
I bought the game in early access and I don't regret it, but now that the price has gone up and they advertise it as 1.0, I don't think it would be fair to unconditionally encourage people to buy it.

Now that we've had 1.0 out for a bit, I decided to update my review for Coral Island. 

There's something very addicting about this game, but there are drawbacks as well. 

First - Pros: 
-fun group of islanders
-haptic feedback of resource gathering/farming/diving is addicting
-farm animals are cute
-lots of different romance options to choose from
-the aesthetic of the game is super cute
-lots of content for the 1.0 release

But - Cons:
For some reason, the PC version of the game crashes often and without warning, which becomes extremely annoying when you're playing a game that only allows you to save when you sleep. I don't have this issue when I play on Deck, but editing the farm on Deck is difficult because you can't pan the screen with WASD due to edge scrolling not working, but editing the farm on PC is likely to crash the game. It's a risk each time, considering I'm writing this after 5 days of consistent crashing and losing a lot of progress on editing the farm. Also - ever since the last update/patch/bugfix/whathaveyou my dog sometimes has the last line a human NPC said to me in its dialogue box, which is whack. 

Overall, I'd still recommend this game. It's my go-to game at the moment after work when I want to relax or listen to an audiobook, and I've got high hopes that the above cons will be worked on by the dev team in time.

But the game is so buggy that I’m not longer enjoying it. My character got married and now they can’t talk to their spouse without the game crashing entirely. And now some of the characters the my character didn’t marry have dialogue like they are married.

[h2]❌ Cons [/h2]

● I don't find the appearance of any of the male romance-able characters attractive
● I dislike the in-game character models (human and mermaid models)
● The seasons don't look very different visually, other than winter. If there are any differences, it must be so subtle that I don't notice
● Only way to save is by going to bed
● Had to restart for the 1.0 update (save data was wiped)
● 1.0 update was disappointing
● The game is not finished, despite being listed as fully released now

It's well-intentioned with the message about caring for earth and nice festivals to follow up on that theme, and also introduces fun undersea gameplay...the writing  feels kinda not involved to me. The characters feel bland, heart events focus on them rather than interactions, and I don't really feel like anyone is remotely interesting - worth knowing, much less romancing. The quality of writing feels airy, and not very involved. 

Moreover I HATE not having narrative branches and being referred to as they, when I want a she character. Yes, there are Ms/Mr but only kids use them - I do like the politeness, but the pronouns are not worked into the lines otherwise and that makes me VERY uncomfortable. I HATE being called a they. 

On top of that, not being able to save at multiple points during the day makes this game a little tedious and sometimes when progress is lost (there are still bugs that may crash the game, like some texture not loading), it's really irritating that you only auto save on sleep, not during the day  


I'll stick to harvest moon. At least I can really be who I want to be and be called a she, though olive town is a really bad one, and really should have had the plot of THIS game. Harvest moon also tends to have way  more fun characters and heart events. There don't appear to be any romantic festivals here, either, which is a shame. 

However, out of all recent releases in the trend without narrative branches and insisting on not having narrative branches and using  only ""they"" (Sandrock and a few others)_ forcing me to feel very uncomfortable, this one is probably the best because there really are many fresh ideas and an ecologically conscious plot that should have been in Olive Town.  

The great things: 
- maps and teleportation animations
- rich flora and fun crops, especially in the autumn. 
- undersea cleaning and merfolk
-  festivals that consistenly follow-up on the  ecological theme and are different than in many other games of this kind
- while individual characters feel bland and similar to one another, making them boring and unappealing, the overall feel of the community is nice. the vibe is definitely lovely.

For instance, I completely finished the mines without dying a single time. Actually I've never died in game. That's very different to a game like stardew valley where I died in the mines quite a few times. The enemies are not difficult at all. Some of them can deal more damage, but I'd like to see the combat be more challenging and require some strategy. What is difficult about the mines is acquiring ore. There isn't much on each floor and if you wanna make it farther that 5 floors in a day, you have to spend your ore on bombs, so then you come out of the mines with almost nothing to show for it. I like the farming and ranching. The underwater parts of the game get a little old after awhile. Really repetitive with no change in difficulty. I like catching the ocean critters, but other than that, the underwater part is boring. The caves still have a lot of work to be done. I've gotten stuck before when I tried to exit diving and walk back home because the cave was populating over the regular map. Just some bugs that need to be worked out really, as well as the caves mostly just being trash and being a bit confusing to traverse. They probably just should've locked the caves until they worked out what they wanna do with them. So far, I've gotten 60 hours of play, but the game is starting to slow down for me so I may not play much anymore. I'm not sure if it has the same kind of replayability as stardew. I haven't done much with the relationships in the game because that's not really something that interests me, so maybe that would improve the gameplay. Overall I would recommend it because the mingames at the different festivals are fun, the farming is great, catching bugs and meeting all the pets in the game is new and fun for me, and overall its pretty relaxing.",1701729643,1701729643,True,1,0,0.533898293972015381,0,True,False,False

Maybe the game will be better with time, but as I read some forum comment and steam comment (after I bought the game ofc and over 2 hours....) feels like a scam with the 1.0. I really hope it will be better, because I like the game and there are promising aspects but bruh, it is a hard pass now.

[i]its obviously not finished yet. but as of writing this review i put in 60 hrs, finished my first year and had a pretty good time. [/i]

review written on the 3rd december 2023. the game has received two patches (as far as i am aware of)

[u][b]the good:[/b][/u]
beautiful setting, diverse characters and character creation, no genderlocked romance options.
lots of different ways of making money, especially when it comes to artisan goods. 
lets you set the in-game time yourself so u can play at your own pace (personally have not used it but i've seen a lot of people happy about this feature!).
i really like the museum and the importance it has. 
[strike]being able to catch bugs, great fun[/strike]
the game remembers the items you have gifted NPC and saves them in 4 categories (e.g ""love"" or ""hate"") so that you can check in-game what items to avoid or gift again.
i love the seasonal outfits!
overall has some nice QOL features that i enjoy 

[u][b]the bad:[/b][/u]
1. combat. the enemies don't really feel dangerous at all. they hit you for like 3HP while u have a 500HP health bar. it makes the combat feel rather unnecessary.
2. personally, im not a fan of the heart events because your character is not even part of them in some. its just other characters interacting with the character that you should have a scene with. 
at first i thought those were extra events (like if u reach 2 hearts with each character, some might have a scene giving you an insight on their dynamic, like wakuu and chaem for example) but thats not the case. 
some heart events are also very short (usually the first ones i think), which doesnt really make them feel like special scenes.
3. sadly missing the halloween outfits while the event was written with characters already wearing them in mind. i am aware its on the roadmap but it still feels weird playing the event while everyone is referencing their costume whilst... wearing their regular outfits.
4. characters do... feel a bit flat sometimes but after the lastest patch, they stopped repeating the same 2 topics so it mightve been the interaction bug and not the writing.
5. personally not a fan when the writing assumes that i am answering in a certain way that i never would but thats just nit-picky lmao 
6. apparently main story and additional content is missing. i personally didn't play the game for the main story but to simply experience the game as it is right now but that might be a turn off for some people

[b][h3]Where does that leave us? [/h3][/b]
If you see the very subjective bad parts that i have listed and feel like that won't ruin the experience for you, go for it!! 
i am aware i am one of the few lucky ones that never experienced any gamebreaking bugs, so my review might have ended up differently if that wasn't the case.

i would recommend the game if u wish for a fresh farm experience with new faces that still feels familiar. 
but i also wouldn't condemn you for waiting for further patches for a more cohesive experience

i personally don't regret buying the game full price because i did and do have a good time playing it and i personally don't feel like the lack of the main story destroyed the game for me. i don't even know if i have hit the end of the current main story yet.

Do I recommend buying this game NOW? No.

Wait until it's actually completed before buying or you'll be like me - waiting to romance the character I was eyeing up since their part of the story isn't finished. 

If you want to play this game for the mermaid content or to finish the story, you're going to be left waiting as there are storylines that have yet to be completed. The mermaids, the giants - neither of the stories with these groups are complete despite them being considered main quests.

Honestly, it would have been better to focus on finishing the actual stories of the main quests before marking this game as out of Early Access. 

In the early game getting anywhere is annoying - you move slowly (alleviated a bit by the quick dash feature) and the map is large, so it's hard to go anywhere in time for anything. Yes, there is a relaxed mode, but the time per day aspect is actually good, it's just your movement speed and the size of areas that is slow.

That aside, the game is pretty fun, the characters can feel overwhelming due to how many there but the more ability you have to zoom around, the better it gets. Characterisation is great, gameplay is fun and there's a lot to do and focus on.

I would have enjoyed some sort of hints as to what time of year certain things can be found (you have a pedia for things like fish and insects, but it doesn't show information about the things you've found, nor does it give you any hints as to the ones you haven't. It would be neat to have at least an idea that you need to find one particular bug at night in summer, or that a certain fish is only out on rainy days in spring, for example.)

Another issue I have is how janky some aspects are - when you want to talk to someone they either just ignore you or say they have nothing else to say. Maybe just give them a 'dead' line so they don't feel like 'just a character in a game'. It really breaks immersion. There's also various bugs all over - from weird graphical glitches when digging up sand on the beach, to some artisan creation items not working properly, to running into invisible walls, to invisible bugs you can't see or catch on your farm, to random crashes (rare, but still). Bugs abound.

The devs should really have held off on marking the game as complete when the main quests aren't finished yet and there are bugs and glitches still very prevalent.

It has the promise of being an amazing game of the genre, but it definitely needs more polish and completing before then. I've enjoyed playing, but it'll take a while before it can actually be considered complete.",1701561524,1701664342,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However - as I've progressed through the game (up to the end of Fall Year 1) I have realised it really isn't finished yet as 1.0 might imply it is.

-Questlines are incomplete
-Some NPCs seem to just stop having anything to say at all after other quests are finished
-The black tendrils underwater kept respawning and covering my screen, making navigation nearly impossible
-There is a huge chunk of mine enemies in the bestiary that don't exist in game yet
-Many multiple spelling errors
-My game regularly crashes at the start of a day when I check the weather on the TV (on Steam Deck)
-Trying to place farm buildings or house decorations with a controller is an insane struggle
-I have gotten stuck on tiny parts of terrain more times than I can count, however I can usually wiggle myself free.

So, my initial feelings of betrayal have dulled to mere disappointment. Clearly the reasons this left early access have nothing to do with the state of the game. One major game breaking bug that's been there for ages was patched just last week. So that's nice, I guess.

From what I've been able to parse (They don't make it easy. I wonder why) the only real additions are more outfits, changed seasonal outfits for a few NPCs, more emphasis on fetch quests, the winter festival and the introduction of the romance, marriage and kids elements which are clearly incomplete. The night at the museum date with Scott was great but there's not much else that I can see changed when we hooked up. A few small bits of dialogue but nothing meaningful. Haven't tried the marriage stuff because I'm holding out for that poly mod so I don't have to break Scott's heart when I can finally shack up with Semeru. Probably not going to touch the kids stuff. Not for me. But I remember mention that that too is incomplete. 

I don't believe the Savannah is in fact implemented despite the fact that it's mentioned in the release notes. 

Literally everything else was all in early access. Some  numbers were moved around too, I guess.

I genuinely feel the new version is less stable and there have been multiple instances where I've just full on missed things(eg the fire giant cut scene, multiple festivals) , not because I wasn't there but because it didn't trigger. 

And now there's a wondrous new bug with the diving caves where the cave decides its in the harbour (my tail is suddenly gone :() and it follows you back to your farm and you have to use the I'm stuck if you make the mistake of doing anything but going straight to bed. So, there's another carve out of my favourite part of the game. I just wanna swim around as a merdude. Is that really so much to ask?

I cannot stress this enough, this is *NOT* a finished game. They absolutely should *NOT* have called this a 1.0 release and charged people more for it being ""out of early access"" when it's CLEARLY still not a finished product.

That said...

The game is beautiful. The scenery, the NPCs, the character of the world itself... I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a really long time. There's so much to do (kinda overwhelmingly sometimes), with the museum, temple, mines, ocean clean-up, the farm, etc. The NPCs are great, there's so many and they're all so different and it was really fun getting to know them while I played! I've gotten to the point where I'm running a kinda ridiculously successful farm because of amazing accessibility options and automation! It really is a blast!

But there's so many problems. If you can get the heart events to trigger, they don't mean anything because the NPC will act like they're meeting you for the first time the next day. If you get married there's a good chance your spouse will just stop talking to you for an entire season. There's entirely too many things that aren't implemented or just say WIP or TBD for a ""1.0"" release! The mermaid kingdom is lifeless because they only have the minimum parts needed to finish the ocean cleanup story quest. The quest based in the mines doesn't have a conclusion. Multiple ""completion"" rewards aren't implemented yet. And it feels like every time they try to fix something they unleash a new set of MASSIVE bugs on us!

This game has *so much potential*, and I've honestly had a blast with what's there so far, but it's not complete yet. I waited for the 1.0 release because I *hate* playing Early Access games that you can tell will have a great conclusion but just have a sign up that says ""WIP, TBD"" and if I'd known that this wasn't *actually* a completed game I'd have waited for whatever is supposed to be coming next year.",1701644194,1701644194,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

While it doesn't deviate too much from what is somewhat standard in these types of games, (romancable npcs, gifting, seasonal events, ranching, fishing, cooking, etc) I do like some of the things that they added for their setting. I didn't expect to like diving into the ocean cleaning up trash and fining relics but it was pretty fun! Bug catching also didn't expect to enjoy it as it was an activity I find in some games not that appealing. Fishing is kind of meh for me, I feel like I catch way too much of 1 fish or mostly trash, and fishing makes time stop and the minigame I find myself in some cases just take too long and thus stretches my day out a lot so I find it lackluster. NPC's are nice, I like how they are written and enjoyable to talk to. Fast travel across the map is SUCH A NICE FEATURE. I wish more games did this haha.

So far, I'm troubled by this game.  It is quite pretty and the story of restoring the environment is pretty good.  The characters seem fine for this type or game, though they respond quite slowly.  

The problems are outweighing the fun though.  The mines are boring and low benefit.  It's rare to find ore or any treasure.  Just endless rocks.  Even coal is hard to find.  Foraging seems low return as well.  Wandering around trying to find items yields too little.  Unfortunately the farming is really frustrating.  The cursor is hard to settle on the plant that needs watering or harvested.  I play with a PS4 controller and they don't even have total support for it!  I think these type of things should be basic to a game like this.  I have to hunt through others tips to try and find things or figure out how to use things.  Story mysteries are fine but mysteries about how to use tools and such is ridiculous.  Finally there's something weird about the saving.  It saves at night but supposedly at other times.

It has all the elements of games like Harvest Moon, it just does them better. For example, it has the requisite Museum that you donate found objects to, but the museum is STUNNING.

*Random crashes
*I need trash to create scrap, the ocean is clean and the only place to gather trash quickly is the caves, but the the caves are bugged and a world of weirdness happens when you enter the caves, making trash farming basically impossible.

What feels worst to me is how dead the underwater portion of the game feels. That is, after all, a core element of the game and one of the parts that elevates it above a mere Stardew Valley clone. But as the devs themselves say in a recent update: These are parts of the game planned for 2024. Which seems odd given that the store page itself already promises buyers that you can romance some of the merfolk. Except that this is not yet included in the current ""full release"".

My recommendation is honestly to buy My Time at Sandrock instead. Fully fleshed out, a ridiculous amout of content, and a wonderful cast of quirky, fully voiced characters. If you want the mystical and magical elements, you might also consider the charming Wylde Flowers. Coral Island, meanwhile, will be worth a purchase once it actually comes out of early access in a year or two.",1701598383,1701598383,False,4,0,0.505776643753051758,0,True,False,False

Edit: Updating for 1.0 release

I love everything about this game. It has all the features you would expect from the genre but does them all with charm. One thing I haven't seen a lot of people mention is the pacing. Coral island paces game progression better than any other farming sim that I've played. My entire playtime, I've never felt stuck or bogged down having to grind a particular resource, but they also don't hand it to you so fast that you skip entire tiers of play (unless you really focus on doing that).

Despite being the official ""full release,"" the game still has a long way to go for development and it does feel like they moved out of early access to soon, but the developers have previous been very fast with frequent updates so I have faith that they will improve the already amazing game.",1670654201,1701558188,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

[b]Vibes and Aesthetics[/b]
Coral Island has perhaps one of the most charming and polished aesthetics you're going to find in 3D farming games on steam. The Disney-style artwork for the sprites is super charming, and the music is soothing and cozy. The characters are attractive, diverse enough that there's something for everyone (and anything that doesn't float your boat is easy enough to ignore), and their personalities are decently fleshed out so their special events don't make you wanna just skip through. Sadly they don't have a lot of different dialogue options, so the daily check-in is still mostly a chore you have to go through.

[b]Customization[/b]
Hands-down the best avatar customization options I've seen for a game that leans so heavily into this cartoony style. You have a lot of options for hairstyle, fashion, and body build, but you also have a delightful amount of indoor and outdoor furniture that the more creative players will be sure to exploit to create stunning farm/house builds.

[b]Genre Innovation[/b]
There are several very charming concepts Coral Island introduces to the known farming formula, the bravest one being to introduce a whole new environment and species to interact with, which on the surface reminded me of Rune Factory 3, my second favorite RF game. The introduction of a lab to help enhance your crops and create technology to help you automatize your farm is also pretty great, and it was one of the things that sold me on purchasing the game once I saw it on screenshots and trailers.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

[b]Genre Incompetence/Stagnation[/b]
Sadly, for all I just sang praises to the [i]concepts[/i] Coral Island tried to introduce, I can't sing praises to the actual execution. The lab crop improvements are slightly negligible when you can get a bunch of Osmium Crops (highest tier available) simply by planting a LOT of crops and sprinkling them with Fertilizer I. You might think such a base fertilizer would only let you bump crops from regular quality to bronze, yet it will yield random silver, gold, and osmium crops as well.

Similarly, the undersea environment and merfolk community are poorly implemented. You can get to winter and do most of the sea quest while being unable to meaningfully interact with any of the sea life or merfolk: you either cannot understand their language or they have nothing to say to you. I'm not sure if this is a bug or if perhaps getting to understand/interact with these characters requires forming deeper friendships with the people who run the lab. If the later is the case, clearly there's a problem with pacing and gating of the sea content. As it is, the sea quests are both tedious and unrewarding beyond [spoiler]the ability to unlock a merfolk form that makes traversing the sea less tedious[/spoiler].

Problems with these innovations aside, Coral Island also struggles to meaningfully implement elements that a lot of farming games [b]feel[/b] they need to have ever since games like Rune Factory and Stardew Valley implemented them, to the point they should consider scrapping them. Mining for ore is tied to combat as you fight monsters while searching for ore while descending deeper into a cave system, and I'm sorry to report both are underdeveloped and clunky experiences. Ore is rare to find, with maybe three or four minable chunks (each producing anywhere from 1 to 4-ish ore) per floor. You will need charcoal to turn ore into bars, but no charcoal chunks are visible in the mines, instead randomly and very rarely dropping from regular stones; trying to produce charcoal from a kiln, at a limit of 5 pieces at a time, is a tedious experience until and unless you want to create a large row of kilns to make up for the limited production.

Fighting monsters does not help alleviate the mining tediousness, as Coral Island is no Rune Factory, and even Stardew Valley might have less clunky combat. Weapons have no proper indication in change of attack power and a super expensive weapon doesn't feel meaningfully more powerful than a starting one, almost like its only the critical hit damage and not base damage which increases. Monster loot has criminally low drop rates, though as I haven't stumbled into anything I craft out of that loot, maybe that's not a terrible thing. And while the game devs clearly want to encourage and reward monster fighting by having a SV-esque Adventurer's guild, it might be bugged or, again, mysteriously tied to specific character affection. Having been made into a member of the guild in spring, and checking it weekly, up to Winter I've only been given a single monster-slaying quest and none have spawned again.

I know it's become a staple of farming games to try to implement some form of fighting or dungeon-crawling, but I believe people should stop attempting it unless they can commit to fleshing out the experience.

[b]Bugs[/b]
While there are few to no bugs I could find at the start of the game, once you get into the later seasons, they start cropping up. Typos and mistakes in formatting become a bit too common, and there seem to be a lot of assets still missing from the game, from Halloween costumes the characters reference but are not visible on anyone, to underwater critter models that amount to a spasming red-brown blob in the deeper areas of the sea. Game-breaking bugs are rare, but before this review I found one that keeps me from exploring a section of the sea due to that section oddly spawning on the surface and creating invisible walls I can't get around.

These are bugs that I would be very forgiving of for an Early Access game, but not a 1.0 release.

[b]Bad Pacing[/b]
Sadly, this game also suffers from a big issue that early-access farming games often seem to do: pacing. The content is not properly balanced with fresh new players in mind, instead feeling choppy and poorly balanced, or rather, seemingly balanced for a pre-existing playerbase who might've already had built-up assets or character affection, without then going back to properly hint or explain systems that such playerbase already takes for granted. The game throws a lot at you only to come to a sudden halt, creating the feeling that there's a whole world of content in front of you... only you have no idea how to get to it and the game's not helping you find the way.

[h1]Overall?[/h1]

Despite being on it's v1.0 release, Coral Island still feels like its an Early Access game, and thus I cannot recommend it as a full polished product. Perhaps I will come revisit the game and change my review if they ever reach v 2.0 and fix some of their issues. I can only recommend this to people who tackle it as an Early Access, and even then I'd get it on sale. Because a lot of these issues are not apparent until you get decently into the game (by which I mean, Fall and Winter seasons), please don't mistake larger playtimes for saltiness or lies. It simply takes a long time to realize faults that can be incredibly relevant to future buyers.",1701552540,1701552540,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Assets constantly pop in or out of view despite how high some settings may be, screen load times can be long when first booting the game. Keyboard controls are not great, and very buggy, it seems like it was made with only a controller in mind. Dialogue during festivals is wonky with the pets, there are missing descriptions, or the practice rounds on the mini games are inconsistent with zero tutorial explanations on some of them during festivals.

This game is cute though, I enjoy the diversity in it, and the overall concept of cleaning up trash and pollution to spread awareness, and I think I like it as much as I do is because it has a Stardew Valley setting to it where a lot of liberties seem to have been taken, but the project as a whole took on too many gameplay elements at a time and now its suffering because of that. 

This project in my opinion needed at least another year to at least iron out the extremely concerning bugs still present allegedly on other forums but in no way is this game playable for the long term as it is. I have not played long enough to experience these bugs but reading about how you could easily lose your game progress is so concerning to me that I'm afraid to re-open the game.

Farming and Ranching is quite ok, but not great.

Mining is horrible, lvl 30 on earth floor and I still get a little amount of copper? Really?

Diving is the only thing you nailed it. The message is there, the rewards are wonderful but overpowered. I just ignored my farm and kept diving with only donuts on my bag and I can get 50k+ just by rushing thru the underwater quest and selling all of my gacha coffer, way better than tending to my farm (or even mining lmao). Also, the endgame economy after finishing the diving section literally bulldoze the entire game

[h2] Not to mention that the progression is weird. [/h2]

Fast Travel unlocked earlier than Hot Spring, an essential feature where you can regain your stamina? [b] WHAT?! [/b]

Museum and Temple rewards measly small amount of seeds but didn’t followed up with unlocking the respective seed in the shop?

 Also, apparently the main quest is not finished aside of the underwater quest? (not really what you expect as the ending of one of the main quest) and several of the bachelor/bachelorette npc isn’t finished yet?

At this point, I’m done with the game.

Something every farming sim lover would like, especially those who enjoy visually pleasing graphics/character models and a ""cozier"" atmosphere (vanilla settings that allow days to take 40+ minutes).  The two main gameplay differences between this game and Stardew are bug catching and diving. I found bug catching to be a really nice addition to the genre - an almost passive money maker as you go about your day on the island with the added benefit of more things to collect for bundles / collection log. Diving on the other hand is extremely tedious and frankly boring. The game play loop is just stale and bland: Clear trash, find RNG item, light gets stuck behind trash because it seems to want to take the most asinine path to its destination, clear more trash, activate beacon, repeat ad nauseum for days on end. This game copy pastes a lot of game mechanics from Stardew and diving is supposed to be what set it apart. I would have hoped the content would have been more varied / fleshed out on release, but perhaps additional merfolk content will change that? 

One thing that needs to be said though... there are lot of little details/nuances in the game that let you know that the devs really care about their characters/story. It's not ""in your face"" representation, but it exists and it's really nice. The vanilla accessibility options / game play settings are also frankly amazing. Dyslexic mode, color blind, monster aggro, time slider etc. Wish more games would spend time/resources on this.

All this being said, the game is fun overall and I would still have recommended this game to anyone interested in farming sims / cozy games if not for the fact that the 1.0 release absolutely broke the game. Game was more stable and less buggy in early access - even on PC. Don't get me started on how terrible the console release has been. The most recent ""bug fix"" at the time of this writing ended up deleting my save entirely. Even if that doesn't happen to you, the frequent crashes coupled with the fact that saving ONLY happens at the end of the day means that significant progress can be lost every instance especially if days are set to the slowest (50%) setting. Game isn't exactly ""cozy"" when you're anxious about crashes ruining 40+ minutes of progress.

As enjoyable as the game can be, it needs significant time to cook at this stage. If you're a fan of the genre, I'd pick it up when it goes on sale or once the bugs settle down in a few months. Pretty much the only game I have ever played where the 1.0 release has been significantly worse in quality than the early access.",1701505585,1701507755,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Despite the fact it's an officially fully released game, it still has some performance issues and immersion- breaking bugs.

Every ingame festival has some fun interactions and winables so it keeps you engaged!

Downsides are pets need a overhaul or just need more interactions, also I need my own Shiba, give Taco (the best NPC) a buddy.

It does have your usual gaming sim stuff and doesn't revolutionize the genre (Not that I expected it to).
The character art is cute and it's adorable that even the animals from the animal shelter have character art, but I find most things in the game too tedious.
Generally, progress is very slow, even when using food to restore stamina. The mines are boring to go through. Diving is boring. Farming is okay, I suppose. Overall, Coral Island takes a lot of inspiration from other games, but the implementations of those elements is...yeah..not good. 
On top of that, the game was super unfinished at released. Possibly even worse than Cyberpunk. (Minus the funny bugs and glitches)
The patch fixed most of the bugs and crashes.
It's neat that you can slow down the speed of the game for sure and there IS a lot to do in theory, just that those things are boring :|
I'm better off playing Stardew, Harvest Moon or other farming sims.
In the same category as Fae Farm imo. Kinda okay in the beginning, boring and tedious after a while.

I tried to hold off from playing Coral Island until the full release; I had faith in the game and I knew that if I enjoyed it, I would blast through it. I wanted to enjoy a full experience, but this is not that. I’ve been so utterly disappointed by EVERYTHING in the game at some point or other.

Bugs and glitches are abundant, but I can somewhat forgive that. Every game has hiccups, and especially right after a full release. But it’s frustrating when you’re playing a game how it’s intended to be played, when it’s intended to be played (and had a price increase to boot), but I’ve run into multiple game-breaking issues? I’ve tried my best to ignore it all and persevere on the game’s good graces, but when something as simple as changing clothes makes my character’s face default and go bald, or interacting with a chest making all the tools in my bag duplicate infinitely (leaving me no choice but to store them in a chest at the corner of my farm), or placing a fence next to my coop that just doesn’t place and yet consumes the fence I crafted regardless? I’m tired.

These gameplay deficits could be obscured by the social aspect of the game - if that weren’t also lacking. The dialogue is just so droll and samey. I don’t know if it is a translation issue, but it’s just not interesting. I mean, Erika has said the exact same thing about Bree every day for a year since I first met her. Why make her a character if you’re not going to do anything interesting with her? There’s too many ‘they’re just there’ villagers in this game that give you no inclination to speak to them, because you are rewarded with the same stale dialogue. If I speak to someone on the day of a festival, I’m no longer allowed to see their festival dialogue. Prior to a recent update, EVERY character would have the speech bubble present to speak to them, but all they said was ‘They have nothing more to say’. It begs the question why it was even there in the first place, though?
I had another interaction with Randy wherein I had a dialogue choice option, and the option I chose resulted in placeholder dialogue appearing. That was more entertaining than seeing the same dialogues over and over from the person I’m trying to woo, however.

Some of the ‘slice of life’ scenes are ultimately just boring. Some are better than others, to be fair (I enjoyed the Antonio/Suki meeting with Valentina’s teacher one). But these scenes could have been a really great way of developing this large cast of characters and showing how they interact with one another. Instead, they just miss the mark writing-wise and do nothing to make you care more about the villagers.

The mining in the game is atrocious. Combat is not fun. Enemies have no reaction to being hit until their stagger bar fills up. Because of this, it is far easier to stand and wail on them and take the damage than actually engage them strategically.
The mines themselves are stupidly large. It takes far too long to organically find an exit in the mines without using explosives, to the point that the decision to not have an elevator on the 35th floor of each mine serves more as a punishment than a challenge. Also, at a certain point, it becomes very difficult to tell how many hits a rock takes to break due to the similarity of the models. The ore is also restricted to either one or no veins per floor. And one vein can be as little as two ores. I’ve currently progressed to the wind mines, but I have to go back to the earth mines for the sole purpose of collecting bronze for buildings and tools. And it is painstakingly awful when considering all the issues listed above.

I have very little patience now for Coral Island. ‘Full’ releasing without a finished storyline, a tease at a currently non-interactive Joja Cola questline and a completely defunct underwater kingdom with borderline-placeholder mermaids just amplifies every other issue it has. I also consider the fact that it so clearly emulates Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon (to the point of having a ‘Concerned Monkey’ npc that sells Harvest Moon garb), yet it drops the ball on a template that has been continually laid out for it. How did one man (without a Kickstarter backing of $1.6 million) do so much better than an entire team? I played Stardew Valley when it first launched, and it was nowhere near as lame as this.

I really love the artwork and modelling for this game (although there’s a bit of a frame-rate issue on all npc animations). But I feel like the eye-catching visuals are distracting from the fact that the game is rushed and sorely lacking in every other department.

Also, the apple bobbing minigame at the Harvest Festival is ass. That whole festival, actually.",1701400818,1701403181,False,9,0,0.591223597526550293,0,True,False,False

I've been playing the game since well before the 1.0 release, and I even kept up with the page they had to fund the project. Lots of promises there that haven't been delivered, even in the 1.0 release, and it's just unfinished and unpolished overall. Lots of bugs that shouldn't be a problem in this stage, some reoccurring (like the animal talking bug), and it makes the game feel rushed and lazy. A few personal points I would make in regards to this would be:

- The romanceable NPCs have a very impersonal feel, and don't really react much to changes in relationship or proposals. Nothing you do with them feels important, or long-lasting. When romancing Wakuu at least, I got to ask him to be my character's boyfriend, but the dialogue is pretty much the same and doesn't give much of a connection. Also, I haven't kept up with this in a while, but the mermaids were supposed to be romanceable upon release from what I understood... [spoiler] I've gotten past the ""One of Us"" quest, and still, not possible/unfinished, as they barely talk to you. And the kingdom is basically a barren shell. [/spoiler] 

- So many glitches. I've encountered one where in the animal festival, if you try to do the race (the main event), the fence just past the starting point doesn't go away and you have to exit the game, as there is no way to exit the race once started. Couldn't even use the escape key to pull up the pause menu. The animals speak the last played dialogue. There's now a new bug, as of writing this, where the underwater caves are broken and cause massive, black chunks to fill space when you exit them. I've had a few other bugs that have caused me to have to lose a day of progress, and it's frustrating how much it happens.

- Lastly, the aforementioned emptiness as a whole. Not much to interact with, the heart events (friendship or otherwise) are dull and sometimes just don't trigger, and while farming is well done, everything else leaves much to be desired. 

I had really high hopes for this game, which may be my fault, but I think it's fair to say that I'm glad when I got it, it was still only $20. Paying anything more for how unfinished this is, is genuinely not worth it at the current time. I really hope it gets updated more, and heavily refined, but as it stands I don't think this was anywhere near ready for a 1.0 release. This game is beautiful and has amazing artwork and character design, and contains a refreshingly diverse cultural and ethnic influence, but it definitely feels a bit rushed, and personally I would have been happy to wait a couple years to see it at its full potential upon release.",1701402529,1701402529,False,6,0,0.517808973789215088,0,True,False,False

I don't want to keep playing and end up missing things that get implemented later or have to wait a full year cycle to see the content. 

Controls are rigid, clunky. I often start chopping a tree and then accidentally move the mouse a bit and I hit the ground. I'm trying to mine quickly and I get a proc for a free rock to break and it is just the same rock I wasted energy on because I'm not waiting around to see if I get the proc. If you are running along and try to change tools (on mouse and keyboard) your character stops in place. Anything related to tools and animations is just overall jarring. It can be a little annoying when gardening and very annoying in mini games. (some mini games are TERRIBLY annoying)

This really isn't 1.0, this is still an Early Access. It becomes very noticeably if you continue underwater and when you get to Fall. If you start now you're going to end up missing content. I did the Halloween festival and there were no costumes despite the text mentioning that people were in costumes. Lots of talk of the haunted house with no haunted house in the game. Pet text will often bug out. You can't do anything with your pet. Eventually people will stop talking to you. Underwater content is incomplete. I was playing so much each day and ran into a hard blocker for progressing, it really killed my momentum. I unlocked some area to the top of the map, up the stairs, nothing is there. Not even more seasonal scavengable items.

If you don't mind just working on collecting things and farming you can still enjoy this game. I just recommend giving it more time.

The atmosphere feels a lot more modern but still home-like. Due to the pacing, the world does not feel too overcrowded or overwhelming. The only problem I have with this game is that it lacks originality. If anyone has played the original Harvest Moon to Story Of Seasons, they would know that every game they made had their own sort of gimmick. One of them had you open a shop in a bazaar. Another had you develop the town and customize it how you like. Another had you age along with the citizens in town and even dealt on the topic of death. This game lacks that originality and freshness that the farming sim genre needs.

good farm sim, 
varied characters, 
the seasonal events are fun,
the town does feel alive.
cute pets.

Cons: 
Ocean exploration/quest is boring and feels empty. 
mining isn't rewarding even when you invest in the perks.

You Start out with like 5 or 10 backpack slots that fill up immediately and it cost tons to upgrade your backpack. Its unnecessarily annoying.

- small glitches here and there (the chicken outfit has weird lighting glitch on face, the pet you adopt will say the dialouge of the last npc you talked to, and a few more i cant think from the top of my head)
- lighting looks super odd indoors, feels more flat compared to the outside world
- the mermaid town feels super empty, although i havent finished clearing the ocean so im assuming this will change when i progress that story line (hopefully)

one thing i was worried about, was this game just being a 3d stardew... and its exactly that, there are sooo many aspects that are heavily inspired, if not just straight ripped off from stardew
the unique parts of the game have been my favourite, diving and cleaning the ocean (although a bit grindy and tedious, still enjoy it)
its hard to make farming unique i guess, so i cant fault the farming side of things
you have the donation bundles to complete, rewarding the greenhouse in the same spot
the blacksmith system is the exact same:
- 5 ingots to upgrade tool and waiting 1-3 days for it to upgrade
- opening 'geodes' and coffers (coffers being a unique item but still practically the same)
- the shop closing days are almost 1:1 (general store closing on wednesdays, blacksmith on sundays)
- donating to the museum and unlocking rewards
when the museum upgrades and you can see the exhibits with the bugs, i think thats super cute and unique 

i dont hate the game, i love it . i think the fact its so familiar and so similar to stardew makes me love it, but i dont know if that is a good thing, ill reccomend it if you enjoyed stardew and want more of that, then this game is perfect (which is what ive been looking for)

A lot of games have reviews that say ""Oh if you like Stardew Valley, you will love this"" - but this game is almost the exact same game as SV. 

Some of the improvements are:
-Graphics. Much better and a very visually appealing game. 
-Fast Travel. Unlocked in the very early stages and makes the game so much better. Last time I played SV Fast Travel wasn't available until end game.
-Item Reach. One of the more frustrating components of SV is having to line up perfectly to water/harvest/place/grab. Here you can harvest up to 5 tiles in the row in front of you from one standing location and 5 tiles in the row behind you.
-Diving. One of my favorite additions over SV is the underwater world.
-Ability to turn off monsters attacking in the mines. Lowers anxiety and makes the mines so much easier.

Aside from some improvements, this game is so much exactly like SV that even the seed store is closed on Wednesdays, just like Pierre's. Item upgrades are the exact same.

This game is a farming sim just like some of the classics, Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons and Stardew Valley. It has a ton of activities, some we are used to (like fishing, ranching, festivals, mini games, offerings, museum collections, critter catching, and so on) and then, there is diving, a new addition that introduces new systems, new resources, a lot of things to do. [spoiler] You can literally be a mermaid and live with your mermaid friends (and lover perhaps?!) underwater. How cool is that! [/spoiler]

The romanceable characters are so diverse and have such different and fun personalities I just fell in love with everyone. The NPCs feel like a community, they interact with each other and with the city itself in such natural and beautiful ways. This is a game to fall in love with everything. I would've spent 500 hours on early access if they wouldn't reset the save files for the launch. This is important information...

...Because even though the game launched, it still feels early access-y. The game is unfinished [spoiler] the mermaid kingdom and folks are still being worked on [/spoiler], and very buggy. Some visual bugs, some translation bugs, some weird little bugs, but also some big bugs that hold back your progress or stops you from doing an activity. They are addressing everything and a lot has already been fixed, but every hotfix comes with new bugs as well xD It just feels like the game launch was rushed.

The game itself is wonderful, truth be told. I've genuinely enjoyed playing it for the 70+ hours I've been in it. However, it isn't a fully released game even though it advertises as one. Many repeat dialogue lines, pieces of the UI that still haven't been properly implemented, an entire festival that's completely bugged, and with the recent patch rendering the game nearly unplayable to most players.

[u] The good: [/u]

I love the quality of life improvements Coral Island has added to the formula revised by Stardew Valley, who revised the gameplay of its predecessors such as Rune Factory and Harvest Moon. Earlier teleports and simple sprinkler automation at the start allows more flexibility in the day. The teleports do make the stable and horse mostly useless however. 

By the time I can afford the stable and horse, I have teleports everywhere. This may just be because I focused more on gifting people and completing quests rather than raw money generation early on.

The ability to track people on the island using my map is also really nice. I know everyone in Stardew had schedules too, but not having to rely on a browser being open while I play is great.

I really enjoy the masteries system but I do wish it was a little more than what it was. I can't describe this feeling as it is just a slight vague feeling of needing something more.

I also really wish the ingame compendium allowed me to check the altar needs like it allows me to check everything else. I also wish I could sort the fish and bug lists by areas, day/night, etc. 

There is absolutely no rush for anything. Festivals come and go, sure, but I choose if I even care about timelines or events. Coral Island has embraced the idea of ""When you feel like it, if you ever do"" and I love it. It's a very fluffy, fun game and I'd recommend it anytime but with the small warning down below.

[u] The iffy: [/u]

The people of Coral Island are, for the most part, great with a wide variety of personalities and identities. You do have your Hailey stand in if you are familiar with Stardew Valley, etc. This game is very body positive and sexual orientation forward facing which is great. Some of the characters have similar personalities but that doesn't really make or break a game.

The handy tracker allows you to see discovered likes and loves, dislikes and hates, their outfits, and where they are (hitting tab when you are inspecting their profile).

To put it bluntly, it doesn't feel that heart events effect the NPCs. You will get comments from NPCs on things you complete, but helping someone in their heart event and becoming good friends will not improve how they treat you when you talk to them on the streets.

No matter how buddy I get with Leah, she will tell me to screw off because I dress bad, smell bad, maybe both, or maybe it's the shark costume I'm wearing, I'm not sure.

I don't need every heart event to have world changing repercussions. Eva's story is very simple and sweet and I'm all for it. I don't mind if the heart events are just simple slice of life; not everyone needs a world changing moment. What I want is if a heart event clearly indicates its a huge moment for the character, then the way they interact should reflect that. If the characters around town would also comment on me getting awfully close to someone, that'd be neat too.

I do wish the heart events that are suppose to be profound...were more so. Or that if you are escalating emotions with a dateable, it really should mirror that tension. 

I do believe the devs stated that the release version has a bug where a good portion of the NPC dialogue isn't being utilized, but I'm not 100% on that.",1701276780,1701277254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I noticed that it tends to stutter quite a bit, which can be frustrating. The dialogue is good, but it can get a bit repetitive after a while. The biggest bummer was that the romantic conversations with NPCs don't feel much different from regular ones. I wish they'd acknowledge the player more or flirt a bit. Some of the animations, like waving and horse riding, for example, look a little stiff and could use some polish. The festivals are fun for the most part, but some of the mini-games, like the pet race and pumpkin smashing, could be better. There's also a handful of bugs that I've come across that others have also mentioned.

Combined with the unfinished storylines (that literally say ""work in progress"") and general unresponsiveness of the team (many of these issues are well known and have been for months, have been acknowledged by community managers, but never appear on any of the official ""known issue"" trackers) and this launch is feeling a lot like Cyberpunk's.

With a beautiful art style, calming soundtrack and wonderfully written characters, it includes a mix of farming, community inclusion, sustainability, environmental restoration, love for the history and culture of your land, a little bit of fantasy, and getting rightfully angry at oil Karens. 

The game is just lovely to play and experience, the people of the Island are delightful, the animals are adorable, trash is fun to clean up and it’s a joy to just relax and play. If you are into this style of game, I can’t recommend it enough. You’ll love it.

Some parts are a little more ""polished"" than Stardew, but they also do not have the charming quirkiness of Stardew.

What tipped me into a thumbs down is that it is now 2 weeks after release and there has been no bug fix and not even an announcement of a fix timeline.  Even if you have to fix trivial issues you at least need to put something out to show that the project hasn't been abandoned, right?

But this is not full release. Can't recommend at this point in time til a few things are implemented / fleshed out/ patched.

 - Underwater environment and merfolk area/dialogue seems barren. No interesting dialogue for the merfolk and is just replaced with ""... has nothing to say"" or something to that effect. The merfolk kingdom is beautiful, but there is nothing to do in it. 

 - Certain quests aren't complete and have a [WIP] on their title in your journal. Some item description even has a ""TBD' for crying out loud. You'd expect a game in full release 1.0 wouldn't have things like this. Why claim it's 'full release' if it clearly isn't finished yet?

 - Feels like day to day dialogue with your romance option is missing. Found them to be saying the same lines of dialogue even before romancing / marrying them. 

 - Music seems to cut off when walking to another part of the island. Kind of a big deal, since the music helps with setting the tone and vibe of the island and the seasons.

 - After getting married, other bachelors and bachelorette have speak to you as if you married them, even though you married someone else. For example, I decided to romance and marry Lily, but Suki, Alice and a few others made comments on how they were so happy to be married to me. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it does kinda take me out of the game.

 - Buildings and other areas on the island are so well put together, but have nothing going for them in terms of gameplay or story telling. For example, the Observatory. Very well designed interior but nothing to do and no functionality. Other examples include the recycling centre and the area behind the hotsprings. No use whatsoever. Wouldn't be an issue if it was still early access, but... yeah. Remember. 1.0 full release. 
 
- During the seasonal events that close of certain parts of the island until the event is over. I wanted to upgrade a few items but since the town is cordoned off for the event, I can't go.

- Lake altar offerings seems to be bugged for me. There are areas and teleport waypoints that are unlocked once you've completed 2 full altar offerings (according to the description when interacting with the inactive teleport waypoint). I somehow unlocked them with only one altar completed and 2 others being one item away from completion.

Some quality of life changes I hope get implemented:

 - One thing I would like in this game is a checklist in your journal that keeps track on what other items you have left to donate to the museum / offer to the goddess instead of having to got the offering altar to check.

 - Something in the journal that indicates town events (non festivals). Half the time I have no clue if any story related events are available. Half the time I feel like I just stumble upon it them, feeling like I should've experienced these scenes way earlier in the game, but I didn't since I had no idea.

 - Crafting items doesn't require you to have those ingredients in your inventory, which is nice. But when upgrading equipment, donating items to the museum or offering items to the Lake Altars, those items are needed on hand. 

Curious to see how far this game will go in regards to updates.

_

Update: Won't be playing more of this game until it is actually complete. I've completed 3 of the 4 altars with no progression made to the story. 2 of the 4 rewards from the altars aren't even implemented in the game yet. The savannah area and the dig site aren't in the game yet. I'm baffled that the game was advertised as 1.0 full release. That's the reason why I bought it. 

Regardless of how fun and enjoyable the game is, the game isn't finished.

One of the main attraction of Coral Island is the merfolks, but it's clearly not finished, most of the merfolk contents are still locked and not accessible, dialogues are stiff, etc.

I like the way our actions allow the town to unlock more stuffs to sell, feels really worthwhile to do alot of the labour (haha). It would be better to go for the more OG dateables to really enjoy the unlocked hearts. I went for Wakuu and I'm assuming he hasn't been completed after 8 hearts. Can't wait though cos it was really fun to romance him. The final winter festival doesn't have dialogues yet in my game, so that was a bit of a bummer. 

A bit more on the nitpicky side, and entirely based on my preference as a Miner in Stardew (lol):
- The audio mixing/design is jarring in the mines. The breaking of rocks are too loud while the monster music is almost inaudible, these are default settings and I didn't tweak anything.
- The text design on the mines are abit inconsistent, and I don't know if that's something people care about, but it feels weird
- This is entirely my preference: I think the monsters are too easy, and it doesn't feel fun to fight them. Again on the audio design, I don't know if it's possible at this point, but it would be nice to have a bit of monster reaction sounds when getting a hit or being hit
- I think the mines are beautiful, and I love unlocking each mine, but I feel like the progression with combat is too stagnant, the monsters seem a bit dull, and I don't know if it's just in my game, or if it's done like this because it's not in map(?) view like in Stardew, but the first three mines didn't really have variety in where the location of the next level would be, so I just needed to break every rock near every floor's entrance and I will surely find it. I just think it's a bit of a shame as some levels have bigger areas, and since gems aren't that common so far, it's not really worth the time to keep exploring.

They are almost insulting since it seems to only gift me items i have already obtained earlier. It takes a good amount of fun and expectations out of the temple rewards as I have come to only expect to receive something I already have. Initially i was thrilled to meet those requirements each tear but after the 5th or 6th time in a row giving me items i already have access to really disappointed me. Final issue at this time is the cost of the horse, its obscene to obtain that and the stall. Also id like to see a few other colors for the horse.

I loved it and i loved seeing it progresses with time. It is a beautiful looking game and it promises a lot story wise in my opinion anyway. After a while though i decided to wait until the game was fully release to go back to it because what i was looking forward to was still not technicly part of the game. Now here i am =D annnnnd it is stil not part of the game !

This game is STILL incomplete. The dialogue is still a problem pretty often, The choices of answers they give you feels weird and like nothing i would ever want my character to say. My dog that i adopted that i was sooo excited to get and see roaming the town like all the other pets in town, is still bound only to the inside of my house... can't progress story in the ocean, the rewards for fulfilling the totems are bare and minimum.

I dont know honestly why they officially released this version of the game with so many flaws still in there. I love it as a early access but not a full price game with still so many problems and things to refined. I might change my reviews when they eventually implement those things but at this point i am really really disapointed and i feel somewhat robbed of my time.

When I first started playing, I was amazed at all the things you could do, the depth of recipes and story line, many levels to work towards and unlock, and more. With this release, I do feel it was rushed but that just means the devs were confident in the game. They were sure the kinks were worked out. It's a small team and I'm sure they're over worked and tired. With releases on multi platform just means more scenarios where things wont work they way they're supposed to. Paying these people doesn't come from nothing, it comes from us. I'm happy I paid for the game. If I experience some crashing here and there, I just report and check back the next day or just move on to something else. I wish this game was out back when covid hit and I was out of work for 3 months. I would have chosen this game over animal crossing 10x over.

My gripe is with stamina and hardwood.. so far. Stamina goes too quick, I've eaten the things and bathed in the water- helps but it could be tweaked. Hardwood seems to be very scarce even with upgraded tools and leveled up town- could also be tweaked.

What would be cool is more open world style, opposed to the scroll style. I love that there's no loading screens when moving through zones. I'd like to see different chests hold more inventory- but maybe I'm just a hoarder lol.

I've had this game all through Early Access and played every 4-6 months because I thought it was neat to see how it developed (I had never experienced an early access game before). I think the release version is a huge improvement on what i saw in the EA, but it is true that it still feels unfinished. Its fairly buggy at points, some of the dialogue doesn't make sense at times, and some of its just not there. Should they have waited to develop it further before any of the releases? Probably, but people are impatient and businesses gotta business. 

All that being said I do love this game. I've easily put in close to 200 hours (including the EA hours) and I know I'll put more in. I think its a beautiful game, with very fun and compelling story lines, and the sheer scale and massive amounts of content that is being put into this is unlike any other farming sim I've played. Its obviously not as fleshed out as people want but that is going to take time with a game this massive. I think the devs will get there eventually, and I'm going to happily play with what they've given us until the next update. 

I'm optimistic it will end up where it needs to, and if it doesn't? The worst that will happen is that I will be disappointed about the unrealized potential if this game. I don't regret buying it, I feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth out of it, and i've enjoyed every hour spent in the game.",1701141819,1701141819,True,0,0,0.47908744215965271,0,True,False,False

I Can’t stop playing this game, it has ruined me from going back to playing Stardew valley.  This is like Stardew plus plus- so many more things to do, love all the NPCs and there is alot of them. All their outfits change during seasons and when they go to beach. They are fun to romance and have some really good storylines. The design of this game absolutely beautiful too. So many mechanics including Mining, farming, ranching, donating to museum and offerings, and diving, bug catching etc. One Key feature I love is time slowing down to 50% or raising to 100%. I will say Combat is very easy however and almost not even needed cause they sometimes stay asleep. I hope they keep updating this game cause I can’t wait for more. I know they have a rocky launch on consoles and some bugs still in 1.0 so hopefully that doesn’t stop them from adding more.

I've actually started following this game back when it was a kickstarter and am excited that it has come this far. I hope it will be glorious once it is completed. Or as completed as these types of games can be.

Don't know who to even date cause there's too many amazing characters. The story is interesting and innovative. 
Of course you have the whole farming thing that many people have done over the years but there's more to see here.

It's 1.0 in name only; this is wholly unfinished. A lot of items and storylines are TBD, and everything with the merfolk is entirely surface level. I can go through the boring, grindy mess that is clearing out the entire ocean of garbage, and I am rewarded with access to a general store, and still no ability to have any meaningful conversation with the merfolk.

The farming gameplay is good, the mines are aesthetically cool but too short and feature combat against enemies that don't seem to notice you exist, until you're standing on top of them at which point they're probably already dead from 2 hits with the sword the game gives you, and ready to drop their worthless loot you can sell to be able to afford one whole potato seed.

In a game where they put so much effort and detail into the characters and environment, it is incredibly apparent they chose to cut corners on the basics such as movement and action animations.

It is downright embarrassing when you turn and cut immediately rather than having transitional animation frames. The same applies to the use of tools and actions. The animation is so consistently missing it begs the question of whether or not they did this perspective out of artistic style, or because they couldn't pull anything more complex. Maybe they want to blame it on the engine? Who knows, but for what it raised and what it is, I find it hard to believe they did their best when even My Time at Portia was more fluid.

I would not recommend this based on that and a few other things, but they did something interesting and sold the game for $30. While it wasn't for me, I will say it seems to be rather justified at that price.

edit: after sinking another 60 or so hours into this and getting at least all the way through the seasons, i would definitely still recommend this. the fishing minigame isn't impossible, the improvement of your gear isn't super tedious (and after gold, not even so necessary, tbh), and the biggest issue i have is the occasional stuttering. there was a resource that was pretty scarce to get, which was aggravating, but then i unlocked an area that had a great deal of it, so now its just refinement of my farm and all that. 

i do hope that there will be increases in size for coop/barn (though I cant imagine why not when you have to purchase two llamas when you get the one), but of course the game is unfinished so I'm sure there will be lots of changes still. (perhaps one to deepen the caverns as well, certainly some more fleshing out the mermaids is expected as they never have anything to say lol) 

most of my time in game, besides tending to my ludicrous amounts of artisan products, is to gather up all the missing museum items still out there. there are a LOT of different kinds of fish and they are very seasonal (and there are a lot more locations to fish than you might realize!) but still, as someone who played stardew as a very fishing heavy game, i dont mind spending the time fishing at sea. though i do adjust the time to go a little faster, even 50% gametime fishing is a little slow for me.

as for story and quests and bugs and all that, well. i've played just about every harvesting sim game that has come out since harvest moon for the SNES. i know how the general story goes and can accomplish it rather well. yes, coral island has a interesting cast of unique characters, but the story is about the same as you'd expect. from what i can tell, it's not fully finished and is lacking in some rewards for finished shrines and whatnot, but honestly, the finishing of the shrine itself is enough for me. 

there are some bugs with the dialogue, but honestly, it could be worse. maybe i'm much more lax in my demands for a game, maybe i skip about every other cut scene because the story specifics dont honestly matter that much to me, or maybe they put this out a little more unpolished than the should have. all things considered, did i get my money's worth? yeah. i've got 100 hrs in this thing and paid what, 25$? so at almost 25cents an hour, i got my money's worth in time spent having fun.

will you? god only knows. but I do know that i stretched that time out as long as i could per day. i think they're like 45 minutes long at 50% speed. that's bonkers. i can play one week in game for a whole afternoon. man, i just love that mechanic so much.",1700012823,1701067374,True,292,10,0.942043960094451904,0,True,False,False

From what I've played, [i][b]Coral Island[/b][/i] shows a lot of promise. A lot of quality of life adjustments have been added to the game such as adjustable Game Time Speed, locating characters via the map, and unlockable automated machines that streamline Farming and Ranching tasks.
[h3][b]Pros[/b]:[/h3]
[list]
	[*]Diverse cast of characters
	[*]Pleasant art style
	[*]Wide variety of gameplay mechanics to engage with (Farming, Ranching, Foraging, Fishing, Catching, Mining, Diving, Combat)
	[*]Unique showcase of some Indonesian culture and cuisine
	[*]Outstanding story and focus on healing the ocean
[/list]

As new features are implemented, it is inevitable that bugs will appear and occur. In the past, there have been rather game-breaking bugs that have led to crashes and loss of progress for the day. Thankfully, the dev team is very committed and work to resolve bugs within a timely manner.
[h3][b]Cons/Critiques[/b]:[/h3]

	[*]Mildly frequent bugs
	[*]Some gameplay mechanics lacking depth/polish (Combat can feel monotonous when you just spam attack until the enemies die. A few character events don't involve the player at all; you just ""spy"" on the scene and don't offer any engagement with the characters or the events taking place.)

Keep up with your temple donations to unlock content and unlock fast travel quickly which you can do easily as it opens up the gameplay tremendously.

The graphics are impressive, and controls are intuitive and easy to use.

The game will also support a multiplayer mode in a near future, which will allow players to work together to build or help their farms.

One of Coral Island's strengths is its attention to detail. The game accurately simulates the challenges of running a farm, fishing including weather conditions, crop quality and animal care.

The game also features a day-night cycle, which adds more to the game’s realism.

Overall, Coral Island is a great game for anyone who enjoys simulation games and wants to experience the challenges of running a farm.

This game is unfortunately still in early access despite the claims of this being the""1.0 update"". It is full of bugs and is missing a lot of content. I want to love it but cannot recommend it in its current state. I was waiting for the 1.0 release and was extremely disappointed that the publisher has pushed this game to release when it just isn't ready.

I have just completed the first year of the game and I have mostly completed all the content such as the mines, sea cleanup and main quests.

The game has interesting characters and some charming story parts but it is dragged down by repeating dialogue and generic lines such as every NPC saying just ""Thank you"" when completing a quest. 

The events for the different seasons feel mostly incomplete with lacking acitivites, bugs and the mini-games are just badly designed. Some events are incomplete and especially the last event of the year is clearly unfinished as no NPCs have ANY dialogue whatsoever.

The mines and the combat is a disaster. Enemies are no threat and barely react to you. When they do they barely do any damage. The combat itself feels floaty and lacks impact. Its apparent that the devs have tried to make varied enemies with different attack patterns etc. but the core gameplay is just not good enough for it to make a difference. 

The sea cleanup  dives are super repetivive and makes you do the same ""puzzle"" over and over again. Clear trash to find a lantern then clear more trash to make a path for the lantern. You will be doing the same exact thing the first time you do a dive as you are doing during your last dive. 

The farming aspects are fine but not good enough to carry the game when everything else feels lacking. You can grow many different corps, raise animals and craft stuff. There are some decent customization options for the house and farm.

The best part of this game is the art style and music. The artists have really knocked it out of the park and it saddens me that the rest of the game is not up to par with it.",1701019381,1701019381,False,19,0,0.629772424697875977,0,True,False,False

The events are great, In my second year...working on my farm is keeping me occupied for sure. Not sure who I will romance here, but I will figure it out with time.

Now having cleared all four mines and the ocean bottom (with the 'One of Us' quest)- I'm just farming along making some cash...wondering when the Merfolk Kingdom will be updated to fully unlock farming under the sea with hopefully a home. Right now there are bugs in the Merfolk store (clothing does not change color as indicated by their icons). I can't talk to Merfolk after the 'One of Us' quest. It's at a standstill atm.

Don't get me wrong, there's a ton of content in [i]Coral Island[/i], it's fun to play and seriously addictive, but it's far from complete. No matter where I go, I come across hints of things to come, things that were planned but might never actually materialize, and just general signs that the devs/publisher either don't understand how Early Access works, or they do but let their greed get the better of them. Seeing how the game still seems to be pulling in crowdfunding even after its official release, it reeks of the latter. Go figure.

Scores of missing or incomplete features aside, the game has serious optimization issues that result in frequent frame rate drops for no discernible reason, most often in the underwater sections. The latest update also did a number on the graphics performance by introducing near-constant visual glitches at the edge of the screen where it seemingly tries and fails to load in the textures dynamically. My rig far exceeds the game's hardware requirements, so that can't (or at least shouldn't) be the root cause. Couple that with tons of grammar and spelling errors and you have two more indicators that [i]Coral Island[/i] should've stayed in Early Access for at least a few more months, if not a year.

To wrap it up, I'm sick and tired of studios releasing unfinished games into the world, especially if they went through an EA period beforehand, which leaves me no choice but to give [i]Coral Island[/i] a thumbs-down no matter how much I enjoy it otherwise.

WAY more characters, more variety and diversity, a events that develop and change year to year, great farming with lots of development as you progress your town and unlock more seeds. a great added mechanic/aspect with the coral reef cleaning. great message about stewardship of the planet. 

however, i dont recommend this game at all. the devs are making terrible choices. EA has been fun, i was content to finish my EA playthrough but i saw the announcement that the full version of the game was coming so i decided to wait. id finally gotten to a good point with my farm and was enjoying the late game stuff. but there was no compatibility with EA and 1.0 version, so i had to clear my file. i put my game down for a month and was excited to restart with the full game, with the finished storyline. i thought it would be worth it to restart.

except the story isnt finished at all. there are multiple MAIN STORY questlines that abruptly cut off with the title ""????"" and description ""WIP"". the dialogue is still very buggy, lots of spelling mistakes that have been pointed out over and over by the community, theyve done the free labour of  combing through and cataloguing it extensively on the discord and it still hasnt been fixed. not to mention how much dialogue should be location based but isnt (i.e. characters talking about being at the beach or a restaurant when theyre not). so many other little bugs and unfinished aspects but the main 2 storylines are obviously the major problem. the game isnt in version 1.0. its not finished. its just... not. and the fact that it was released as if it was and the price went up is outrageous. 

my save file should not have been cleared just for a few minor map changes. they shouldve held the update until the story of the game was actually done as well and released it as an actual 1.0. this is embarrassing. i dont recommend purchasing this because the devs have been scummy to increase the price. and the price is simply not worth it for the game youre getting at this point. maybe in 2024 when they actually finish the game.

I still very much enjoy this game, and the fresh inspirations and spins it puts on the genre. However, it still belongs in Early Access.

I'm not even out of Year 1 yet and I'm running into dead ends. This is expected with Early Access titles and I can prepare myself for that, but when you hype up the full release of your game and allude that all the storylines can now be completed I personally think players should be able to- you know, *complete it*. This has been extra frustrating for me to navigate because now I can't tell what features are missing or if I'm just having trouble triggering things because all the articles and help are out of date too. Related to that, some systems seem to be poorly balanced making things that should be fun instead a challenging headache. The polished, breath of fresh air that was this game in Spring Year 1, is nowhere to be seen in Fall Year 1.

This game is truly a love letter to all who love and appreciate games of this particular farming sim genre.

As of writing this, I'm currently most enjoying decorating my farm, catching bugs, and deep sea diving! 

If I had to critique one thing, the combat in the game does feel a little anticlimactic and weak. The enemies in the first cave won't notice you until you're right on top of them, and you have so much health at the start that I find it incredibly unlikely you could actually die to anything.

Playing in the Early Access build, there are not many game breaking bugs and the rest are either visual or out of bounds which places you back in your home anyway. I highly recommend this game even while in EA, but I bet I will be even more enthusiastic when it fully releases.

1.0 EDIT: While this game still does have everything I said good or bad, the 1.0 update made the game full of bugs, a promising update turned fizzle. Loading times are abysmal and previous update bugs came back, enter at your own risk.

Good:

Customization is always good for a video game, as it allows you to create the character that you want to be. This game does just that and even has additional costumes and clothing, not just a one time or even color palette of clothing, a variety of clothing waiting for you at the clothing store or other locations.

Graphics are not as important, but this game does a pretty good job when it comes to detail, each area feels vibrant and full of life no matter if it is a forest or a polluted area in the ocean. The art is beautiful and each character has art for every appearance they have.

The map is nice to have, as it shows you basically every location of every person inside or outside of a building, and if you can't find that specific person for some reason, you can go to the character page and locate them.

I think movement like this in any game should also be praised, being able to dash short distances really speeds up your movement rather than just running, once you get a horse this becomes obsolete when running outdoors, but indoors it is still a very viable movement ability. I find dashes in video games for movement abilities like bread and butter, it gives people who don't mind spamming a button for faster speed but also gives the people who don't like that their own sprint option.

Decent:

Grinding should be a repetitive but easy/fun process while doing it, this game does have an somewhat-infinite dungeon for seaweed farming, it lacks mining and a combat arena. Although mining rocks doesn't do much other than geodes and the occasional gem, I think it would be great to have an infinite mine where every previous ore/geode/enemies appear.

Fast Traveling is a good way of getting around without a mount or dashes, but in order to fast travel to certain locations you have to do certain prerequisites, like donate to the museum or clean the ocean, etc. Now that isn't really a problem if they were listed that way, but instead they are listed almost like a riddle you have to solve. I unlocked the ones I currently have passively and some fast travel options aren't available yet, so you are wondering which one can and can't be done.

Bad:

EXP gain is one most annoying parts of this game, while some skills you can level up easily, the other half of the skills require constant grinding like fishing, catching and combat. I hope exp gains for those skills are in the work, mainly fishing and catching while combat only needs an arena.

Like almost every other farming/life simulator game, currently it has only once a day saves. This is unbearable, as you HAVE to finish a day, which can be bad if you don't like wasting precious time or you just want to take a break from the game and continue from where you left off previously.",1697911501,1700869858,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 A mash up of Stardew Valley and animal crossing.  Enjoying it a lot. 

Not perfect though, some character stories feel like they are out of order, theirs a replication glitch I found, and load times aren't awful but just long enough to be slightly annoying (Museum after its updated is the worst wish they made the founders room a separate instance to walk into). Also feels like the game isn't really monitoring what I am doing and just making assumption on the date... I have not done any ranching but keep getting letters about how great a rancher I am or  say something like awesome job here is  a machine to make mayonnaise with all those eggs your making...? Also combat feels weightless and the timings are awful, you kill a mob but it takes the game a few seconds to register often having them do damage as they die... Not that its a big deal the mobs hit like a wet noodle and aren't a threat at all (up to to the 3rd dungeon so far)

Edit,.......

The more I play the mor unfinished the game is. I want this to be positive but there are just more and more things that lack polish, or not finished with the place holders etc....

I'm still not at the end, I stopped playing at some point in EA to let the dev catch up the missing/in construction events and with 1.0, we had to start a new save. Which is just as well since they added so many things, I'd rather see stuff in the right order/make sure not to miss anything and get the time to learn the new stuff. Still a gorgeous game, so far haven't bumped into more than a few bugs and none were game breaking. This is one of the very, very rare game in which I actually enjoy getting to know the characters and just plainly wandering around the map with my bug net without rushing to gather more resources/make more profit. I like to take this game at a ambling pace, no rushing needed.

My ony gripe with 1.0 is that it should have been named 0.7, in truth. For me, 1.0 should mean ""the main game is finished but there are a few things here and there to polish or add or rebalance"". But apparently (I'm not that far yet), the main quest ISN'T finished. Also, some of the dateable characters aren't dateable yet. Basically, if you start over the save (which everyone must), you get dozens of hours of really enjoyable game, but if you speed-run it, you're going to face a wall at some point until they add more to the game. But I'm pretty sure that for a casual gamer or a slow paced/enjoying the life farming gamer, you'll get your money worthwhile by the time you reach the in development area. 
Even at the stade it is, I consider 30 € way worth the status of the present game, given that I've already added like 50h to this game in the last couple of weeks, since I started again. 





2022/10/22: Honestly, go for it. One of the most complete Early Access version I played (not that I played that many, but still).
I've finished spring and started summer, played 17h in three days, and only encountered a couple of bug yet. The gameplay is massively mostly playable. So far, the first two festivals (of spring) weren't fully playable, and I expect that the next ones will probably be the same/they focused on the game itself rather than festivals which happen for a hot minute one day.

At first, it seems SO IDENTICAL TO STARDEW VALLEY. But really, there are only so many way to bring a new character to a new place and teach them new things. Many of the first tools/items/crops are the same as SV, which on one hand, meh, I don't want duplicates, on the other hand, at least you're not lost or having to remember the same basics but with contradicting info between SV and CI.
That said, once you're past the basics, the background story is very different and so much more interesting (the oil spill, the altars and related stuff, ...).

The fishing is SO MUCH BETTER than Stardew Valley. Seriously, you don't feel like you need to be Superman to catch one measly fish, it's such a relief. 
I love the bug catching feature, and I love the background story about the oil spill and gathering the trash/clearing the ocean & island. The npcs and scenery are gorgeous, I absolutely love the many representations for the npcs.
I haven't tried making silos/barns/coops yet, so there's still that to see.

Honestly, this feels like a game in which I'm going to sink so many hours, and it's not even the full version of the game. I'm so glad I gave in and bought it (I don't usually buy Early Access versions)

The one downside I see in particular is the lack of warning when something isn't available (ex: the festivals). By reflex, I paused the game and looked it up on the side, so I knew not to look farther, but it would be better to have an in-game placeholder of ""not ready yet"".

I've been looking for a game to scratch that ""Stardew Itch"" for years now, and this is the ONLY one to measure up to Stardew-- once the rest of the 2024 goals are implemented, this game will handily surpass Stardew imo. 

The art style is both charming and beautiful. Starlet Town is the most gorgeous fictional town I've ever seen, and the level of detail is astounding. It's a joy just to look at.

The nps are almost as pretty as the town itself, and have a LOT of personality. Impressive, considering that there are also a lot OF them. There are some bugs on release that prevent some of the npc's heart events from progressing (looking at you, Scott), but I expect those to be fixed soon.

The diving and bug catching are genius additions, and the diving in particular is probably my favorite activity (the mines were my favorite in Stardew, but the diving here is better). However, the mines in Coral Island are, imo, not as engaging as Stardew's mines (more passive monsters, fewer ore deposits).

The elephant in the room at he time of this review (other than the 'unfinished' nature of the game) is likely the bugginess of the 1.0 release. AMENTIH's review in particular paints some bugs as unavoidable and game-breaking. Let's go through some of  these.

[quote=AMENTIH]""Mini games from events & cleaning the ocean bring game breaking bugs with them. You lose your tools which you cannot get back again. & since there is no manual save option, you don't have the ability to load an older save file. So then that's it, because no tools = no things you can do."" [/quote] 
I have gone through an entire year and have never encountered this bug. This is a rare bug, if it exists at all anymore. Moreover, if this does happen, just close the game and restart the day. Not hard. Annoying bug, yes, but hardly common and hardly game-breaking.

[quote=AMENITH]""The NPCs keep forgetting everything. I've finished year one & every time I talk to the NPCs, they re-introduce themselves to me as if it was my first time meeting them.""[/quote]
Haven't encountered this, possibly already patched.

[quote=AMENITH]"" The story ends exactly at the same point as in early access, nothing about it got developed any further.""[/quote]
This is simply not true. More of the Town vs Pufferfish storyline has been developed-- Karen [spoiler]running for Mayor to force the company's oil drilling on the Islanders[/spoiler] was not present in Early Access.

It's true that the best updates are yet to come in 2024, and if you're the type to play a game only once before moving on, then definitely wait on Coral Island for now. Otherwise, this is a great little game that deserves your attention.",1700856411,1700856411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the worst part is the under water exploration. All you do under water is clear fields and fields of trash with your scythe. A mindless, endless chore. And the reward for pushing through this awful grind? Access to some underwater caves that contain nothing but more endless trash to clear!

However that being said, let's start with the negatives: it's still buggy, crashes once or twice, items don't always work like they're supposed to, and dialogue with the NPC's sometimes feels really flat. When my character got engaged/married, i only got the appropriate ""congrats"" dialogue with one or two villagers and the rest didn't seem to care (even though they're all maxed friendship-wise). The aquatic villagers ""have nothing else to say"" for weeks now, my ageing barrels are stuck, and random bug-catching mechanics appear on screen when there aren't any bugs. There's more, but this is really the tip of the iceberg.

Next, the positives: It's basically an upgraded stardew-like farming sim, with an added environmentally-friendly theme which makes you feel fuzzy inside. I love the townspeople, Mark looks exactly like my IRL husband so that's a win for me, and I really love the cutscenes and festivals. The map is beautiful, the farming mechanics are not hard to understand yet the game is surprisingly difficult: you farm to make money but in order to upgrade seeds, trees, etc. you need lots and lots of cash. With this difficulty curve it allows for fresh new ideas and unique strategies for making the dough.

Just from my 15 hours of playtime, I've noticed that:
- the game glitches 50 % of the time that you want to put items into machines (mayo machine, compost bin, etc) and simply will not work when you right click.
- dialogue glitches very frequently, especially at events for some reason
- framerate gets awful 30 mins into playing and game just runs very choppy even on a gaming laptop with a great processor - could be my issue but idk
- Sometimes the walking keys just sort of glitch? like you'll be holding down the left and up keys and you'll just go up until you take your fingers off and try again

What's not intuitive
- there are no reminders in your journal about where or when events are. you read the mail (which you cant reopen by the way, as far as I know) and you just need to remember where and when it is or you're out of luck
- hydro craftable items can't be placed on soil with fertilizer or growing crops but it doesn't say this in the game, just says ""cant be placed here"" - had to google after a few frustrating minutes
- there's no missions, incentives, or reminders to get a coop or a barn before the animal festival so I had nothing to do there when it came up
- its not super clear why relationships are affected - i've gifted people items that they like and the relationship does not increase, other times a relationship increases when I just have a conversation with somebody ... there could be some built in points system but again, this isn't clear and it was more intuitive in Stardew Valley

There's a lot of things in this game that I love - diving, the whole aesthetic, pets, the large map. But it just has so many problems that make it annoying to play for more than an hour or 2.",1700834075,1700834075,False,2,0,0.501557648181915283,0,True,False,False

TL;DR section:
Ideally check the dev's 2024 roadmap to see if you need to wait for long to grab the game.
- Main story quest? Wait 2024.
- Merfolk content? Wait 2024.
- Marriage/Romance? Wait for a few days/weeks since there's a bug with npc romance dialogues, but wait 2024 if children content.

Otherwise, if all you care about is gameplay and willing to wait for other content then I think it's fun enough to last for hours, bugs aside. If you are worried about bugs/crashes then feel free to wait for a few days or weeks since they release hotfixes. I personally didn't encounter that much game-breaking bugs (I had to restart a day after a crash when going down a floor in the mines), but mileage may vary.

=========================================================

FULL REVIEW:
In terms of core gameplay loop, if you love games like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, I think this game may interest you a lot. There's your usual farming, ranching, mining, and fishing, but there's also bug catching and ocean diving. The story/main quest line of the game is still incomplete though, so if that bothers you then you can consider waiting for a few more months before getting the game.

RNG in the game right now is terrible. Want to catch a fish that's exclusive to raining in a particular season? Too bad. It's frustrating to get rain in this game especially in the Spring and Fall. Early game mining also sucks for the same reason, you might take a long time to get a way down to the next floor. Monster loot also has terrible rates. You may get frustrated and take a few days just to get loot like slime goop and bat wings just for offering to the lake temple. Ores also suffer from this.

Farming is in my opinion the best part of the gameplay loop. There's a lot of variety of crops available especially when you make progress with the town. Sprinklers are also more accessible in the game as the lowest tier can already water 8 plants and the materials are readily available in the early game. Be sure to keep a lot of storage though if you plan to keep a lot of crops of different rarities. Chests are cheap to craft so I don't really mind that much. One thing I like about chests in this game though is that you could set them as if they were global, so you could craft in the mines even if you left the items in the farm.

For ranching, I liked how the animals you buy are already adults so they may start producing their goods immediately. There are also a lot of (cute) animals available so you could have a diverse ranch. My only problem with ranching in the game is that it could be boring and repetitive. There is an unskippable animation when interacting with animals and if you need to both pet and milk an animal for example it could waste time. There are endgame automation stuff but they're reported to be buggy right now. Personally I still like their passive income though.

I personally find diving to be a fun mechanic. This one makes the game quite unique from other farm sim games but I understand that it may become repetitive for many people. Basically it's cleaning up trash -> upgrade tool to clean larger trash -> clean more trash. It's kind of satisfying to clean up trash in the ocean though. Merfolk stuff are also incomplete. Right now you can't raise their hearts (hence incomplete story/lore), so if you're into that then I suggest wait for 2024 if you want more content about them.

In terms of townies though, they're easily one of the best things in the game (potentially at least). The game has a cutesy aesthetic to it and it's noticeable with its large assortment of cute characters. The character designs are all so adorable. They also have seasonal outfits and swimwear. There are a lot of (hot) marriage candidates too although their heart events can either be a hit or a miss depending on the character. I experienced having NPCs forgetting about the player and talk to me as if they haven't met me before. I also experienced NPCs having repetitive dialogue, for example Lily always repeat the same dialogue[spoiler] of her worrying a lot about her brother Theo not expressing his feelings that much[/spoiler]. There are also reports that people who you are married to you congratulate you on your upcoming wedding even if they are your partner and the wedding already took place. Apparently these weird NPC behaviors are bugs so I guess they may release a hotfix a few days or weeks after this. If they fixed issues with cutscenes not triggering and dialogues showing up properly like they should then it would be great for the game at its current state. 

Some parts of the map are also not accessible at the moment, so after a while after obtaining fast travel the map kinda feels like emptier than it should be. Some of the map are also supposedly rewards for completing milestones in the lake temple even though they aren't available yet so keep that in mind. Nevertheless, the overall setting is beautiful and looks lived in. As other players have said, the game is great at immersing you in their world. It being inspired mostly by Southeast Asia feels like a breath of fresh air. It feels like you are really a part of the community, even though if the dialogues of NPCs are bugged right now.

Speaking of community, festivals are also neat, although it would've been nice if we couldn't talk to the townies if they don't have anything to say anymore. While most of the minigames are fun, there are also some reported bugs with them. Some minigames like [spoiler]pumpkin smashing and apple bobbing[/spoiler] in my opinion have janky controls and input feedback, but at least you could repeat the games if you want to get all rewards.

The game also has accessibility/QoL settings that you can enable, like dyslexic texts and adjustable font sizes. You want time to move slowly? You can! You want enemies to aggro only if you hit them? You can! Just be aware that if you set the time to move slowly then you'll have to wait longer for stores to open and if the game crashes midday, then you will take longer to redo days.

For now, I'll be waiting for them to fix the dialogue stuff since it's one of the few things that bothers me with the game right now. It's a shame too that the version marketed as 1.0 has an incomplete main storyline. It's definitely a dealbreaker when you go through a lot to finish the offerings just to end up never getting the satisfaction of a reward (like imagine if completing the Community Center bundles in Stardew Valley doesn't do anything). Nevertheless, at its current state I didn't regret playing this game. I still had fun, but if I only knew about the dialogue thing then I could've waited a few more weeks to play. I also kind of wished they didn't increase the price of the game with how much stuff still missing. If I ever convinced you to play the game right now (or in the next few weeks after hotfixes) in spite of its flaws then I wish you luck and hope that you still enjoy the game like I did!",1700747549,1700808152,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I haven't loved a game this much since Stardew Valley, which I primarily play on console because I couldn't get the keyboard controls down very well. As such, I was worried the same would be true for this game, but for whatever reason, I have zero issues with the controls in this game! I originally backed this game on KickStarter, and picked Switch as my console of choice, but then the game went on sale on Steam, and I was itching for a new farming sim as several others I had tried failed to hold my attention. So, I picked it up on Steam a couple months ago and I am SO glad I did! I've sunk over 700 hours into this game in a pretty short amount of time, and couldn't wait to start all over again when 1.0 was recently released! I really just can't say enough good things about this game! I love how alive the town feels with the sheer number of NPCs, yet they all feel unique and interesting. Even the ones I don't absolutely love, I still find myself wanting to get to know them better and am excited to see their cutscenes unfold! The graphics are super cute without being too cartoony and obnoxious. The developers didn't exactly rewrite the book here with gameplay, but it all works well together and there are some QoL improvements over some similar games. I find myself still wanting to play this game daily, even after a few months, which is incredibly rare for me, and I'm really looking forward to getting to finish all of the heart events for each of the NPCs!",1700806764,1700806764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, I think the game is great. Lovely art style, real cozy vibes, wonderful characters, and fun activities. I love doing the bug catching while foraging and walking around town. That's so much fun!

There are some issues I take with the game though. My biggest complaint is the farming. Not much wrong with it mechanically. It works decently well. Rather I don't like the selection of plants that we can grow in the game. Or at least the selection I've seen so far. This is supposed to be a tropical island setting based on Southeast Asia if I'm not mistaken. Yet the plants we are given to grow are ones that wouldn't be really found there, either naturally or to grow. I mean some can be grown there but there are other plants that grow instead and I wish we could grow those instead. We grow stuff like wheat, cauliflower, turnips, etc. Stuff that is familiar to the cozy farming games but feels climatically and environmentally out of place in this one. At least to me. I wish we could grow more crops and fruit that would be seen in those regions and would make more sense there rather than just finding some like mangosteen out when foraging. It just feels immersion breaking that I'm growing turnips and wheat and blueberries on a tropical farm, y'know?

My other main complaint/criticism is some of the heart scenes. They just feel a bit short so far and dialogue outside feels a touch bland and repetitive at times. However this is not too big of a deal in my own opinion and I still really enjoy talking with the people of the town and getting those scenes. It's great. I just wish I could date them all because they're all so great!

All said, I do really enjoy the game and think it is worth it. There are others who have left more in depth reviews of other things that might concern others more, but these were the big ones to me.",1700806315,1700806315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art style is great, the character designs are great, the characters have a lot of personality to them making them a joy, I like how they all have outfits for the seasons, the music is okay but not to intrusive, and the plethora activities are nice so you always have something you could be doing from fishing to insect hunting to foraging.

That being said the fact they game says it's 1.0 but still has as many spelling errors, as many bugs, and as many things still ""TBD"" is just a BIT of an insult to push it out the door so soon.  This game is still very much an early access title as a lot of events aren't finished, a lot of character events aren't finished or are broken, some characters seem to have none at all despite them being marriage candidates, and if people who have played this game to the end are to be believed it doesn't even have a real ""ending"" and is instead still listed as WIP rather then the usual wrap up before you continue as normal.  All this is kind of an insult for the price raise and 1.0 slapped on.

For bugs I've personally encountered, I wasn't able to do the Animal Festival despite having a pet and a chicken and attempting to do the chicken event or pet race caused a soft lock so I just had to join the event, talk to people, then leave.  If I talk to an NPC after leaving a building they will T-pose and glide across the map until next day.  If I talk to an NPC and then an animal, every text box after that will be what the NPC said until I change screens like entering a building.

Now I'm sure the devs didn't expect people to blow through all the content so fast but this game still needs a ton of time in the oven and I hope it gets the patches and love it so clearly needs.

Calling it 1.0 isn't really fair when there's still a lot of game breaking bugs and missing content that was shown in the trailer. Some item descriptions are even labeled TBA.

Dialogue gets repetitive and at one festival, no dialogue available at all. I don't feel the farmer's connection with the characters. Tons of marriage candidates but none of them feel actually dateable, since most of their heart events are of the farmer spying on them as they go through their problems with their family (ex Surya, Wakuu, Lily) up until 8 hearts. There was no proper buildup for their event at 10 hearts with the farmer.

Mining is too grindy. Monsters barely drop any loot and where are the ores? The drops are a nightmare. The opposite of cozy.

Fishing is very frustrating and its not much better even when you upgrade your rod. Bug catching is pretty nice though.

I love the concept, the art style, the characters.. there's so much potential in this game but there's still plenty of stuff missing. I would stay away from this game until they finish their roadmap for 2024

People who say it's a copy of stardew valley. It's not. Sure it features some similar things, but it's still different. And works differently in some ways from stardew valley. But if you like chill and relaxing farm simulation games, then this is something for you.
However, if bugs, and such bother you, wait until it is out of early access before getting it. To me, it's definitley worth it. When I play I have trouble stopping myself from keep playing. It's just, one more day. And all of a sudden I've played for three straight hours. 

TLDR: it's an early access games, it's going to have bugs, however, it has a lot of great content and story despite it being in early access and is worth it, in my opinion.

I have been playing Coral Island on and off, and I've always sunk another ten hours into it with each update. And I'm loving it. I also love how now that it's fully released, you have the new game plus feature and you get to keep what money you've earned when you start over.

I have played coral island a LOT lately and don't get me wrong, I do really REALLY like the game, it has a lot of potentional, especially with regular updates. I know the game just released it's 1.0 and I am really excited what more it has to bring :)

I'll start with my personal opinion about dating;
I do really hope they'll extend the romance candidates roster. But especially update the dating/marriage part.
There's a lot of people that are able to be dated, however right now the dating is pretty ...bland... not really that deep/indepth or exciting. Talk -> gift -> view a couple heart events, repeat till you've got enough hearts to unlock dating. Give locket, they say thanks and continue on with their day, and they keep telling you the same sentences over and over. Would be great to see more depth to the dating and characters and their responses, for example make Rafael feel more secure/open up around you the more hearts you have with him. Same with Mark, which usually is pretty closed off.

I haven't gotten to the part where they can move in to your home so can't comment on that so far.

Now for the tops;
First of all, the graphics are amazing and the game works great on Steam Deck! (It is verified, controls work fine)

The game itself. Personally, one of the more intriguing and laid back farming/life sims out there. There's a lot to do and sometimes you won't have enough time in a day to do everything you want, which is a good thing. Such a wonderful mix between realistic tinkering/mining/farming and some fantasy elements 
(Giants, Mermaids/Mermen..- oh Semeru, hi there... Do you come here often?). 

Strangely I really liked the diving part, it did became pretty repetitive at the end but imo it just finished in time before it became a real chore. Mining is also a really fun minigame-ish where you've got to mine rocks to go deeper and deeper and at the end free something, gives it more a purpose other than the better ores.

The festivals, I like them so much. They give such a lively feeling to the town once in a while and makes it much easier for you to get to know all the citizens and bond with them, the minigames are great and I do really like that they aren't the easiest sometimes, makes you want to try again next year.

There's plenty, like PLENTY of crops, trees, animals, machines to expand your farm with. Oh and gotta catch them bugs and fish too.

Conclusion:
I still have to find a way to not make my brain go brrrr and be distracted by everything in this game, I personally would say the game is a solid 7/10.

Look, the game is nice, it is build on top of everything Stardew Valley did right and beyond, but I think the stuff they left out in order to be able to deliver the 1.0 in time are huge flaws for this genre.

[h2]What is good:[/h2]

- Beautiful art style. Not just the 3D, but the style they've choose to do the portraits are right on spot. You will imediately want to know everybody in town.
- Stardew Valley fans will be really well familiarized with this, since a lot o things were inspired by this game. The basic animals are the same, the usual starting seeds, system of quality crops, etc
- And of course, you have the ocean. Not only you'll take care of the town (as you usually do in these kind of games) but you also have a underwater civilization and the sea to take care for. It's really nice twist!

[h2]And now, what is the worst:[/h2]

The interactions with the NPC just makes you feel alone. Your character simply isn't recognized as someone in the town, and your actions will be barely noticed. It's just a shame, because you have all these great looking character, but the majority of them won't care about your presence in town. The cutscenes you trigger around rarely have anything to do with the player, is just the people talking among themselves as if you were never introduced. Even if you marry a person, sometimes they will forget about your existence. This cutscene happened to me:

- You walk on two people talking about having a dinner (that appearently everybody is invited). They finish talking about that, a dude asks you to help him with his table, and the cutscene ends. No one invites to the dinner, nobody cares that you're there, and if you actually go to the place the this dinner is supposed to happen, nothing is going on...

This happens a lot, and the ones that actually require the player's character sometimes are confusing and makes you think ""Why am I talking to this person? What is going on here?!"" Any way, just a mess.

I bought the game on the very first days of the early access and I was happy with the few content it had because only looking at it the potential was really big. Playing the ""Full Release"" is just a disappointment, because it feels like a 0.8 version. I would have gladly waited for one more year if that meant they would at least finish the main story.

Because this is really weird, a lot of things might be happening with the devs, and if that's the case I understand, but still, I think people should know the true state of the game, and I hope that they can add and do all they things they have in schedule. So right now, I don't think I can recommend this based on my experience",1700767075,1700767238,False,9,0,0.583763182163238525,0,True,False,False

Literally Stardew Valley - Animal Crossing - Harvest Moon fusion/copy (heavily inspired they said) and for now have many flaws like bugs, broken community event (lol), character get stuck, weird combat mechanics (like ffs why do you need to dash when you first attack). A little bit more grindy than Stardew Valley for early-game in my opinion. Need many improvement yet this is fun to play and spending time.

Also, the Indonesian references are strong in this one (I like that 'kosan' and Javanese reference btw hehe).

Here are the list of what needs to be added or improved in the game in my opinion (this list will be continously updated):
1. Why we don't have birthday for our character? haha. Maybe if you add this, we can have option to attend a party or something in the city square or our farm maybe
2. The grass don't automatically inserted to silo (I assume this will have the same mechanics as Stardew Valley)
3. Add more legends at the map (many of the places are not highlighted by legends)
4. Please update the story-events, relationship-events, and community-events feature as soon as possible (it's tilting when you're addicted and wanna keep on playing but 'skipping' many of its content)

game has its bugs no suprise all games do but the music is relaxing the atmosphere
is really enjoyable being an aquarious the diving underwater is really something i enjoy.

not too much to say other than yeah its very much like games like stardew valley and harvest moon.
It takes inspiration from both games and its quite obvious to see that. but that in of itself is not a bad thing, has they have improved on some aspects like being able to automate petting animals has that can become quite tedious lol. Some folks might find the underwater aspect to be tedious and it can be has its dive clean up garbage collect kelp rinse and repeat.  You can of course collect underwater critters and forage for shell fish etc. in a sense the underwater aspect is very similar to mining so again some folks may find it tedious and monotonous.

BEST FEATURES
- using the same mechanics as most farming/simulation games these days and made it their own without making them repetitive and a chore
- the application of the devs' culture in this game is truly beautiful
- i love harvest moon but i also wish for more asian themed games like this (i'm an asian)
- the devs (this is obviously a labor of love. you'll know if u joined their Discord)
- played jackbox games with the devs and it was fun. they really tried connecting with the players
- the art, the bachelor/ettes, every NPCs, the pets, the whole map, design of everything
- children around town will grow up until teens (even NPCs)
- i just love everything about this game that i would just advise u guys to try it

IMPROVABLE FEATURES
- the devs obviously had a planned timeline for everything (updates to full release date to after 1.0 updates), and the 1.0 was also obviously pushed by the publishing company... and it resulted in the 1.0 being plagued with crashes, bugs, and glitches. Especially the PS5 port
- they made extra characters too hot. if not marriageable, why hot? (especially derek, raina, senja, and axel)
- encountering some character specific cutscenes really made me wish this game has rival marriage mechanics. i miss those",1700656675,1700757415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THIS REVIEW COMES WITH A CAVEAT! 

I've had my eye on this game for a bit and finally, the 1.0 was released. Now, I see incredible potential, but this feels like Early Access extended. There have been minor bugs and a few lags in my save file but I managed to avoid the bigger bugs and errors other players seem to encounter. However, I only made it to the middle of the first summer and already encountered some missing content, like pets not working 100% or the Merfolk essentially being placeholders for now. Of course the game is massive and there are TONS of other things to see and do, but the Merfolk were one of the things that I personally was most interested in and to see they were not included (which although it is in the patch notes I was unaware of at the time) was a bit of a disappointment. I will give this a positive review regardless because the things that ARE there are fantastic, full of little details and many quality of life features I missed in Stardew for example. There is a roadmap out, but I'm not sure what ""planned for 2024"" is supposed to mean. Early 2024? Another entire year? Will my save file be compatible? Will I miss out on some events if I keep playing? I'm going to give the devs the benefit of the doubt because I can tell there's a lot of effort put into this game (the museum alone is GORGEOUS), but as someone who wants the full experience from the get-go I'll probably not get too attached to my first file.",1700430215,1700741229,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One, it's horrifically derivative; as other reviewers put it, it's ""we have Stardew Valley at home."" This game does absolutely nothing that Stardew Valley doesn't already do better (and that goes fivefold if you have any of the major Stardew quality-of-life mods like UI Info Suite.) It's the _same game_ but nowhere near as well done. Stardew's characters are more memorable, the heart events and plotlines better written (and again, speaking of mods, Stardew Valley Expanded and Ridgeside Village are practically free DLC. You know any expansions this game gets won't be free.)

So if there's another game that does everything this game does, at half the price (or less, if you get Stardew on sale), then why choose this game over that one when you could be playing that one?

Two, it's laughably unfinished. This is not a 1.0 release as of November of 2023. It's still very much in Early Access, they just don't want to say that anymore because they apparently needed the money and released it on consoles as a 1.0 and changed the version number on Steam to go with it. Even their roadmap all but says this out loud; it'll be Q4 of 2024, or maybe even 2025, before this game is even realistically a 1.0 release.

Three, it's buggy in ways that break the game. Machines don't work right, events don't fire, quests don't advance...they couldn't even copy Stardew right.

And just a personal gripe, but there's a musical motif in Spring in this game that is so blatantly a Wild Horseradish Jam copy that it's all but winking at how it got one over on you.

Seriously. If you haven't played Stardew Valley, buy that instead. And if you have played Stardew Valley, just go play it again and save yourself 30 bucks.",1700715299,1700715299,False,3,0,0.467894524335861206,0,True,False,False

Coral Island covers the majority of the essentials that make farming sims great, including numerous crops, a relaxed atmosphere, and simple, yet rewarding animal husbandry, while avoiding a number of pitfalls from more retro entries in the franchise (such as missable time-gated events, overly tedious crafting systems, and structures/items breaking, never to be seen again). The message of promoting sustainability isn't too on the nose, and the marriage options, if slightly redundant in places, are varied, plentiful enough (and perhaps most importantly, not children).

However, there are a few things that those who aren't already used to the genre may not appreciate, including the need to refer to the Wiki for some things which are crucial to progression (I'm looking at you, certain milled cooking ingredients, and more than a few fish/insects), and a (warranted, as the game is still incomplete) lack of polish in some places. 

All-in-all, this is a game that does the genre justice, is accessible for most people, and for those who have one, is verified on Steam Deck.

With its humorous characters, ridiculous situations, and stunning visuals, it offers endless laughter and amusement. Although there might be occasional repetition and a lack of story depth, the game's comedic charm and engaging game-play make it a must-play for those seeking an aquatic version of Stardew Valley. Dive into Coral Island and get ready for an ocean of laughter.

Keep in mind that the game is in early access and there are bugs that are game-breaking and there is still a lack of content for now, but I still recommend the game despite this. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]

[*][b]Ridiculous Situations:[/b] From trying to communicate with talking dolphins to attempting to outsmart mischievous seagulls, the game is filled with laugh-out-loud moments and absurd scenarios.

[*][b]Stunning Underwater World:[/b] The vibrant and visually stunning underwater environments of Coral Island are a treat for the eyes, with colourful marine life and breathtaking coral reefs.

[*][b]Engaging Game-play:[/b] Engage in entertaining activities like fishing, farming, and interacting with unique sea creatures, making each day in Coral Island a hilarious adventure.

[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]

[*][b]Occasional Repetition:[/b] Some activities and tasks in Coral Island can become repetitive over time, which may dampen the initial hilarity.

[*][b]Lack of Depth in Story:[/b] While the game excels in humour, the overall story may not provide the same level of depth and complexity as other games such as Stardew Valley.

[*][b]Game Breaking Bugs:[/b] The game is in early access, but there are certain bugs that will make you rage, such as losing your save file randomly, hopefully this has been ironed out by now.

This is literally Stardew Valley (plus) in 3D. From the general store being closed on Wednesdays, the similar town events, the similar  tool upgrades etc.. SO many similarities to Stardew. Thus, makes me like this game (although -  I am not sure how to feel about a team copying so much from SDV... but let's put that aside).

This is a game which you can replay - so already worth it. However, the game is not done yet. I wish they'd kept it in early access as 1.0 is not a complete game. There is main story line missing, still many bugs (which the dev team are addressing!), and very sub-par friendship/romance plots - not to mention that the merfolk friendship is not even avail yet.

However, I would still recommend this game. One can spend hours progressing - as long as you overlook the bugs or missing content. Hoping dev team will continue updating the game swiftly - AND we don't have to lose our current saves again with the next update!!!

If this game were still in early access I actually would have no problems with recommending it on the stipulation that it is early access.

So far I have found things from minor issues such as summer dialogue on the beach during the winter night festivals, to far more serious issues such as interactions with the tool enchanting and upgrading duplicating my tools. Tools that I cannot sell or throw away so I just have to shove into a box into a corner of my farm to forget about. Additionally I have had issues with my Mushroom Logs where they just sit with fully completed bars for days and days and days without being able to be harvested even after restarting the game. 

Further still there are missing descriptions in some items. From minor things like the Bone item that previously was listed as 'tbd' to having just recently unlocked the Solar Panel where it's description is TBD. I do not know what this machine makes. I do not know what it is for. I just know it is something that I will probably need to advance further on the farm.

Nothing that is outright game breaking but these are all the sorts of thing that should be cleared up before the full 1.0 release of a game. Overall a very, very solid game with fun characters and a wonderfully charming gameplay loop. It's got everything that I would want from a cozy farming sim including a wonderfully diverse cast of characters and variety of activities to do. There's tons and tons of content here to play with and I'm very excited to keep going.

I look forward to playing quite a lot of this game in the future.

If you can look past these kinds of issues this is a game well worth picking up. Just do keep in mind that there are places where it still feels like an early access game rather than a full release.",1700699904,1700699904,False,2,0,0.512096762657165527,0,True,False,False

Yet they STILL make a video game infested with homosexuality.

The Quran, the holy book of Islam, contains verses that condemn homosexual acts, particularly in the story of the people of Lut (Lot in the Bible). These verses are found mainly in the following chapters (Surahs):

- Surah Al-A'raf (7:80-81): This Surah recounts the story of Prophet Lut (Lot), who warned his people about their practice of homosexuality. It quotes Lut saying, ""Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.""

- Surah Hud (11:77-83): This Surah also describes the people of Lut engaging in homosexual acts and their subsequent punishment by God, which was a rain of brimstone.

- Surah Al-Hijr (15:71-76): Similar to the above, it recounts the story of Lut and the divine punishment that befell his people.

- Surah Al-Ankabut (29:28-29): Here, Lut again expresses his disapproval of his people's actions, describing their practices as unprecedented in the world.

- Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:165-166): This Surah contains Lut's direct address to his people, questioning their attraction to men over women and calling it a transgression.

So with all that said, I can not recommend this game as such.

Since Stardew Valley released, every farming sim has to measure itself up next to it. 
And Coral Island is so much like Stardew Valley.
Dating works pretty much exactly the same, and so do farming, mining and animal husbandry.

However, gameplay wise, Coral Island is just so much better than SDV. There's farmwide chest access for crafting and cooking, sprintbursts for walking, the fishing minigame is Not from hell, and you can unlock forecasts for collecting critters and auto crafting. You can also unlock cooking recipes by experimenting, which I like so much better than having to watch TV every day.

How is the game worse?
Well... the visual story telling isn't great. According to the story, the player has just moved to an island that fell on hard times after an oil spill. And yes, there are some oil slicks, and some supernatural black tentacles you have to get rid off. A few trees with weird stinky clouds you need to heal. But otherwise, the island is...fine? More than fine, to be honest. Gorgeous beaches with the occasional bit of debris. Lush forrests, beautiful rivers and lakes, steaming hot springs. Luxurious, beautifully designed homes and public buildings with inbuilt furniture you definitely couldn't get without hiring a professional carpenter. This makes it hard to believe that we're not just visiting a very fine, very esteemed luxury island resort off season. 

The game is also very much not finished yet, even though it got out of early access. For example, they're still finishing up the merfolk storyline, and the big wedding update is yet to come.

Oh, and a personal gripe - the pet variety isn't wonderful.
It's fine on paper: 6 dogs, 9 cats, 2 bunnies, one lizard, 2 foxes. I mean, which cozy sim lets you decide between a fox, a bunny, a lizzard or a ""classic pet"", right? Too bad that 4 of the 9 cats are black with green eyes, 3 of the cats are brownish tabbies (also all of them the same eye color, green) and two of the dogs are pitties (both have ""Spike"" in their default name). Yes, I get it, the pets got included because of a patreon stretch goal, and all of them came from patrons, but it wouldn't have hurt to round out the selection.",1700685107,1700685107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, a nice and relaxing time.

If you've played Stardew Valley, then Coral Island will feel very familiar to you.

[h2]Some pros:[/h2]

 - An option to lengthen the duration of a day, so you can definitely get all that busywork done and still do some side activities.
 - Funny at times.
 - Whilst not easy to acquire early on, there are ways to automate things; I haven't really done much of this yet.

[h2]A few cons:[/h2]

 - There are still a few cases of missing description text (I've seen 'TBD' fairly often, and a few cases of CamelCase: 'MonsterLoot' for example).
 - Quest progress can be difficult to determine: one has you wait without notice for roughly two ingame weeks; another doesn't tell you to talk to the quest giver.
 - Some aspects of the [spoiler]Merfolk[/spoiler] could probably do with little helper quests to figure out how to progress with them.
 - Saving is done at the end of the day (on sleeping), which can be a bit of a pain if you're trying to play a quick session and being a bit of a completionist about things.

This game is just lovely. The design, story, characters, quests, relationships all make this game a really worthwhile purchase.

I started a new game since the release and enjoy playing it all the time.

If you love farming, mining, fishing, scavenging, fighting, loving and helping save villagers and the town itself, DEFINITELY give Coral Island a go!

I'm now 17 hours into this game and I absolutely love it!!! I'm super keen to see the next updates. Being able to take part in the events etc will be awesome. The diving is great, farming is great.

Looking back on all the farming games I played and then going into Coral Island, Coral island delivers a very familiar experience. You won't be lost, there is no way you won't know what to do. It has everything you encountered in all the farming games you've played in one package. From earning money through various things like Farming, Fishing, Animal Husbandry, Collecting, Scavenging and Going in Dungeons. At the same time you have this vast list of NPCs that makes the town very much alive. Aside from the initial 50+ NPCs you can Befriend or Romance (around 28 romance-able characters as of writing this review), you also have NPCs you can interact with that are there as other inhabitants of the island.

There is already a ton of stuff to do in Coral Island and from the looks of it, they're planning to add more in future updates. 

Good Art, Good Music, Good 3D designs and most important, a simple questline that drives motivation.
Everything I could ask for in a farming game.

One big reason for that is you can have more than 20 dateable characters inside this game which is insane.

The game really feels like a solid Stardew Valley in a 3D isometric representation; however, has several key things that make it unique.  Ocean exploration is fun, and adds a new dynamic to upgrading bug nets and fishing rods, the mines are diverse (4 tiers x 40 levels each, for 120 total levels), and there seem to be great crops to grow in each season.

I'm just approaching the portion of the game where you can start automation -- auto feeders, collectors, petting, and there's some farm / crop automation I'm yet to work with such as auto seeding, moving chests and so forth.

Despite all the great happenings with the game (and having a 1.0 release), there's still a bit to be done for the game to be fully complete.  Some items (like bones) are still flagged with TBD as the purpose, and some of the Main Story Quest is still incomplete.  I'm 75+ hours in though, and haven't run out of things to do; so, is it worth it?  Yes.  Would it be better if everything was done and polished?  Well, yes, but it isn't stopping the fun.

For those who haven't played, I think the best way to explain the game play would be to combine Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon. The seasonal events are very involved and they make cleaning up and restoring the island rewarding with the community center. The friend-able and date-able characters are diverse and it honestly makes it difficult to chose who I like best, which isn't necessarily a bad problem to have. I feel like I am able to take my time and get to know the characters since there is so much to do elsewhere in the game.

My favorite aspect so far is the ocean diving and clean-up. I feel like this is a unique addition to the game which I want to spend every day doing. I also LOVE catching bugs, every time I catch a new one I get so excited. All of the little shops around the island make it feel like a real community, which is nice. 

That being said, I feel like the area that I am struggling with loving is the mining. The combat system with the enemies has felt lackluster so far. I think it has to do with the low amount of dropped loot or the disconnection I feel between the enemy and their environment.

full release

Finished the altars (again) and the museum (again) - they deleted EA saves because of reasons and those reasons don't hold water

-Main quests work in progress
-Unfinished ocean content
-Max town rank cannot be achieved
-Ocean max rank cannot be achieved
-Museum with 100% donation does not achieve max rank
-Town heritage max rank cannot be achieved
-Savannah access does not exist
-Dig site unlock does not exist
-Altar rewards are insulting (catch a years worth of fish get small bait, literally 100 worth in money... aka nothing --- the rest are equally bad every single time)
-Altar completion rewards only 2/4 work
-Fishing, fossils, treasures, etc are terribly bad RNG
-NPC conversations often have ""has nothing more to say"" or are worded in garble
-Farming - auto harvesters/planters are still bugged
-Farming - auto chests are still bugged
-Farming - moving things at the farm is still bugged
-Farming - animals are still bugged (but not as often) and can go awol
-Levelup rewards are minimal and often have more negative than positive bonuses if taken
-Rings effects (buffs) turn themselves off constantly, you have to reequip them to get the benefit basically anytime you switch maps (enter a building, go to a different layer of the mine, etc) or they don't work
-Food effects are hit or miss for if the effect is actually applied - might be under the same conditions as rings
-Storage is an issue with 5 ranks of each item and each rank takes its own spot
-Catching is still bad hitboxes - using traps is infinitely easier
-NPC friendship rewards are minimal - ex give 100,000,000 in rare stuff, they will give ya 0.01 worth of stupid common stuff back
-Pets are bugged, more of a nuisance than anything
-Barn animals are mediocre for everything (source of income, difficulty to manage until you have auto stuff, things that need them)

Actually I'm done writing out a list, a hundred other major glaring issues exist...

""1.0"" review

I cannot in good faith recommend this game

The game is less stable than its last ""beta"" version

The game has had NOTHING added since the end of the 0.8v or whatever it was beta

The game has SEVERAL main quest progress bugs that are incredibly common and have been reported since the early days and not corrected

The game has SEVERAL ""WIP"" main quests

The game lacks the ability to save whenever, you can only save at the end of the day, and days can be long, you need to do stuff at night, so just hope you don't crash after doing 30-40+ minutes of stuff


etc etc etc

they took a step forward to launch the game
but they took twenty steps backwards at the same time

If you played Stardew or another farming sim you will know whats going on. But they have taken that standard and really mastered certain elements of it. If I use the highest quality goods to make wine, then that wine will be of the highest quality also. Makes sense!

What they do add is a beautiful underwater diving zone complete with its own few NPC and small villiage. It IS totally achievable to pick at it or complete it if you sacrifice other elements as you do. But its great and makes something that could have just been a environmental message into something that feels friendly and not overbearing. It has its own island Goddess and spirtuality and magic. And its a nice touch. 

The variety of crops is great and the fact you unlock more via improving your island's Town Rank is really rewarding. 

I would say that there a a few bugs underwater like the black roots not receding and blocking my view or getting stuck on nothing (very rarely). Also the character portraits are a little flat and not as vibrant as the rest of the game. Some look a little dis-proportioned. A lot of nice NPC if you like guys and not as much if you like girls (not awful just a little lopsided) I would prefer they either stuck to being faithful to a variety of body types for all or made everyone equally eyecandy.

It gives off the nostalgic feeling of Harvest Moon and the more recent Stardew Valley. Even though it reminds me of those games, it stands on its own identity with the addition of elements that makes it a wonderful game. The infusion of the Southeast Asian culture, specifically Indonesian culture, is one of its greatest features. It adds depth and immersion that makes it relatable while showcasing a culture rarely featured in mainstream media and games. 

Another feature that I adore is the diving feature. For those who love the ocean, this is one of the games to look out for. It even expands on that feature by adding fantasy elements (both from the local culture and from internationally known ones). In addition, this game is not just a game, it is a game for a cause, Saving the Ocean. Apart from providing entertainment, culture, and knowledge, it strives to further one of its causes, Saving the Ocean, by working with organizations like Coral Guardian.

Admittedly, even if it is a wonderful game that has a great potential, it is not yet complete. There are still features or functionalities that are under development/testing and I would have expected it to be included in the 1.0 release. Having an understanding of the game development process, it is understandable. The development team did release a roadmap and has consistently updated the community on the progress of the game.

The potential this game has is absolutely massive and that is easy to see; i'm having a blast with the farming aspects, the underwater section is amazing and the mines are classic mines, simple and fun. 

However, the game advertises completely fleshed out relationships, marriage systems, adoption, pet adoption, etc. This is simply false. The social aspect of this game is so far behind it is disingenuous to call this a full release. The dialogues keep repeating i.e characters being excited you moved in even though you're far into the game and have multiple hearts with them, marriage dialogues are bugged, and overall the relationships at this point in time seem very shallow. I have personally not reached the merfolk section yet, but i have heard that the bachelors aren't finished either.

I have not experienced this myself lately, but two very big story quests are also unfinished, and once you reach a certain point in the game, the quest dialogue just says W.I.P and you cannot proceed further. Unacceptable for a full release game imo.

Other than that, performance so far seems ok. Some minor stutters here and there (bearing in mind my laptop has a 30 series graphics card, 16gb ram and a good cpu), but i am not too far into the game so it is hard to say. I have heard the performance on all of the consoles at the moment is horrendous and maybe acceptable for a game in beta, but not full release.

TL;DR: The farming aspects of this game are very very fun and entertaining, and i have played 11 hours of this game just for that alone. The graphics are beautiful and in 2024, this game has potential to be one of the greatest farming sims. However, the relationships and the story are unfinished which is a big shame.",1700652307,1700652307,False,3,0,0.516417741775512695,0,True,False,False

Biggest pro so far are characters, heart events are mostly wholesome, if you just want to escape your daily life and look at thighs and pecs while wistfully reading 2 lines of dialog about current weather - its an alright game, however:

1) It's not finished yet: I played early access before and there was a lot of stuff that looked like a placeholder or a WIP, but now that the game is released those things are still there, as if someone just said ""eh, good enough"" Like im not a fan of dungeon combat but its rediculoius that you have this full moveset with a sword, but if you equip a hammer its just 1 attack animation which you spam. The whole town in its current state makes much more sence as a tourist reliant resort-town, hence why everyone care so much about the town rating, but tourists arent in the game yet. Let's charge full price now
2) The core themes are very shallow: like we have a corporation thats just evil for no reason(ok thats true irl but they could have given it some nuance at least), locals who say stuff like ""welcome to our tight-knit community"" but not realy behaving like one, in the beggining the game tells you that the town is at its lowest, but from the start it looks like a prosperous paradice. One of the reasons people like stardew valley was because it didnt shy away from dark themes, and here everything tries its hardest to be as cozy and as sweet as possible as to not inconvenience you with any negative emotion whatsoever. Overall it feels either very naive or like someone tried to emulate whatever it is the younglings are into
3) All the mechanics look borrowed from different games without much extra thought. Bug catching has this same animation of showing off your catch as animal crossing, it has a museum, tool upgrades and GOD DAMN bundles, and it all feels just added for no reason other than ""we need to have all the cozy game mechanics"". The dungeon, though somewhat different and unique, still functions the same as stardews, which feels weird somehow. Like in stardew it was much easier to suspend my disbelief because it was simplistic in its presentation, coral island however tries to recreate all those mechanics in a different stile and in the end it feels awkwardly stuck in between. And the only thing that feels unique is the diving and merfolk, but that storyline isnt finished yet, and moving around without dashing feels like a chore
 Despite all that I still want to try and like this game somehow. Have very little hope of things changing, but if they do - id be happy to change my review",1700643114,1700643114,False,4,0,0.551984488964080811,0,True,False,False

But I would only recommend this if you are aware that there is still a lot to be implemented and you will eventually hit a road block in some things. I don't know if the current save files will eventually be made obsolete like the EA ones, but I'm preparing for that as well.

Some thoughts...

[b] Story [/b]
Haven't played much of the quests so can't really comment on them, so far it seems ok. The Island seems to be based on South-East Asia/n culture which is unique and pretty interesting.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
[list]
    [*]Standard Farming Sim gameplay. I actually enjoy mining and combat which is very rare. Thought the mines were easy to clear.
    [*]The economy is pretty forgiving which could be a plus/minus depending on what you like. 
    [*]There's a few QOL options, including: disable combat until you strike first, extend days.
[/list]

[b] Characters [/b]
[list]
    [*]The characters can be quite good/sweet, though they're not all that remarkable and a few probably could've been merged together. The dialogue can be very cute at higher hearts with some NPCs.
    [*]Haven't done dating/romance so can't comment on that.
    [*]Gifting is [spoiler] very easy because flowers are universally liked and are abundant as forage in all seasons (except winter maybe? I haven't reached it yet but even so I have plenty from previous seasons left over). [/spoiler]
    [*]Some of the NPC dialogue assumes that our character has said something to them which they are replying to and it sometimes implies that the PC has said something rude which I don't like. (one with Charles where iirc [spoiler] it implies
the PC calls him lazy and he gets upset. [/spoiler]
[/list]

[b] Random [/b]
[list]
    [*]I don't get the TV, maybe it's because the channels haven't been fully implemented or something, but the same dialogue repeats often and some of the shows (idols) seem pointless. Others like the cooking/late night shows are really not funny, though that is entirely subjective. I don't bother watching the TV anymore, only for weather or tips. The art is cute though.

Sometimes on controller, the game glitches and won't let your character move if you're going down and to the right at an angle that isn't precisely 45 degrees.

The game softlocks if you accidentally pick up a tool in the crafting menu then go up to craft. You can craft, you can never leave the menu, so you need to alt tab out of the game and start the day over.

It is definitely a cozy farming game you can spend an evening with a hot cup of tea. It is VERY similar to Stardew Valley in terms of gameplay, such as completing bundles, farming, relationships, down to the quirky character that sells you hats in the woods. Coral Island did introduce some new mechanics such as diving, which I really enjoyed, but stuck largely to the same formula. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing because it feels familiar. Games within a genre often reuse the same tropes and mechanics, and that might be because those are effective. But if you are looking for something drastically different from Stardew Valley, look elsewhere. 

Hands down, my favorite parts of Coral Island are diving and exploration under the sea. I haven't gotten to the Mermaid Kingdom but I am totally looking forward to that. Another favorite is the South East Asian setting that feels fresh and different enough from the usual western world based games. I am from South East Asia (so I may be biased), and was very excited to see representation of our food, and even the diversity present in the region in people, lives, food, language, cultures etc. Also, there are Durian, Mangosteens, and all these tropical fruits I grew up with and that warms my heart!

I think Coral Island is a worthwhile timesink if you are a fan of this genre (which I am) or as the first entry into the genre (if you have not played Stardew or similar games). It is a well-done cozy farming game, and checks all the boxes in that sense, and would be really exciting for someone newly venturing into this genre. There are characters different enough to want to get to know, a new setting, a storyline with varying branches, yet the gameplay is familiar enough to ease into. It is fun enough to start a new adventure with, has gorgeous graphics (not pixel art) and plenty of content. I did experience some crashes after the 1.0 update, but it is no longer occuring now so I think that was just some growing pains. I am excited about the post launch updates too, and can't wait to see how the game grows.

This negative review is primarily about the developer or the publisher's decision to release this game as a 1.0 version, when it is clearly not. It should have stayed in EA. There are other highly followed games on Steam which came into EA before Coral Island, and are still in EA. There was no need to rush this to a false 1.0 release.

Now granted I personally have not reached this point, but as others have mentioned, you will hit a point in the MAIN questline where you get a dialog box saying ""WIP"". This is unacceptable for a 1.0 ""completed"" release. Post 1.0 roadmap should be adding end game content, not finishing up the main questline.

My specs are good enough to handle ultra settings on games much more graphically intensive than this game. However on this game, I experience stuttering and pop ins as I move around. It is very noticeable and occurs frequently, spoiling the immersion and enjoyment of the game. Catching bugs with your net is a game mechanic, and I have had several instances of bugs appearing on the edge of my screen, and just pop out of existence as I walk halfway toward them.

I bought the game on EA to support the devs and encourage them to produce a good 1.0 release, and I was really excited for this game. I am disappointed in the ""1.0"" release that my support produced, and my negative review is to encourage the devs and the publisher to fix their mistake.

TL;DR: DO NOT buy this game in its current state. It is not a 1.0 game right now. Wait to see if the devs complete their roadmap and release updates that actually make it a full game.",1700622061,1700622061,False,3,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

The attention to detail with the art and assets, particularly the interior of buildings and the environment around the island, is impressive.

For the first time in any of these games the town and its people feel dynamic. They change their clothes. Mix up their routines. Have conversations with one another. They can be seen doing numerous activities around town on any given day. One might watch you as you pass by or step aside to avoid you as you careen through town. Their dialog is dynamic, with them mentioning current events. It's really cool.

The game is quite buggy though. Sometimes you can't catch an insect with your net. Occasionally you can't get a special event to start, or at least one of the mini games within it. There's starts to quest lines that simply won't work - such as delivering an item you find to the NPC it belongs to. So far I haven't come across any egregious or game breaking bugs, but all of the little annoyances do add up.

Even with the bugs I think this is the best of the genre out right now. I daresay it might even be better than my beloved Stardew Valley.

Pros
-Very diverse characters 
-Beautiful artwork and animation 
- The diving feature is super interesting i love the merfolk lore so far 
- I love the environmental involvement in game play 
- There is a wide range of NPCs to date and build friendships with 
-The controls are easy to use and easy to understand 


Cons 
Since the 'Official' 1.0 launch I have noted the fallowing issues that could possible be reason to either wait to buy or not buy. 

- Issues with many different NPCs 10 heart events with in turns means you cannot marry or move forward with them till its fixed 
-Issues with missing dialog I get the same 3-4 lines from almost NPCs 
- Feels very unpolished and the story is still not finished I expect this in beta not a official launch 
- The mines have poor drop rates its i could spends many in game days and get very little loot 
- A few bugs that are annoying but not game breaking- I cannot walk up any steps, tools being duplication with enchanting or chest items duplicating when upgrading barn/coop- I got 'stuck' a few times causing me have to restart the game 
- Audio issues where its just nothing or weird sounds for no reason 
- Something arent explained in game at or are explained poorly 

Over all I will say I have enjoyed the game and wont pretend i haven't but I am disappointed with this official launch it clearly is unfinished and wasn't ready to move from EA. Coral Island has a ton of potential and this could be up there with Stardew. Its just not there yet. I hope some hotfixes come soon to fix some issues I have pointed out and I know this even close to all the bugs people have been dealing with including some bugs that just make it unplayable.

I enjoy playing stardew valley and similar games but something about the way Coral Island all comes together just scratches the itch of farming sims. They have it all from farming and mining to fishing and even bug catching (which can be quite tricky early on) but thats not all the festivals and community center are fantastic as well as the addition of adoptable pets. Where else can you adopt a bunny or reptile along instead of a cat or dog? Then you have the underwater location and mermaid kingdom. All in all if you want a game that has all the staples but then stands on its own by making them all better this is the game.

EDIT: The mechanics are still very akin to Stardew (even down to digging up the ground around town for artifacts/books), but the devs are definitely working for the game to have its own charm. One bonus, so far there is no choice to side with the environment destroying business rolling up into town, you gotta go the eco route, which I appreciate (only because the corp route was so BORING). I still agree that the townsfolk are far more interesting to me, I know people say otherwise but this town is full of REALISTIC adults. Not a bunch of teenagers who are vapid stereotypes (again, sorry stardew lovers, but we all know the marriage candidates in that game are picking between a bunch of teenage movie tropes).

I look forward to seeing how the devs continue to flesh out this game, and for anyone who is curious if early access is worth it here: they have been very consistent with updates (every 1-3 months) and each major update has a solid amount of new content added. So far, it is worth it.

This game has sooo much to do. I absolutely love cleaning up the ocean! 
I don't get why people call this a Stardew clone... It's the same genre of game, but I don't recall diving in the sea and cleaning up the ocean in Stardew!

Farming is so fun. So many different things you can unlock to help automate your farm. 
Ranching is great fun too! The animals are adorable! I also enjoy that you have to work your way up your town rank to unlock more. 
Mining : great times. The enemies need to chill though.
Bug Hunting: Can be frustrating with a basic net, but overall a great time! A little buggy at times. (pardon the pun)
Fishing: I see others complain about the fishing mechanic, but I actually really enjoy it. It's not super easy that it's boring, but it's not too complicated to be frustrating. 
Foraging. I absolutely love going around collecting the random stuff each season has to offer!

NPC;s/ dateables: There are SO MANY PEOPLE to talk to and befriend  . It is kind of overwhelming at first, and I hope more dialogue becomes available in the future, because characters repeat themselves somewhat often. But it's great that when the seasons change, their outfits change as well! 

Cons:
Okay I get it, a lot of farming sims do not have a manual save feature. But MAN. This game sure does enjoy crashing sometimes right at the end of a long day of being productive, and poof, progress gone. Please, if there is any way to add some sort of manual save, or even auto save feature after every hour or so to help combat these crash issues.

The good:

The game is really fun if you like farming Sims. And it's got some beautiful places and NPCs. The activities are plenty and if you played Stardew Valley you will see many familiarities with it.

The bad:

Heart events are missing for a considerable number of characters, some storyline points are still a work in progress with no acceptable end, still some small visual glitches, and weird relationship progression with NPCs (suddenly the NPC you've been investing your gifts and time with goes back to talking to you like a stranger) definitely are a plague they will have to overcome.

Coral Island is incredible. It is so relaxing, has a wide variety of mechanics, amazing art, beautiful graphics, dynamic characters, and so much more. AND IT IS ONLY IN EARLY ACCESS!

Everything in this game is done to such an amazing, above-and-beyond degree. For example (without spoiling too much) the mine in the game is broken up into unique sections and seems to have its own lore. Combat is so fluid and satisfying. The crops for farming are huge in size and that makes them adorable to me. There's also a HUGE variety of plants you can grow right from the start of the game. The gathering is simple, but the graphics/art for the plants you are gathering is so beautiful. I am so impressed by the amount of detail that went into drawing the icon for every character, animal, and item in the game. The characters all have unique, dynamic personalities and are a diverse cast. Bug catching has unique mechanics, but is very fun and I cannot wait to master it. Fishing is SO satisfying and relaxing. The diving mechanic is basically equivalent to a second mine, but holds different items and is so addicting I've become sucked into it like a literal whirlpool. The festivals in the game are so detailed, lively, and fun! The town and island itself feels teeming with life--from the gentle sounds of the water to the people to the wild animals all around.

The game is in early access, and that means that yes, there is some jankiness. But that will smooth out over time and nothing I have experienced so far has dampened my experience. There have been some features that haven't been added yet, but the developers have announced that these will be addressed in future updates. I am so excited for the plans the developers have for the game, as I have been blown away by everything I've seen so far.

Please note that I have barely touched version 1.0 and as such, haven't tried auto chests yet.

I've played for a few months throughout the last two major updates and have looked up how stable the game is now that it's out of early access and it seems the stability issues have not been fixed, so my feedback still stands as of now.

CORAL ISLAND is a pleasant take on the Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley farm sim, with a twist: you're here to save the entire island from pollution and greedy corporations. So, a bit like fighting Joja Mart but with trash-picking. The comparisons don't end there: the farming, fishing, mining and dungeon-hunting will feel oddly familiar if you've played other farm sims before.

What's new is that there's an entire underwater region to explore, an actually explored mystery/magical story line and events that don't feel like afterthoughts. You know how, in some farm sim games, seasonal events feel like they're there to do ONE thing (sell a certain seed, give you a certain currency) but really fail to make an impact on the narrative? Here, events feel properly developed and are a big part of the story, fleshing out characters more than I'm accustomed to in other farm sims.

And let's mention the NPCs. Not only are they all beautiful (what are Coral Island people eating to look like this?!?) but they all have actual personalities! You will gel with some more than others but that's normal, that's life. They don't feel like caricatures or stereotypes, like a certain beer-guzzling bus driver from another popular farm sim, you know...

There ARE downsides to the game. None of the game mechanics are super complex. While other games will tier-gate mechanics and offer drastic differences between tiers, you'll feel here that the changes are... light. And the options are also light. But that's okay, not every game needs four tiers of sprinklers! This game prefers to give you more options of things to do (bug-hunting, actual adventurer bounties, helping the lab study the sea, etc) rather than give you 2-3 very complex game loops. The result, for min-maxers like me, is a game that asks that you let go of your Excel spreadsheet and take time to relax and care about the community-building aspects of farm sims. Yes, the farming is there but you won't lose sleep over it.

Finally, because I've mentioned it above... the game is not super stable, even now. UE crashes will happen and if you're like me, you'll likely end up at some point stuck in a crash loop that you can't get rid of. I was lucky to have a full in-game year's worth of gameplay before it happened but these crashes are still happening today. There are reports of crashes happening when you give out items at the museum, with certain events, with auto-chests, etc. The fact that you can't really save whenever you want means these crashes will ruin days of playtime. Hopefully though, these will eventually go away. We know Stairway Games is aware and they're working on it. The dev feedback has actually been pretty solid so far during early access, so it's only a matter of time.",1700599720,1700599879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Exploring the island, farming, donating to the museum. It's amazing to see the game grow and getting more and more content.

After all those hours I spend on my farm and the progress I made I needed to start all over. But luckily I could take at least the money I made with me. I just wish I could get all the animals from the shelter, it's hard to decide which to get, since they're all adorable and lovely.

Others clearly ran into much worse problems than myself. I had a really enjoyable 30 hours until I ran into problem after problem, it was on the fast track for me to declare it as one of the greats if it kept up with the experience I had but the further you got the more things deteriorated.

... is a really promising new 3D farming game.

I really don't understand all the negative reviews.
Pretty much all farming games these days are very similar, and anyone comparing it to Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon should take a step back.

I can think of a dozen things that SV has in common with Harvestmoon, and no one complained.
Hot Springs? - YES in SV, Wylde Flowers, Story of Seasons and ongoing, Harvest festivals? - YES in SV, SoS, WF and ongoing...

All new farm games will always have various things in common and thats good, for a reason! Because we really like them! 

The art-style and characters are nothing like SV or any other game i encounterd. Clearly somethings are ,,veeery'' similar to like Stardew Valley but in the End, it will not harm Eric Baron or his masterpiece of Stardew Valley in any kind. He himself once said he took various other games as examples. I hate plagiatism, thats true but i dont see the point here. 

I like the work the devs did here and the world in this game is full of life, even if the game is in really early - early access. The art is beautiful and the museum is a happy place itself. I was full of joy while exploring the museum [spoiler] after the first upgrade, when you donated 50 things  [/spoiler]. I really like the ideas for a varied combat system and the mines, it gives you the feeling of being able to design the fights individually. 

There is a lot to explore and craft on your way through Coral Island and you may even see a [spoiler] mermaid! in the ocean [/spoiler]

I am really looking forward what the devs will do with this game! I will update this review from time to time.

I have never been this fixated on a game out of all the games that I have played that has similar elements to Coral Island; farming, fishing, building etc. Even though I recently bought this game and thought that maybe I'm like this due to the fact that it's a new game, I don't think that's the main reason. I believe that what the game has offered its different yet similar elements is what has gotten me so addicted and so fixated on it. E.g. Diving, cleaning and healing the ocean as well as meeting turtles who give you gifts when you save them. 

The only thing 'I don't like' about this game is simply the bug-catching mechanics.

The farming is standard but enjoyable. The museum and collecting is great! The mines are fun (though I feel there needs to be tweaks to how and how often the next level stairs appear). And the quest lines and stories are nice :)

What isn't fine is the fact that the game seems to lack a significant amount of polish. Crashes, lag, weird dialogue triggering (Somebodies wife/husband congratulating us on our engagement ... to them ... days after our own weddings?). 

Entire quest lines are unfinished, ending in simple WIP tags and to be continued - after the 1.0 release.

I really feel like some of the costs and values need significant tweaking. Moving a farm building costs money, destroying it costs over 3 times that? Clothes, and appliance seem prohibitively expensive. After upgrading the house to have a kitchen, you can't even cook unless you drop another 3k on an oven.

This game is 90% bugs and glitches that it is beyond insane how unpolished it is. Obviously these will most likely be fixed as time goes on, but a v1.0 release should have at least minimum levels of polish done. What is this a Bethesda title on launch?

[b]List of Bugs/Glitches/ETC I have found:(There is actually significantly more by other players, this is just what I found myself from 20 hours of game-play.)[/b]

[list]
    [*]Weapons would clip out your hand and onto your hips.

    [*]Hit detection in combat is beyond broken. Attacks that are suppose to hit do not while some do making for a confusing experience.

    [*]Enemies take a second longer to die which causes them to attack even though they are suppose to die. After hitting, they finally go down which causes chip damage.

    [*]Pet Race will have some NPCs just cheat 100%. A few NPCs didn't even have a pet following and just sprints to the end without stopping making it impossible to win.

    [*]There is literally a gate fence in the race that prevents anyone from running in the race. LMAO

    [*]Even though an insect is alerted and tries to flee, you sometimes fail to catch it even though it is within your net's grasp. It sometimes allows it and other times it fails.

    [*]Sometimes your character will carry items in their hands way above their heads. 

    [*]Fishing hides the HUD which is fine, but it will often persist after finishing the mini-game. Requires you to press ESC twice to go back to normal.

    [*]When trying to mine or cut objects near the end of your character's reach. it sometimes allows it and other times it doesn't. There is no consistency.

    [*]Tons of micro-stutter or macro-stutter when travelling around. I noticed this happening often underwater sections. I am terrified if it crashes I will have to redo the entire day again.

    [*]This end-of-day save system is hot garbage. I honestly don't care what the reasoning for it. It is a bad mechanic and I am tired of seeing other farming games use this. Especially how buggy and glitchy this game is, it is a constant fear that I will crash in the middle of the day. I can't wait for a potential mod that fixes this similar to what Stardew Valley has.

    [*]Your character will get stuck on the terrain as there are a lot of out-of-bounds and weird dead zone areas. Especially near the stairs of the town.

    [*]The Big Slime monster in the wind cave will accidentally throw a slime outside making it impossible to reach and kill.

    [*]Very rare moments where the rope downwards doesn't show on a few floors in the Forest Cave.

    [*]The rope item recipe costs 199 stone to create [b]Hemp rope[/b] LOL. Ayo what are we making here? An Onyx Pokemon? I heard there was a game-play reason for this, but come on you could have easily made a new item for this.

    [*]When you are trying to activate the sun relic power itself in the underwater section. if you stand underneath the beacon when it comes out you will get stuck 100%. Either you have to use unstuck(which skips a day), leave and restart the whole day, or be lucky that the anchor drops on you for to leave.

    [*]You can also soft-lock yourself out of the game's options menu if you put any keybind under the E key as it's the same one as ""Apply"" button. So you can't make any setting changes from it. The only fix for this is to use a controller and reset the keybind back.

    [*]The UI gets stuck when you load in from your save for the first time. Causing you to restart the load to fix.

    [*]Romances are completely broken for many of the characters. Marriage dialogues are completely fucked and nonsensical as your spouse congratulates you on your marriage(wut). Or they act like they are your bf/gf when we are just friends.

    [*]Constant white squares on character icons on the map screen. Meaning there is an error loading in their icons.

    [*]Characters icons on the map sometimes get stuck staying large as if you hovered over them when you didn't.

    [*]Lag when opening up the map screen. 

    [*]No way to put down any way points or markers on the map screen as the game has no mini-map. Making navigation a pain in the ass especially when you are looking for a specific NPC.

    [*]A lot of typos in some of the dialogue and descriptions.

    [*][b]Main quest ends in ""WIP"" is the biggest insult to all your players who have purchased this game with the belief that it is a full release version.[/b] (Found out about this from other players)

    [*]Half of the content is apparently going to be released in 2024 that was promised. So players who have been playing beforehand suffered a save wipe for little to no good reason. What's to stop these developers from doing another save wipe in the future?

    [*]A few of the content shown in the v1.0 trailer are not even accessible yet. That is 100% false advertising or publisher negligence.

    [*]And much much more bugs that I didn't even list as other players had even more unique encounters. If anyone else has their own list or experience with bugs share them down in the comments. Because I have seen a lot of them on the Steam Forums, Reddit, and their own Discord.
[/list]

The design of the characters alone should make anyone buy it. The amount of diversity in the cast is amazing !

The farming aspect of the game is quite different as well from other games ! They have a bunch of new tools and items to use to help your farming life more easy and fun ! The game itself not only has your typical dateable characters and farming aspect but also introduces diving and not only do you get to know the characters in more depth but also uncover all different secrets in the world including the existence of mermaids ! I also really love the use of recycling and helping clean up after an oil spill disaster ! Also getting to fill up a museum with creatures,gems, artifacts, etc that i spent so much time farming feels so so rewarding! I truly truly recommend this game to everyone ! It's family friendly and also has some options for those who may need certain features such as colorblind options and dyslexic font options !

I was very excited for the release of this game but held off on early access because I prefer playing completed games. The early release was unexpected but a seemingly pleasant surprise, so I made the purchase..

This is out of early access in title only and saying it is a finished game is disingenuous at best. I’m not sure if this was rushed ahead to make holiday but it is far from complete.  I’ve experienced crashes, and bugs where I have lost items/progress, the NPCs are incomplete and hollow.  Dating is non-existent. Apparently, a bunch of these things are being released at a later date but the average buyer might just assume a game claiming it is complete on its surface and being charged full price is finished.  Why was this released on consoles as well? The PC version is not ready. I don’t know what they were thinking. I did not mind waiting but I do mind what feels like deceptive marketing. I wish I could request a refund. Sick of false advertising with unfinished games.

One thing I need to highlight is that this has the worst movement of any life sim I've ever played. The player character is slow, slower than whatever you're picturing in your head. Even when ""Sprinting"" which is really more of a power walk. The system to unlock fast travel is tedious and it begins by unlocking the most useless fast travel locations first. Finally, you don't get a horse until way late into the game. I can't help but compare it to my favorite game in this genre of this year, My Time at Sandrock, where you can get your horse within the first two hours.

It is also difficult to consider the game as a finish product so far, item with description still saying TBD, a lot of things that have no purpose, puzzles obviously not finished, it's more like version 0.8 than 1.0 at the moment. 
I would suggest to buy the game in about 6 months when patches have fixed the issues (if they ever are cause some are real old) and the game is actually finished.

- I have an item in my inventory that literally says in its description ""TBD"" ????
- The merfolk stuff you have seen all throughout the marketing is NOT OUT. You can go in the ocean, find their city, and grind a lot to clean up, but it ultimately feels empty because you can't have a meaningful narration or romance with the characters there.
- Even the ""on land"" stuff isn't completed. After clearing the mines, without spoilers, I discover a mystery, and the quest on the quest log literally starts with [WIP]. So you don't even have the narrative completion of what you start doing.

These are only the things I have encountered so far, and they're not isolated issues. The game clearly not having mid to late game content throws off the whole balancing of the story. Some things feel too rushed, and I think it's  because the devs might not have a comprehensive view of their game in order to fine tune the pacing.

If you're okay with having this kind of experience, by all means, get the game now. It's cute and extremely enjoyable otherwise. It does so many things right. I love the different outfits, the loveable characters that make it very hard to choose who to romance, all the festivals, the cute cutscenes that give a lot of insight, the decor styles that show you how a room might look, the outfits, the fact that you can jump over fences, etc etc. This game does SO MANY THINGS RIGHT.

Objective number 1 could be done within 1st in game month, but the 2nd objective couldn't be done because you don't have the necessary tools/items. That items/tools is locked behind Town Rank, in this case B rank (acording the wiki).

You're able to customize your character, decide whatever relationship preference you prefer, see the location of all NPCs on an easy-to-read map at all times, easily access shop times, collect items to donate or offer, and enjoy several skill building activities. These activities include farming, fishing, bug catching, ranching, mining, diving, and fighting. It's pretty chill and has a crap ton of stuff to do as long as you have that sweet sweet stamina (stamina can be increased by working on skills). Despite what my notes say below I really enjoy it. It's my go-to cozy game when I'm having a blah day. I do believe that there is much more that could be done for CI, but for what's there this is a pretty solid game. I can tell that the team has worked hard.

Additional Notes:
- Though I do not have a problem with it I realize that the game is not easily accessible to those of our fellow players who have disabilities. There are alternatives out there that make this game user friendly, but I will not be listing such alternatives here as people get all Taco Bell spicy. Just Google it, man.
- Fighting is optional if you set your enemy setting to only start encounters/fight you if you ""aggro"" them (meaning if you smack them with a weapon then they'll attack you).
- You can have a child with the NPC you marry.
- There are little minigames per festival/community event. The minigames are a bit difficult.
- The pet appears just as useless as every other pet sidekick in most cozy farm games.
- The controls are relatively simple compared to others I have played on for PC, but you can easily change the keybindings.
- You can easily make a heterosexual looking male character...... (dunno what's got that one reviewer's breeches in a twist)
- There will be times where your NPC dialogue will be repetitive, but honestly, you should expect this. I've yet to come across a game that doesn't have repetitive dialogue in ""cozy"" games.
- Taco the dog is precious.
- The developers appears to heavily focus on feedback on their Discord. Discussions on Steam are primarily supported by players.",1700429177,1700429177,True,0,0,0.491982519626617432,0,True,False,False

Here is what I like:
-The colorful world and diverse characters
-28 romancable characters 
- The focus on environmentalism and cleaning up the island around you
-There are quite a few festivals, that have a variety of new themes I haven't seen in other games in this genre  (although I personally find the mini games frustrating)
-Theres a lot to do: farming (theres plenty of farming animals to chose from), fishing, mining, bug catching, cooking. And a museum to fill up with all your collected items 
-A lot of character customization options (including pronouns and body types) and clothing 
-You can change the exterior style of your house and farm buildings

Issues I have with the game:
-The full story is not released, there are items marked as TBD
-The character lack distinct personality, they have about 3 lines a day that repeat pretty often. If you date or marry these characters, their lines barely change
-You can adopts pets. But only one pet and they don't currently do anything other than stand in their bed, and move around every so often
-There are mermaids, but their story isn't finished yet either
-I have had lag issues, freezing issues and occasional crashing issues. I assume these will be fixed in an update soon

Here are some notable features coming in 2024 (unclear on if it will be free or paid. I assume they will be free but you never know these days):
-Tourist system
-Hangout/Dating mechanic
-A big Merfolk update
-Ocean farming and ranching
-More story
-Children update (you can have children in the game currently, but I assume this will add more to them)
-Savannah access
-Island visit

I really am enjoying playing the festivals also it breaks up the month as you play and they have such cute wholesome themes like the tree planting, cherry blossom and pets/animals festivals. I really appreciate the individuality of that in this game rather than just doing the typical Easter, Christmas and Halloween alternatives especially since personally i don't celebrate them and they made me uncomfortable in other games. I can't wait to see this game continue to be developed and to see new features being added. Its really awesome!

I've had the game since early access and playing post 1.0 update you can see how much thought they put into the game, the stories, the characters, everything. Also, for reference, I just hit fall in the 1.0 gameplay so some things may change as far as mechanics, character dev, etc. and pre-1.0 I was in winter.

Favorite things: 
- the npcs and their storylines/designs
- the artwork is just *chef's kiss*
- the overall storyline has pulled me in so much, i've never wanted to read every line in a game so bad 
- THE EVENTS!! 
- some of the in-game mechanics that other similar games need mods for (npc locations, crafting from chests anywhere)

Things that need work: 
- some of the npc lines coding is bugged or not sure the best word but it'll show part of the coding instead of your name
- i remember work on the price of objects so you couldn't exploit the economy (which i like!) but sometimes it feels as though the economy is skewed still (too close to home lmao -- also note here, bc i had the early release i started my latest farm with 100k ish and ran through that pretty quick)
- some of the resources for craftables (looking at you sprinklers) feels too grindy

things i hate:
- bug catching (skill issue, idc i hate it)
- not being able to give gifts to the merfolk
- walter (spoiler: be nice to your child or i will find a mod to allow me to punch you in the throat)",1700402111,1700402111,True,0,0,0.490950226783752441,0,True,False,False

I'm sorry to break it to you. Some things in this game feel too much like WIP.

[list]
[*]Emma's Taco Truck is set dressing. But why? It could just sell tacos. Having an establishment be set dressing is so immersion-breaking that you cannot convince me this was an executive decision, it undoubtedly was a corner cut to fulfill a deadline;
[*]The monsters in the mine pose no threat whatsoever (the player is too bulky - needs balancing ASAP). Some other player called the monsters ""squishy rocks"", and yeah, that's accurate, they pose as much thereat as a rock;
[*]When finishing an errand, the task giver will simply say ""Thank you"". All of them. Considering how rich all the other dialogues with all characters are, I can confidently say this is a placeholder text.
[*]And finally, the reason why I decided to write this review in the first place - after breaking the big incandescent boulder (that no character ever mentions btw), I found a completely empty area and immediately fell out of bounds. Talk about anticlimactic. I'm still giving the devs the benefit of the doubt here. [b]Maybe[/b] I was supposed to reach a trigger that would teleport me elsewhere, and the trigger failed because of some bug. After all, I can't think of any reason why a finished game would lead the player to a completely empty (and obviously not properly tested) area after the player cleared a fixed map obstacle.

I recommend this game for people who like to build up a base, who like to improve skills, relationships, tools, and expand the layout of the land.

As you can tell I put some time into the game mostly over the course of the beta and then having to restart once 1.0 came out. If the game was still in beta then a lot of what I'm going to say would be excusable but with a 1.0 release it's really not. I had an NPC say '-Insert name of character here-. Theres a quest that still says 'WIP' in its description. Theres a festival where there was no dialog with anyone in the town. The only impact of increasing your friendship with the people in the town is so you can get recipes or romance. Even the romance its self is lack luster. Theres really only two 'romantic' events per love interest and they're good but lacking.  The 'wedding' was about 30 seconds long and it had practically no impact on anything else. A couple of new dialog and no gift limit but no interactions or activities. Now this last one is just a nitpick and left me a little confused. They created an NPC with stretch marks and a child but when it comes to your character and their spouse theres little content. You get a prompt after getting 15 hearts asking if you want to have a child. No new dialog with spouse about it. After a certain amount of time, you go to bed and you get a little prompt basically saying you adopted a kid. Ok? You have no problems highlighting uh certain body parts but have issue with uh i guess natural conception? If your wondering what im talking about with the highlighting body parts just talk to everyone at the beach during summer. They wanted to emphasize a banana in the shorts for a couple characters.

They've now pushed it to 1.0 and are calling it a ""full"" game. It's not a full game. It's not finished. Not just rough around the edges, but main storyline sections are completely unfinished to the point that you get overtly told ""WIP"" during gameplay. My biggest praise from Early Access was the nuanced dialogue and interesting conversations I had with NPCs. They felt really fleshed out. I was so excited to see that in 1.0 but the creators seem to have stripped back so much dialogue and I do not understand why. NPCs say the same thing all day every day, even though one of them is at maximum relationship and is officially my boyfriend he continues to say the same lines that I got right at the start of the game. He makes no acknowledgement that we are in a relationship. No-one does. This game has been completely ruined by greedy developers and greedy publishers rushing it to the finish line and removing content to ensure it works adequately. But no. I put 80+ hours into Early Access. I've found now after 30 hours that swathes of content are missing and I am changing my review to Do Not Recommend because of it.






ORIGINAL REVIEW: Even though it's early access there's clearly so much here, I'm barely scratching the surface even after 23 hours. My chief praise would be the dialogue. The characters really feel like real people who have lives without you. You can watch them go to the park for a sandwich before work, and if you talk to them they will say how they love doing that. They tell you what they got for another NPC for their birthday last week. They really do seem to have real lives and feel like believable real people. Only thing I would say is it's very skint on tutorials, so you have to teach yourself a fair bit, but it's always fun. Also the music comes in and out a bit abruptly and often you are left in silence, I think it would be better if the music was more frequent or even permanent.",1665928118,1700337057,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Old Review ""Currently not recommending until there is some kind of save outside of the bed. As the game crashes from time to time, that means ALL progress you did that day will be gone. Maybe they will have something in the final version. Until then i don't need to spend hours on a day only to have it lost because of lack of features.""

New - Again I still cannot recommend this game. Even in the final version its unfinished... 

This game is extremely simple, bought a house, coop, barn, animals, mill, silo and bunch of other milestones in the first month.

The game is beautiful but still poorly designed with a ton of clipping, animals going through other animals, walls. The 2d designs are wonderful everyone is hot and no ugly people allowed. The 3d designs less so, very close to looking like some cheap. mobile game rips

The story is much the same as every other farming sim before it... Big bad corpo wants/has ruined the town and you gotta stop it. 

I do love the cultural aspects of the game diverting from some boring cookie cutter town from other farm sims. Its beautiful and well done. 

Character design is bland, poor and virtually non-existant. Also everyone is Asian. You have no choice. 
The player character feels very disconnected with the in-game characters right from the start.. especially concerning the heart events which with most don't seem to actually involve the player character at all. You are just watching from afar or not even present. There is not alot of dialogue that changes. Just pretty bland. Even the ones that you are apart of are simplistic and not very interesting. The townies movements are all just copy pasted i.e. when they are doing yoga in the town square.

Farming is a slog and not really worth it. Easiest way is just to farm gold kelp in diving and ignore the tedium of farming. Only farm for the bundles. 

Farm animals need work but they are cute and I enjoy seeing them. We just need the ability to pick/push them as if they are standing in their feed box you cant feed them unless you wait and wait for them to eventually move. I do like that there are many different types of animals than any farm sim before it.

Tons of items throughout this game which is a huge plus in my opinion. 

I do love the diving portion but it has become a slog and im still not sure what the goal of those underwater caves is. The mermaid city is very empty. The map is extensive which is a plus.

The mini-games are fine but challenging. 

The mines are much of a slog with no challenge whatsoever. You can easily walk around the mines with the monsters and they do negligible damage.

This game has all the intentions of being great but it has a very LONG way to go. For now ill wait until next year and return to the game as there is not much reason to play it as it currently stands.",1699314462,1700335836,False,5,0,0.465245515108108521,0,True,False,True

I'm not very far along in the storyline but it's enjoyable so far.  If you enjoyed SDV this might be for you.

Pros:
-Very nice graphics, the artwork and general style is great and MC customization has a lot of detail.  Beautiful character models.
-The fishing minigame is superior to SDV (imo).
-Lots of romance options and good cutscenes so far.
-Bug catching is fun, and the museum is open 24-7 so you don't sit with a bunch of donations taking up bag space.
-The farm is huge.

Cons:
-One nasty game bug that I ran into and I've seen other comments in the boards with the same issue.  The first time I got a coffer from harvesting trash the game locked up.  I had to use the ""I'm stuck"" button.  I'm glad it's there but the penalties are pretty harsh.  The upside is that this is the only bug I've had so far (I've only played full release, not early access).
-The MC moves painfully slowly.  Maybe there are upgrades for this later in the game and I'm not there yet.
-Bag space is very limited early on.  That's part of the experience but there are so many item options that it feels very constrained (more than usual for this type of game).
-Combat, at least with the starter sword, is very janky.  You swing twice then take a step forward for the 3rd swing, which usually steps you right into the mob.
-Higher level tool upgrades take multiple days to get your tool back.  I don't mind the single day wait from SDV but I don't look forward to Level 4 tools with a 4 day wait.

Neutral:
-SJW stuff (or human rights, woke, liberal, left, use whatever term you want...pejorative or supportive).  It's not apocalyptic like some have posted online and in the discussions, but if you're hypersensitive to things like rainbow flags and same-sex partnerships this probably isn't your jam because they're present.  Doesn't really affect gameplay as long as that stuff doesn't bother you.  The main storyline has a pretty heavy environmentalist message, common to ""get away from the city and farm"" type games.
-Some may like this, but I prefer the option to save any time instead of just at the end of the day.  Prevents save scumming but it means you have to commit to playing a full day at a time.",1700335175,1700335175,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It basically plays as 3D Stardew Valley with a lot of Quality of life features that were seen in mods. It also integrates Animal Crossing Fishing and Bug Catching with museum. So its got a lot going on, whilst still feeling familiar, its nice!

I do have to say however, the mining part of the game is at current really bland and boring. The combat is just ""sit and hit"" and mining is just hitting rocks to get to the bottom, few rewards and not much engaging going on. It brings the game down a bit, but it not enough to recommend it.

Took me an hour to play the first day (set your time to 50% folks) and it didn't feel long enough. If you don't set your time settings to 50% the day will fly by in no time and you would never get anything done.

Okay I'm deleting my original review. The sheer amount of bugs in 1.0 is breathtakingly bad. Many are game breaking. Every day I check the discord to discover more (often game breaking) bugs are being reported. Not just for the console! The console.. I'd be demanding a refund on console. 

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. I'll edit this review once they fix every bug, but Stairway Games lost my trust, and in the current games industry that's going to be very hard to win back.

Compared to most other major farm sim games, the content in this one is already VERY shallow. No creativity, nothing new, just fancy facelift graphics that still fall flat if you look for more than an hour. Everything advertised in the 1.0 release added maybe 10 hours of content from what already has existed in the indefinite early access. 

1. Relationships
The NPC doesn't even recognize that y'all are dating, nonetheless married. Dialogue stays the same as if you're at 0 hearts, except now they appear in your house in the morning then awkwardly glitch away outside. ""Children"" in this game are really just humanoid house decor, just like with the pets update that added animals with broken AI you couldn't even interact with--of which has not been updated AT ALL in this release.

2. Where is the content...?
The main questline is still unfinished, literally reading ""WIP"" in the description. Nothing has changed since early access. It follows you going through 3 different mines which are all carbon copies of each other with the same T-posing enemies and then nothing. It took me about 6 hours to get through this the second time (since they forced us all to restart) so there's your main storyline. The underwater area is still the same as early access as well. A repetitive trash-clean up sim with placeholder NPCs you also can't interact with and a story that holds all of about 5 hours of content, at most.

3. Bugs, performance, laziness
The same bugs since early access are still here too. Glitching furniture and wallpaper, extreme FPS drops every 5-10 minutes, and placeholder, placeholder, placeholder for just about everything from town events to NPC text to shops in town that they want you to waste 20-30 hours on the most boring of gameplay to unlock just to find they don't sell anything. 

In my 40 hours of gameplay, I don't remember having fun a single time, but in desperate hope to avoid buyers remorse I continued playing almost out of complete desperation to find anything this game has to offer that you can't find better elsewhere.

tldr: Don't grab this unless you're ok with an unfinished game.

I hope to change this review as what there is of this game so far I have enjoyed. I generally avoid Early Access games, I like to enjoy finished products and don't get as much enjoyment as some out of seeing works in progress. Coral Island's development and the generally positive attention it has been getting left me optimistic so I purchased when it exited early access, but the 1.0 release feels like an attempt to get enough money to finish a kickstarter that ran out of cash (or worse, cash in on what's been finished and never touch it again. Fingers crossed that isn't the case).

This game should not have received a ""full release."" While there is a lot of game to enjoy, much of it is still incomplete, including main aspects of the story framework the farming simulator hangs itself on.

I'm going to change it to a positive review but I wish I could go neutral. There is more things to do and the actual mechanics work now, but it's not attention grabbing nor do I really care all that much for the characters. The art is amazing, there's always something you can be doing, but the game doesn't really grip me into playing it more than casually and happy to put down without a thought.
Also, its so old fashioned that you can only save by sleeping, it's a gripe I have with so many farming sims, and the fact that quests can be opened that just you can't do until the town is upgraded that gives no indication you can't do them. Like planting and giving fruit to a neighbour, I was looking around the island for a long time trying to figure it out before giving up then suddenly upgrading the town it said 'fruit seeds' at the end of the time to complete the quest. This game really needs some serious indicators thrown in or quests that aren't possible, to not appear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Review, Early Access:
So, this is a hard one. I think the game is worth it but I don't think it's at the stage where it should have released in Early Access yet. I'll list my gripes with the game below.

There is many things I can forgive and there is one thing I cannot forgive. The easily forgiven but really could be fixed with just adding (W.I.P - Not currently implemented) tag at the end of letters and descriptions:
Public events? Not working but they are still announced and act like you can go. 
Some crops like fruit and such are not in the game but you are told you can get them. 
Tier II on the skill tree is not implemented and there is no real way of knowing it until you level everything up then realise it doesn't unlock the next tier.
You are shown the wrong indication for what to click on some things or simply the button doesn't work occasionally. i,e proceeding with the day

The single thing I can not forgive, at all, is the fact there is NO controller support. It does not make sense to me at all that one of the first things implemented wasn't controller support. Again, I have played games from alpha to beta to EA to full release, and most games make this a high priority because in games, especially cosy games like this is trying to be, it is essential to reaching a full audience. People with disabilities, people with trouble grasping so many controls on a keyboard or heck even just people who like to stream the game and sit back on a couch.

[b] Why was controller support not the first thing implemented beside PC controls, or very soon after. [/b]

Overall it feels like a good game, there is a lot to do, but it feels like it should still be in Alpha. I am going to give it a negative review until at least some sort of warning IN GAME is put in for what does and does not work, as well as controller support.",1666109853,1700278465,True,0,0,0.48310813307762146,0,True,False,True

I've put nearly 200 hours in the game and the majority of it was in early access. I absolutely loved the concept and had a lot of fun making the farm but with the 1.0 release I'm left disappointed. The lack of finished content and the lack of re-balancing of systems and activities that people have asked for weren't implemented which begs the question why even go into 1.0 if it's just going to be the same as a content update would've be in early access? 

[u]This just seems disingenuous as a company and a money grab even if it was not the intention from Stairway.[/u]

The funny thing is I'd discount a lot of this stuff and even recommend the game if it was still in early access under the guise of further improvement.

WIP (quest) and TBD (item discription) should not be included in a completed game.
The first few hours are good, but more and more missing, bugged and unfinished surfaces.
You get a few main quests that guide you, but just a few until you hit the WIP quest.

As for mechanics: 
Many of the event minigames feel to random. 
Mining is hardly rewarding as you get floors with no ore, and finding the way down can take some time.
If you play longer sessions some machines just stop producing.
The ""I'm stuck!' button puniches you, not really fair with a buggy game.

Some stuff which looks like puzzle are actually non active and do nothing. Some other like the undersea cave youa re told are full of resource - they are not they are just an infinite cave labyrinth with 99% only trash (I saw 3 kelps total among 12 room of trash bags). 

At this point I am wonder if I should continue or wait 3 to 6 month that they are finished...

Of course, there are other issues. Random lags as you traverse the map, try to decorate your house, or even put new clothing into your wardrobe. Events triggering when the characters in question aren't in the area and it's not even the right time. Tools being duplicated when you try to enchant them. Display glitches, characters skating across the map.

I think they did a great job with this game. The art style is fantastic, and the game play is exactly as one would hope for this type of game. A few minor bugs, but haven't come across anything game-breaking. Overall very good game worthy of its place in the genre.


Pre-launch review:
Yes, with the caveat that it is *very* early access. Meaning, this game definitely has potential to be a lot of fun.

I would still say the game is a lot of fun and I really enjoy playing it, but again, IT IS NOT COMPLETE. You CANNOT finish one of the main quests.

I first noticed it when the intro cutscene played and it was an exact beat for beat replica of the stardew intro:
-Player leaves big city and moves to a small rural community
-Greeted by town mayor
-Mayor takes you to your new cabin
-Cabin is being fixed up by local carpenter(s) 
-They do a bad job so you have to upgrade the house
-The farmland is overgrown and you're tasked with fixing it
-Mayor gives you tools and seeds

Next thing I noticed was the player moves incredibly slow for how big the map is. Idk if you can move faster later on but my god is it a chore to move around the island

Next is that the game is uncomfortably quiet. You get small jingles (that dont loop) when inside interiors but walking around the island it is dead quiet. No background music, hardly any ambience, just the sound of your footsteps. I thought it was a bug at first but after some googling this is apparently an intentional design choice.

The final nail in the coffin was while googling I learned this 1.0 ""full release"" isnt even the full release! The games only half done, if even that!

EDIT: 54 hours in: Still very much Early Access, so if you're expecting a complete product, this is not it. The devs make big balance changes, have things that aren't accessible, etc. That said, I'm loving it. I started a new playthrough and it's just so addictive.

Original Review:

So far so good, but I'm only 4 hours in.

The elephant in the room: Stardew Valley. Yes, it is EXTREMELY similar to SDV in a lot of ways. A large number of the systems/story points are almost ripped exactly from SDV, so if you're likely to get annoyed by similarities to SDV, you might as well move on. For me it's a positive, because a lot of things SDV just got perfect, and it's great seeing other games use what worked in good games, instead of just making their own system from scratch just to be different.

Tons of characters, huge map. The characters are all ridiculously good looking, so if you're here for the husbandos and waifus, this game has you covered.

It's not feature complete at all yet, so don't buy in thinking this is a finished product. That said, if you know what you're getting into, there's a lot of fun to be had.",1672251444,1700230195,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am truly trying to give this game a chance, but I've just found their design choices to be completely aggravating. Never mind the bugs this game has.

If I didn't like one skill, I could nearly opt out of it with alternative means by way of planning. Bigger and complex doesn't mean it's a good game. They waste the players time with multiple cutscenes, just to tell the player they can upgrade/decorate their house, but doesn't talk to you about inventory management. Their economy balance is a complete joke. To craft a basic sprinkler, which is visually just a water bottle with holes in it for plastic tubing, you would need tier 2 kelp! You're discouraged heavily from buying materials. 1 silver kelp is worth thousands of coins. Well, maybe you're not into diving. Maybe you want to roll a fisherman. Too bad. You can no longer just buy a better rod, you have to waste hours in the mines to grind for ore. It really doesn't make sense. Leveling up skills is awful too.

However i still think the game stills need development.

Cons:
The beginning is a very slow start. 
The character creation is still very limited.
I like the characters but i have zero reason to talk to them on a daily bases, if at all, the daily dialogue is rarely interesting enough for me to go out of my way to talk to the npcs.
ANd i really dislike the fishing minigame its a good way to get carpal tunnel syndrome in your hand. 

Pros:
I really like the festivals, they have fun minigames, i just wish i could interact more.

Overall it plays nice and easy, its very must like stradew valley but less edgy. 
This game is by far one of the best and most fun stardew valley type games out right now.


old review before the update 1.0
(I like it, but it's still very early access.
cons:
there needs to be serious quality of life improvements in the gameplay and especially the user interface of this game
The chacater is a little slow and it's frustrating to play. since you have to walk everywhere
there needs to be an outlet for conversations with characters and scenes.
the hair is very shiny
chacater creation light is strange
needs more sound effects in scenes and conversations
the city seems a little empty
Pros:
It's very beautiful and you can see the dedication of the developers in the store building environments
I really like the game's themes
so far the story is ok
conclusion:
It has real potential to be very good!!!! but I won't buy the game now, maybe after a bit more months of development. iacnt recommend it now but i will revist in a few months.)",1699704406,1700188548,True,0,0,0.520563244819641113,2,True,False,True

The only reason why I am still playing it, is because I am a diehard Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Sun Haven fan so I can handle games that are not quite as good (My profile avatar is from HM: ANB).

So a few of the quality of life features that are missing:
 - No stamina use when tools do nothing.  If you accidentally water the same crop twice well count that extra stamina gone, or if you miss aim your pickaxe in the mine... well sorry you just wasted stamina.
 - Smart tool aiming.  Do not let tools target squares they cannot interact with.  In the mines my pickaxe loves to aim at the tiles next to the rocks I am trying to smash, which results in missing that pairs poorly with the previous missing quality of life feature.  To see a good example of smart tool aiming Sun Haven has this mastered.
 - Queued actions.  When I am hoeing or watering and click on the next tile before the previous action is finished, be smart enough to know to actually perform that action.
 - Hold to perform continuous actions.  Clicking on 100+ crops to harvest or water them is bad.  In other farming games they are smart enough to know that with the basic tools since they cannot be charged if the player holds down the action key let them do a continuous action so they don't kill their finger clicking on every single crop or tile.

Stamina system:
 - It takes a base of 20 stamina to catch a fish and it takes 20 stamina to catch bugs.  Why is bug catching so stamina intensive?  Fishing makes sense but bug catching does not considering a miss swipe only costs 1 stamina.
 - You start out with 450 stamina which translates out to 150 actions (this does get better, but in early game first impressions matter).  Might sound like a lot, but every watering counts as an action.  So if you have a nice 10x10 field with 4 scarecrows that is 96 actions every day to water your crops in early game leaving only 162 stamina.  Might sound like a lot, but a trip into the mines will deplete that very fast.
 - Other activities outside the farm drain stamina fast resulting in you being left with the only thing you can do is foraging.  This in turn causes a huge chunk of the game to become gated in early game.  For example lets say I want to start raising some chickens, I need bronze ingots to make the coop.  Which means I need to do mining, but I have no stamina to do mining (and the ore spawn rate on the first floors is terrible, on one run I found no ore on floors 5, 6, and 7).

Main plot line:
So early game I am presented with two main goals: 1) Fetch a bunch of items for this quest, and 2) Fetch a bunch of different items for this quest.  I did not mind Stardew Valley bundles, but this game cranked it up to a level that it is off putting to me considering how a number of said items involve activities which drain stamina extremely fast and thus make them tedious to collect.  I am low on stamina and see a bug I might need, do I really want to waste 20 stamina on a bug I might not end up needing?  Meanwhile the town folk so far have not really shown any effort on their part for contributing to save their town that they supposedly treasure.  I am the new guy, why am I doing all the hard work to save their town/island?

I don't know why Left-click, right-click, and R are all required button presses to advance text boxes instead of just, y'know, one of those three options but every NPC is hot so it's okay.

It's funny to spam click balls to make the bouncing audio to loop and overlap over and over -completely- out of sync with the ball itself.

You have to click to pass through a door on the way in, but not on the way out (you -can- but it's optional).

Add an extra level of funny by pretending X number of NPCs are Westworld robots.

There's a bunch of weird tiny art and code design decisions that throw me off and break me out of immersion, like the carpenter woman's hand that looks like an AI foot, or the palm trees covering a table up some stairs, or the music just... stopping and you're standing in silence.

There's some unique stuff perhaps - like the bug catching - but the mines feel pretty much identical, farming is identical, even the farm area is very similar to the basic Stardew Farm. Characters also often pop up in front of your house in the morning to give you stuff - just like in Stardew.

This is definitely the definitive ""Stardew-like"" game.

That said, that doesn't really have to be a negative exactly. Stardew Valley is a good game. This one just happens to be the most similar to Stardew than most of the other farming sim games that are similar. I like the tropical vibes mixed with asian and polynesian culture and influences.

I do feel that starting up in this game is much slower than practically any other game in the genre... Which is fine... it just kinda feels like you're stuck doing very little of anything for the first several days to a couple weeks while new things to do are slowly spoon-fed in.

The characters don't seem all that exciting or interesting yet, but I haven't dived super into any of them yet. Will see how that plays out.

The social aspect of the game is challenging, but not so much so that I feel as if I'm struggling to make in-game connections to other npcs.  Clearly a lot of time, love, patience and, dedication went into this game and in the results it shows as the results are stunning.

I purchased this game as soon as it released in early access, waited for the updates because I just wanted to explore this world.

Coral Island is a farming life sim in the vein of Stardew Valley and its predecessors, with some inspiration from Animal Crossing. The game goes for a Pacific island theme with an emphasis on environmental/ecological concerns. Having spent some time in early access, 1.0 has arrived, and I think it's worth a buy.

Before I get into the good/neutral/bad, I want to touch on some of the criticisms I've seen leveled at the game as a farming sim. Many have pointed out the heavy similarities between the core features of Coral Island and Stardew Valley, oftentimes with accusations of stealing ideas from the game. Those folks clearly have no knowledge of the history of video games and their evolution. Every game in a given genre takes ideas from those that came before and iterates or puts a twist on it. In some genres, many features stay almost the same through the years. Stardew Valley would not exist without Harvest Moon, and Coral Island would not be the game it is without Stardew Valley.

The Good
- The farming and ranching aspects are well done and in line with my expectations for the genre
- The characters are complex people with their own histories and ongoing stories
- The town rank system is a nice way to show the progression and ongoing improvement of the town
- I like the resource split of the mines and the diving sections
- Great variety of ranch animals, crops, and PETS!
- Like any good farming sim, there's no need to rush
- Lots of great decorative options to gussy up your farm
- Everyone is insanely attractive

The Neutral
- There's some QOL things that I think are missing, such as holding down a button to continually plant seeds. Right now, you have to click for every single one until you get improved sprinklers.
- No Multiplayer yet.
- In one of the festivals, there's what looks like a cockfighting ring. That's not what the animals ultimately compete in, but it's kind of questionable and poorly explained.
- Having come from early access with a chunk of change to start out with, there's some sequence breaking with the progression that the game didn't know how to handle.
- On that same note, I really flew through the overall progression of the mines and diving sections with such a strong head start. I'm worried I'll hit a wall.
- None of the fun little TV shows seem to have more than one episode.

The Bad
My first point here is a gripe I have with development. The devs have declared 1.0 to be feature complete as they envisioned it without the extras that were funded on Kickstarter. While I'm not a fan of that way of looking at things, it's clear that there are some things that are NOT feature complete. When I see devs in the Discord mention that they're still working on heart events and that there's a plan to re-do a storyline or expand on certain sections, that to me does not come across as 1.0. It feels shady and I'm not thrilled that this is the route they've taken.
- Lack of accessibility features. Many features rely on repetitive clicking.
- Mining and combat both kind of suck. Combat especially is difficult to level up.
- Like Stardew, fishing also isn't that great.

1) No option to remove screen shake. If you are prone to motion sickness, you will struggle with some of the mini games. The screen shakes rather violently at times (specifically with the mechanical bull riding mini game).

2) ""Disable fatigue animation"" does not work as intended/may be glitched? When you are exhausted, the game fades out and the colors dim to this washed out grey filter. There IS an option to disable this, but from what I can tell... it doesn't do anything. Getting fatigued is FINE, but the solution shouldn't be HAVING to eat food or ending the day early. Adjusting the game to color blind also does not resolve this issue.

There is nothing wrong with LGBTQ, but it becomes and issue if it's pressed onto you heavily. The game is trying to be a mix between a chill Stardew Competitor, mixed with Animal Crossing, if it was made by the new Disney where every character is unfitting just for the sake of diversity.

That's the only real gripe, the forced diversity. It could be a fun kids game, but as an adult and exposed to what's going on in the world at current times, it's all too obvious that this is yet another attempt to be controversial, ""like it or dont like it, you cant change it"", you know, stuff like that. Just a huge troll by confused people.

But that's the hard stuff first.

The game has decent graphics, but runs like crap. Absolute crap. Like, absolute crap. You could run this on a PC from 2000, on highest graphics, but it runs like crap. Stutters, microstutters and loading delays. Thank goodness it is an early access still (I think it is, if it's official 'gold' then yeah, figure that out yourselves).

The main menu music, I said it before, and also said it on livestreams I made when the game was still in pre-1.0, is just tune-wise just stolen from SV. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but the timings, the tune layout and the whole vibe of it is an exact copy of SV. Not necessarily a bad thing, but we don't need 2 of the same game if most of it is stolen. And no, Stardew Valley did NOT steal from Harvest Moon, unlike people claiming it. But this game steals from SV. And sadly, SV Dev is a two man company and can't do anything about it, legally.

There is an evil corporation messing with everyone, they want to drill for oil, end of story. If that doesn't get all the enthusiasts and fans of a small norwegian climate activist enraged and engaged in the game, then what doesn't. Of course the company is run by a woman, because diversity, and women need to be in key positions more due to diversity, diversity all over the place.

Steam really needs a ""average"" setting for recommendations and reviews.

It is, could be or potentially might be a good game? I just can't stand this forced diversity, and since it's so overly present and forceful, I'm turned off instantly. I have to see that in the news, in the media in general, in forums, on the streets, in the public transportation, when shopping, when going out drinking, when just walking around in the city. I want a break from all this madness, and the game throws it at me the same magnitude as the aforementioned activities, so what do you expect, a pat on the back and a ""good job""?

Giving it a ""do not recommend"" does not do the game any good, but saying it's ""good and recommended"" is too much as well in it's current state and without the Devs seriously starting to sort themselves out.",1700126310,1700126310,False,12,5,0.380371898412704468,0,True,False,False

I know the Xbox version is performing pretty poorly right now. As for my experience with the PC version, I've run into few performance issues and only a couple bugs. I'm still only a few days into new game plus, so there may be more bugs to find along the way.

My experience with Coral Island has been quite a positive one. Anytime I tell my friends about this game, I always explain it as ""Stardew but better"". Which to be frank, isn't a fair comparison. But, it is one I see being made constantly. To be clear, this game definitely sets itself apart from Stardew Valley in many ways. And let's not forget Stardew Valley was based off of Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons. So, at the end of the day it is another farming life sim that follows many farming life sim tropes. Which is why I'm here! And, I believe it brings a lot of fun new things to the genre.

New things like their pet adoption system, and the diving mechanic. Not new but something I'm happy to see them bringing back- the drawn portraits. I will also be adding their diverse cast here, as it's in my opinion new and refreshing. 

The biggest con for me personally is their combat system. It's super basic. Which, in these types of games is fine and honestly to be expected. But none of the enemies really do much to stand out from the others, so they're all basically 'hack away until dead'. And the drop rates for the monster loot is pretty abysmal. 

I also know a lot of people are upset by the road map for planned future content. And on that note, I unfortunately want to bring up Stardew Valley again. I don't know if many of you remember, but the Stardew Valley ConcernedApe originally put out into the world was VASTLY different from the Stardew Valley we have today. And I know, we're all tired of games being released feeling like they aren't a complete product. But honestly, Coral Island as of right now feels like a complete game. Yes, maybe the most basic version but it is in and of itself a complete game. I'm honestly excited to see all the future content these devs have planned come to the game. Not to mention Coral Island's dev team is really good at communicating with their fan base, and actively posts pretty consistent updates as to what they are currently working on. 

So, in conclusion, I highly recommend Coral Island. Especially if you're like me, and you loved Stardew Valley. Or grew up playing Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons.",1700106291,1700106291,True,4,0,0.544651448726654053,0,True,False,False

Overall I recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoys farming/life sim games like Stardew, My Time at Sandrock/Portia, Sun Haven, etc. But I do also have some specific cons that I feel are worth noting.

_______________

Pros:

- Art style is fun and different. 
[Things like buildings, clothing, animals and decor styles are very charming and well drawn/animated. I didn't love the character creation art that much in early access (I still find the hair textures and colors to be a little weird looking) but upon full release there are more options and I have been able to make a character I really like.]

- A lot of fun clothing options!
[Even in character creator you can pick from different colored farm outfits, but as you progress in the game and open up more clothing options you get a lot of fun stuff to pick from!]

- Colorful characters that display their own unique personality.
[While some feel initially cliche (The peaceful fisherman who plays guitar at social gatherings, the hippie who appreciates good vibes and foraging mushrooms, the athlete who is always looking for a good challenge, you get me) they all end up having story pieces that give them uniqueness and deepens what you know of their personality as you get to know them more.]

- If you run out of energy you don't just immediately pass out!
[I've not pushed this -too- far but I have dropped down to -9 energy and was able to still eat food to regain energy and could continue on as normal! I really appreciate this, because it lets you manage your energy more efficiently and only use consumables when you really need to.]

- Mastery system for skills is satisfying.
[You gain levels in skills like fishing, mining, foraging, ranching etc and get to spend points on some upgrades to those skills as you go and it feels good to unlock that next point that'll give you a helping hand.]

- You can skip cutscenes/scripted conversations.
[Self explanatory but more of a QoL thing than you might realize, after playing more than one character the ability to skip through lengthy talks you've seen before is quite nice.]

- The diving and cleaning up the ocean is a fun break.
[Inbetween the tried and true things like mining and tree chopping it's nice to have another thing to juggle but not feel stressed about. You're given the task of diving down to the reef floor to clear away debris and in doing so hopefully heal the reef. You cut away chunks of junk with your scythe and harvest forageables, while it's not anything crazy new mechanics wise it's a nice addition in my opinion paired with Coral Islands 'Don't stress unless you want to' pace.]

- Tool enchanting is a neat idea.
[You can enchant your tools using various artifacts or gems (and probably other things I'm not yet aware of) and give it a variety of different buffs.]

- The game feels like the Devs care.
[Continuous updating to the community and attention to feedback from early access, multiple donation to charity events hosted, cute homage to a couple foundational farm sims like harvest moon and stardew, it's just nice seeing game developers who care and have real love and respect for what they're making.]

- You can adopt a pet! 
[The downside of this... You can only adopt 1, and ALL of them at the shelter are cute. I'd love if the limit of adoptable pets was 2 instead, for example I personally would love to have the little lizard but I know I'd always kind of regret not getting a cat to signify my cat irl. (Though I do know you're able to have 1 pet and 1 mythical pet by end game, I still feel 2 regular adoptable pets would be perfect.)]

_______________

Cons: 

- Inability to enter the hot spring at first is confusing.
[Minor con. You're told from Takeba the hot spring caretaker to enter the hot springs whenever you'd like, but when you enter it is blocked off saying ""temporarily out of service"" with no way of knowing why or how to change that. (tiny temple offerings spoiler: You have to complete 2 of the offerings fully to unlock the hot spring.) I feel like some kind of hint about that could be nice.]

- Let us hold the button to add ingredients to machines. 
[Some machines you can load up with 20 items but you have to click individually currently to add them, and honestly after playing for a couple hours doing that actually starts to hurt... Just let us hold the mouse button down to add...]

- This is a side comment from the above con: the crafting system -with machinery specifically- is not enjoyable to manage from as far as I've played.
[They chose to not have any farm machines (Forge, kiln, recycle machine etc) use a crafting menu, instead you just add the item to your hotbar and manually place them into the machines... I don't love this interaction style, but that may be personal preference. I think further progress in this game gives us the ability to make crafting more automated but I've not experienced that aspect yet so keep that in mind!]

- The bug catching is more frustrating than fun at first.
[Some bugs you can walk up to no problem and swing at. Others flee instantly it seems even if you dash into them from behind and swing instantly (a good technique typically). Even if your swing is in range, once they've triggered their ""run away"" animation you can't catch them (Only SOME of them though, maybe the more rare ones. Others you can catch while they're technically running away. Why? Shrug). Until you get the upgraded bug net AND the mastery talent that makes insects 10$ less aware the bug catching really isn't that fun feeling. But once you get it you get it.]

- Side comment from above con: Bug alert level doesn't go down after you've walked away.
[Say you're setting up for a rare bug catch and accidentally walk a step too close, it fills up some of its alert meter, now that'll never go down so it just became even harder to catch. Just kinda frustrating and makes an already not that fun system to learn worse.]

- The targeting system feels odd at first and it's easy to miss and waste energy.
[Minor con as this becomes much less of a problem once the hot spring is open but: It's easy to accidentally swing on a space you didn't mean to, say like chopping logs, or breaking rocks, or trying to catch a bug, which wastes energy (only -1 at least)]

I don't see controller support on the roadmap but I do hope it gets added soon.

This game could use a lot of quality of life updates because right now it just feels like a 'walk here and press a button' simulator. Character customization is very inclusive. I love that.
I really want them to make farming a bit less tedious are at least more interactive like in Palia. 
The directional movement is extremely janky on both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. Walking slowly makes your character run in place and everytime you turn, your character essentially teleports into a different animation without a transition. It makes for a very harsh animation vs environment contrast. It does not fit the creative direction of the environment the developers are sketching. 

Here some more points:

- Diving feels like a re-skin from mining. Exactly the same experience minus the swimming animation and the tool used to harvest things on the ocean floor.
- Inventory management is an absolute hell with a regular controller (I'm using an Xbox one controller)
- Placing farm decoration, chests and workbenches is lacking in rotation options.
- Progression is too tedious with too little direct sense of reward. Everything is extremely tile-based which makes interaction with the environment tedious.
- The story so far is cute, I feel invested.
- At the moment: the grind/reward ratio is too steep
- Farm tiles are literally square boxes that contrast with the surrounding art-style
- Spamming dash to get around until you can get a horse gets old extremely fast and then there is not even a guarantee the horse will be fun to control because the tile-based nature of the game removes all sense of momentum from the character movement. 
- Fishing is okay. The stress-release mechanic is more engaging but also the least intrusive mechanic I have experienced in a game. You can easily watch some Netflix during fishing 
- The sack-race mini game was quite fun

IMO, the game needs to feel more engaging in it's basic gameplay elements.
Animations and environment interaction feels abrupt and unengaging. I don't expect to play this for too long because it's a bit too much of a chore to enjoy. I do however love the art-style and writing. The artists really sell this game. Sadly, the gameplay repels me from really enjoying it.",1700066521,1700066521,False,27,1,0.582172274589538574,0,True,False,False

Look, I've been playing farming sims since I was a wee babe with a gameboy advance and ""More Friends of Mineral Town"", scrunching up my face as I tried to romance the kappa. I've played more story of seasons and harvest moon and etc than I care to admit. This game beats them all. 

(and as much as I love stardew valley, I gotta say none of the romance options appealed to me. This game? Urgh I can't DECIDE they are all so GOOD.)",1700025919,1700025919,True,1,0,0.503688812255859375,0,True,False,False

    [*]The animations of using the tools and the feedback on the objects feel not polished enough and very rough
    [*]There are no turning animations for the main character, which makes walking feel really harsh
    [*]When you walk around the town, there is partially no nature sound or music playing, which makes me feel uneasy, when it is completely quiet!
    [*]The 2D character portraits look very detailed, but the 3D models look more bland, especially the player character
    [*]The music in general seems very generic and boring
    [*]The zoomed out camera makes everything feel more disconnected to me, although I kind of understand that it is probably necessary for later in the game when you have lots of machines and tools
    [*]Very slight usage of political symbols in the game, which I personally don't need in games, but probably will be okay for 
most people

Controller support has improved over EA, especially with bug catching. Though it still needs a bit of tweaking as you do waste energy during farming due to controller drift. Mining has also improved, but is still not the best use of your time long-term. Neither of those things are deal breakers for sure.

You're prompted in the character creator (which was surprisingly shallow and an issue in itself) for ""honorifics"" preferences... I guess that's the new hot topic. Alright, fine, push on. One of the blacksmiths decides to flirt with me, entirely unprompted (none of the female townsfolk did this, for comparison), Cool... thanks, dog. I find it weird that they never show you the front of the community center, at all. None of the screenshots, not even a split second flash of it in the trailer. It's almost like they're trying to hide the big ""pride flag"" on the front of it, that you cannot change, in a SINGLEPLAYER game. I thought you guys would be proud of it being in your game, no? Especially since you made sure it can't be changed. It's almost like you don't want to hear our opinion, but you do want our money. Kind of a weird decision to remove personal preference in a, again, singleplayer game. 

Those things aside. I'm WAY above recommended specs, and even still it keeps hitching as you move around the fairly large (which I would ordinarily consider a good thing) map. It even shows a little icon for a split second like it's loading. No bueno, my dudes. When you talk to the NPCs, they have finite dialogue, one or two lines, then you just can't talk to them again for the day. It's weird that it doesn't loop their last line of dialogue to let you know you've exhausted it for the day, which seems to be the standard. I didn't really get into a lot of the minigames (if there are many), but the fishing is pretty not great. Hold the mouse button, wait for the fish to fight, waste an unnecessary amount of time to reel it in. I assume it gets better as your skill goes up.

If none of that stuff is going to irritate you, there might be a decent game under it. It seemed like a slow start, in my opinion. I already requested a refund.",1699987520,1699987520,False,40,10,0.281746357679367065,0,True,False,False

Still not sure if I needed to change the settings a couple times and wait or if I pressed something to get it to work but the left one is doing what it should, the right one is still stuck on the track pad but you can figure that out.

All the residents of Coral Island are so charming and lovely! Everyone has their own little twist and personality which is just MWAH, a chef's kiss, if you will!
The gameplay is also absolutely wonderful! There are so many activities you can do and it's not only for the sake of getting stuff and leveling your skill but also for the betterment of the island itself! I really love little details like that 'cause it not only gives a player an incentive to go out and do the things they like, it shows that your character does contribute to making the island thrive again.
Also, I love the visual details of when there's too little energy left so the colors get a bit more muted and dull, and also the lake, where you donate the bundles, getting more and more vibrant, lively and wonderful the more progress you make!
Another thing that I should mention is the festivals! They have so much flavor and give a taste of what the Coral Island community is all about!
And last but not least, as an artist, I also want to mention how lovely the sprite work is! Absolutely gorgeous art style that helps every unique character come to life!

Now for the Cons - can't reposition the mill after it's set, dealing with the ocean got REALLY grindy, the little light squares that show where you're watering crops could be brighter and more noticeable, I wasn't happy with only being able to get the first scarecrow until AFTER it ravaged my crops, I wish the cooked foods would list the selling price without having to take them out to the shipping bin to check that detail (assuming you've already sold one), And last but not least, there should be a larger refrigerate available to buy.",1699746068,1699746068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The only things that kinda bother me is the mining activities, it's kinda hard to find the ores??? like in one floor you can only find 3-6 ore??? and the other things is the heart event??? I hope it will get more interactive rather than just watching the other npc's talking to each other. 

Also, I have an issue with the mines, it gets error when I tried to enter the mines and this error happen quite often :( I don't know what's wrong but I hope you can fix this issue

I can say as someone who grew up playing games like Harvest moon, SOS and Rune Factory. This game absolutely gives you the sense of nostalgia that you might be looking for.

But it was honestly because I couldn't wait to see what they would come up with next.

However, I have a few grievances about this game.

First and foremost, I really do not like the 28 days system. sure it looks aesthetically pleasing, but I personally think it limits the seasons in terms of the number of festivals you can add. Having 31 days a season would allow for more events to be added without it being too overwhelming. 

There should always be a portable calendar, i hate running to the general store just to see events and birthdays. Players should be able to put a birthday for their character.

The music could be improved, most of what i heard while playing is not very memorable.

Anyways onto the gameplay mechanics:

Farming: It's good, but the tiles are so small its hard to tell which plant is ready to harvest, its also hard to which plants have been watered because its hard to see the tile beneath them. And with no tags, its hard to tell which plants are which.

Mining/Combat: Mining is boring, it feels like its been copypasted from Stardew (also Wind cave just looks like Earth cave 2.0). The mines need something to make it standout, it has no unique foraging, no crystals, and geodes barely drop. The combat is just as boring and the monsters have no variety, just recolors/reskins. Also it's very hard to get any drops from the monsters, and some of the death animations take too long. 

Diving: is better than mining because it doesn't have combat. But I wish there were additional things to do while diving that would make it less grindy/tedious. The caves should be utilized for something better.

Bug catching: i like it, but it's way too hard, the fact that their caution meter never goes down is very annoying.

Crafting: it's nice, i like that i have universal access to my inventory, wish stores had access to my inventory that way i don't have to keep running around the town to grab items.

Socializing:
This is my biggest grievance in the game so far. I love the diversity of the NPCs, but man i wish they weren't so one dimensional. I partly blame the heart events, because they're so short and always end before they start. Also, I wish players had more opportunities to interact during the events. 
Heck, a lot of the events don't even have the player character even as a bystander. And it makes me wish that the events that do not involve the player character were categorized differently from heart events. Basically you'd have two events, heart events where you interact with the characters, and uninvolved events (i'm bad at naming) where your character is not even present.

Also all NPCs need more dialogue, it gets tiring to read the same text, especially when you can only talk to the characters a handful of times.
I wish there were more non-festival days, where it's not exactly an event, but you can run around and give characters gifts to celebrate a special day. For example, a valentines day where you give gifts to eligible bachelors/bachelorettes.

Anyways, because this is early access, i decided to only focus on 1 or 2 characters to see what this game had in stock (i did see a handful of other NPCs' events, some were good, some were lackluster). I focused on the blacksmith bros and I'm pretty disappointed (spoilers ahead). 
-
Rafael's events are very silly and the fact that they span like 5 events that focus on him forging a cartoonish hammer. Meanwhile Pablo's events focus on Rafael and his insecurities, and not on Pablo, and his events are the type of events that end before they start. I find it weird that I learn more about Rafael in his brother's events than his own.

After exploring other titles a bit like Cornucopia and My Time in Portia, I like this the best. The music is good, and the townspeople are vibrant and fun, at least so far. One bonus is that they are far, far more varied in appearance and background than the Stardew Valley community. Not to say I still don't love that community, but it's nice to experience someplace new.

The systems however, are very much identical to SV, so its easy for a newbie to get into. Customization options for the character are quite good, although I wish you had a 2D portrait to further immerse you in the world. Fire Emblem lets you do this, and I think it would enhance this game too. If I had one Christmas Wish, devs, it would be this. No pressure though, this is already a fantastic job.

I could tell back then that it was still a work in progress, but even in just a few short months - so much had changed! I fell like I am playing such a better game, and I thought it was great to begin with back then as well. There were lots of changes just in my short amount of time away. 

On to actual game commentary, I love all the characters. The little cinematic are wonderful and give an amazing view into who the characters really are even when you are not around. Believe me, it was so hard for me to choose which romantic interest I would choose because these characters were so lovely. 

The pet feature is really neat! I am very impressed that it is not just a dog or a cat, but I wished there was a little bit more furniture around the pets so my cute little bunny didn't look so lonely in my home (but this is very minor and I feel like this is something they will add later in the future). 

Honestly, I love farming in these games, but it is my least favorite part of the game. Cleaning the ocean while diving is so therapeutic. I love just being down there and finding creatures and actually seeing my work make the island a better place. But the farming is very standard farming tbh and I don't blame the game for that and it is NOT a negative. It's just basic farming and that's A-OK in my book. I just mostly use it as a way to make money in the game. The bugs and fish are very similar to other games to catch as well.

I think for being a game still in development that talks about current environmental issues- BUT ALSO has your typical farming, fishing, collecting vibe, mining, and interacting with characters. WOWZA this game is just absolutely FANTASTIC!

However, I am revising my review. I watched multiple updates come out for the game and decided to give it another shot. I can say that I am impressed. I think this game is on it's way to an official release. I watched the devs put out a checklist of goals they had for the game and they completed most of them ahead of schedule.

The storyline and getting to know all the townies had me hooked 12 years ago. I had loads of ideas on how to make it better, and Coral Island has implemented every improvement I had in mind.

It's funny, I never thought I'd find a game I'd be so passionate about again, but Coral Island has proved me wrong. I've played Stardew and, no offense, but I'm really loving Coral Island more. I've dabbled in Sims, Animal Crossing, and other Sim games, but let me tell you, Coral Island takes the cake. It's got that Disney-esque charm that I adore, and I'm thrilled that I can once again get married, build a family, and have up to 2 kids in the game. That's just fantastic.

I'm so in love with this game that I find myself chatting with all the townies across the whole map. I'm striking that delicate balance between enjoying the game and making sure I still handle my work and other responsibilities IRL, LOL. I definitely don't want to get too addicted!

Honestly, I didn't expect to fall head over heels for this game. It's like my old addiction to Harvest Moon: 'More Friends of Mineral Town,' but this time, it's the grown-up version that has me totally smitten. 🥀🥀🥀",1697392340,1697392340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Looks decent for a farm-sim game, and has cute and emotive characters and animals. The pets in particular are adorable. 

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

This is why you play the game. Have played SDV for hundreds of hours across multiple platforms, played Harvest Moon religiously as a child, and this game's gameplay, in my humble opinion, takes the cake easily. 

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Music is fairly good, but I will admit some of the tool usage sfx seems a little rough around the edges sometimes. 

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☑ Grandma

Anyone can play this game, but I do feel that the game touches on enough complex topics, such as environmentalism, parental/spousal grieving, loss of culture, and others that perhaps best suit individuals who have had the ability to be somewhat educated on the matter first.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Not a difficult game to run, but it does look good enough, and there are enough interacting systems that I wouldn't be surprised if some older computers started to have difficulties in running it. 

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☑ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Only thing in the game that I have even remotely struggled with, is the fishing, and that feels about right. Not a difficult game by any means. 

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

You have the same kind of community board-style offerings that SDV did, but WAY more of them, with some pretty cool final rewards. The grind isn't intense, and the wiki is updated fairly often.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☑ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

I personally think the other major reason to play the game is the story. Not necessarily the overarching narrative, as that's fairly cut-and-dry, but the stories in between characters. More than any other farm sim that I've played before, the people feel like they have relationships and lives. Obviously, given the scope of the game, you'll get several repeated lines from the same character over time. I am pleasantly surprised however, that seasonal variance, events you have completed and even just a long enough wait, and I am constantly being greeted by new dialogue and cutscenes. The devs really went to town with the cutscenes that serve no purpose other than to show the residents of starlet town going about their daily lives. Arguments, laughs, gatherings, grief, all of it. It's these wonderful little moments that make the game's characters feel fleshed out. 

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

My game time is inflated by many nights of falling asleep with the game open, but this is a game, much like many other farm-sims, that you can easily spend hundreds of hours in. TONS of stuff to do and customize, with only more being added as time goes on. 

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

As my hours played may indicate, I believe that this is worth every penny.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

The bugs have gotten much better than when the game first went EA, and in my first save, I lost a core part of the game in multiple locations because some flag somewhere didn't proc, and I missed out on further quests, teleportation pillars, and more. On my second serious save, those issues largely seem to be resolved, although visual glitches still happen here and there. I have had a cutscene appear when only half of the quest is finished, but not sure about whether finishing the quest will still work as intended.

Great game overall, I'm beyond excited for the full release, and I hope that the devs get all the love in the world. 

BIG GAME TIP: Lower your in game speed to 50% in the settings. There are several ways to get energy, and endless ways to spend it. You're gonna want the extra time.

For each feature that is similar, there is one that is different. Unusually enough, the bugs and plants look like their RL counterparts, animals behave like they should (despite the cows being amazingly rotund) - this is made by someone who has been outdoors at a farm at some point.

And it looks absolutely lovely, it has a nice sense of humor and lots of quirky characters.

Of course, there are a host of games inspired by stardew valley out there now, and many of them are quite good. What sets this one apart is its focus on environmentalism, and the gorgeous graphics.

The game is... AWESOME! It gives me so many throwback Stardew Valley feelings, and it feels like such a refreshment in the genre. It not only reproduces the cozy farm game feeling well, but it also introduces much more mechanics. In other words - it brings something fresh without steering away too much from the vibe. 

However...

As of me writing this (v0.5-205) the game is littered with bugs, a lot of which make it pretty hard, if not unable to progress. I've been posting some of my encountered bugs on developer's Discord as well as browsing the reported bugs and well... the list keeps growing, while the community manager only assures players of a fix coming ""in a future update"", without giving any context as to when to expect a fix. From crashes to inventory wipes to even forcing player to ALT + F4 due to broken interface, I cannot say I would recommend you getting this game at this very moment.

Stardew was heavily inspired by Harvest Moon, but did things in such a unique way it felt like it's own thing. I didn't get the same vibe from CI. The artstyle, setting and some gameplay elements like diving are some deviations, but as a whole this is a very beautifull and fun Stardew Valley Clone. So if you are seeking something totally new ; nope, you're not gonna find it here. butttt......

This is the very BEST SV clone i've ever played. It's such a lovely, polished (for EA, it still has it's problems) and great experience as a whole. You can create the farm of your dreams on a tropical island, and for an EA title you get a lot of content to enjoy. There is lot's of stuff to craft, fun people to meet, different things to do (mining, diving, farming, collecting, designing, socialising, exploring, etc.), things to craft, animals to enjoy and products to refine. It just is a really fun and addicting game that will keep you busy for tens if not hundreds of hours. If you are a fan of Farming sims, this game is a must play, it kinda feels like a 3D Stardew Sequel in a weird kind of way. Which is a HUGE compliement. 

Because of the game being 3D (SV was 2D), i was kind off afraid for it to play slow (like the recent Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon games), which is a very big turn off to me. Because farming games with slow gameplay become tedious en just not fun to me. I was very surprised that CI plays like a charm ; tasks are done quick and movement (although at times a bit wooden) and animations are fast en fluent. Because of this, the game gets that 'just one more day and then i'll quit' kinda vibe. You just can't put it away. 

The game is still in EA, so it also has is lesser points: bugs like not getting to pick up items or characters getting stuck while walking, the game crashes now and then with resulting in you losing a day of progress, there are a lot of WIP storylines and areas (which take away the immersion a bit) and the music sometimes dissapears for a while. 

But like said; it's still EA, so that's a given. The game on the other hand regularly gets new content for you to enjoy, which keep you coming back.

Farming life sims are my bread and butter., the ocean is super important to me, and as a disabled queer person, inclusivity is a must. When it released in early access last October, I was at first excited, but then I saw that the reviews expressed a lot of incomplete playability. While that is expected to an extent for early access, I just wasn't feeling like paying to be a beta tester if there wasn't much fun to be had. So I waited until now, and decided I'd give it at least close to a couple hours.

It's honestly so pretty. There are so many little details such as the sheen of rain on rooftops and trees, realistic layouts for buildings, and various critters crawling about. I LOVE all the scenery. It just feels and looks so good. Also, the UI and controls feel very smooth, fluid. I also love that the game is intended to bring environmental awareness and also brings to the forefront non-Western non-white cultures.

By the way, there's a lovely animal shelter, and it has so many cute animals and I frankly need to be able to adopt at *least* one of each species, please and thank you.

If you have the funds, I'd recommended checking this game out, early access and all. That's my initial thoughts, and I can only see this game getting better, given all the love put into it so far!",1696995624,1696995624,True,0,0,0.456940233707427979,0,True,False,True

I do feel like there are definitely a few areas that need improvement (although since it is early access, that's to be expected). The mechanics for bug catching are a little wonky and sometimes the hit box doesn't quite register accurately. I also felt as though a few of those ""mini-game"" mechanics like fishing, cooking (what equipment you need) and bug catching such aren't really explained and you HAVE to go look it up to find out how to do it successfully. A lot of the upgrades for tools don't even tell you what the upgrade will do (I.E. reduced stamina use, number of swings to clear something etc). It's also a bummer that you can only have 1 pet and as of the Merfolk update mine is trapped in my house. 

Overall though, this game is really cute and charming. It scratches the Stardew itch and even improves on a few areas I found lacking in Stardew Valley (fast travel, ability to adjust time flow etc).

1. Story: a small, beautiful island with secrets and mysteries;  and an ecological disaster to solve. 
2. Beautifully crafted world and you should see the mermaid kingdom ( wow!). Well designed and with more islands probably added in the future - oh gosh!!! can't wait:)
3. You have a house and farm to tend to - upgrade, design and so on... or you can just fish all day long, catch some sea creatures or annoying insects and enjoy changing seasons with festivals coming with them as well. There are monsters in the cavern to fight with and hopefully, in the future, crafting your own swords, armour etc. will be added.
4. A peaceful, calm game play with equally serene music and  the slice of life scenes, which actually made me laugh a lot of times and also made me more familiar with characters living on the island.
5. A lot of things to look forward to: dating, marriages, kids, other islands and more options are still not implemented at this point of time.

I'm coming back to double down on my first review.  I took a break for a couple months and they've already done so much. Some things I think the girlies would want to know:

- The NPCs are BEAUTIFUL and UNIQUE! The dialogue never bores me or feels repetitive, which is so huge to me, it makes the world feel that much more real
- The farming mechanics are pretty standard, but smooth. Just wish I could water more than one tile at a time (maybe I can and I'm just a goob)
- They are adding pets, but they are all so cute and unique! There's a town shelter where you can select your own unique rescue (p.s. the town hall has a pride flag!!)
- The whole storyline is cute and relevant. You are taking over your grandpa's farm in an oceanside town that is struggling with litter/contamination and greedy corps. What more could you want!
- There are so many romanceable characters and they are so pretty :-)

However, every patch and update seems intent on making the game harder in making it less accessible, more difficult, and more frustrating. This game has, in my opinion, become a little bit gruelling, which ruins the fun. It's a shame because it had so much potential. 

The monsters in the mines are now at swarm-worthy levels and I'm going to be frank, I already found the mines to be slightly annoying because of how much energy you use in them combined with how little reward you get. I often waste entire days unable to proceed to the next level because it is almost impossible to get there. But now, you get nuked on site by a mob of monsters that do a lot of damage. 

Coupled with other patches that made money extremely difficult to obtain, new files are increasingly challenging to get started. I bought this game for the farming, the romance plots, and the story line.., not for 'the grind'.

There just seems to be a lot of focus on the part of the game devs to implement things that increase the difficulty and make things more complex, which I find unusual given the genre of the game and their original marketing. 

I don't know why they even boasted the marriage and relationships aspect as that unfortunately doesn't seem to be a priority for the game devs. They are apparently too busy making death bees that kill you in the mines. 

Loved the concept and the story line, but the game is becoming an incredible slog for the players.",1696244330,1696244330,False,73,4,0.699173569679260254,5,True,False,True

I'm also gay but choose not to practice that. And I guess being disabled is also relevant. I don't normally address myself like that but it is kind of relevant.

This game is unrealistically diverse. Every race is in the game, there are subtle disabilities, there's a muslim woman, the opportunity to wear a headscarf or even a Christian kerchief (that they call a farmers hat), and there is optional use of non-binary honorific when creating your character. 

HOWEVER. Sometimes this can be a good thing. I love diversity because I hate division. But a lot of media such as movies and games add in non-white races, disabilities, religion etc simply for tokenism. It's really obvious when they do this.

HOWEVER #2. This game is not engaging in tokenism. Diverse characters have important roles in the game, a lot of cut-scenes etc.  Honestly when I first noticed the diversity I eye-rolled ""hear we go again, more woke tokenism..."" but I must say after over 60 hours of gameplay I'm pleasantly surprised I was wrong this time!

I just have 3 suggestions...

There is a pride flag outside the community centre. Do I want it removed? No. I just think that having 1 flag that represent only SOME people in a game trying to be as diverse and welcoming as possible sends out the wrong kind of message. I think somewhere inside the community centre there should be many more flags. 1 pride flag. And then country flags. This is more inclusive then and fits with the game's image of everybody being welcome. 

I notice there is a temple. But I don't see villagers going to worship. This leads in to some unintentional tokenism. The muslim lady. All she does is metal detect in various locations. She never says anything muslim, I've not had any cut-scenes with her, no important role and no signs of worship. Sorry but at the moment this character exists only to say ""hey, we support religious freedom because we have a girl in a head-dress!"" Faith is not that vain lol in fact some muslims don't ""dress up"". But I digress. I'd like to see more religious diversity. Perhaps the temple can be an inclusive worship place for villagers of ANY religion to come together!! Now THAT would be pretty cool! :) 

Finally a bug. I'm scything grass and some grass glitches and becomes unmoveable. As in, when I walk over it it doesn't move, as if it is frozen. And cutting the grass does nothing but drain my energy. This happens in random patches and appears to be a brand new bug!

Final gripe..... CO-OP PLEASE!!!!!!!!

Overall this game is within my top 3 favourite games. I like the relaxing atmosphere. But also feeling like a part of the community due to the developers trying really hard to make sure EVERYBODY feels welcome. It's a feeling of no judgement and in a world full of judgement and evil, this is great for escapism. 

Before people go off let me remind everyone of a neglected word: tolerance. We don't always have to agree to get along. That's why I'm actually okay with the pride flag even though religion aside as a gay woman I never felt that it represented me as it is just a political symbol (to me). I understand it represents some people. And if I want religious diversity it'd be pretty rich of me to turn my nose to the pride flag when I know some people are atheists!

On one hand, you have a Stardew Valley clone with an almost identical beginning, player activities, crops, and machines. On the other hand, well, it's 3D. There's not much else to say. You can farm, raise livestock, catch fish and insects, mine for ores, promote healthy coral conservation by removing ocean debris, and build friendly/romantic relationships (eventually) with the townies. Stairway Games loves to boast on Kickstarter that they funded their game in less than 36 hours. Such an arduous task for blatantly copying another game. Lol. What began as a $70,000 project, ended as a $1.6 million undertaking with every stretch goal achieved. I'd normally say ""If you are interested in Coral Island, give it a try,"" but the story is progressing at a snail's pace and there are a few things to keep in mind: 

1. The story is a work in progress with the potential to erase player quest progression following updates
2. NPC/townie interactions are mundane with player responses having no impact on relationships or flow of the conversation
3. Numerous bugs/crashes make this game unplayable at times 
4. 3D character models are generic, like dolls with stickers for facial features (the 2D artist is carrying this game)

All of the above points are likely attributed to being an Early Access game. I'd recommend purchasing the game when version 1.0 releases, probably in late 2025. I'm interested in the final product, but there is currently nothing to chase after catching all fish/insects and finding all scavengables/artifacts.

3/22/23 Edit: After reading the March 2023 patch notes, the game has fallen further from expectations. Earned income has been slashed, products/modules removed, and production times have increased. I've changed my positive review to negative as this early version of the game is not something I'd currently recommend. Thank you for the Jester award. Your gifted points were well spent! :)

9/9/23 Edit: Another 6 months and 70 hours since my last edit. I've caught up with the Merfolk update and everything in between. Starlet Town still seems very boring to me, almost dead. The townsfolk wander around aimlessly and the topics of conversation are incredibly mundane. Imagine conversations on an elementary level. Each spoken idea receives a text window and/or followed up with a physical expression by the user, usually some sort of water drop to indicate confusion or worry. The player's text responses do not factor into the direction of the conversation. I find myself just pressing the A button excitedly to finish the stupid conversation faster. It's actually criminal in 2023 to not include an option to skip dialogue entirely, or at the very least, implement an auto-skip function so the player doesn't have to sit there constantly engaged to progress the dialogue further. Recently, I've either fast traveled or walked into a part of the town and came upon a mandatory cut scene with random residents. For example, I encountered a lover's spat between Bree and Walter and a disagreement between Paul and Annie over a forgotten birthday. I was hiding behind a tree in each encounter. What is this Stairway Games? How does this add anything to the story? Airing the dirty laundry of townsfolk, people of which I have very limited interactions with other than weekly gifting. As the romancing guidelines are strict, I can't even romance Bree, so why are you showing me this scene between the two residents? Your character can't approach the townsfolk afterwards, nor do you even ponder this for a second afterwards...SO WHY?

Where is the story even going at this point? The early stages introduced the Pufferfish as some evil oil drilling corporation. We've encountered the Giants in the mines and the Merfolk under the sea. Supposedly there will be some sort of digging area and Savannah? Lol, were you just playing darts with new areas to add to Coral Island? Truthfully, the only fascinating aspects separating Coral Island from SDV were it being a 3D game and the whole coral conservation effort, but the trash in the ocean makes zero sense. You kind of screwed yourself on this one when you developed a game so reliant on scrap, a by-product of trash. Lol.  Clearing trash is super monotonous and boring and you'd expect there to be less of it as you cleared it, but no, there are literally four dedicated caves filled with trash. Lol. 

What about purpose? Is there any more to the game beyond generating profit? The game has these errands you can fulfill to earn about 500 coral dollars and a few dozen merit points, but there are no commissions beyond those. It seems I make between $15K - $90K daily from farming/ranching artisan products, then spend an absurd amount on fertilizer for the next planting season. There's just nothing worthy to spend my profits. Sure, I can purchase a $700K scarecrow in the shop, but why? Give me a reason to plant lesser profit yielding crops/produce. Give me seasonal tasks to harvest X number of tomatoes, Y number of cucumbers, Z number of sunflowers. Otherwise I plan to grow the most expensive crops that earns the most profit. Challenge me to catch so many butterflies or tunas. I want to be optimistic at this point because the farming/ranching/production are pretty cool and the art is fantastic, but the game feels so barren and there is nothing to chase beyond making a profit from the same 7-8 artisan production lines. It's inviting enough to play and pass the time, but it's still a no from me at this point.

Final thought: My game just froze in another mandatory cutscene with Nina and Millie in the library over some stupid angry disagreement between the two of them. Obviously no relation or interest to the player. All I wanted to do was deliver the one Almond Millie had requested in the Errand. I had just come from delivering 2 flowers to the tavern and sitting through another 3 mandatory cutscenes. It's very clear there are no gamers in Stairway Games. They just pumped out a story using SDV as the baseline and generated $1.6 million. I think 150 hours in this unfinished 'game' is more than enough time invested. Any chance I could still get a refund?",1678756150,1696107049,False,7,0,0.528513669967651367,0,True,False,True

- Great art direction. Hands down the most visually appealing game in this genre, even compared to higher budget entries like RF5 and SoS: Pioneers of Olive Town. The environments are lush and full of life (both flora and fauna). Furniture and architecture look great.
- Diving is a great feature and perfect for the island setting. It's very gratifying to heal the ocean and see your community improve.
- Fun and unique festivals (like Tree Planting Day) as well as refined versions of genre staples (the harvest festival is very thorough and rewarding).
- Great cast of characters. Tons of options for romance- you will be spoiled for choice! Everyone has an outfit for each season- it's a touch that builds on their personalities.
- Best video game museum I can think of (second only to New Horizons).
- Progression is well paced and implemented. I particularly like how you upgrade farm products via the Lab.
- QUAILS!
- Really fun selection of tropical fruits and vegetables to farm. The fruit plant, a middle ground between a regular crop and a tree, is a great addition.

I've been playing since early access launch, and early access games can be hit or miss. So I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be fantastic since the beginning.

Bah, look at all that harmony, that peace, that inclusion, that love, that support, that... wait a second, this is great actually!

Joke aside: This game is the lovechild between Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon - and boy does it show. Everything that makes both games great is in it and a ton more. 
The tropical pacific setting is just awesome, the diversity between the inhabitants is just great (and they're all sooo pretty!) and they surely tried to bring new things to the genre in terms of storytelling. I think it takes balls to include a bachelorette with stretch marks from the birth of her child. That's not the typical thing you see on a game but it is sooo true and realistic, I love it. 
I also love the small details. While there honestly many things missing considering that it is early access you might find small details or hidden gems, for example: Archie mimicing a zombie even though the halloween event is not yet finished or a special small ""animal"" waving you goodbye. 

And once you think ""maaaayyybee I've seen it all, it feels a little bit more grinding now"" a WHOLE new world appears underwater with a ton of new content and (for me) some of the best music and best characters. For me it came SO surprising I had goose bumps of joy. 
And then on a second big surprise also some magic/fantsy enters the game which similiar loveable creatures as the Junimos in Stardew Valley. 

The whole island and the whole game is so wholesome, I could spend hours there and enjoy this game. 

I also really respect the game for its message which is indeed a big problem in the ocean and especially the pacific where the game takes place.  

I recommend this game by the power of the fact that I destroyed my sleep rythm in order to play more! :)",1695741579,1695741579,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

+/- Clunky, the tool rectangle isn't on the right tile too often, and there's a lot of stuttering. However this isn't a - because it's probably (hopefully) just a trait of very early-access. But it makes playing this game a pretty cumbersome.
+/- Very VERY tasteless copy-paste from Stardew Valley.

- Writing is very hit or (and mostly) miss. Like too many cutscenes that don't actually teach you anything about the characters or world. Nor is insightful or funny. On top of which it feels like a lot of dialogue options are missing from cutscenes. Making this a role-playing game where you aren't allowed to play as your self-insert like in most farming sims. Instead you are the farmer, which is like its own character with the amount of dialogue options you have to pick because what you want to say isn't there.

At 6h in its an exact copy cat of Stardew Valley except its 3D and you can't rotate the view camera; this combination makes it annoying to navigate. The map while pretty looking isn't very useful its quicker if I google where locations are that I want to be. I wish the map had a search function as well as the ability to pin locations where I want to go and have it be easy to follow in game. This play style has me realizing Stardew's top down retro style is more than cute, its practical.

Apart from getting around the fishing mini game is unnecessarily complicated. I honestly just don't want to play anymore after learning to fish.

I was really enjoying the characters, but you can achieve the same thing by downloading mods for Stardew without the hassle of tolerating the fishing game.

First, I love the farming! I think farming sims need a strong farming foundation and lots of creative aspects to farming to keep the gamer engaged. The animals are basic but yet there is a uniqueness to them as well! You have your standard cows, chickens, and pigs plus some peafowls, quails, and more. The seeds you get are the same. You have your basics and then you have another level of unique to it!

Second, the community rebuilding! This is an absolute gem of an idea for me. I enjoy the idea of watching the island restore its former beauty and then even add to it making you feel like a true value to the town.

Third, multiple story lines to keep the gamer engaged! Each romanceable character has their own back story and cut scenes to make that connection feel truly special. The merfolk and the saving and restoring the ocean is a beautiful idea and it shows how much protecting the ocean is important irl. The giants add a layer to the mining aspect that is sweet and uplifting, making you the player feel like the island can't be preserved without you.

Fourth, the collecting!!! This is probably the most important thing I look for in a game. I adore catching the bugs, the fish, and the diving really sets that into a new standard for future collectathon type games. Plus you get to put them in the museum and monitor you completions and it helps restore the community! Double win!

SO far these are the things that stick out to me and make me love what they are doing. All the things that I have seen that are promised with full release make me more excited to play the game.

HOWEVER, I have not been able to play for more than a day without getting an Unreal Engine 4 crash report that crashes the game to desktop and you lose EVERYTHING you did, absolutely everything you did, that day because there is no save feature implemented other than sleeping in your own bed. No manual save feature, period, other than sleeping in your bed. BUT the other kicker is there is a 70% chance that when you go to bed every night, your game is going to crash anyway, and you'll still lose everything you did for that day.

I do NOT recommend utilizing much of anything to regain stamina to prolong the day because you risk losing substantially more the more effort you put in each day. I had just finished putting up 70 fence pieces for my cow and sheep barn, had filled the hay for the silo, had cleared another portion of my land for a horse fence and barn, for the game to crash the second I walked into my house to go to bed to save. I have my settings on the slowest settings, so it was about an hour to two hours worth of progress that's just gone. There is essentially no point in me starting over again because I know it will happen again--as it has every day I have played and as there have been reports for the last year that are still not being addressed. I have seen reports of the same instance since October 2021 in their discussions and more complaints, still, from players this week alone.

I have played this game a lot, and while there are issues here and there, the patches and updates that are released have fixed those issues so far. I think this game is awesome because of how much there is to do. It's not just a farming simulator.

A solid life sim, based on farming, but also branched strongly into diving and collecting bugs/gems/artifacts, with a rather clear goal for endgame of automation of the main game-play loop. Still have a decent amount of things to do in the game, and can't wait for what's to come. Personally, mostly the graphics and the QoL that helped the main loop of game-play made the experience more enjoyable than other recent titles of similar genre, which are either still in EA or on full release. 

[b]Score: 9/10.[/b]

[h3]Pros[/h3]
+ Big farm for customization
+ Big world map
+ Diving in addition to the usual activities from other farming titles (farming/fishing/mining/cooking/collecting)
+ More waves of content are yet to arrive as it's EA
+ Many mini-games for the festivals (there are several in the game, and each has its own pamphlet; it's just neat)
+ Many NPCs to get to know, and follow-up events based on the friendship parameter
+ Many good QoLs that allow you to focus on the main activities, such as global inventory(meaning at any part of the game that requires access for material/ingredients, it will automatically fetch from whichever chest they are placed in) for crafting, cooking etc., as well as the projection of locations of spawned collectibles in the world map with an in-game device.
+ Charming music and graphics
+ Nice premise of the game of saving the ocean and the island from man-made pollution

[h3]Dislikes[/h3]
- No possible manual rotations of objects or perspectives (so it looks 3D but customization is 2D, if you will)
- Minor bugs (although Devs show to be attentive about them) and crashes that are few and far apart (which can be reported upon occurrence)
- Main loop of the game may get a little repetitive towards the endgame, which might just be a good point to call it then.
- DLC even before full release (albeit it's allegedly for a good cause)

[h3]Minor Suggestions[/h3]
- Horses limit the activities of the player character way too much; it cannot jump across fence nor allow player to pick any collectibles while on the mount. The mounts should just facilitate the movement of the player character while not preventing them from engaging in activities. I would even suggest that the players on mount should even be able to use teleportation. 

- Enhancement of tools limits to 5 sacrifices to reach the required points. I'd say getting rid of the number of sacrifices will allow for a smoother game-play. 

- I also wouldn't mind if there was literally no boundary between the farmland and the non farmland of the player's area for more customization.",1694773865,1694792733,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,True

And now the game keeps crashing! :( Put me off when I did most of the things within a day and when on saving, it crashed and didn't save it! Ughh Please fix it!

There was a new update today 7/07/23. Was happy as I thought they may have fixed the crashing problem. But instead I start up the game go outside and all my crops are gone. I spent hours earning the gold so I can buy the seeds and plant them but now it's all wasted!

09/07/23 I still continued playing this game (8 hours) after leaving a bad feedback, because it's fun and relaxing game and just hoping that there would be no more crash when saving, gives me a bit of anxiety each time I ''go to sleep'' in the game / Save and hoping my crops are still there. I know once the full game has been released it's going to be amazing game! The only thing I wish that would fix in early access is the ''Crashing''.

Since the new updates for August 29th. I went back playing it non-stop. It's much more enjoyable and most of the bugs has been fixed. Thank you! I hope we can unlocked achievements too in the future updates and further developments for the story. I also like to be able to have my dog follow me around as an option. <3 Thank you developers, you guys are doing awesome!",1688604864,1694486667,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The art is gorgeous, the characters are interesting, there's loads of activities to do, there's interesting lore, and the multiplayer gives me and my brother a chance to play together. I'm not sure if there will be couch co-op or not, but even if it won't it will be a good game to play with my younger sister who is mentally disabled.
I played the alpha for over 200 hours and the progress I've witnessed with this dev team is amazing. I also appreciate that they don't just focus on the marriage candidates, but give all the townsfolk the same amount of love. I also really like that the marriage candidates are all different. Even the twins have unique personalities and aren't just copy paste versions of each other. And I find it very cool that Suki already has a daughter that we can bond with.
The children are fully fleshed out as well. I enjoy talking to them and having their cutscenes. They act like believable kids. I'm not saying I'm looking for 100% realism in a game that has merfolk and mythical creatures; I just appreciate the care they put into every aspect of the game. I can't think of anything I really dislike about the game. Maybe how slow it is to make money in the beginning if I had to pick something, but there's no time limit on the important things, so it's not that much of a big deal. And they'll have mod support in future, so I'm sure a modder will have a money mod up.

I thought it was so exciting, I had this in my wishlist and decided to buy it when I found out they would release the merfolk. I have never been so confused starting a new farming game. I love Stardew Valley, I don't know how many hours I played it since its first release. I love Story of Seasons, and I even played the Doraemon one. I never felt so confused trying to decide what to do. Frankly speaking, I totally understand when people said it was like a copy of Stardew Valley. I mean, I don't know what devs actually wanted when they decided to make this a tropical island. They said it was tropical island, and it HEAVILY features Indonesian people and culture, adding some Japanese elements into it as well, but Indonesia doesn't have four seasons. That's what having tropical climate means. I really wanted to love this, and I know it's still early access, and I really don't want to keep playing it for now. First of all, make up your mind about the controllers. I really, really hate how you have to right click for dialogue but left click for info. They are the exact same box, I don't want to have to see the little icon of which mouse button I have to push each time. It works fine for a controller, all I have to do is push the A button, why does it have to be different for mouse? Why is this even a thing?
Now, I really hate watering in this game. I have had my fill on playing with basic watering can before, watering plants one by one, but this is just too long. Why? Because the character is swinging back and forth to water! Do the developers ever water a plant? People don't do that, they just tip the watering can to the plant. That's why Grandma can do it. That's why anyone can do it. How even moving like that would help watering a plant? In reality, you will only sprinkle the plant, not properly watering it. In fact, the water probably wouldn't even come out. It's just unnecessary and it's making farming experience painful.
What's up with scarecrows can't be put in the middle of planted field even though I cleared a patch? I only got scarecrow after I harvested some and I can't protect the middle part of my field because the scarecrow can't be used in the middle of it. Darn it.
I got a mail about diving but I knew I couldn't dive until I hit later level, why even I got this mail? Just send it later when I actually can start diving.
I hadn't started selling anything, but I checked the stores in town and wtf was wrong with the prices. Everything is so expensive. I didn't even care, I used a mod to kickstart my play because I just couldn't be bothered. I have like gazillions of stuff to do, but I always don't have enough time because apparently it takes me an hour to go to town. Lmao. I wasted so much time doing absolutely nothing because I was trying to find some flowers, because I had no money to buy seeds, lmao.

I love how many different characters there are, both single and ready to mingle, and not. (Rafael has my heart entirely <3) 

Being able to grow the town's rank, cleaning up the ocean, donating to make the museum more of a feature on Coral Island, and also helping the gods/godesses take care of the Island and save them. 

There are a couple of things I wish were already here but that's the thing about an early access game. I do also wish that time wouldn't move so quickly somehow? It always caused me anxiety of the FOMO if I didn't get everything I needed to get done before each season is over with, but at least in Coral Island, there isn't a massive rush to try and complete everything within the 1st year.

Its very much in the style of Stardew Valley / Story of Seasons, down to collecting community bundles to save the town, upgrading your home, dating villagers etc. However, it has some great additions like the diving and environmental focus, not to mention the general beachy vibes. 

Pros:
- Has a museum like Animal Crossing to display fish and bugs
- Villagers around town feel really lively and do activities every day like volleyball or yoga 
- There's a fast travel system that unlocks with progress
- You can choose how long each day lasts
- Sooo much crop variety
- Very pretty game

Cons:
- Home design isn't quite as robust as Disney Dreamlight or Palia
- On a laptop that can handle DDLV, this game runs really slow, so despite being a cozy game it needs a dedicated gaming laptop or pc

This is definietly my new favourite farming sim, I love the open world instead of loading screens everytime you want to go somewhere, the storyline so far is so fun, I love the different plants and animals and activities.

It also hasn't had a lot of bugs that I have experienced. 

It is the first 'farming sim' type game with, in general,  more than six crappy marriage candidates (twelve at most in the games that are LGBTQ friendly).

It even has more realistic life- like actual people in shades other than white and a token brown or black family/character (even Stardew Valley, which was one of the best thought-out of the genre until this popped up was guilty of not being very representative- mods disincluded because they weren't made by the game devs), as well as a divorced couple and they don't just have widowers with no backstory.

I love that it has both science and fantasy/magic, but that everyday life is still 'normal.' I also enjoy there being a 'bad guy' The corporation), because it gives you more realistic goals.

The controls are good, as are the graphics. Character customiser is great (with the amount of diverse townsfolk, though, it'd be great to eventually be able to choose modifications like a tattoo or peircing).

Moving furniture and changing the design of the house drives me bonkers, though. It isn't as user-friendly or intuitive as the rest of the controls and it takes waaay too long.

I LOVE being able to re-use trash into paths and stuff. Sends a good message.

However, I don't have a ton of time for gaming and the time I do have, I actually spend gaming, not trolling Kickstarter for new games or sitting in a Discord chat waiting for news on updates.

Therefore, it really ticks me off that there are limited time DLC packs for this game.

Okay, I get the 'Founders Hall' idea because their donations allowed you to work on the game, as it was the largest donation amount. 

But the fact that there is in-game content that will always be unavailable to an average player (i.e. the much smaller donation costume packs, the limited time Ocean charitable pack) because of things outside their control - i.e. not being aware of the Kickstarter campaign, or it selling out too fast or not seeing the updates regularly enough to have seen the ocean pack - is very annoying.

I work three jobs- one full time and two part-time and only login to Steam when I truly have the time, but I would definitely buy the DLC and I think it should be available all the time, as I'm the type who doesn't think a game is complete without all it's DLC.",1693342709,1693342709,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have absolutely loved this game from the moment I have started playing through the 70+ hours I have put into it. As many of the reviews have stated this game is Early Access. So if you are looking for a fully furnished, complete story line and polished game, this one is not for you...YET. I mean that fully...YET because this game is amazing.

Starting this review off I have to give a huge thumbs up with the way the devs have laid out their roadmap for updates, it really shows their dedication and gives you somewhat of a time line to look forward to. Their first update focused on bugs, user suggestions and was community based, rather than content. This shows just how passionate they are to ensure their players get the best out of their work and enjoy the game rather than flooding you with more content! 

The story line is very unique and really pulls you out the normal day to day grind of just another farming simulator. While a lot of the mechanics, farming, mining and fishing are similar to other games such as Stardew Valley, you will find that everything else starts to take off from there. From the characters you meet, the romances, the quests, upgrades and finally one of the coolest additions I personally love...the diving, this game has unlimited potential. 

The graphics, character designs and the island itself are beautiful and it is a very pleasing game to look at and explore. You will find yourself immersed in a world all it's own, down to even the smallest of details. One of the things I find rather interesting about the game was the level of detail for each character they designed. Each character is personally crafted to their personality and even further they didn't make them all ""perfect"". For example ""Suki"" who is a mother has stretch marks, and she shows them proudly as she should. What a great way to show that what could be in someones mind a flaw, or ugly as perfectly normal and should be a sign of a mother who worked hard to bring their child into the world. This is the level of detail that I find so amazing from this game. 

To sum up this review, if you are looking for a beautiful, content rich and story driven farming simulator that will grow as you play then you absolutely must add this to your library. Even in its early state their is hours and hours of content to keep you busy as the updates roll out adding more to to be desired.",1675180004,1692530125,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Being a HUGE farming sim game fan, I was pleasantly surprised at how full the game already feels. Obviously, the game is still in early access, so there's still a lot of things in the works and a few funny glitches here and there, but nothing so bad that took away from the overall experience so far. At this point, I don't even think I can call it a Harvest Moon/Stardew copy, because it really isn't. While it may borrow a lot of themes or gameplay aspects, Coral Island offers so much more.

Graphics are gorgeous, although I would like to see more customization options for the character's features and clothes down the line. The art style for the NPCs are great (and they change outfits—so cute!). The background music is super relaxing. And there's SO MUCH to do aside from your usual farming, ranching, and mining. I absolutely adore the diving aspect of the game and the inclusion of merfolk and I'm excited to see what we can do in the dig site (I haven't gotten to that part yet, so I'm not quite sure if it's accessible as of writing this). There are also monsters to defeat within the cavern, though I feel it's a little clunky still. And I LOVE seeing the museum come to life! Although some bugs just refuse to be caught lol. I'm currently starting Fall as of writing this and I feel like there's a lot of things left for me to do in early access. 

I would like to see an improvement in the hit boxes though, especially for big stumps and rocks as it takes me a couple tries to find the right spot. Also, fishing is a little difficult in some cases, but I would assume that would get easier with increased skill and a better rod. There's also some fish that I can't seem to catch as the meter doesn't move at all, but maybe that's a me problem for now.

The setting is beautiful and the characters are all different, interesting and alltogether lovable. Their stories make you [i] want [/i] to run around the Island each day to talk to them, which is a new one for me. Most of the time, I talk to everyone on occasion, pick out my husband/wife, shower them with gifts and forget about all the other characters until one of them asks for something. Not here! The interesting characters, combined with the pleasant relationship progression, make exploring all their stories extremely fun. 

Both farming and ranching feel incredibly rewarding, despite it's usually repetitive nature. It's easy to upgrade your farm and all the extra buildings are in the realm of 'affordable'. That carries out into all the other parts of the game - weapons, tools, furniture, clothes and whatever else are all varying states of affordable, without the crazily overpriced items that other farming games often include. 

The mines as well as the ocean have interesting storylines that make digging and diving a treat. And they do that while not being crazily out of reach. Especially the mines don't feel horribly endless and repetitive, because there's a clear goal to follow. 

As of right now, there's still a few bugs and missing pieces - absolutely not surprising, seeing as the game is still in it's early access version. Most things aren't really all that bothersome either. The one bug that can really get extremely annoying, is when the game crashes during saving and you loose an entire day. Some actions seem to trigger this behaviour, however, but I have yet to find what exactly to avoid. 

Other than that, the game is already extremely lovely and fun to play and has, by far, outdone it's brethren.

I play a LOT of games like this and they all have shared aspects that's how it goes. if you're looking for that i overall do  recommend.

I do have one (rather big) complaint though. the character creation isn't very inclusive. There isn't very much variety when it comes to hair textures and the one ""afro"" (and the other textured hairs) looks like sh!t compared to the other hairstyles. The hairs have been updated once going from approx 3/20 sh!tty to mid textured hairstyles to approx 5/52 sh!tty to mid textured hairstyles. (which like is almost worse?)
There's also only 4 options for facial features which look very similar (and none of them look like mine) and one slider for weight that inaccurately makes everything bigger.

I'm not saying this is a deal breaker. Especially for an early access game. I'm just saying as midsized/chubby black person i notice these things in games.  Especially in ""inclusive"" games the first trailer says ""be yourself"" but you literally don't let me
I genuinely do like this game. It's fun and has nice gameplay and a good artstyle. I honestly LOVE playing it. But it feels like it tries to be inclusive but falls flat on it's face when it comes to character customization.

While it appears to copy stardew at first, the island theme and island-related tasks help it stand out, and the more you play, the more different it becomes. Despite being early access and obviously a work in progress, there is a fair amount of things to do; it's unlikely you will be able to finish the content in one sitting.

Pros
-lovely art style; character art is beautiful, and the game looks visually amazing without straining my computer
-simple and easy-to-understand gameplay mechanics
-more tasks available than expected for an early access game
-npcs are interesting and diverse
-easy crafting system
-very nice UI, easy to understand
-fishing and bug collecting are fun
-easy to move around map (on completion of certain tasks, which come early-on in game)
-festivals often useful, make sure not to miss
-lots of options to style your character
-developers post regular updates, and have a clear road-map
-ocean guardian dlc is quite helpful early-on, and money goes entirely toward a good cause. 

Cons
-mine area feels grindy at the moment, foes are over-similar to each other and easy to dispatch despite the mine level (more of a challenge to collect bugs than defeat foes)
-some tasks feel repetitive
-shop items sometimes feel over-priced, it is a little harder than expected to earn money in game
-occasional game crash to desktop (due to early access). Can be annoying when you've found a rare item, but it's only happened to me twice

All-in-all I definitely feel I got my money's worth and would recommend to players who love this kind of gameplay. It's the second early access game I've played, and there was a lot more content available than I expected.",1691144232,1691144232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm usually not a fan of farming games but I still wanted to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did (Ive played 22 hours in exactly 48 hours, please send help).

[list]
    [*]The graphics are beautiful and the game is relaxing, with a pleasant soundtrack. It's a delight to explore and walk around the island, which is neither too big nor too small. At some point in the game, you'll be able to unlock fast travel (although there are, in my opinion, not enough spots).
    [*]The storyline is engaging, with the main objective being to revive and grow the island's ecosystem, which sends a lovely message about sustainability. I also got the Ocean Guardian DLC as all profits go to charity, which is an amazing initiative from the studio and publisher.
    [*]The game offers a variety of activities, including fishing, cooking, crafting, mining (while fighting a few monsters), clearing the ocean of trash (which is surprisingly quite entertaining and soooo relaxing) as well as interacting with the local community. I have to admit I really don't like fishing, I feel like the game mechanics aren't very intuitive and are frustrating. Mining can be a bit repetitive too.
    [*]There are A LOT of NPCs, with none of them having a blend personality. They're diverse, all quite interesting, and I always enjoy talking to them every day. AND THEY'RE ALL FINE AF!!!!!! Still unsure which one I wanna date and have babies with though... hehe (team Scott and team Pablo here)
    [*]The only con is that at the time I'm writing this review (August 1st), you can only save the game by ending your day.

It's clear that the developers put a lot of love and care into creating this game, and it's definitely worth checking out for anyone who loves farm simulators and/or peaceful games. I'm usually not a fan of farming games, but this one is the exception. Have fun!

Two QoL things that would be nice.
1. Missed swings with tools not taking energy. Can be annoying when missing a tree/rock and swinging at the air and losing energy, especially early game.
2. Have time freeze when in the fishing mini game. I find to level or catch fish, I need to lower the game speed to 50%

It borrows very heavily from the formula of the Harvest Moon games and Stardew Valley, complete with ""inherit a shack on a messy plot of land"" trope, ""fight monsters in the mines"" trope, and so on. But even with the abundance of similarities, they manage to do it beautifully. 
What truly makes this game stand out from its kin so far is the beauty of world you play in. It is SO well crafted and fascinating to explore. It also has a truly diverse cast of characters that feels like so much more than a token gesture to inclusive design. When first meeting the characters, my jaw literally dropped at times at how hot but ""real"" this characters feel all at once. 
The unique element to this game is the ocean clean-up branch of the island's overall restoration quest, which has you scuba divings into the coral reefs and clearing away trash.  
I am so excited to see where the team takes the project, as there are some parts missing like certain merchants, missing products, and really weirdly underdeveloped combat in the mines.

I first got it not tooo long after it was released on steam, back then I can say I wasn't the biggest fan but I saw all the potential it had. Picking it up again recently I'm in LOVE with it. I haven't loved a game this much since I first started playing Sun Haven!

I didn't play it immediately at that time, mainly because it lacked controller support, and I found it difficult to play using the keyboard.

Months later, when controller support is finally implemented, I finally decided to try it out. I intend to only play for one hour. But one hour soon very quickly became 5 hours in no time, and Coral Island soon became something I play regularly.

I've played farming sims like Stardew Valley and even the Story of Seasons franchise, so I was expecting something similar. Coral Island is similar and yet different from all these games at once. It allows full customisation of your farm which is good for those that love to decorate and are good at it, but hell for those of us that aren't. I think I scrolled through dozens of pictures on Pinterest before I found a few I like and took inspiration from. Getting the necessary resources for the machines I needed to upgrade my tools and buildings is a bit of a grind, but not in the annoying way.

As of this review, Coral Island is still in the beta phase, and had been getting constant updates rolled out. I mainly play this on the Steam Deck, only playing on my PC occasionally. But save for the occasional crash, I haven't gotten many major issues as of yet.

Still, I gave it a try, because somehow.. I miss playing. 

As a solo mum, who's, by the way, also a gamer before I was blessed with a little one, I'm really occupied these days, from managing my time to balance housework and baby care, to working diligently almost the entire day to provide for my bubba. In short, I'm very busy to the point that I don't have time for myself anymore.

The day I bought this game, I just opened it for a few minutes just to have a little peek on how it works. To be honest, I was not that excited. Later that day, after my shift, I put my baby to sleep, and started playing this game. I was really happy and a bit emotional? I guess? because I suddenly remembered the times I played Stardew Valley back in 2021 when I still don't have a baby and I got lots of time for myself, I miss that feeling, you know? But don't get me wrong, I love my son more than anyone could ever imagine. My point is, this game brought so much joy to me. I got excited to play again after a long time.

Whenever I put my baby to sleep, instead of hitting the lights off and calling it a day, I will spend few more waking hours becoming hyperfixated on this game because it relaxes me and yes, it's kinda addictive. And there are lots of things to do in the game even though it's still an early access. I did experience a crash, just once, when I was doing a diving adventure, healing the corals, but it's alright. I liked the graphics, it's very cute. The characters are also adorable, especially, Wakuu, my astrophysicist babe lol. I did finish some of the quests, explored the town and met lots of attractive characters, fought fluffy monsters in the cave, and ventured under the ocean. And right now, I am very much focused on decorating my farm. I had a great time playing this game that's why I'm very excited for the upcoming updates. This would definitely be my ME time from now on.

Pros:
-The game itself is really beautiful in terms of graphics, and each character has gorgeous original art. 
-The NPCs are lovely. I'm convinced anyone who says they're not hasn't spent enough time speaking to them. Sure, the dialogue isn't state of the art, but overall they're well defined and lovable. Everyone has a personality.
-Love love LOVE the fact that this is essentially Stardew with more realistic graphics. Don't get me wrong, Stardew is undefeated and the pixel art is iconic, but I was missing a game that felt more ""real"" and 3D. 
-If you love Animal Crossing and Stardew, this is 100% the game for you. It combines some of the best aspects of both.
-Same-day house upgrades!!! Oh yeah. No more 3 day wait for Robin, they get on it. Tools still have a day waiting period though but that's fine. 
-No dark scenes when traveling around town/the farm, so you can go from each outdoor location to the next without a pause. 
-Okay. You have to note the diversity in this game because wow. We have black and brown characters, tattoos, prosthetics, and WLW vibes to go around. No mods required (looking at you, Stardew). 
-Themes involving conservation and pollution are always fantastic. 

Cons: 
-Stardew. Yep, Stardew. The game borrows a little too much from it, which generally isn't an issue, but c'mon, we have characters named Leah and Emily. There are a billion traditional feminine names out there. And the city itself is called Star— so like...it needs a little more originality. It didn't kill it, but it's definitely a little odd for a seasoned Stardew player. SPOILERS!!!!!!! the plot is essentially identical to SDV with less dimension(ish). 
-Although it was recently updated to include controller support, it was obvious designed specifically for a mouse and keyboard. It's very difficult to maneuver with a controller, and the keybinds are very glitchy. 
-Slow dialogue...to be fair, Stardew and many other games have this issue. Long cut scenes and pauses. I don't want to skip the conversation but I'm seriously bored by the end of it. 
-No tutorial, which is mostly okay, but fishing is hard without one. I had to Google a few things, especially since the keybinds are wonky, but not impossible. 
-Why do we have a single 2D view of a 3D game???
-There are bugs and glitches, but this is early access. It's actually pretty well developed for EA.
-KEYBINDS are pretty much impossible to change, or at least they are for me. They're all mixed up so it takes some fiddling and getting used to. 

Overall, please do not let the cons deter you. I have enjoyed every second of this game so far, and I can't wait to see what comes in the future. Even if you're not a fan of early access games, I still highly recommend it. There's plenty to do. And even with all the negative aspects, I can tell it's gonna be great. 9.999/10",1690098147,1690098147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game's had a few major upgrades that have vastly vastly improved what was previously a bit disappointing of a game. Sure, it's a farming sim, and if you enjoy farming sims you'll probably enjoy this one. The bug catching and diving mechanics especially are standouts to me, the game has a beautiful artstyle, and a unique setting that sets it apart somewhat from the standard farming sim setting. For me, these things are enjoyable and make it worth playing, for others, it might not be enough to sell them on the game. Ultimately, if you're looking for a farming sim game, you'll get that with this, and will have a good enough time playing for it to be worth your while.

Now onto the critiques I have. For one, it is pretty evident the game is still early access, especially in seasons that haven't received an update yet. While each update has been a massive upgrade to the game, there are still obviously areas where it feels incredibly unfinished. Hey, you're working with early access, so it's not a dealbreaker, and there are regular major updates coming out for the game. For me, the biggest flaw is the characters. While they're all visually very interesting, and have interesting concepts, in actual gameplay they have a grand total of 0 personality. Each character has maybe a total of five unique lines of dialogue, sometimes less, when you talk to them day to day, which makes it rather uninteresting to go find the same person so they can say the exact same thing you've heard 20 times before, not really changing their shtick at all regardless of friendship progression. The heart events are almost always not involving the player character themselves whatsoever, so there's no real sense of progressing in friendship or more with characters as you befriend them. Obviously, it's a farming sim so I'm not expecting any groundbreakingly interesting characters, but more dialogue and a sense of progression of relationship would vastly improve the game. I hope this is something that gets added in future updates, because otherwise aside from the unique setting and the diving mechanics, there's honestly not much setting Coral Island apart from any other more polished farming sim",1689886092,1689886092,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Back in May I was fired from my job of 6 years, and my already crumbling mental health took a huge nosedive into the darkest of territories. 

After a while, I reconnected with Stardew Valley and played it obsessively, feeling like it was my only lifeline. As usual though, after a while I started wanting to play games I didn't know inside out, that would give me the same comfort and hope that Stardew does. I've never found a game like that in the genre, despite my searching. 

I initially didn't want to play Coral Island (despite having it in my wishlist) because I thought it being EA would ruin the experience and leave me unable to judge whether I liked the game or not. Boy was I wrong. I've had this game for 3 days and played 25 hours already. 

The story is reminiscent of Stardew, yes, but there are just enough changes that I don't spend my time playing comparing the two in my head. I'm just immersed in this beautiful, vibrant island, doing my chores, talking to people, diving, mining, foraging. Not fishing because I actually hate the fishing mechanic in this game but I'm gonna have to suck it up at some point if I plan on finishing the altars lol. 

I'm taking it nice and slow, exploring and learning the world, new recipes, new quests. There's a lot you can do in game despite it being EA, which is amazing considering how little it costs by comparison. Being inside this universe has really been a huge serotonin boost for me, and being on my farm and about town has been such a welcome diversion from my thoughts. I can't wait for more features to be added to be able to experience the full extent of the island. 

So, from the bottom of my heart - definitely buy this game. You won't regret it.

The music score was also something that greatly pleased me, it's soft music that plays without disturbing the gameplay and turning irritating after its fifth loop or so.

The animation of some actions especially feels very awkward, but nothing you can't look past, you'll enjoy your time regardless, especially because there's a LOT of content so far already, I've almost 10 hours in it, and still am not close to seeing and doing all that's available in this EA.

I've run into numerous glitches that result in my game either crashing out or my character getting stuck. Currently, if you get stuck in the game and use the help feature, you will end up in the hospital, get charged a hospital bill, then lose half your stamina for the following day for something that is absolutely not your fault. This is absolutely terrible feature to have, especially in a game that's in early access and obviously going to have a lot of bugs. Devs, please remove this.

It's really frustrating when you're playing these kinds of games where you can only save once a day and the game crashes and you lose a days worth of progress. I personally don't see the point to only being able to save your game once a day. With how games are these days and the cloud, what's the point of this? 

How long it takes you to travel around is really annoying. Thankfully you can slow the time progression, so thank you for this feature. I also really enjoy the fact that there is fast travel in this game. It might be nice to make the town fast travel a little easier to unlock early game since that's a really important location and it's super annoying and time consuming having to run from your farm to the blacksmith and museum. 

I love the diving. It's probably one of my favourite parts of the game. Super fun game overall, just in need of some bug fixes and maybe some player friendly feature adjustments.

Yes the gameplay still has flaws but it is early access, so it makes sense. 

First of all it's of course your ""typical"" farming sim with a Bali-esque setting. Which is beautiful and wonderful. Can't really say anything to accuracy but it looks lovely. I love that you can pick up trash and clean up the ocean. And mermaids! *_* Furthermore your kids will grow up over time which is an amazing feature. It's just a very lovely and wholesome game overall. Even the ""bad guys"" look so amazing. TAT

gameplay wise i like it a lot, although the mechanics are quite the same as Stardew Valley, this game had a shitton more character that THANK GOD aren't all ugly white men.
Also They made a very smart move here by tying the lore into the gameplay with raising the town's ranking by performing activities such as diving, donating to the museum, and restoring the island's status by donating items to the Goddess and completing bundles.
Also if you take a look at the story behind the giants, amazing! i absolutly adore!

Nice graphics
Lots of romance options
Cute 2D portraits

Weird hitbox, mining/woodcutting/fighting feels squishy
Hard to distinguish NPCs. I mean, there are just too many of them, making almost no one can leave a deep first impression. Their personality, especially in the first few dialogues, feels bland - basically everyone is nice, and, that's it. Truly a waste of such wonderful 2D portraits.

I'm not lying when I say there has been SO much to do in this game. Out of all the activities so far, bug catching has surprisingly been one of my favorites (although maybe that's because I keep feeding my character Bug Jerky haha) along with diving! I'm super stoked about the merfolk update that will come. The ocean's design is brilliant and I love all the critters you can find in the depths of the deep blue!

Do you ever look at a project and you can see just how much hard work has gone into it? I've paused in the middle of activities and just admired how much effort went into this. I've already spent days playing this game and there's still content I haven't discovered yet. I thought it was going to be Stardew Valley on steroids, but it is so much more than that. It has all my favorite activities from Stardew and even Animal Crossing, with more flair.

And the DESIGN! Phew. The design is incredibly intuitive and being an artist myself, I love the use of colors. It gives the game a very upbeat vibe. This is way too detail oriented, but I love looking around the townspeople's rooms. Whoever did the design for that, I applaud you. I ended up looking the whole team up and big props to the Art Department. Y'all really are incredible. Speaking of which-- the diversity of the cast! It is so refreshing to see BIPOC and nonbinary people who take major roles in the story. They're not treated as token characters and there's not just one. They're well developed and it just gives me a lot of hope.

All that being said, there are bugs from time to time. The team is on discord is very responsive about issues and often times other players will help each other out.

I believe in supporting game development as much as possible.  I was not paid to do this review in any way.  I felt it important to share my experience of my first 30-40 hours of my game play.

I've been playing farming and life sims since the 90's, starting with the first Harvest Moon.  They all tend to run the same, with some variances in social, building (or the lack thereof), ranching, farming, exploration, etc.  

I am not going to make any comparisons, because my belief is that each game has its own charm and merits.  

I have enjoyed playing Coral Island and am looking forward to the full release, to be able to continue expanding on what I've already experienced.

I personally tend to prefer the 3D graphic style over the blocky throwbacks, and am quite satisfied with the look and feel of Coral Island.  I do absolutely appreciate that I'm finally able to play an actual adult character, not a chibi child, which to me feels uncomfortable ""making a family"" with.  Kudos for finally having characters that have grown up!

The music is soothing, not jarring, and pleasant enough that I don't feel the need to mute the game, it doesn't irritate me, even after hours of game play.

I've not yet delved too far into the relationship aspects of the game, but I do like it to be simple, and not ""high maintenance."" My real life is busy and complicated enough, I don't want to feel obligated to be constantly pursuing a partner or friendships.  So far, I'm pleased with this aspect of the game.

Mining and cleaning up the ocean are on the same vein, using a tool to clear objects and receiving resources, nothing new about that mechanic.  I do enjoy the change of environments, from one elemental mine to the next, and being underwater, both of which are visually appealing.

Cooking, light item crafting and refining are present.  Additionally, weapons can be upgraded and enhanced. The interfaces and mechanics of these tasks are simple, and effective. I do like that I have the ability to control what bonuses I put on my tools, rather than just the standard bronze > silver > gold upgrades.

The change of the seasons is a standard 28 day rotation, with a good number of festivals (one to two per season from what I can tell).  Not too many, not too few.

I find that cleaning up the environment is satisfying, and provides a nice sense of calm, watching the world I'm in go from messy chaos to clean and pristine.  Definitely zen.

Shrines, a goddess, elemental beings, all again, typical, but not unwelcome.  Another familiar, comfortable aspect that Coral Island takes advantage of.

I am very happy with the fact that I can slow game time down, and move at a pace that suits me.  The ability to make play time variable for your play style is a nice touch that I've not often seen before.

Since I've started playing, from alpha, beta, and into early release, I have been fortunate enough to have only experienced one crash, and noticed a few grammatical errors, but no ""deal breakers.""

I will absolutely be adding this game to my 2023 comfort games list, and I can't wait for it to also be available on the Switch, I'll play it there too!

I could absolutely go on, but I'd encourage others to try it if you like farming/life sims.  In my opinion, it's been well worth the price.",1688941030,1688941030,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,True,True

The game is like harvest moon and star dew had something going on and birth this game. The graphic and style of the game reminded me of Harvest moon save the homeland ps2 my favorite game til this day and had the mechanic and the way the game process like star dew valley the dating the potential partner, getting tools at  the blacksmith and fighting in the mines etc. 

The stuff that I see that feels like what it has the other lacks were seeing the actual personality of the character without having to speak to them. They all move differently in the way they walk and there activities they do that you can see them actively doing is amazing especially taco the dog playing in the fountain and having small info on the characters are nice and being able to see where the characters are is so helpful than just actively running around trying to find them to just give them a frozen tear in the middle of the night almost passing out be able to be in decor mode to move furniture in the house and rotate it perfectly then just holding it in game to get a good angle to place it. 

It really is similar to star dew but its not at the same time but this review may change when more updates happen or when the game is fully released. So far I like it but obviously still lacking since its still in development and I can't wait for the adoption update in a few months.

Main pluses: Great story, characters, and art. I love how (almost) everything you do feels like it has a purpose on the island, and for the story lines. This is by far the best improvement over stardew valley.

Neutral: Most of the game is EXACTLY like stardew valley. A community-center like place to drop some items, a museum for others. A mine you progress through, but with four flavors instead of one. Similar fishing, foraging, farming, machinery, ranching, etc. etc. etc. The only major additions in mechanics are bug catching, which is fun, and diving, which is like a persistent, and peaceful, instead of random mine. Otherwise, it's just stardew valley with different paint. 

The negatives: The mine and especially combat are very rough still. At least one enemy type t-poses, loot from monsters is meaningless, the designs themselves don't fit with the rest of the game, and combat feels really, really bad. This is luckily still a relatively small part of the game, but in my own run I've been putting off the mine as much as possible due to the lack compared to the rest of the game. 

Overall: If you love stardew valley and want basically a second island to explore with more content, then this will be great. Otherwise, either play Stardew Valley first, or stay away.",1688852047,1688852047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So I'll start with the negatives:
- The decor mode with a controller is absolutely terrible. Things get 'stuck', the cursor just generally doesn't function as it should and it tells you, you can't place something but as soon as you switch to mouse, it's fine.

- There's NO indicator on where things are, especially when you're on a quest. No direction where you need to go, you're just left to find your way. Not even a mini map.

- No tutorial or HUD to tell you which buttons do what, the game just assumes you know.

- Can't change the camera at all which makes it really awkward to see things sometimes, especially running around town. I feel 'top down' camera angles only really work for 2D games but that's just my personal preference


Now the positives:
- I always appreciate a MTAP-art-style. The graphics are great

- The animations are good for this style of game

- The concept is actually pretty simple. You run a farm, the typical farm sim game.

- It's chill

The actual review: 

I wish Steam had an option other than ""yes"" or ""no"" because I'm firmly in the middle, but I will have to give a thumbs-down solely for one game-breaking, player-access-limiting reason. 

I've played 138 hours so far, so I clearly very much enjoy the game. I going to start with the positives:

It's cute, it's easy, and the characters are fleshed out and feel like more than just NPCs. I love the island/Polynesian vibe. I like where the story has been and where it looks like it's going. I've encountered no serious issues with bugs. I don't care about the romance options but there's apparently like 24 of them, which I gather is a lot for these kind of games. I was looking for a farming simulator, and honestly this is so much more than that.

That said.... sigh. After the update on June 29th, the game would crash at the end of the day (the only time you can save), and I'd have to play the day over again. After the 5th time this happened, I dove into the discussions and realized that the integrated graphics card was a known issue from the start. To say that is disappointing is an understatement.

I didn't think to check whether the game would have issues running on a laptop with an integrated graphics card. I run much larger games on it with no issues (such as House Flipper and Power Wash Simulator). So why would I assume this game would be an issue? 


Can I still run the game on my desktop PC? Sure. [EDIT 7/6/2023: NOPE. CRASHES ON PC TOO.] But the entire point was to have a game I could play on my laptop. I often travel for work or fun, or just want to sit in my own bed and play a game, and now my source of cozily de-stressing after putting out (metaphorical) fires is no longer possible.

I'm sure I'll play it here and there, but probably not daily as before. Maybe it's a good time to pick up cross stitching again 🤷‍♀️",1688605916,1688693624,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

The interactions you have with these characters are far from cliché, but I would like to see way more unique dialogue and events with them. I found myself eager to ""soften up"" some of the more closed off characters and eager to see how certain relationships play out, but a lot of that isn't in the game yet at the time of writing.

As for the gameplay, anyone familiar with the genre will feel right at home. Unlocking an expandable fast travel system and upgradable sprinklers early on in the game means you could be spending less time doing the ""chores"" and more time interacting with the characters and relaxing on the island. There is a huge host of crops, and a neat cooking system to go along with it that feels a *little* bit more immersive than the typical farming game. The progression system, while similar to other games in the genre, feels a little quick to go through. Admittedly, I played the game on the slowest setting, so each day was nearly twice as long as the default, but I found myself near the end of the gathering progression (Think Gold/Iridium in Stardew) around the end of Summer Year 1. If you played with default settings, I'd imagine this would take you until the end of fall.

I really hope the developers polish this gem by adding multiplayer, many many more character dialogue lines and interactions, and maybe even some more carrots to chase through systems similar to the ""Offerings"".

This game pulled me in through the graphics and its similarity to Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley has been my favorite game for what feels like years now and I've reached 100% completion on that and played through the expanded mod as well. I'll list now how Coral island faces up. 

To be fair, I've only played 14.5 hours of this game so far vs. my hundreds on SV, but I swear this is a good review and I have a lot to say about Coral Island. You have many of the same overarching features. Farming, Dating, Fishing, Mining, Adventuring, Foraging, Ranching, Donations to Museum, Donations to Altar (See SV Community Center). However, Coral Island boasts even more.

The diving aspect of the game is one of my favorites (it doesn't seem to be completely developed yet as there are parts of the story I cannot reach, but I'm still hooked). You're able to dive deep into the sea and clear up trash which gives me a sense of accomplishment whenever I see the clearing I did. If you're into games like Powerwash Simulator it's kind of like that feeling. 

The Bug Catching is also fun though a bit frustrating (every game has a frustrating aspect. I almost see it close to SV fishing frustration but I could also just be bad). You'll run around and catch new bugs to donate either to the Altar or the Museum and it's always nice to finally catch the bug you keep missing. 

Now there are a lot of aspects that are similar to SV but also different. 

The total number of ""Marriage Candidates"" (I don't believe marriage is available yet, but I could be wrong) is vast. It matches more closely to the SV Expanded Mod than it does the actual game. But the best part here is not just the number, it's the diversity! Seeing so many different types of people has been amazing! I'm personally going for Chaem at this point, but I'll be seeing each of the character arcs and will perhaps do another deeper review of storyline once the game is more developed. 

The characters follow a similar scheduled type of movement that differs by season and by weather, just like SV. There are SO many characters though, including pets which is super cute. 

The fishing is worlds easier than SV, but I kind of like it that way. The only thing is that it has been a bit boring. The difficulty for me has been to sit there and reel the fish in. With SV you can have long long battles with a legendary and it's extremely hard. For Coral Island, it's easier, but feels more time consuming. Fishing was my favorite aspect of SV, so the fishing part of Coral Island is a bit lower on my tier for the overall game. 

Mining is very similar to SV. I haven't progressed far enough to know if there's some other mine that we can go to like the Skull Caverns or things like that, but so far very similar.

Combat is more fun. I think it's mostly the graphics, but it does look very cool. However the monsters may be easier (but again haven't progressed far enough to really know)

Farming. Compared to SV, the farming feels slower. I can't just hold down my mouse and farm up all the neighboring crops. However, your range is bigger for Coral Island. Instead of the 1 tile surrounding you, you can reach 2 tiles away in Coral Island which is nice for watering plants in early game. 

I don't have farm animals yet so I can't speak to ranching. 

Foraging/Chopping trees. The foraging is basically the same. However, for chopping trees and mining rocks, I do have one thing that may just be due to early development. Large stumps take up 4 tiles. If you don't hit directly in the center of the large stump (or large rock for that matter) you will miss. It's honestly a bit frustrating, but hopefully with development this is fixed. On the topic of trees, fruit trees also take four tiles and require all four tiles to be watered. I don't really have development feedback for this because that is just a quirk of the game, but thought it'd be helpful to know. 

Scything takes energy. I think it's brilliant since diving is ALL scything when clearing trash. But it definitely took me off guard when I first started playing and noticed I was out of energy. 

I think there's a lot I can unpack with this game and I've only played about 15 hours, but I think it's certainly worth it to check out if you're a fan of SV. The graphics really are cool and the character design is beautiful. Although SV can be played time and time again, it's nice to have a change of pace and quickly Coral Island is becoming one of my favorite games. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I thought it'd be nice for other SV fans to see what another fellow SV fan has to say. I'm excited for all the new development and I think if you all played this game, you'd be just as addicted to it as I am.",1688493300,1688493300,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I am absolutely hooked on it. I was waiting for this to get further into its road map before I picked it up and I honestly wish I had done it sooner.

I have exclusively played this on my steam deck and it works perfectly. No complaints at all.

Some things I really enjoy:
- the diversity and inclusivity of the Townies.
- the crafting mechanic utilizing items in chests and not just what's on hand....makes the need to rush to upgrade your bag less urgent.
- the ease of getting into ranching. It's usually such a big investment that you have to stay with crops but I felt it was a good level of challenge and ease.
 
Some things that I don't like but they honestly feel nit picky:

- the days are really fast/short, ending at 12am instead of a later time. I know this can be changed in the settings but I prefer to play it how it's designed.
- sometimes the Townies aren't in their shops during the posted times but there might be a reason for that I just haven't figured out.

Coral Island is one of other those games I took a chance on and now months later its all I play, I've abandoned my other games for the time being simply because... Coral Island is amazing. 
Lets get the cons out of the way.
1- The Game isn't obviosuly finished- however its not really a con because of how many times they have updated, fixed any glitches, they even gave us a roadmap of all those upcoming updates as well to ease any curiosities if the game is worth it or not.
2- Since the game isn't full game yet, there are still a lot of things that aren't ready such as certain cut scenes when improving relationships, events, mini games and honestly a lot of other things as well- but with all of that this game is still worth it.

some of the pros""
1: beautiful beautiful beautifullllllllllll grahpics
2: soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many romancable charcters
3: the fact you can slow down your farming time down by 50% is SO HELPFUL. My biggest pet peeve about other farming games is how much time flies and you're left with so many things you haven't gotten done before its time for your sims to go to bed.
4: Customizing has to be my favorite thing in this game- from your character, what she looks like, to her outfits, to your house any alllllll the objects you can buy, or what cooking items to buy for your kitchen to even what you want your farm look like. 
5: we also have forest giants to help, you get to clean up the ocean of all the trash, and we also have merfolks coming soon too :) which some of those are datable too.

I was gonna wait until it got fully released, but I am already proud of myself for being able to restrain myself for 8 months since I've been counting down the days until it got released haha

I am super excited about what else they are going to add, and I think that once it gets fully released, it's going to be one of my favorite farming sims. The game is still kinda empty as of now. You can do quite a bit, but it's just obvious that there are still huge gaps and empty spaces. But based on what is there: the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is easy (I play with controller), you can already customize your house and character quite a bit, I love the diving and ocean part (stoked about the mermaids coming next update), and as an environmentalist myself, I love that aspect of cleaning up the ocean and taking care of it.

Honestly, if you're into farming sims: buy it. I sincerely cannot imagine you will not like it haha

That concept does Coral Island an injustice, however. This isn't just shinier graphics, but an engine overhaul from start to finish. The weather patterns in the seasons are here, but the rain soaks the cobblestones and walkways in town, darkens the sand on the beach, and drips from the trees in the forest. Children don't merely walk to school, they skip or trudge along with their parents; pets chase insects or jump into water fountains; and when people are in the town for their daily outing, they're drinking coffee, reading a book on the bench, watching the outdoor yoga class, or working on their newest project. Starlet Town feels alive in a way that other games merely hint at, and it's easier than ever to lose yourself in the fine details of the locals going about their lives as you go about yours.

As to your life, there're no surprises here. You're a returning citizen of the island, here to inherit an old overgrown farm and do what you want with it. Grow, ranch, mine, fish, forage, collect bugs, the island is your oyster. Some of the citizens even remember you and give opportunity to flesh out the character as you go, which is another excellent little touch. The farm itself is nothing new, but the responsiveness of the trees swaying as you chop them down, the art for the animals, and the interactivity of the systems in place of selling enough of your goods to the local store that you see them on display are all great modernizations of SV, well enough to do justice to the original.

Where this game slows down is on the very thing that makes it special, however. So much of its identity is owed to Stardew Valley in terms of character interactions and the plot that some of the issues carry over as well. The best example of this is the main story of the game: the town is in danger of being bought out by a predatory oil company after the area was trashed by garbage and pollution. This sort of thing that should concern the town populace, you would think, so the locals of Starlet Town respond by... doing nothing at all. No pitching in from their interactions, no meetings or leftovers from past failed attempts, no quest lines involving the most concerned citizens and aggregate efforts and results, nothing. They go about their lives, as quirky as ever, and it falls to you, the newcomer with a farm to oversee atop everything else going on, to do the clean-up, the coral restoration, the rebuilding of the museum, etc. The locals don't even comment on it when the town rank goes up, the very thing that so concerned them in the first place.

Central to this is the means by which the problem is resolved. Cleaning up the ocean means revitalizing the coral, and here was a unique opportunity to add to the formula, use some local know-how or innovate some machinery or go into the real nuts and bolts of coral health. It's a central point to the story and setting, after all. The answer on offer? Magic. Special underwater technology and magic, that's what we're given. Stardew Valley used sprites and woodland spirits to repair the community centre, sure, but to hand-wave the explanation when there's so obviously real-world things that could be drawn from to address this problem felt like a cop out, or perhaps an adherence to the source material when the devs should have broken free of it. It's an odd decision, too, because in spring and summer there are days when the community comes together to undo the damage of deforestation and beach pollution, respectively, and that's all handled through human effort and grit with clear results and pay off, no magic or sacrifices to the lake goddess required.

This game is in Early Access, so some of the places I hope the finished product goes include greater interactivity with the locals, whether doing things with them or them interacting with the town more. As the town regains its former glory, tourists or new tenants in the closed buildings in the town would be a great show of progress, or any other sense of responsiveness to the player's input and actions. The groundwork seems to be there for a greater tie-in for everything going on, so I hope that the devs take that potential and run with it.

What complaints I have are clearly the product of the game not being finished, and from the dev responsiveness and the roadmap of what's to come, I'm confident that some of these things will be resolved by or after 1.0. The game is still a joy to play regardless of those shortcomings, at least for the first few seasons ala that incompleteness, so I hope that what we get as a finished product surpasses whatever flaws there might be. The potential is there, the devs are passionate about the title, and the full picture if they do integrate everything they want to promises to be excellent.

Story mode is cute
Fast travel is amazing and I enjoy the points along the island

Cons:
 Can't always speak to a character till maybe a few minutes later if there are a bunch on screen like during festivals.  
Trash seems to pile up at a faster than keep up rate in areas that I have cleared and moved on from. This messes with OCD people and makes progressing in the Diving portion difficult

Saving is only done at night, I wish I could just when to save and not auto save every night

Your fertilizer has to be placed before the crop goes down.  This hurts you if you have reoccurring plants

There is no regular run button.  I have to hit the space bar occasionally to really speed up if i'm hurting for time

I've started a lot of new farms in Stardew Valley to know when something is ripping it off. And this game is STARK.

You receive a farm from a place your family used to live.

Day 1 they give you 15 turnip (parsnip) seeds.

Day 3 it rains. They give you a fishing rod and a bug net for free at the beach.

Day 4  (or 5?) the mines open and someone informs you of that in some fashion.

Unlocks--

Scarecrow unlocks at farming level 1. Incidentally you get that from harvesting around 14 turnips.

Furnace unlocks when you first collect bronze. (I don't know why they decided on bronze? Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin. It's not a naturally found metal? At least not is large quantities?)

Once you hit level ten in the mines, you get an item chest with helpful equipment, and a quest to slay 30 monsters (10 slimes in Stardew.)

I'm sure if I played more, the similarities would continue. As it is, it's a Stardew clone with a face lift. I know they could do better than that.",1688216429,1688216429,False,7,0,0.484480381011962891,0,True,False,True

It is as much fun as Stardew valley imo, but more immersive, with lots of surprises. 
The gameplay  feels good, nothing is really clunky or annoying character animations are smooth and it feels good to play.

Open world enough to explore, a story that's not so in-depth that all you're doing is working on it, characters that are individual and seem to have their own personalities, monsters that are not difficult to beat and so on, and so on. 
The animation is so good that it's easy to see who is who. There's SO much to do but without a whole lot of time restraint. Adjusting the day length is an awesome feature that allows me to take advantage of longer days to get more done. Most of all, I love the way that even at night, there's plenty of light to see. No funky red shades to try to visually muddle through. Overall, a GREAT game - and it isn't even done yet!

Now that I have a few hundred hours into this game I can say that I STILL love it. It's SO disappointing when it won't load/launch for days at a time or when it took over 10hrs JUST to ""validate"" only to start the ""validation"" process again.

It's been a while since a farm simulator held me captive to where I lose hours of my day farming away and fishing. With that said, it's hyper progressive and has some things that some people might find ""charming"" but I just find tacky and forced. It's just my opinion, okay? I think the devs are doing a FANTASTIC job on this game. It's my only gripe.

For instance.... One of the ladies you can date has stretch marks. They're a part of her story and I guess it was voted on in their discord. People were raving about how great of an idea it would be to make her walk like a pregnant woman and give her stretch marks where she used to be pregnant. During the summer when she wears a bikini she has these huge red stretchmarks down the front of her character(all love to the mothers out there. I love mine to death it's just a strange touch for a video game). 

There is a lot of this kind of stuff sprinkled around the game. Like when you do a quest where you catch a bunch of bugs the chick says ""Isn't diversity great?"" and i'm just like.. the hell does that have to do with bugs? Like I said,  a beautifully done game, It's just really hard to get beyond the strange quirks that make it apparent they're western-influenced gave developers lol. There's a pride flag hanging from the outside of the community center as well. That could just be because it's pride month so theyre paying respects to that and that's dope but beyond that I'd have to ask, ""why? lol"". I never really noticed if it was there last month. like I said, it doesn't bother me but it makes me scratch my head. 

Like, I just want to play an adorable farming sim where I can get lost in conversation with the townsfolk and make dope ass food from the crops I grew. I don't really get the point of throwing in a bunch of human rights topics. I'm happy to see where the game goes and I check back frequently to see when the next update is but hopefully they ease up on the real life topics. I just wanna farm my wang off dude.

Coral Island truly captures what makes this genre (and Stardew, in particular) so fun and engaging.

Everything about this game is genuinely fun: the combat, the farming activities, the bug catching, the diving, getting to know the townspeople; especially uncovering the lore behind the island, much like the secret notes in Stardew. They made a very smart move here by tying the lore into the core gameplay loop with raising the town's ranking by performing activities such as diving, donating to the museum, and restoring the island's status by donating items to the Goddess and completing bundles. (Fast travel, anyone?!) You'll find lots of interesting additions here that feel like Stardew and Animal Crossing combined into one ultimate form:  besides diving and bug catching, check out the laboratory in town as soon as it becomes available to you. You'll find some very neat things at this vendor, I can assure you! To boot, the game devs appear very involved in their creation and the roadmap appears solid.

Even though I have my complaints about it not being full released (Cause I really want all the things hehe), they are the normal complaints you'd have with anything Early Access. The game is addictive and I want more!

So, I'll start with the art style, because it's what originally attracted me to this game. It's Polynesian and it's beautiful. The characters are unique, the game story so far has kept me waiting for the next chapter and the farming system itself is nice and cozy. I have a lot of Story of Seasons and OG Harvest Moon vibes mixed with games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. 

There is plenty to do in this game, whether you want to fish, farm, raise cattle, go diving in the oceans, or just scamper around foraging and talking to your favorite characters. You can design, craft, and build to your hearts content on your farm and have a very vast region to do what you want with. It's very cozy and had hours of playability.

Coral Island also has a skill system and combat system that are still being added too continuously that I find not super challenging which is nice. It gives a little more play room to figure out what you want and gives more than enough to do. On top of that there is a lovely clothing system with more and more styles coming out ON TOP of the fact the NPC's are getting seasonal clothing too!

This game has so much you can do and it's consistently being expanded upon so I highly suggest nabbing it up now so you can come along for the ride.",1686796088,1686796088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Everything feels very ""this is cool, I like this, let's put it in the game!"" and I feel like it's really well balanced so that it doesn't feel like a hodgepodge but a cohesive whole. A+ aesthetic.

As it's still in early access, there are some little issues here and there. I froze a few times while diving and had to shut down the game. it would be nice if it put where you click on higher priority than where you're facing, like when watering crops or talking to people.

It even could be a great game.
The atmosphere and mechanics from the games it draws inspiration from harmonise well, feel like they belong together, nothing clashes or tries to steal the spotlight.
It is being updated regularly, it has gone through a lengthy alpha phase before being released, so surely all the game breaking stuff is gone, right?
It is a game that only needs more content and polish to be ready for an awesome release, right?

Well, let me tell you about my past three months with this game.

All is well in the beginning, new game, new adventure!
Launched the game, got through the intro, started getting to know everyone, did some basic farming work, I am having a blast!
Until a few hours later, the game started freezing during the only save point the game has: when your day ends and you go to sleep.
The first time, after waiting for 10 minutes, task manager no jutsu managed to save the day.
Next time it happened, I lost the day and had to re-do the entire Cherry Blossom Potluck.
Crashes became more and more frequent. Loss of progress became more and more frequent.
I did the Tree Planting Festival four times before it finally managed to advance.
Since then I am stuck on Day 24.
The game's crash log generator has yet to succeed making a crash log.
It's been me trying every couple of weeks for three months and some game patches now.

Both people on the community hub and I still have the same issue.
The game was in alpha in 15 months and is now in early access for almost 8.
And still people lose their progress with some having to keep separate backups of their save files because they just can corrupt over time?

I am sorry, but this game should have stayed in alpha if something as basic and essential as saving correctly does not work. I could have understood that after hundreds of days and tens of thousands of crops and other items, this could happen. But after just a few hours?

It is such a shame because the game is really, really fun otherwise.",1686342737,1686342737,False,195,5,0.81029742956161499,0,True,False,True

At this point, the only real issues I have is that I can't buy anything from the taco truck, and I can't give the cats and dogs unlimited head pats.

Original Review: [strike] I would love to be able to recommend this game, but I can't. I understand that it's currently in early access, but there are so many bugs, incomplete talent trees, and dead ends in certain areas such as relationship/npc interactions, mining, and just crafting in general. I tried so hard to overlook the grammar and spelling mistakes in dialogue trees, but it's really hard to do so when there are so many other issues. I look forward to the game's full release, as it is extremely reminiscent of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon, but in it's current state, it should be available as a demo, not early access. And certainly not for the current price. [/strike]",1667417711,1686237621,True,0,0,0.71977078914642334,4,True,False,True

In this game, things are just kinda missing all over the place which leads to a lot of confusion. I just found it really strange. It's a beautiful world and will hopefully shape up to be something really special.  Just be aware that it will be a bit odd with the missing content.

One thing that is a problem is the character getting ""stuck"" in the environment. They know its happening because there is actually an ""I'm Stuck"" button in the pause menu. The problem is that using it cause my game to crash every time. I'm getting stuck under water a lot, and losing all my progress for that day. Slightly frustrating but I figured I would just avoid areas where I get stuck, but the areas are multiplying. Gonna have to fix that before it makes the game unplayable.

I've put about 45 hours into the game.  It's very similar to Stardew Valley.  I really love the art work and that you can do missions in the ocean and eventually encounter mermaids!  I haven't dealt with many bugs and it only crashed once on me.

For a game that came out in OCT 2022, I feel like the update for this game is a bit slow.  They added more people that you can possibly romance in game, which is cool and all, but as for cut scenes and interaction, its little.  And honestly I'm really tired of Macy talking about her eyes hurt from the lights, lol.  

Missions end up being incomplete as for you to progress.....you need to wait for 2.0 update . They literally just put out 1.0 update for Summer. 

So far the only quests that seem to take most of the time is offerings, working in the mines and ocean (though that will come to an end as you need to wait for 2.0 to come out) 

I really like the idea of this game as it's really just another Stardew valley game with different art work and mermaids but for a game to come out in OCT 2022 and have little updates since then BUT with the promise of other updates that will come eventually, it's really not enough for you to even play till you wait for ALL updates to be placed in.  

With that being said, i sort of wished I waited to get this game because essentially you're paying for a unfinished game with updates that will come much much later (like towards the end of 2023) and when they do the updates its little additions.

My impression may come from a different angle, because I played this game before Stardew Valley. After having played Wonderful Life and Rune Factory, I came across Coral Island, and it looked like it could be the game for me. I liked the colorful environments and character design. It works fine on the Steam deck and controls feel intuitive. It is clear that a lot of effort is being put into creating and polishing this game. For this reason, I can't give a negative review. However, the game didn't stick with me. Moreover, I went along to play Stardew Valley for the 1st time, and I'm hooked. Despite having inferior graphics and controls, it has ... I'd say, it has a soul, a ""feeling"" in the environment that sticks with you. 

Coral island is very pretty. It doesn't look affected by bad tourist business at all. Residents drink coffee on the deck, smile at you cheerfully, and everything looks like some kind of Californian utopia where only the right people are let in. There is some trash and oil in the ocean though, and the task of cleaning soon became tedious for me. The scientist-task giver has a robot and some magical crystal network of cleaning, yet I have to walk around the ocean floor with a sickle. Can't the robot have a knife or a sword, or maybe a laser?... I didn't feel motivated to do anything besides gardening, so I decided to get to know all the residents. Seriously, I can hardly distinguish any of the bachelors. Apart from their appearances, to me they all feel like the same person who says something about weather and liking certain foods day after day... after day. There was one big guy who seemed a bit different because of a single ""grumpy"" note in this character. The pretty avatars alone are not enough for me to be invested; I'm too old for this. I may come back to it later in the final release, but I doubt that this general ""feeling"" of the game will change enough to hook me up.
In Stardew Valley, you can see right away that the town is struggling. A huge store with creepy marketing stands out among the quiet streets like a sore thumb. Nature is pretty. Petals flowing in the wind, fireflies following you at night, pretty flowers, fairies, spirits...  The pixel people have exaggerated traits (like most characters), yet they feel 'real'. They bring something extra to make me care. There is a lady living in a trailer, drinking herself numb every night (dunno why yet); an old man in a wheelchair who says he can't see the flowers; a hermit who prefers to live alone yet still comes to town events (curiosity?); a cowboy wizard; a programmer who dislikes sunlight and whose family doesn't understand that he actually is working, not just sitting idly by the computer (isn't that relatable?); a very wholesome old lady... I can go on. So far, Stardew Valley managed to hook me up, but Coral Island didn't. So if you're looking for similar things and you are 30+, my 5 cents may be useful.",1685358624,1685358624,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

If you thought those games were great, but needed to be more aesthetically pleasing? You should've already bought this game. If you thought those games were great, but needed to be more diverse -- yes, even you, Pumpkin! Somehow! -- then you probably should be out on street corners handing out steam codes for this game to the unwary while preaching about the coming Messiah. I'm just saying. 

On to the actual review: 


While the game is unfinished -- it says EA right on the tin -- and there are a few glitches? This game is a gorgeous, heartwarming, cozy, *relaxing* little number that will easily eat up hundreds of hours of your life. The game *makes* you take it slow and chill out, wander around, take in the sights as you experience all the gameplay actions we've all gotten used to in games like Stardew and Portia. 

Thing is, though? The grind isn't at all frustrating -- at least not for this little black duck. There are just too many different (again, gorgeous) items and moments of ""oooh"" to keep a player going until the various milestones are met. For contrast: I *adore* Portia and Sandrock -- they're two of my all-time favorite games -- but I *immediately* went looking for mods to hack down the grind aspects so I could get to all the good stuff. 

This game? Not so much. I'm *here* for the slow and steady approach. I feel rewarded for my patience with all the quirky humor and honest-to-Christmas beauty and *kindness* within this game. It's a wholesome and *inclusive* game, and there's always something -- or someone -- to catch a player's eye with all their glories. No, I'm not exaggerating. I'm going to be *heartbroken* when I've played 800 hours of this game and can't bring myself to play more... yet...

Mechanics/Glitchiness:

Farming = Excellent, though the watering mechanic can be a little awkward until you get the hang of it.

Fishing = Awesome, though watch out for carpal tunnel. Maybe don't fish all day, folks. 

Mining = The one thing I honestly can't stand. The combat is in the mines, and it's both boring and annoying. I'm not a *fan* of combat much of the time, but when I have to do it in order to have something else? I'd like it to feel worthwhile. There's just no joy in this combat. On the plus side, it's easy to get through it with a very weak weapon. 

Trash-collecting = SO SATISFYING. TOP MARKS. I WOULD DO THIS ALL DAY. 

Cooking = Glitchy. What to click when and where for which dish??? It doesn't always acknowledge the ingredients and tools you have when you try to cook a recipe manually in your kitchen (You get a kitchen!!!), and that is frankly infuriating. On the other hand, the artisan production machines you keep out on your farm are *glorious*, and can provide an incredibly wide range of lucrative products.

Ranching = Faintly glitchy, but mostly great. It's nice and easy and intuitive to raise the cows, ducks, and chickens (all I've gotten so far), but picking up the eggs, milk, etc. can be a pain if you don't click in the exact right spot. The eggs may also be *invisible*, so you have to mouse over the whole coop.

Festivals = Fascinating. I've never really been big on this aspect of my farming sim games, but I have to say that Coral Island is original about their choices. They just don't do what everyone else does, and that's wonderful in and of itself. 

Bug-Catching = I *used* to find it frustrating, but I got the hang of it within a couple of real-time days, and now it's really addictive. This game just does a better job of the mechanic than several others I could name. (I mean, I love Pumpkin Days *forever*, but damn.) 

Romance Candidates = *chef kiss* Perfection. Never has there been such a *magnificent* range of hotties to choose from. My eyes are blessed. My heart beats anew. My soul takes flight. 

All in all? I love this game. The only reason I put nearly 60 hours in before reviewing is that *I didn't want to stop playing*. I vastly look forward to more updates from the developers, and I'll absolutely be following them in the future. 

Now to check on my orchid honey... 

Rating: 8/10, likely to go higher with updates. *Would* be 8.5/10, but it's one of those games where the save only happens when you sleep. We hate that.",1685045501,1685045501,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- The sea farming is a nice break from the regular farming and there are a few little surprises too.
- A great variety of things to farm in general.
- You don't get all the upgrades at once which is a nice touch.
- The storyline revolves around more than ""just"" farming. This is probably what I enjoy most about the game, it has great variety and an interesting mythical aspect.

Cons:
- The map could have been lit up in the area you need to search when you have a quest in progress. A lot of time is spent on trying to find your way around.

It's not finished yet, but the updates are steady, the devs listen and care about the game, and it's definitely playable. The new summer update (May '23) is like the others. It expands the game, fixes bugs, improves QOL play, etc. 

The only real con is that you can't save whenever you want. You have to either play to the end of the day and go to sleep, where it will save. Then you have to wake up and then you can quit. It's very annoying. I've been playing for awhile and the devs are going to change this, but I can't remember when they plan it.

But the rest of the game is delightful, relaxing, colorful but not garish, and the story of the Island is also interesting. I can feel the love they've poured into this game. And I imagine I'll be playing for quite a bit longer. 

Even after nearly 300 hours, I still have things to do, even though the game isn't done. So yes, I highly recommend this one!

Coral Island's a farm simulation game that's still in development as I write this. Your character moves to a tropical island where they start running a farm, and get involved in the lives of the depressed locals as a soulless corporation tries to buy up the island.

Just like in Stardew Valley.

You go into caves in the woods near your house to fight monsters, and dig up metal to upgrade your tools, or geodes that you take to the local blacksmith to break open and reveal treasures.

There's an empty museum it's up to you to refill by finding jewels and ancient artifacts.

There's a supernatural helper who'll open new areas or unlock extra features after you give them all the things in certain groups of items they ask you to find.

There's a festival where you can get free friendship points with everybody in town if you add something really tasty to the potluck soup.

Basically, it's Stardew Valley with better art, and a few areas where they go one step farther. Like besides fishing, there's also a bug-catching feature. Or like how SV talked about mermaids living near the beach, this game lets you go scuba diving and actually meet them.

But me, I've already played the hell out of Stardew Valley. I'm not super excited by a game that obviously took all its cues from a game I've already played the hell out of.

If you liked Stardew Valley, but wished there was a bit more content, or a few more romance options, this is the perfect game for you! It does what I'm sure it set out to do, and it does do it pretty well. This is a good farm/life sim game with a lot of things to check out.

Pros: engaging storyline, gorgeous artwork, good mechanics, relaxing soundtrack, easy-to-grasp concept/gameplay, fun interactions with people and animals, the festivals are entertaining, the ability to ship goods is amazing, and instantly having access to such a large plot is great (not having to buy/extend it by grid). 
Cons: repetitive mechanics (grid-based mining), I feel there should be difficulty levels when you begin. Many players are there solely for the story and do not want to invest so much of their time in the grind of the resource game. Fishing is frustrating, as it takes so long for the cast, bob, reel animation. Bug catching is identical to the animal crossing mechanic, but personally not my skill so- frustrating. Developing relationships and progression is wildly slow, and trying to literally run someone down to deliver the quest (errand) item is ridiculous. We should be able to put it in their mailbox or ship from our bin direct to them.

MAJOR CAVEAT:

I wouldn't buy this until it's out of early access. The updates tend to be super frustrating and I can't help but think I never would've had a problem if I had started on this patch rather than earlier. For example: The latest update released a new tier of tools. Many of them are not better, they are just as good as the previous tier was and they nerfed all the tiers below them more.

There's been some constant nerfing of prices on goods that MIGHT make sense later on but are really just more frustration now.  As it stands a lot of cooked products sell for only marginally more than their ingredients and sometimes a whole lot less.

This is stuff I hope will be fine for new players when 1.0 drops and the pricing will continually get addressed along the way I'm sure but for now I recommend waiting and you'll enjoy the game a lot more.",1684519709,1684519709,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

♡ Pacing - for a cozy farming game, I always felt Stardew was a bit rushed.  I know the point is to be realistic about what can be completed in a day, but I feel like I can do so much more in a day in Coral Island.
♡ Art - I like 8-bit, but I don't love it.  So having a more realistic, but still animated in a Disney-esque way, is perfect to me.
♡ The characters - POC.  Tattoos.  Stretch marks.  Shy men.  Buff women.  There is so much diversity on the island.  Some of it is a little stereotyped imo like the asian computer girl but I also haven't progressed enough in my relationships to learn their whole story.
♡ MORE ANIMALS - they recently added pigs and quails to animals you can have on the farm.  You can breed insects and fish.
♡ Love for the environment - one of my favorite themes through out this game.  Most of the characters are bothered by the state of the island.  They want to preserve it's natural beauty and I love that they push that message without being overly annoying about it.  A line of dialogue here and there.

I think Coral Island is the next step in cozy farming sims.  Stardew built on what Harvest Moon did and Coral Island is building on what Stardew did.  Between Coral Island, Dinkum, and Stardew, Coral Island is still my favorite.

Minor things, but:
- I know I have to earn it, but I wish money was just a little easier to earn.  Maybe I'm not just smart about it or I'm overthinking it and comparing my growth rate to what I'm used to with other games.
- In the future, would love to see the full breadth of customization options for clothes and home decor.  It's still early access.
- Eventually, would love to see some events that are more than just festivals.  Not sure if that can be done with the game engine but maybe a fishing competition or hide and seek on the island.",1684515883,1684515883,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Coral Island has far surpassed the others in its genre in terms of sheer enjoyment and delight. I'm serious ya'll. First.Ever.Steam.Review. and I'm a paltry 8 hours in. Go ahead, chuckle wryly and roll your eyes...as long as you keep reading reviews.

The developers have earned every dime you spend on this game. It is beautiful, fun, runs smoothly, has tons of balanced content through quests and crafting(but not an overwhelming amount like Graveyard Keeper), and has some tiny details that make a big difference: birthing stretch marks on a fit and toned mother NPC is RAD, burn scars on forearms of potentially former food-service worker NPCs, rough work-worn hands on a carpenter. I was genuinely smitten from an hour in. 

Sure, the genre-familiar format already gives a solid foundation but there's an enchantment here in the small things that knits the larger components together with love. The NPC's change clothes, play volleyball on the beach  and show quite a bit of unexpected autonomy.The storytelling is just different enough, the setting is gorgeous and easy to lose yourself in, and even the character customization was a vast improvement in the farm sim category.  The art style is captivating and I started feeling like the NPC's could have been real friends. 

Dev's - keep up the good work, reward us with continuous updates and when your love for Coral Island starts to flag or fail, just read some positive reviews. I hope to continue to see your personal investments in this game.

Make this your first farming/life sim or your 7th - just make it happen. Go on, I'll wait for you to check out........ :D",1684387199,1684422852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For most Indonesians, HM is *the* reference point when talking about farming sims, much more so than Stardew Valley or any other later iteration of the genre. It's not even close; *all* Indonesian news and reviews of Coral Island that I have seen unanimously compared the game to HM series instead of SDV. Thus, when I read English reviews saying that the game is mostly an SDV copy, it's actually pretty funny because SDV itself was intentionally made as an HM clone with more content and an improved gameplay experience. The same can be said of Coral Island, and I'm not complaining.

Most of the base game mechanics in Coral Island are shared with HM and SDV, but there are lots of additional content even in the current early access state. You may farm, mine, fish, scavenge items, raise animals, make offerings, donate to museums, celebrate festivals, all of the things you can also do in many similar games. However, it also has a unique environmentalist flair with the ocean trash collection and recycling mechanics, as well as extensive arrays of plants, animals, and items to farm/raise/fish/catch (though some will not be available until future updates). Not to mention the diverse NPCs to interact and develop relationships with.

Art style-wise, it's not particularly groundbreaking, but the mixture of 3D models and 2D illustrations in this fits perfectly. I like that the game doesn't go for chibi-like aesthetics and gives a more realistic proportion (though still cartoonish) to the 3D models. The landscapes of the land and the ocean are done beautifully, and I really love the shiny, wet rendering of the town during rainy days. The music can be better but at least it's comfortable enough to listen to.

For all its similarities with other farming sims, Coral Island is still a charming game with its own personality. Do give it a chance if you love farming sims in general, or have been wanting to play one but don't quite like HM/SOS and SDV aesthetics.",1684116458,1684398641,True,92,0,0.875099003314971924,1,True,False,True

Before I get into things here, I want to state that Coral Island is still a pre-release game so things are likely to change quite a bit as the game continues to be developed. The game itself is beautiful and the story is well written. There's quite a lot to do in it already. I really want to recommend this game to others but it seems that with every update, the Developers change something to make it increasingly more difficult to actually follow the main farming quest line.

I've been playing Coral island since the beginning, and I have a lot of time invested. I want to start off with a couple of examples... In this latest update the price of a the Smoothie and Green Smoothie dropped from $140.00 and 165.00 each down to $15.00 each. Now that might sound fair, however; I can't buy a cup of Coffee at Raja's Coffee Stand for less than $150.00. and yet I can not brew a cup, myself, in less that two days. When I sell  a cup of coffee, I receive less than half that amount.  I'm sure the argument to all of this would be that, in reality, the middleman always takes his/her cut. To this, my own response would be to open a food stall or maybe allow locals to pay a fee to come and pick their own produce. Those are real things too. By the way, an entire keg of coffee yields one cup of coffee.  One Cup. Two Days. 

I'm afraid to see what they've nerfed the price of Cactus Jam down to after I spent so long working and saving to be able to pay the $300.00 per seed price to finally produce it.  I'm still waiting on that crop to come in before I can even find out. Cactus seeds are no longer available at Sam's, during the fall, but my crop still appears to be growing and my spare seeds are still in my storage. 

With each nerf to the player's potential income, the answer seems to be to buy more farm animals and make more machines... Until your farm no longer resembles a farm but some bizarre outdoor specialty grocers. 

On a previous update, the cost of Wine was nerfed, by a huge amount. Not only in the actual payout but in the time it takes to produce it. It seems that a number players had figured out that they could become Wine Barons if they just focused on grapes and kegs. That change made sense.

Everything you purchase, on Coral Island, is so ridiculously over priced - Clothes, Seeds, Kitchen Appliances, Furnishings...  With every new update it becomes more difficult to figure out how to pay for seeds, equipment, and furnishings. It appears that the only one not allowed to make money, on this island, is you. 

The last couple of things I want to comment on are the length
 of each day and the inability to save the game yourself.  

Now, this isn't my first farming game and yes, I have adjusted the slider for the length of day all the way down to 50%.  I have the Barn and Chicken Coop fairly close to my house but running the few feet between my home and these barns is 10 minutes. Putting down 8 pieces of hay, picking up 4 eggs, petting 8 animals and milking 4 cows takes an hour, at a run. Half a day to water several crop plots... This is not accounting for harvesting crops either. I've done these things in real life. I can fill an entire basket full of eggs and put feed out in a matter of minutes... As far as watering goes, I have a huge garden and it doesn't take me half my waking hours to do that. In my opinion, the game play needs to allow for a larger decrease of speed for each day. I don't want to take away the full speed for those who like the challenge but I'm already sprinting all day, everyday. 

Lastly, game saves. The ONLY time you get a game save is when you go to bed. At the end of the day. If you crash between the sleeping and waking loading screens, all the previous day's work is wiped away and anything you accomplished the day before is gone. That's right, there are no auto-saves after key events like the Cherry blossom festival or the Mermaid cut-scene so if you crash at anytime before the next bedtime, you just revert back to 6am that morning and have to do it all again. If player saving is not something that's going to be implemented then periodic auto-saving should be a thing.

As I stated at the beginning, this game is visually beautiful and the story is compelling. The NPCs and their stories are unique and getting better all the time. Character creation is as well. I just find this game way to grindy. I don't want to have to sprint everywhere because of time constraints. This doesn't allow me to actually enjoy the beauty of the island or learn it's stories. It also doesn't motivate me to stick around. 

The economy needs some reworking for sure.  Our Character's story is that they're a 3rd generation farmer (or at least gardener) and we communicate with our family, back on the mainland, via mail. 

Were I able to reply back to my family, I would imagine it would look a little something like this... 
 
""Dear Dad, 

I hope everyone back home is doing well. I miss you all. If it's not to much trouble, can you send me some seeds. Please see the enclosed list. Sam is really ripping me off on some of these items and I don't think I can afford to continue growing crops here if I have to purchase from him. 

All my love, 
           Saphia 

P.S. Also, some sweats and t-shirts would be much appreciated. Thank Grandma for all the goodies!""


As it stand now, I would recommend that anyone who's considering paying for early access, might want to hold off and see if some of these issues get corrected in an upcoming patch or another update before spending any money.

   Happy Gaming Everyone,

There are aspects that remind me of the OG Harvest Moon games, as well as their Story of Season successors. There's clear inspiration from Stardew and a bit from Animal Crossing too! The inspiration from these games that went into this one only pushes it higher rather than any sort of negative from it. There's a fun fishing mini-game, bug catching (that I'm bad at), and diving too!

The art in this game is beautiful! The animals are cute, the buildings are well done, and most importantly, the people are amazing! Each character is expressive and has multiple outfits you can find them in. My favorite lady is Aaliyah, but it was so difficult to choose her over the many other options. I'm a lesbian and I still got pleasant surprises out of the men you can romance! Whether you want a man or a woman to romance in your game, you'll be able to find someone.

Now, I reached summer in my playthrough, but I'm taking a break to wait for more content. I most definitely didn't see all there was to offer, but Aaliyah doesn't have any heart events at the time I'm writing this. I want to wait until I can have more interactions with her.

Even with that, it'll be hard to stay away from this game. It's showing tons of promise with all I've experienced and it being early access. It perfectly sates my desire for a farming game!",1684288145,1684288145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

9/10 game so far, only minus is the few bugs and annoyances that come with the pre release version:
1. some monsters have fx bugs, and they can't attack or be attacked.
2. a few times now, I've seen butterflies and moths that spawn too high up and are impossible to catch.
3. night-time butterflies will instantly fly away, there's no way to approach them currently at my rank I believe.

But even for now in it is enjoyable to play even if there are still some bugs and issues that early access brings with it, but it's nothing major I could complain about and I'm sure the Devs will fix everything going forward. 
I'm also really excited to explore the storyline further, both on the island and in the water.

So if you're looking for something to put a lot of hours into (and of course enjoying every second of it) this game is definitly for you.

It could've been interesting to see storm season incorporated to fall/winter months, and have winter reflect tropical life with still being able to farm, etc. It felt like a missed opp to help Coral Island stand out from the many other farming sims out there.

The diving feature is smooth and underwater area is beautifully crafted. You can tell careful meticulous care was taken with each aspect of the land, mines, and sea. The scaling system for your town is easy to understand, and improve your rankings. The developers honestly listen to the feed back of their community and implement ways that don't make it to hard or easy to complete your objectives. The variety of the characters are amazing as well. The unique look at what a spirit is, and the culture references are amazing.
