2338770,159241575,76561198351190788,132,5,20,20,20,1708866762,"It's a lot worse than NBA 2k23. I thought the reviews were just an exaggeration, and mostly the negative reviews were talking about the online stuff and VC's. I bought this game because I thought it was updated and could hopefully play games realistically, just like in the NBA today. However, there are many reasons that didn't meet my requirements, and NBA 2k23 was better than this:

When selecting a team in play now, there's a player who will display while dribbling, but in 2k24, there's nothing.
When I changed my jersey, the court doesn't match the jersey, unlike in 2k23 where it matches the jersey.
The fonts are ugly.
It's quite unattractive in a way that it is not smooth (not talking about the framerates) and is sluggish.
There's no feedback when your shot is good or when it was contested.
There's a lot more, but this one is just what I could remember.

If you have an NBA 2k23 it's better to play NBA 2k23 than this. It's a lot better than 2k24.

Side comment: I rarely review games and whenever I do it's either the game is really good like really good or really bad. I also checked the reviews before purchasing and I'm the type of guy wherein It's your experience not mine maybe it's good for me and not for you but in here, the reviews are true. I was so frustrated because I really thought I could get an updated game just like in today's NBA game but no. It feels like 2k24 was just a modded older NBA 2k game with an updated roster. I tried playing the ""play now"" and ""MyLeague"" because i thought there's a difference between them but it's just the same. I couldn't get the black court with city jersey in GSW.

If you actually want to invest in a basketball game on PC, emulate an old 2K. 

2K hasn't properly ported the next-gen 2K (the PS5/Xbox Series X) onto Steam and it's been going to be 4 years since the era started. They also do this for their WWE series as well as they are about to release 2K24 with no intention of making it the proper generation with the new upgrades. There is absolutely zero reason why the old version is being charged for this amount other than pure laziness. It will not surprise me that 2K pulls the plug on selling 2K games on Steam in the future. This is also the first game I will refund in ages from my memory, in fact it could be the first game I have ever refunded if my memory is that horrible.

Genuinely do not buy this game, even when it's on sale. Don't even buy it for a dollar. They don't update the mechanics, photos, graphics, etc. People always meme about how 2K makes the same game every year, but with these ports I legitimately don't see a difference from 2K21 to 2K24 other than the jumpshot meter in terms of gameplay. It is also extremely bland in quality. For example, back in older versions the after basket camera cuts/transitions used to be very cool and bright, but now in this its just a boring black and white auto-generated player image from the game with no color to it. It's unironically just an updated roster every year port in the laziest way possible, and I feel anyway sorry who is willing to pay $60 for this worthless abomination and sorry excuse of a game.

Either pay for a console and pay for the next-gen (which even then I don't think is worth $60 considering how boring the basketball video game genre is now) or emulate a 2K game on a emulator. There's a reason why the reviews are mostly negative and believe me they are accurate. In fact, I take that back. I find it astonishing that people are giving this game a thumbs up. I have no clue how they can even think such a god awful product deserves a rating like that. The 22% has to be trolls, sports video game addict losers, or 2K themselves. There is nothing positive about this product and anyone who thinks there is a singular positive thing that this game provides to society needs to be deported from not only their country but from this planet and sent to Mars. An embarrassment to the Steam Store page and it's the first game where I ever had zero expectations and it still disappointed me.

+ Last gen for that vintage feel
+ Menu's everywhere
+ Game expires so you can always buy a fresh one

-Only 2 genders and you're locked to one.
-Not available on PS3. Could come in handy since they have Fight Night Champion.

Burn out because no VC for 2K.

Guys, you know, I can't believe how fast 20 years went by. This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. And to be standing here at center court with you guys, my teammates behind me and appreciating all this, the journey that we've been on, we've been through our ups and been through our downs, and I think the most important part is that we all stayed together through out.

I grew up a die-hard, I mean a die-hard Laker fan. Die-hard. I mean, I knew everything about every player that's ever played here. So, to be drafted and then traded to this organization and to spend 20 years here, I mean, you can't write something better than this.

I'm prouder not about the championships, but about the down years. Because we didn't run. We didn't run. We played through all that stuff. We got our championships, and we did it the right way.

All I can do here is just thank you guys. Thank you, guys, for all the years of support. Thank you, guys, for all the motivation. Thank you for all the inspiration. You know, what's funny, the thing that had me cracking up all night long that the fact that I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball and on the last night, they're like, 'Don't pass it.' This has been absolutely beautiful, you guys. I can't believe it's come to an end. You guys will always be in my heart and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. No words can describe how I feel about you guys.

Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys. I love you guys. To my family my wife Vanessa, my daughters Natalia and Gianna, thank you guys for all your sacrifices. For all the hours I spent in the gym working and training, and Vanessa, you're holding down the family the way that you have, I can't, there's no way that I can thank you enough.

I've played 3 other NBA 2k games before: 2k21, 2k22 and 2k19 (2k19 offline modes only) (2k21 on Switch, 22 and 19 on PS4). An optimist might think that this game might have smooth gameplay and a good myLeague/myGM mode like 2k19, or control nicely and have an amazing soundtrack like 22, or at least have a half-decent story like 21. All with the great graphics that 2k keeps advertising.
After a small bit of testing the game out, I found that instead, there's no story (it's the same as skipping the draft in other games, you just choose a team and start for them), the game feels clunky, slow and unintuitive, has crappy, cartoon-ish graphics, and I haven't played myLeague, but the fact that Starting Today and Starting in the offseason don't work, I don't need to. Plus the music sucks.

The fact simply that you have less stats online in the current gen to the new gen copy and that it's a different game entirely is why the games failing so bad now. 

Pay to win structure making it impossible to win on steam as there is no next gen. In what way is that fair gaming? 

Ronnie 2K should have never been hired and I feel like he was just an affirmative action hire. Because he has little to zero skill in his job. Has zero control over his staff and just releases the same game with minor tweaks.

I've played every nba 2k game since its inception. However, since maybe 2020 I've never bought one full price since then. Because they don't seem to care anymore. 

What hurts me even more is that I'm a Kobe Fan. The fact they wasted his number and likeness on this game burns my soul deeply. I watched every game he played. He would be ashamed that you used his likeness in this disrespectful way. 

2K in its current state is an embaressment to gaming in its entirety. All about underhanded tactics to make stupid kids pay their parents hard earned money on in game pay to win currency. This is what the gambling commission was so mad about with Fifa. I hope they go after 2k aswel. 

Fuck Ronnie, fuck 2k and honestly fuck this game unless they can prove they are worth buying going forward. If you keep buying games after this one and expect a difference your part of the problem. I may have only paid 7.99 but I still feel ripped off.",1708711032,1708711032,False,7,0,0.548077225685119629,0,True,False,False

The removal of auctions make trying to get these MT numbers impossible without buying MT or VC. Grinding rewards that are so minimal for the amount of time you have to put in is not worth it at all. I am not sure if they felt they were not getting enough money because progressing without paying is brutal. Yes, the shooting is difficult right now but that is because there are no good cards out yet. I will go back to 2k23 until better cards come out because grinding levels with these terrible cards is bad for my health.

UPDATE 2/23/2024: I have kept trying to give this game a chance because I really really want to enjoy this game but it just keeps becoming more and more of a money grab. Season 5 just came out, there is a level 100 and there are 98's but the only way to get those players is to buy packs. The same was with the All-Star packs, no 98s available in the player market, only 96s. 2k gives you 1/3 the MT back on spent cards so that you have to dump more money in to get the same level card you just sold. There is no way for you to try a card out before you buy the card and then do not like it, you lose MT for trying to use other cards. 2k has made it impossible for players to make any MT off currently held cards to try out other cards. This has become a pay to win game now that NMS players do not have an opportunity to get the highest cards in the game through grinding or being able to profit off cards they currently own. The shooting is better with better cards as I stated before but the money grab just gets worse.",1694760924,1708710629,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think this is my first ever review, and honestly.. I'm so disappointed in this game, that I actually needed to leave my input.
***DO NOT BUY UNLESS IT IS OVER 80% OFF, OR DO NOT BUY AT ALL***

The PC Version is VASTLY different from the Console Versions.. I don't even think it's the same game, honestly.
-myCareer story? Nope.
-Explore the Locker Room? Nope.
-Select what Jerseys you want to play in? Nope. (Yes, This has been patched Oct 21, 2023)
-Accessories for away games? Nope. (This Has Been Fixed)
-Graphics are identical to 2k22, maybe even 2k20. Officially dubbing it ""Last Gen"" Graphics, since it's embarrassing to still have nothing from the now Current Generation of consoles (PS5, Xbox Series X).
- The Rec is actually unplayable. I have waited more than 30min to find a match, with no way to leave the matchmaking screen once you ""Have teammates"". AKA, *MAYBE* one or 2 real players, and then auto-filled AI Teammates. Literally a useless game mode. (Added on Dec 1, 2023. *THIS HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE LAUNCH OF THE GAME.*)


I held off to buy this years game because I didn't see anything I wanted in 2k23.
I didn't think I would get duped into buying a game through false advertisements.
""You're going to have all these things! ... ooh, you're on PC though, so.. here's a re-skinned 2k22. But thanks for your hard earned money for this 'New' instalment of the franchise!""

This version should be 1/2 the listed price, since PC players got less than HALF of the sick features that Consoles received.
This game is Highway ROBBERY at full price.

Final Verdict, Feb. 2, 2024:
Do not purchase this game.
Some of the glitches and bugs were fixed up, however nothing else of importance has changed.
The only focus is on pushing out more purchasable cards in MyTeam, and not improving the game itself.

Again. Do not purchase this game.
I will continue to play this game until ""Next Gen"" graphics finally catch up to pc, (which will probably then be ""Current Gen"" by then, let's be honest) and only because I already own it, obviously.

Quick addition:

It's F I N A L L Y on sale, for $12.79 CAD (84% off) until March 7th, 2024. (Today is Feb. 22)
If you're desperate for a Roster Update after owning an older 2k for My Player, then it's worth the sale price.

Other than being on a deep sale of 80% off or more, I still CAN NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME.
The company seems to have abandoned development for this version since November (Bug Fixes), but they still have the time to update exclusive items that you can buy with your hard earned VC, or real money.",1695598407,1708649818,False,1066,19,0.981913983821868896,26,True,False,False

At a glance it wasn't bad at all, and the gameplay is pretty decent. however, I did not realize there was some bullshit about not having next gen on both console and pc. So I paid for a game that is part of a dated gen for what reason? I wondered this and contacted 2k to ask them, and was given the most half ass responses without any sort of resolution. Basically told me it sucks to suck. IF you are on steam, straight up don't buy this game. If 25 isn't next gen don't buy it either. I have never been more disappointed in a product, and though I paid half price for it, I wouldn't even pay that for a non next gen game. It feels bland and half put together, the player/coach models look like absolute dogpiss. Not only that but they don't even update trades or what players look like.

I watch videos online showing builds, badges, intro animation, rivalries, etc., and a lot of it I just never see.  Want to spend money so you can feel left out? Buy the PC game.

On the plus side, the physicality of the game, and the strategy required to win, is greatly improved from the last game.  Team play is more emphasized, as it should be (I was wondering how they'd make Jokic a more dominant player, as he was pretty weak in '23).  However, this comes at a cost: I'm not sure if this is also a nerf from the PC game, but having an 80 dunk, and the defender behind you, moving slower, means you're about to inexplicably miss a layup from 2 feet.  I don't even try to dunk now unless there are no defenders, it's a completely losing play (maybe 20% success, and I'm being generous).  I'm not even sure the PC version has all  the animations it should to ensure smooth gameplay; this mind-boggling *extreme* difficulty in finishing (75 layup, superstar difficulty, layup timing off) makes no sense, is supremely frustrating, and of course, only applies to you, the player.  [Edit: even after starting a dunk animation - 85 rated - if the defender who is completely behind you can touch you, you will then stop dunking and transition to an awkward layup that always misses 
- horribly, infuriatingly broken]

Micro-transactions suck, the PC version is completely inferior, and the game devs are amazing, but apparently don't have anywhere near enough time for anything but console.",1696201344,1707686394,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

and now the no:
1.It started (For me) to crash or like tell me that its tring to reconnect to the servers(keep in mind that i dont got no internet problem)
2.Toxic players , like  if u arent a 99 overall and level min 20 they will just leave and stay afk then play with u

As the years went on I didn't bother buying the latest 2K releases; playing the same version as well as the newer versions at friends houses, I realized how much the game has changed in a negative way. I am deeply certain that most 2K developers have never played on hardwood, nor blacktops, to understand the physics and dynamics of basketball. Since when 2K and CS2 share the same mechanics? When a defender barely grazes me or is within 2 feet, my player slows down. Since when did players start slowing down once they broke their defender? Like who does that? Especially on fast breaks too. My player is capped out as well and it doesn't make sense to get slowed down by any player that just simply sticks an arm out. 2K Developers need to go to a YMCA and play some pickup games with randoms to understand how basketball works. It doesn't get better either. After posting my last review, the game actually became a lot worse. Why am I playing scripted games? I could drop 50 points and my team would still have a scripted deficit in the 4th quarter, like why? Since when did the worse team inherit the skills of the '96 Bulls and the '18 Warriors?  2KSports, I ask what made you think this game was worth publishing. As if the state of gaming couldn't get any worse, you ruined a favorite sports title. I also think y'all will not recover from this.

I'm boxing out for a rebound with Jokic right, a great rebounder that should have 90+ overalls in that department, then fucking Tobias Harris comes out of nowhere and forces his way in for a put back dunk. Then at the offensive end we have De'Anthony Melton, great defender at 6'2, but holy shit when I had Jokic, a 6'11 270+ lbs behemoth posting him up, Melton somehow blocks the shit out of Jokic and throws a ridiculous full court pass to Kelly Oubre for a wide open cheese three pointer. Fucking ridiculous. OH and don't get me started when you play the Celtics and Lakers like holy shit the bias is crazy.

As for other gameplay and features, they're pretty mid. Also knowing that this is last gen and having the same price tag as current gen is unfair.

1)
The PC community is scam for about 4 years in a row 

2) 
you pay for 60$ for an old gen, this game should be brought for 10$ game 

3) 
there is so many hacker around in 2k servers and there isn't an anti-cheat, BUT, you can be ban for farm to much VC (virtual coin of 2knba) in a legit way, I can confirm because i was ban in 2k22 for just play the game i love in a normal way

4)
this game for beginners is pay to win, and if you pay for get 1 build to max first of all you need for one build 100$ (seriously), and you will not get the 99 in that shop because you need to farm about 60 hours for begin  enabled to play this game (multiplayer), and Obviously an hacker can have all stats 99 and he dont need to pay or grind  (remember this hacker can't be ban, there isn't an anti-cheat for them)

5)
if you are skilled in 2k20,21,22,23 you can easily win against a cheater (Obviously if isn't a 2,21 auto green) but in this 2k24 is really impossible to win against this mother fuck###, example: in 2k20,21 ecc. i have a 70% win rate with always one friend in 3 vs 3 game against them but in 2k24 if i meet ONE cheater my winrate will drop down to 35% but if there is 2 cheater, well, 10%, all cheater 1% of win rate, good shit 2k

6)
my league is old gen and if i see a video in my league next gen, i dont want touch the old gen for this steam game

7)
if you want play my team, well, is the exactly same thing of fifa game, pay to win, and Obviously the cheater have all card from free (fun fact, the economy card of my team is dominate of cheater card)

8)
if we do not have next gen on pc we don't even have crossplay

9)
i have about 5500 and more of hours and i my favorite things to do in one game of 2k is create a build, i love create build, and i love the variant of building in every year, but in this game (2k24) the build are dogshit, low variant of build, low progress in the building, mostly 99 in one stats can have the same effect to 80 or 85, and I WANT THE BUILDING OF NEXT GEN, FOR 4 YEARS I PATIENTLY WAITED, AND NOW MY ONLY FRIEND WHO ALWAYS PLAY WITH ME AS TAKE THE PS5 AND BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A CROSSPLAY HE WILL PLAY LESS OR WE WILL NEVER PLAY TOGETHER

10)
In 2k21 i lost one friend because this game, and you can lost easily more friend in this game (2k24)

11)
in 2k24 the gameplay isn't very fun, and dont have some unique, example: in 2k20 the game is perfectly balanced, in 2k21 the game has to be really hard but fun, in 2k22 all build are strong (you can play competitive game with the playmaker whos tall 5'7 and a center tall 7'3, in 2k23 the building are more next gen and you can build a perfect ball handler with contact and a lot of shot and defens or you can build a perfect demi-lock with contact elite an elite defense an a good shot and ball handles and same thing of center, in 2k24 you dont have any of that shit, really the building suck the gameplay is very repetitive and if you meet a hacker you will be destroyed by him

12)
in 2k23 the server are more populated than server 2k24

13)
the support dont have any power of unban and in the game but the only thing they have in their hands are: duplicate the build if the build have file corrupt, and give VC if the final mission is bugged and you can finish it

14) 
i play for 5500 hours and more, and i play on keyboard (I'm not lying) and this game seems not programmed for playing in keyboard, many commands i can't click, example: if I want to wear badges first of all i need to connect a controller imput (p.s. my controller is broken) and magically i can put my badges Obviously with strange comand and if i didn't have a full keyboard i will not have 2 command, I'm not complaining because it's a controller game but at least I can use the buttons to click

15)
if you want more build you need to spend 100$ for each or grinding for 80-110 hour each

16) 
if you want play only offline you will have a bad time because bot are more powerfull than cheaters, and this will touch your sanity while grinding, and also the old gen dont have the story

17)
the animation system It hasn't changed for 4 years (probably because we have a 4 old gen streak)

18)
while grinding in offline match your build the game can crush so many time, i lost around 60 match because of this crash and 1) the game it does't save the game  2) and also your contracts That give you extra VC (a lot of vc 6,500) it may be he doesn't give to you because of this fucking crash

19)
Most of the reviews positive on this game are: 1) that player who play only 100 hour less (I'm not insulting anyone) 2) or player who only played nba2k24, this mean all (or the most) player who buy every year this game, it not gonna enjoy this game

20)
i prefet play shit game on my steam library than play every game online going paranoid about every game to see if a person uses hacks or not

.)
5 of 20 i nomined haker because are for this fucker we are not getting next gen, because hakcer are the most problem in every 2knba saga on pc, if 2k solve this problem they can put cross play on pc and also if they put an anti-cheat mean they care about pc player, this apply we gonna get next gen on pc, why they not gonna put anti-cheat, well, they would have profited by putting everything on PC but, who understeand the choice of 2k marketing (I hope in the next year we will be noticed)


in conclusion, this is my favorite saga and i being scam for about 4 years in a row, this game is a legal scam and if you want to play this game you need to wait for next gen on pc (p.s. it may never come), or if you are a nba fan or a basketball fun buy it on PS5 or XBOX or you will be scam

However if youre looking to play online on mycareer etc, its terrible. NBA have decided to behave like thieves. First they’ll take £50 minimum for the game from which you can create an absolutely terrible myplayer. No matter what stats you give, they will miss every shot and fail in everything. If you want to actually enjoy the game you have to buy vc to make your player better. Paying £10 is nowhere near enough. You will have to invest £50+ on vc in order to make the game playable. If you want a nincredible myplayer be prepared to pay £100+

So £50 for the game plus £100 for vc. The actual price of this game is £150 minimum. If you're not willing to part with that cash, dont bother with this game. (Maybe try find a cracked version? No online but atleast its free)

Attempting to play without buying vc is extremely long, difficult and frustrating. Its just simply not fun and will feel like a waste of your money.",1706466908,1706466908,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Here are my list of reasons...

1.  NBA 2k24 PC version is not Next-Gen and is missing content that is provided in the PS5 version.  

They couldn't even put in the NEW SCOREBOARD.  Modders have made a version of the new scoreboard for PC before 2k.  How lazy can you be???  

Here's another example..
In MyTeam you can equip a Home / Away and Alternate Jersey...EVERYTIME 2k releases new Season Jerseys they only release 2 (Home & Away) with no Alternate Jersey...LMAO
They don't even know their own Game...SMH 



2.  NBA 2k24 PC costs the same price as the PS5 Next-Gen version meaning I'm paying more for less. #GREED  #FRAUD



3.  The Game has sooo many Bugs and even if you open a ticket with 2k Support (I have opened over 10 tickets) they eventually close your ticket without resolving the issue.

Here are some examples...
a)  Playing an opponent that has the same color or identical Jersey as you and getting a LOSS and potentially BANNED if you quit the game.    
b)  Cannot save the Camera view in Triple Threat even though there is a SAVE option
c)  Intermittent Game Freezes for 30+ seconds sometimes resulting in a mid-game crash
d)  Getting stuck in a loop in MyCareer when trying to play games with other Online Players
e)  Season 4 Jerseys # font is too big and doesn't display properly in game or Edit Screen on PC
f)  Matchmaking is terrible...You can have a Team of Emeralds and be forced to play against Pink Diamonds
g)  Cannot change the Camera View for MyCourt in MyCareer
h) Random Game Crashes to Desktop for no apparent reason
i)  The Badges and Playbooks are different on PC vs. PS5
j)  Some Menu Navigation options don't work on MyTeam PC (it says press LT or RT but nothing happens)
and so MUCH MORE....



4.  Too many Micro-Transactions
The Player Market (controlled by 2k)  that has replaced the Auction House is too expensive.  If you want to try out a new card...you will instantly lose 60% of the original value.  If you choose to sell the Card because you don't like it or want to get a better Player Card.  A 60% money grab by 2k for what!?!?!? #BigPimpin



5.  Too much Gambling 
(Game Pack Odds are questionable) 
Every Reward you receive after winning a game that has value is attached to a gambling component (spin the wheel, drop the ball, open the door) that is manipulated by 2k Sports to encourage you to spend money.

This is achieved by making you BUY crappy Player Packs with odds that are NOT in your favor after you DON'T get the Reward you actually wanted for winning the Game or completing the Challenge.  

When you purchase ""Player Packs"" YOU have less than 2% odds to get a Top Tier Card at a minimum cost of 4000 MT per Pack you BUY.  Your best chance to get a top Tier card at 13% odds costs 21000 MT per ""Deluxe Player Pack""...OR...You can BUY a Top Tier Card for over 200000 MT (instant 60% loss in Value) if it isn't locked behind a PAYWALL of 800000 MT...LMAO

DO NOT BUY BASE PACKS...they are worthless!!!  (2k nerfed the odds so they are even worse)

OHHHHHHH...I forgot...
This is how much you earn per Game approximately...
The GRIND is REAL CRAZY!!
So your option is ""SPEND REAL MONEY"" or ""NO LIFE"" the Game
1 Triple Threat Game = 400 to 800 MT 
1 Clutch Time Game = 800 to 1200 MT
1 Domination Game 2500 to 4000 MT



6.  Gameplay is clunky and choppy with animations...it sometimes feels like there is a wall in front of you or that you got cement in your shoes.



7.  If you want to play MyTeam or My Career expect to pay a minimum of $500 over the 9 Seasons OR Have NO LIFE trying to GRIND out the GAME for FREE and still always be at a disadvantage vs. opponents who spend money on the GAME.



8.  The Game AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be overpowered making some Challenges impossible or extremely frustrating requiring the use of METAs which make the game irritating, boring and monotonous.  

All Star Difficulty is broken...the CPU fouls you, pushes you out of bounds, in-air collisions, clothesline you in mid-air = No Foul Call 
How is a 6 ft. 200 lb. Guard able to BULLY 7ft 280+lbs CENTERS?!?!   GTFOH

YOUR players feel like they should be playing in the ""F-League""  They can no longer defend, dribble, move, pass, layup, dunk or shoot.  Once Again, all REWARDS worth getting are usually achieved on ""All-Star"" Difficulty.  In the meantime, the CPU can't miss a shot and does EVERYTHING FASTER and MORE EFFICIENTLY than YOU.

It is so noticeable and it becomes CLEAR 2k has done this on purpose.  2k plays with the animations and obviously the settings in any Challenge (Pro and All-Star) when the REWARD is good.  The difficulty feels so different...the game plays choppy especially when the AI is trying to CHEAT or Manipulate the Gameplay.

2k's goal is to frustrate you sooo much...that you SPEND money on Shortcuts (Buying Packs) which is the most scummiest form of MANIPULATION.  #Psychology

It feels like 2k is teasing you with a FREE Deluxe Pack that is extremely hard to get if at all.   It just makes me hate the game more and more each time I play it...It has to be the most unsatisfying experience I have ever had playing a game....compared to Forza 4 that rewards you constantly just for driving your car.

Remember this is on Pro or All-Star Difficulty...
I dare you to try HOF Domination...You will probably break your Controller or Monitor...SMH

It makes me wonder if 2K really wants us to play their game or complete Challenges...
Of Course not...there is no MONEY for them in that.  



9.  Multiplayer Modes can be very choppy making it difficult to time your shots 
Shooting is more harder in NBA2k24 than in previous versions and some of the BEST REWARDS are provided in Multiplayer Mode...LMAO  

I don't even waste my time doing Multiplayer Challenges any more because it gets me so irritated.  The VARIABLE SHOT TIMING and SHOT CONTEST SYSTEM is HORRIBLE...I miss perfect Green Shots, Free Throws and Layups.   Anyone who tells you shooting is EASY is LYING or CHEATING...lol

Think about it...2k get numerous complaints about their SERVERS but they still make the best REWARDS available ONLY through MULTIPLAYER...how tone deaf can 2k be????



10.  The players you REALLY want in MyTeam or give you the best chance of success are locked behind a PAYWALL...

Sellable and Unsellable Player Cards...???
Let me make it simple...
Cards you BUY are usually Sellable...MOST cards you Win or are REWARDED are Unsellable.  

Unsellable cards have more limitations in regards to VALUE, applying additional Badges and in some cases cannot be used in Exhibitions or The Exchange.  Cards that YOU purchase do not have these limitations.

Every other game I play manages to find a balance between Challenge / Monetization / Player Enjoyment.  2k has lost touch with the Player Base and thinks that it's ok to spend THOUSANDS of DOLLARS a Year to play a BROKEN Video Game that is COPY and PASTE  of last year (The same bugs in the game for YEARS) 



Spending Thousands of dollars on a basketball video game that is released annually with no carryover of YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS, YOUR VC or YOUR MT = $$$$$$ in the TOILET and TONS of WASTED TIME.
Yes!!! 
People have even posted receipts online of spending over 5k on an NBA 2k game....That is INSANE!!!

I can go on forever but it's not worth my time...I wasted enough already.


2k has taken the fun out of this game...All they care about is making money and not the Quality of Product they sell....That is more than obvious.  

If there is a mistake in pricing or a Reward that they feel we don't deserve... 2k will fix it in MINUTES... Game-breaking bugs that affect Gameplay and QOL (Quality of Life) are fixed WHENEVER... 

If you buy or own NBA 2k24...play ""No money spent"" or the other OFFLINE Modes.
Save YOUR MONEY and buy a CAR or a HOUSE...lmao

Yeah I got this game on sale.  I know it didn't get the next gen treatment.  I was hoping to have a PS5 by now.  So I broke down and got it here!  I bought the Season 3 Pass And Got EVERYTHING off of it.  I completed the regular domination and got some great cards and stuff.  I guess people cheat on here.  But, they kinda made it where you can just buy your way to the top so there's really not point other than putting your player on ""god mode""  Best Basketball Simulator On The Market! Soundtrack isn't very inviting in my opinion.  That's part of the reason people may have turned their back on this game.  And this is PC!  More console fans out there than US PC ""Geeks"".  The game does crash at random.  I barely meet the system requirements.  So I just deal with it.  It's complete for what it is here. I'm enjoying it!  It's not as bad as people say other than it crashes at random.  Now much more I can say.  It's NBA 2K24 for the PC.  Not Next Gen.  There are ""cheaters"" here!  I don't cheat!  I just know about it.  If you buy it.  It's a great Basketball Sim. Hope to meet on the court. Y'all Stay Up!  Happy New Years!

1. GAMEPLAY & CONTENT
I wouldn't consider this a game, none of the content is fun. The thing is.. i'm not sure if it even has content at all. My career without story is more like a ""play now"" with your own created player. MyTeam challenges is the same every year. The difficulty seems strange, at some point the game is very hard on semi-pro level and is easier on all-star. Sometime the pro, all-star, and HOF difficulty is very hard to play. It makes you feel like the game is scripted to make you lose in a strange way (AI draining half court contested shot on a winning buzzer situation). Your player misses open three and layup on slightly late or early even though it's not on HOF difficulty.

2. ANIMATION, MODEL, and ISSUES
Game is full of bugs and glitches that is not fixed by the 2K developer on every update. The animation doesn't look natural and sometimes causes in game error. Even the modelling of the character is buggy. One of my player is even playing with partially naked chest. Player's hair is not updated, player's torso is rendered outside the jersey, jersey is not stretched in a natural way. I can name 10 or 20 more animation or modelling glitches. Last but not least, when you play myCareer, once you get subbed, it will stuck and the game play is on slow motion. You can't sub back in because the menu or the action button doesn't appear, and this happens LITERALLY EVERY GAME.

3. PERFORMANCE
I'm playing with a good PC, but sometimes the FPS drop even though i have adjust the most suitable graphics options. I think the system that they created is very complex and should be optimized ASAP. I also play on a stable connection with high speed wifi, but the loading takes me like 5 minutes before going back to the menu. It takes me around 10-20 minutes on some worst cases. Even if you play offline, the loading is still taking eternity to complete which is weird. On multiplayer, it gets even worse. It's very choppy and laggy, you cannot even score. I realize that the lobby has many servers all across the country, but the ping is not playable no matter which server you're playing at.

To conclude all these, i wouldn't recommend everyone playing this game even if it's free. Very lack of fun and frustrating. Play basketball in real life, everyone can play better in real life. Why would somebody put one of the best athlete on the worst sport game ever exist... disrespectful...",1701058940,1706170554,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

He makes the first 2 but at this moment I just think oh well Im only down 2 and I start ful pressing only his Curry card. I full press this curry and he greens every single shot from half court for 3 straight quarters. Thgese were not open shots these were anywere from 20-100% smothered contested shots. Safe to say during the fourth quarter he continues this. I smashed my monitor and my controller. My headset is in 17 pieces and my controller is torn in half.

Microtransactions: NBA 2K games, like many others, often include in-game purchases or microtransactions. Some players may be averse to this model, feeling that it can lead to an imbalanced playing field or an excessive focus on spending real money within the game.

Repetitive Gameplay: Some players may feel that the gameplay mechanics or features in NBA 2K24 are too similar to previous versions, leading to a sense of repetition and lack of innovation.

Technical Issues: Video games can sometimes have technical problems, such as bugs, glitches, or server issues. If players experience frequent technical difficulties, it can detract from the overall gaming experience.

Time Commitment: Playing video games, especially sports simulation games like NBA 2K24, requires a significant time commitment. Some individuals may prefer to spend their time on other activities or may not have the time available for gaming.

Preference for Other Genres: Not everyone enjoys sports simulation games. Some players may prefer other genres of video games, such as action, adventure, role-playing, or strategy games.

Ultimately, whether or not to buy or play NBA 2K24 is a personal decision based on individual preferences, priorities, and values. If you have specific concerns or reasons for avoiding the game, you may want to explore alternative gaming options that align better with your preferences.",1705725251,1705725251,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I only purchase the game in honor of Kobe. But even Kobe would say this game is sh*t! 
* Developer is lazy. This year, they only needed to hire graphics designer because everything was just ported from last year.
* Animation is garbage as usual. 
  - Kobe's Jumpshot? Ugly, need to mod.
  - AI will decide whether you will turn the ball over, go out of bounds, be guarded & miss the shot. Execution doesn't matter.
* Cyberface is trash. That Kobe face has been used since 2k16. He looks potato. Need to mod. 
  - Their heads is too big. That's not proportion. 
* Difficulties & attributes are not optimize. 
  - Tendencies are bad. You will see small guards like Trae Young getting rebound and doing a reverse layup (not banked) and goes in perfectly even surrounded by 3 big guys. 
  - Even Rudy Gobert doing things he's not suppose to. 
* MyGM & MyTeam lacks depth. 
  - Lacking intricacies and details on how to be a GM. .
* MyCareer is so st*pid.
  - Lacks depth. Too linear. Options are not open. Just either this or that. Putting limit on attributes bad. 

I don't recommend this to be purchased by others. 
You can easily mod the 2k23 game, change the intro wallpaper to Kobe's, voila, 2k24!

What I could recommend to 2k is to stop producing another game but add yearly update instead.
Like a season pass or something.

This will allow players to continue playing their MyCareer up to maximum age.
This will also give some time for 2k to ""think of some ideas"" because obvously, they no longer have any.
*************************************
After Trying the game for few more hours, I could take it anymore but to ask for a refund.

How come you get assist of the game during 3rd quarter? 
How come player of the game is introduced 5 mins before the end of regulations?

Update:
This game is unplayable. The recent patch makes the enter button obsolete, so there's no way to advance into another screen.

His research and insights have had a profound impact on the field of theoretical physics, and he has become one of the most recognizable figures in the scientific community. In this essay, we will explore the historical context, key figures, the impact of Stephen Hawking, and influential individuals who have contributed to the field of theoretical physics. We will also discuss various perspectives on Stephen Hawking and provide a well-reasoned analysis that covers both positive and negative aspects, as well as potential future developments related to his work.
Historical context:
Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. He attended University College, Oxford, where he studied natural science. He then went on to pursue graduate studies in cosmology at the University of Cambridge, where he became interested in the Big Bang theory and the origins of the universe. In 1963, at the age of 21, Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that left him paralyzed and unable to speak without the use of a voice synthesizer. Despite the challenges he faced, Hawking continued his research and made significant contributions to the field of theoretical physics.
Key figures:
Throughout his career, Stephen Hawking collaborated with many key figures in the field of theoretical physics. One of his most notable collaborations was with Roger Penrose, a renowned mathematician and physicist who worked with Hawking on the singularity theorems and the nature of black holes. Hawking's work with Penrose laid the foundation for our current understanding of black holes and the behavior of gravitational singularities. Other key figures in Hawking's life and career include his colleagues and students at the University of Cambridge, where he held the prestigious position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 1979 to 2009.
Impact of Stephen Hawking:
Stephen Hawking's work has had a profound impact on the field of theoretical physics and our understanding of the universe. His groundbreaking research on black holes, the nature of spacetime, and the origins of the universe has opened up new avenues of exploration for scientists and researchers. Hawking's best-known work, ""A Brief History of Time,"" has helped popularize complex scientific concepts and make them accessible to a wider audience. His work has also inspired countless individuals to pursue careers in science and academia, and his contributions to the field of theoretical physics have been recognized with numerous awards and honors.
Influential individuals in theoretical physics:
In addition to Stephen Hawking, there have been many influential individuals who have contributed to the field of theoretical physics. One of the most influential figures is Albert Einstein, whose theory of general relativity laid the foundation for much of the current research on black holes and the behavior of spacetime. Other influential individuals include Richard Feynman, who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, and Edward Witten, who has made groundbreaking advances in the field of string theory. These individuals, along with many others, have helped shape the field of theoretical physics and have influenced the direction of research and exploration.
Perspectives on Stephen Hawking:
Stephen Hawking's work has been met with a range of perspectives, both positive and negative. On the positive side, Hawking is widely admired for his intelligence, perseverance, and ability to communicate complex scientific concepts to a general audience. His work has inspired a new generation of scientists and has brought theoretical physics into the public eye. However, there are also criticisms of Hawking's work, particularly his stance on the nature of black holes and the information paradox. Some researchers believe that Hawking's conclusions may need to be revised in light of new evidence and theoretical developments.
Analysis and future developments:
In analyzing the impact of Stephen Hawking's work, it is important to consider both his contributions and the potential for future developments in theoretical physics. While Hawking's research has provided valuable insights into the nature of black holes and the behavior of spacetime, there are still many unanswered questions in the field.

We will also explore various perspectives on the sport and provide a well-reasoned analysis, covering both positive and negative aspects, while considering potential future developments related to basketball players.
Historical Context
The history of basketball dates back to the late 1800s, when Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor, invented the game as a way to keep his students active during the cold winter months. The first official game of basketball was played on December 21, 1891, in Springfield, Massachusetts. From those humble beginnings, basketball has evolved into a global phenomenon, with professional leagues in countries all over the world.
In the early days of basketball, players were predominantly white, and the sport was not as diverse as it is today. However, as the sport gained popularity, it began to attract players from all ethnic backgrounds. This diversity has contributed to the rich tapestry of talent that exists in the world of basketball today.
Key Figures
Throughout the history of basketball, there have been countless players who have left an indelible mark on the sport. From the early legends like George Mikan and Bill Russell, to modern superstars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry, these players have shaped the game and inspired countless others to follow in their footsteps.

even better 2k delisted its pc versions so you have the moral high ground they litteraly wont let you give them your money for these games and again you can play them without needing a server connection.

I hated 2k23 one of the worst things about it were the RNG shooting and adrenaline bars. In this game, that's fixed. As long as you time your shot perfectly, you can make anything that's not 100% smothered, and personally, I like that way better. You don't lose an adrenaline bar from doing basic dribbles anymore. And the layup meter closes in or out depending on how contesting you are midair, meaning and1s are actually makeable something with 3 point and1s. The Ais actually feel like real NBA players; instead of being a straight brick, they actually make shots. Of course, with all this, there are some shots that are kind of odd and shouldn't go in that these Ais make, but at least for me, thats rare, and the only couple of ones Ive seen was when luka made a logo three that was 43% contested, but he did avg 40 pts, so ig 2k. One thing I dislike is that I legit get a clean block on someone, and the refs will call a foul, and even when I challenge it, the call stands, and there are a lot of refs that will rig fouls. Another thing is the free throw rework. Instead of being able to green a free throw its RNG i have a big man with a 51 free throw. I could full bar it, and it would say 71% and brick, and then the next one would say excellent release, 71%. So unless you have curry at the line, its rng for free throw greens. There are also more dunk animations, crossovers, stepbacks, and overall, a lot more animations. For right now, at least with the game being on sale for 21 bucks, I think it's a game you should get if you like basketball.

NBA 2K24, the latest installment in the popular basketball video game franchise, has generated significant discontent within the gaming community. Despite the franchise's history of delivering immersive and engaging basketball simulations, 2K24 has faced substantial criticism from players who feel that the game falls short of expectations. This essay aims to explore the reasons behind the community's dissatisfaction, drawing upon factual evidence and feedback from players.

Microtransactions and Virtual Currency (VC) Exploitation:
One of the primary grievances within the NBA 2K24 community revolves around the pervasive presence of microtransactions and the exploitation of virtual currency. Players argue that the game heavily favors those willing to spend real money on VC, creating an uneven playing field. This financial model not only impacts the overall gaming experience but also raises ethical concerns about the fairness of competition.

Unresponsive Gameplay and Glitches:
Complaints about the gameplay mechanics in NBA 2K24 are abundant, with players expressing frustration over unresponsive controls, inconsistent player animations, and a plethora of glitches. These issues undermine the realism and fluidity that the franchise is known for, contributing to a sense of dissatisfaction among the player base.

Unbalanced Player Ratings and Attributes:
The community has raised concerns about the imbalanced player ratings and attributes in NBA 2K24. Many players argue that certain characters are either overpowered or underpowered, disrupting the game's balance and making it difficult for users to enjoy a fair and competitive experience.

Lack of Meaningful Innovation:
While players expect each new installment to bring innovative features and improvements, NBA 2K24 has been criticized for its lack of meaningful innovation. The game appears to recycle many elements from its predecessors, leaving players yearning for fresh and exciting additions that would enhance the overall gaming experience.

Disconnect Between Developers and Community:
Some members of the NBA 2K24 community argue that there is a notable disconnect between the game developers and the player base. They feel that the developers are not adequately addressing the community's concerns or implementing feedback, leading to a sense of frustration and alienation.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 has faced substantial criticism from its community, and the reasons behind this discontent are rooted in tangible issues such as microtransactions, gameplay glitches, unbalanced player attributes, a lack of innovation, and a perceived disconnect between developers and players. While the franchise has a history of delivering high-quality basketball simulations, the shortcomings of 2K24 have left many fans disappointed and eager for improvements in future releases. As the gaming industry evolves, it is essential for developers to actively engage with their communities, listen to feedback, and strive for continuous improvement to ensure the longevity and success of their franchises.",1699661242,1703184884,False,277,15,0.889915764331817627,9,True,False,False

It really is a downgrade from PS5/Xbox Series X. I can ignore the ProPlay animations the next-gen consoles have, but the game just isn't pretty. I feel the brightness is turned up, and it looks overexposed. Also, the game is missing a lot of graphical touches. For example, when the game first launched, the Triple Threat scoreboard looked VERY basic. When Season 2 launched, 2K updated the scoreboard on console and it looks great. However, even in Season 3 now, the PC scoreboard still has that ugly launch scoreboard. I feel like if 2K can't update a scoreboard in the game, what else are they not caring about?

Also, for some reason, I feel the FPS when navigating the menus feels fast. I guess that's a nitpick. But, speaking of the menus, they are just so basic compared to the presentation on PS5/Series X. Sure, maybe another nitpick since it's menus, but another case I feel 2K is taking a less effort approach with NBA 2K24.

Good luck if you have a PC that can actually run this. Kind of a shame because it seemed like fun if it worked, of course it's as greedy and grindy as ever.

FIrstly, the video quality and athlete's appearance are significantly worse than PS5, despite tweaking to the highest settings in PC. In addition, the PC version lack features and functions that is present in the PS5 version, such as holding onto the rim by holding on to R2, after a dunk, which is not included in the PC version.  Furthermore, the playing court of blacktop of the PC version is not what is shown on the screenshots, which supposedly should include the sideline audience crowd, drones and the much better court graphics, but instead in the PC version, the same old blue court which has been the same over the last 3 versions of NBA 2K, showing obvious reluctance of game developers in improving the game on the PC version. I have always been a fan of NBA 2K, but in terms of the gameplay experience this year I would say that it is an inferior game on the PC version, and has shown the laziness of 2K game developers in bringing the gameplay experience across all platforms. Last but not least, the roster on the NBA 2K24 PC version is NOT UP TO DATE (in contrast the 2K24 PS5 roster is much better managed).",1702200762,1702200762,False,1,0,0.502617835998535156,0,True,False,False

Glad I ain't that addicted, seeing the same vomit that I saw in nba 2k21 and in nba 2k23,  seeing how long it will take to get to a 80,  seeing how almost every cool feature that is new is locked behind new-gen for consoles and is limited to PC, I feel scammed to pay even 55% off for this bugged roster update and will request refund. this pile of fecies is worth max 10 euros, maybe even less because of how insane the microtransactions are being pushed, probably payed top dollar for psychologists and psychiatrists to invent the most addicting basketball turd simulator to milk the average 13 year old moms credit card.  Horrid reskin, this puddle of piss is not worth it.

- no Auction house anymore - favor microtransactions now
- shortened singleplayer mode - only two domination modes (Present NBA/ All-Time NBA)
- Less Player Cards
- stupid ai (greens on 100% contestet) to make you loose game for sure.

But now the bad things: Game is practically unplayable. After Season 3 Patch I can´t play any of those, what is in MyLeague section. Advance or Enter button is gone. There was problems of buttons earlier also. Esc button was total nightmare.
My Career is practically non-existent. It reminds me the games before NBA 2K started to make some storyline in the MyCareer. But it is non-existent, because, why You need play that, if there is no challenges. 
My League messed up with other saves. I had created team in My League. Everything was fine until I decided, that I try another created team also. Then I found out, that buttons doesn´t work and I can´t go through the Team Selection. But, when I turned back my old save, I noticed, that some elements of new is inside of that save. Team logo, arena and team shirts were changed. So when I tried to build the new team, it completely messed totally my old save. So I finally deleted it. But now I don´t have opportunity to play My League, like I told before. There is no Advance Button. 
Conclusion is this: Game needs fixing quickly. It is year of 2023 and it is impossible to understand, why there is so many problems and crashes. It is not the first game of the series. NBA 2K is made for years. Even if it is not Next Gen, there is people, who want to play in computer.",1701774197,1701774197,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't dare try and take a shot because there is a almost zero percent chance of it going in so I get the 3 seconds when I hold my left joystick towards the closest edge of the paint only for my character to decide to start moving after 2 seconds. I have to mention this great new animation introduced into this 2k where you can have a step on a defender and be between them and the basket, you know wide open fucking look. And then you gather the ball and the defender magically slides right in front of your player causing you to take some contested push shot instead of the incredibly easy layup that is inside of the restricted circle. Idk if It's because my player doesn't have that many badges yet but its seriously so un-fun, frustrating and just straight up not playable that I can't be asked to play it. I love basketball and I wish this game was good but holy shit do I find myself just alt+f4ing almost every time I play it which is becoming less and less often. shame on the developers for releasing the same fucking game year after year and just making it cost more to do the same shit. almost nothing has changed from 2k23 but everything costs more VC.",1701288734,1701288734,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dont know why this year its suddenly an issue. I hate this game for many more things beyond the lazy cash grab it is.

 Beyond the shameless wallet swiping of MC and MT to try and steal your money is annoying enough, the gameplay this year takes maybe the worst step back since 18. While random jumpshot release timings are gone, its been replaced by the stickiest CPU defense since 2K16 HOF and the complete nerfing of big men and slashers.

You simply cannot get open in any 1 on 1 situation unless you are using elite level ball handlers and spam snapback dribble combos until you get a stagger animation. Big men cannot finish over smaller guards on switches, big men cannot do any post moves or finishes unless your Jokic and Embiid, and guards cant finish a layup if there is a big man within 3 feet of them standing on the ground like this is 2K 21. 2Ks constant push for 41-38 final scores online seems to continue.

Once again Steph Curry has killed the perfect game balance that was 2k 14 PS4/Xbox1 version. Unless your steph good luck hitting any sort of  jumpshot while moving or off flare screens or gather jump shots from any distance. Everyone else turns into Russel Westbrook when shooting if there is a defender within 4 country miles of you and the RNG jumpshot timing comes back if your """"""defended"""""". I do not know what it will take to get an actual balanced gameplay experience and not just tweaking animation probability and playing with defensive effectiveness sliders every year. 

CPU defense is the strongest its been in years which means good luck playing online games where players aren't exploiting double teams and CPU pass lane lockdown coach settings and hiding off the ball (if they arent just hacking outright) and abusing snapback dribble combos on offense. Another year, another BS online experience with the same garbage prehistoric netcode thats been used since 2k11 on PS3\360.

I miss the times when you could jump into 2k and players could actually do things on offense even if they weren't 95 overalls or higher. I miss when players actually felt unique and had special skillsets. I miss when bigmen could finish dropstep layups over 6'2 guards. I miss when paid professional basketball players not named Steph Curry could hit a jumpshot without having no defender within 3 miles of them. I miss when user controlled defense trumped CPU defense and was actually stick skill based. Does anyone else miss that or is it just me?

Oh also the Kobe challenges are mostly all the same with stupid requirements like getting 3 steals in addition to your 65 points and lockdown defense on other star players. Its insulting to everyone involved.

Another year, another garbage 2K that further erodes the amazing foundation that games like 2K 12,13,14, 15, and 16 perfected to a mirror sheen. Yes the aggressive micropayment trash is worse then ever, but its nothing new for this series and most outlets are about 7 years too late on reporting on that harshly to make any difference. Theres fundemental issues with the gameplay that needs to be addressed first and foremost that most people seem to ignore.

Still gonna play the hell outta this game tho cause im a glutton for punishment and love basketball. but still, to hell with this series and to Take-Two itself.

2K support has not been helpful so far. I have been told the appropriate teams have been notified but I will be receiving no more updates on the matter. WELL OVER $200 WORTH OF VC DOWN THE DRAIN.

That is not even mentioning the immense amount of cheaters in all forms of multiplayer. There is no form anti cheat in this game. 

On top of all that this is the single worst NBA 2k game I have ever played. Every aspect of the game is inconsistent. Defending, shooting contested, layups, dunks, meter shots/dunks, lobs, on ball defense, PICK AND ROLLS. 

No attempt to fix any of these problems or move PC to next gen is being made. Last 2k game I ever buy...",1695327052,1700674287,False,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

The MyCareer feels so soul-sucking, it seriously is bland, lifeless, and is basically old MyCareer (2k13 story) with current player building (which limits your stats and badges to a ""99"" overall) onto the same map from 2k23 except worse. 

The MyCareer is advertised as a limitless and personalized experience, it's neither. You can build your character with the same builder from Next-gen 2k23, and then you're told by the team you pick to draft you, that they believe in you! Watch the Chris Smoove video for 2k24, it shows how you're this hyped prospect and I will say, 2k24 for Next-Gen looks amazing. I don't have a next-gen machine (PC should be one, but it isn't because 2k thinks it isn't), so I bought it for PC because of MyTeam and because the $150 pre-order had a 12 month NBA League pass sub (which I don't know how to get), other than that I was just going to buy the game at some point. But the MyCareer isn't Next-gen, it's obvious 2k is pushing people to buy Next-gen, and that's where all the effort is going. For this MyCareer just from a game and using the same Neighborhood from last year (except there is even less effort put into it), I can tell it won't have much in it. I had 5 cutscenes in 2k23 (from my Xbox One) by the time my first game was over, now there is none. It's not the same story, it's no story. 

2k advertising the MyCareer how they are on Steam should be illegal.

Also MyTeam is drastically different. There is no auction house, and players cost 55k (Ruby Andre Iguodala discounted from 70k woo!).

Edit: I've played about 40 or so hours across MyTeam, MyLeague, and MyCareer. This game seriously stinks. There are countless unfixed bugs/issues from past games, and more issues too. MyLeague had this issue on old gen (at least) where it would tell you a player couldn't be traded until Dec 15, yet you could be in January and it would say that. The game itself has a new issue where many windows you bring up (like draft scouting in MyLeague) don't display correctly, about half of the window isn't readable and is covered by other windows. Yet 2k won't ever fix these issues. They've persisted for years. Horrible business practice. It sucks that such a horrible company has a monopoly on a sport.

Another edit: The game is just getting worse. MyLeague is unplayable, and that's half of what I play. I can't draft players because the game crashes everytime I try to pick, many of the critical menus are unreadable because other menus overlap them. It's just awful. This game is the product of zero competition.",1694155726,1700098735,False,15,1,0.641359508037567139,0,True,False,False

[b] Core issue [/b]
You cant compete online unless you spend €150 or grind an insane amount of career (60hrs). Thats for one build then when you realise your build is ass, you got to repeat the process. 2K has created this system to force you into micro-transactions. Alongside buying the game you are spending [b]  + €150 on a build + €20 for a season pass. That is €200+ to even begin to enjoy the game [/b]. This will not change, they will not reduce VC prices as the system is successful and they have a monopoly over the Basketball game market. 2K advertises influencer builds within load screens and on their social media pages encouraging their practise. 
 
[b] Neglect of PC [/b]
We are still on last-gen and without crossplay. This is because of 2K's inability to spend money on an anti-cheat system and laziness for the third year running. The excuse on their end is a majority of the player-bases PC's cant handle it yet the game is not hard to run in the slightest on low settings. Because of the horrible engine the game breaks itself when above 60HZ or without VSYNC turned on. MyCareer will bug and become slow motion not allowing sim to next appearance. Its time they spent the money they rob from their community on investing in bringing next gen to the PC, a solid anti cheat and bringing the game in line with modern hardware.

[b] Delay [/b]
When playing career the jump-shot timing is consistent and you can build up a solid jumper. This timing however changes when playing online and you are constantly having to guess the timing of your shot. This could be a me problem but I have fibre connection with good hardware. Some people on the park seem to be prime Larry Bird and others cant hit anything.

[b] It wont change [/b]
I have been waiting for years for the PC community to get an upgrade yet I acknowledge it will not arrive. I held off buying the game but decided to try due to sale. 2K have realised that hiding behind the hardware excuse prevents them from investing their money in a solid anti cheat, updating their engine and having to respond to the console players anxiety over a cheater influx from PC. The game is a cash generator for the company, no protest will prevent change unless NBA Live comes back and forces them to adapt to competitors.

[b] Positives (hahahaha) [/b]
The genuinely only enjoyable component is Blacktop yet here you cant even play online. Blacktop runs solid and can give you the basketball fix, yet the mode is identical to the Arcade version for mobile. Save yourself €60 and just hook up your controller to the €5 mobile version I promise you the experience is identical.

Overall 2K wont change and the predatory business tactics dictate the direction of the game. There is no defence for a company as evil.

[b] I have never wrote a review before but 2K, Ronnie 2K and the entirety of the decisions for the game are unbearable. [/b]",1698793052,1698793052,False,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I've been playing 2k consistently since 2k11 only skipping a few. This is the first time I've bought a 2K and it's been considerably worse than a previous version. I came from 2k22 to be clear I only bought this one on sale since they'll be shutting down the 2K22 servers December 31st. 

TO BE CLEAR: I am not talking about the microtransactions every 2k player knows they get worse every single year I am talking about the actual gameplay. It feels clunky compared to 2k22. Maybe I still need to adjust but I'm not having fun with it and feel there is no longer any hope for a redemption in the franchise.

But in the end is absolutely garbage because of too many annoying errors and bugs, like some controller functions are not working after changing it like step back is sometime RStick down and sometimes RStick up.
They will need 1 year at least to fix the bugs and than you can buy the next version (2k25) because neighbourhood will be empty and the server support will end. Just take a look to the versions 2k23, 2k22, 2k21, 2k20! Be aware that you are only buying the game for a year.
They also don’t care about the cheaters (never did) and some of the gameplay decisions for NBA 2K24 such as being able to lose badges make it overall a terrible game to play on PC. 
Not to mention it’s basically too much VC (50+ USD if you buy the needed VC) for each player you create if you want to upgrade it due to how expensive VC is and how expensive it is to upgrade your attributes. And if you are a loyal customer and bought previous versions before, you cant even transfer your account VCs from older versions (2k20/21/22/23). 
Even baskeball rules are not implemented correctly or may some of the many bugs. 
This game is ridiculously pay to win and still full of bugs. 
I feel as if I got scammed buying this!

PS: 2k shall not speak/write of sportmenship in their error messages specially when my game crashed or i quit because of cheaters in the game session. SO its a TOXIC GAME ! AVOID!

The game is still more or less unplayable for MyLeague. IF it doesn't crash when I try to load the save file, I can no longer play past the 1-2 quarters before it will hard crash. It has persisted across multiple save files, and multiple reinstalls. The game is broken. 

I genuinely don't understand how 2K managed to completely break a game they have literally copy-pasted the last 5 years but somehow they did. I'm going to be seeking a refund from Steam and this will probably be my last 2K that I pay for. 

**Edit** 

Three weeks in, and all of these issues are still occurring. I'm currently updating this as I struggle with YET AGAIN my Myleague save crashing when I tried to reload it. Now, I am stuck in a seemingly endless loop where my controller will not be detected (forcing me to force close and keep relaunching until it randomly is), and then IF my controller is detected, I try to load my MyLeague save and the game crashes. lmao. JFC

__________

Loading any MyLeague save completely crashes the game more times than not. Usually I have to reload the game multiple times for it to finally let me access it. It basically makes the mode completely unplayable. 

So far, I have had a lot of trouble making it past the second quarter while playing MyLeague, I have only played a handful of games so far (since I was dealing with the other issues). but so far they have all crashed when the first quarter ends or second quarter starts. 

My PS5 controller is detected sometimes, sometimes not. No rhyme or reason, it will either detect when I start the game, or not, causing me to have to restart the game (sometimes repeatedly) until it detects it again. 

The ability to see available minutes is gone in the coaching section of MyLeague (where you assign minutes). It was there last year, i am assuming this is a bug. 

They removed the ability to name your MyLeague saves after 2K22, and this game has not re-implemented it. This is honestly one of the most infuriating thing that pisses me off about this game series. We HAD the option for several games before these last two. It is seriously one of the most BASIC quality of life options. It is vital for someone like me, who makes a lot of backups and alternate saves. There is NO reason or excuse for this change. None. The current iteration gives you literally every other piece of info you don't need (record, standing, team name, etc) EXCEPT the ability to just rename your save -- the ability we already have BEFORE! 

Somehow the game looks considerably worse than before. I have no idea how you even pull that off given each game has been almost a complete copy-paste of 2K20. 

Player's faces still look goofy as ever.

The lighting is AWFUL.

Almost all of the music is quite literal hot garbage made by artists with little to no real talent. This isn't a new thing, it's been that way for the most part the better part of a decade now. What cracks me up is not only the fact they have to censor the lyrics so much in so many of the songs that at times they almost become instrumental versions. It's also that they often suck so bad at censoring, that they will not edit out the cuss word completely, or miss a word or two and leave it in. Because they do such a poor job, it's pretty easy to infer a lot of the subject matter they want to ""censor"" in these songs. I'm not one to normally scream about censorship, however, 2K is rated E and basketball fans of all ages play it, so it should be up to snuff when it comes to this kind of stuff. 

Also, as an aside, the lyrical content which is NOT censored is often not great messaging either-- most of the song lyrics praise money, power, greed, consumerism, vanity, status, hustle-culture, etc. There's very few songs with good, or even neutral messaging here (though to be fair, from what I've heard there seem to be a couple). Again I'm not here to be the moral police, I just think a game that many kids will also play should be more considerate of these topics being present. 

There is STILL a bug where I have to go into the video settings every time I launch the game to change the refresh rate to the proper 120hz. If I don't, every time I launch the game it sets it at 119.9, and it causes significant studdering of the gameplay. This has been an issue since at least 2K22.

I ask again -- how did 2K manage to screw a product that is literally a copy-paste every year so badly?",1694152229,1697902544,False,4,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

What was so wrong with the auction house? What is the point of team starter packs in MyTeam?  it seems like all you did was make it easier for yourselves to manage and way less fun.  I opened MyTeam and after hearing the intro and seeing how I am supposed to get excited about creating a perfect team of amethyst level players I didn't even have any interest in playing a game.   You do remember that last month we were all competing for dark matter cards?  How am I supposed to get excited about a new season of players that are inferior to the ones i was just playing with?  And you want me to pay another fee for a Pro Pass? Fuck you you gouging losers! I am so underwhelmed and disappointed with this version.   After the amount of money I spent on 2K23 last year I should have been contacted and asked if I wanted the next ten years free.
And the card art---why would you make them so boring?
So, I tried MyTeam and after 10mins of getting my ass handed to me on the lowest setting I realized that 2K has rigged the game so that you HAVE to spend money to have any chance of competing against domination teams on pro setting.  I played 2K23 and I KNOW i can win, but not against rigged teams that just frustrate you in to spending money on better cards.  I am just going to enjoy all the fruits of my labour on 2K23. I am imaginative with my gameplay and as long as there is an auction house running and other interested players I will play that game for the rest of my life.  Fuck you 2K for being progressively worse at your game development.  2K24 has been uninstalled and refund requested.  Unimpressive to an overwhelmingly disgusting degree.  What do you guys do? Just sit around and imagine ways to make your games less fun and inclusive as the years go by?  Once in a blue moon you guys do okay.....2K23 was tolerable without the spending----but if I am gonna spend hundreds, thousands of dollars into buying cards at least make an effort to make the cards look like some thought and work were put into them.  you did a GREAT job of this. in 2K23 and I read TONS of compliments and good reviews on this.....so, ummm, okay, lets reward our customers by making the cards BORING AF!!!!! Thanks.  the one thing that made it tolerable to spend my money as an adult on virtual player cards---and you take it away.  the auction house, which was a neat little game within the game----taken away.  IDIOTIC
and the new shot meters, plus now you have to use shot meters for quick layups?????  makes the game unnecessarily harder and so f--ing boring.  Why didn't you just stick with what worked?
maybe if it was offered to me free I would give it more of a chance but it just seems like spending my money on this game is rewarding people for a horrible job.

Until now......... 

And it's not because the game is copy & paste or because of 2ks predatory dynamics(I don't play career anyways) it's because the games just broken. 

I had 2k23 and it worked great on ultra settings. 2k24 stutters like crazy even on low. I don't think it has anything to do with graphics settings as it plays the game at a high frame rate smoothly for 5 -10 seconds then freezes for a second. I think it's just a crap port they clearly don't care about. 

So besides that being impossible to deal with in a game that uses a timing mechanic to shoot, there is an even bigger problem. 

If the game crashes or you force close the app during a myLeague or myGM game it completely corrupts your save file and crashes the app when you try and load your save. 

So in conclusion. I got what I deserved but for others I'd like to help. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

People get banned for being efficient at grinding vc by using the foul out method or some other game provided technique, meanwhile hackers and cheaters do not get banned at all.

I usually enjoy 2k, even though its inferior to the ""next gen"" console version, but its hard to find anything fun about this game.

PC 2k will never get next gen even though most of the 2k community could run next gen at least on medium. Forever we will be disrespected by 2k.

don't buy this game 2k does not care to PC Players they just want to drain your wallet to take your money and nothing else. it is the same game only a minor adjustment.
NBA 2K24, just like its predecessors, is a example of how a franchise can become stagnant, offering very little innovation year after year. As a PC ""Steam"" player, my experience with this game has been nothing short of disappointing, plagued by inequality, mistreatment, bugs, and server issues. Unless you want to play MyTeam or a storyless 2k24 MyCareer, stay away from the game. The MyCareer feels so soul-sucking, it seriously is bland, lifeless, and is basically old MyCareer with current player building ""which limits your stats and badges to a ""99"" overall"". WASTE OF MONEY. don't waste your money, get 2k23 and use a created 24 roster, save $60 bucks. literally nothing new besides mamba moments. even the rookie animations aren't new, they're old animations from prior 2k games that they had taken away previously. this is one of the worst releases I've ever seen. 2k sports, you are all greedy you LIE to us PC Gamers you didn't say that the My Career on PC has no story it's like I'm playing My League. I don't recommend this game!!!

With a price tag starting at $60, it's hard to justify the cost of what this game brings to the table.

Sure, there are some positives. NBA 2K24 introduces a handful of new animations and updated team rosters, which is expected in any annual sports game release. The revamped Jordan Challenge mode is historical Kobe Bryant mode now. These few additions hardly justify the price point.

The biggest issue is the lack of innovation and substantial improvements compared to its predecessors. It feels like a mere roster update with a few extra bells and whistles, rather than a genuine evolution of the franchise. For those who have been loyal fans and have seen multiple iterations of NBA 2K, this release feels stagnant and uninspiring.

I made the mistake of purchasing the game this year as part of my ""default subscription"", and I can't help but feel like I've overpaid for what I received. The inflated cost for updated team rosters is simply not justified, and it leaves me questioning whether I'll be willing to make the same purchase next year if 2K Sports offers a similar product.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 is a lackluster entry in the NBA 2K series. While it maintains some of the franchise's core gameplay, it fails to bring enough new content and improvements to the table to warrant its price. Die-hard fans may find it hard to justify the expense, and I can only hope that future releases from 2K Sports will show a more substantial commitment to innovation and player satisfaction.",1696434881,1696434881,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i cant play career, i have bugs where you can not fast forward the time on the bench. and during the games it will crash again.

the other side to career is that it is unplayable. they made it impossible to get VC with out paying for it. unlike in the past where it was possible but sucked it is straight impossible now.

Computer constantly has fast breaks and wide open cuts to the basket for no reason other than user controlled team CPU players jog everywhere and don't react to anything regardless of defensive/hustle ratings, and lobs are fucking ridiculous (from the 3 point line from 70 overall PGs against HOF centers). HOF PGs like to dribble the ball out of bounds with any type of pressure from the defense (both user and CPU). Shot defense percentage is broken... wide open shots are considered defended if a CPU player is anywhere near the shooter for user, but almost all shots are wide open for the CPU. Team creation is cool, but images like to bug out and then you have to redo your jerseys, which is annoying at best.

This has been the best basketball game available for the last decade and still is, but the experience for a returning fan is poor. I knew this game would still be current gen before buying it so I'm not going to say that I was expecting next gen. But there are some huge flaws with the game that I will share from my offline experiences.

MyCareer:
The story mode in this game is terrible. The devs constantly adjust the story mode to please online park players, and it damages the MyCareer experience. Not having a story line is not an issue for me because MyCareer didn't used to have a story line, but my issue is that everything in this 2k is spoon-fed to you. You begin your career as the worst player in the NBA who somehow is starting at your position no matter what, even ahead of superstars. The game should punish you or reward you for your play, not just hand you minutes. The ridiculous prices for upgrades wouldn't be as unreasonable if they just started you at a normal rating. I created a player that is supposed to be a good three point shooter, and started with a bad three point rating. To completely upgrade just the three point rating, it would take me 200,000 VC, which costs $50 to purchase. I play 12 minute quarters and make about 1000 VC every game, to upgrade just one attribute it would take me 200 games, that is ridiculous. They need to separate the offline story from the park. If the story mode is your favorite part of the 2K games, this is definitely not worth it.

MyLeague:
I play MyLeague the most and I could go on forever about the flaws. The 2 biggest flaws are that they did not add the Clutch Player of the Year award to the game, and there still is no Transition Take Foul in the game. The Take Foul has been in the NBA for a while now, and this game is supposed to be a realistic simulator of NBA basketball, how have they not added this. Playing past more than a few seasons is not enjoyable, the default progression system results in really good players stuck in free agency and teams full of all-star level ratings from top to bottom. If you look at team stats, teams have record high Offensive Ratings every season and horrible defensive ratings, that is not realistic. MyLeague in its default state, in which it is supposed to simulate the real NBA season experience, is not playable for more than one season.

2K fans complain every year and still buy the game, but this is the first time that the game is actually worse than it is good. The game will never change because there aren't any competitors. This game is a slap in the face to Kobe Bryant, the NBA, and 2K fans. [b] NBA2K24 is an underwhelming depiction of the NBA and poorly accommodates the casual player base.

Title: NBA 2K24: A Disappointing Struggle with Microtransactions and Unfulfilled Promises

NBA 2K24 has arrived, and while it promised improvements and innovation, it seems to have stumbled in several critical areas, leaving fans and gamers disappointed. The most glaring issue that continues to plague the series is the presence of egregious microtransactions, which, sadly, seem to be even more pervasive than ever.

One of the most significant letdowns for players is the game's failure to deliver on the promise of cross-play functionality. This was a feature that was eagerly anticipated and much-hyped prior to the game's release. Yet, upon playing, gamers discovered that this long-awaited feature was nowhere to be found. The absence of cross-play is a major setback, especially in a sports game that thrives on the community aspect and competition among players across different platforms.

On the positive side, the gameplay in NBA 2K24 has seen improvements, making for a more enjoyable on-court experience. The mechanics feel smoother, and there's a certain level of realism in player movements and interactions that enhance the immersion. However, these improvements are overshadowed by the persistent bugs that continue to haunt the franchise. Glitches, AI quirks, and animation issues can disrupt the flow of the game and diminish the overall experience.

Furthermore, there's a noticeable lack of polish throughout NBA 2K24. It feels rushed, as if the developers didn't have enough time to refine the game before release. This lack of attention to detail is particularly evident in the presentation and various modes, leaving players longing for the level of quality they expect from a franchise of this caliber.

Perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of NBA 2K24 is its failure to represent the values and ethos that Kobe Bryant, a beloved basketball icon, stood for. Kobe was known for his dedication, work ethic, and passion for the game, and his untimely passing left a profound impact on the basketball world. It's unfortunate that the game bearing his name falls short in capturing the essence of what he represented, both as a player and as an inspirational figure.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 arrives as a disappointing addition to the franchise. While it does show promise with improved gameplay, it falters due to its continued reliance on microtransactions, the absence of promised cross-play, persistent bugs, and a lack of overall polish. This game fails to honor the legacy of Kobe Bryant and leaves fans hoping for better days for the NBA 2K series.",1694895448,1694895448,False,5,0,0,0,True,False,False

NBA 2k24 is sssssssoooooooo good with the gameplay. I like it better than 2K23.

I had fun playing it with MyTeam. First few deys was good. Until I encountered a player in MyTeam wherein he uses a bunch of 85 rated players. Shoots 95% beyond the arc during the whole game. Take note, most of these shots where contested by a good defender, but still went it. I thought it is OK. Maybe the player is just that good. Until I realized with more games. I encountered more players same like the last one. Contested 3 pointers 95% beyond the arc.
Then I got suspicious and searched about NBA 2k24 cheating. Then I realized NBA 2k in PC is very rampant.  Now I realized why this game is rated so low in PC.

Now, I stopped playing ONLINE GAMES in PC NBA 2k24. I decided to play Offline.

1. Mycareer games not paying out your salary (How is this not a scam??? I dont know, f me right??)
2.

Next, and worst of all.  This Legendary Path.  They leave it up for two weeks and say if you get it you can get a super high graded Shaq.  Sounds good right? Wrong.  It was a lie.  After you buy it?  They add another one.  And another one.  Wait... Another one.  I spent all my MT and Gold getting the first two only for them to add another.  Wait, it gets worse.  Now you only have 36 hours to get the new legendary path.  Price if the new one?  200k MT or 150k Gold.  If you don't get it?  No Shaq.  And it is impossible to not get it without spending $200.  Can't get worse right?  They added another one.  Bigger price. 

Oh!  And they capped your MT gains.  You can only get 4k a game.  On 2K23 you could get triple that in one full 13 man game on Pro. Now?  It will show you that you should have gained 12k.  Just to piss you off.  But you are walking away with 4k.

I personally am enjoying the game, but that is because I play with my brother and I took 2k23 off, so I have been waiting over a year to play 2k.

In this game, 2k really did less then the bare minimum. Literally the only thing new in this game is the park design. Everything else is the same (or has been completely removed).

This game is not next gen, which is a huge slap in the face to the PC community, since PC hardware is so much better than that of the PS5 or XBOX. They say nobody plays the game on PC, but clearly that is a flat out lie based on all of these reviews.

Aside from not being next gen, here are the other issues I have with the game:

1. No voice chat - This has been an issue on PC for forever, and makes the game feel kind of lonely. Why is voice chat not enabled? I cant talk to the people I play with or attempt to make new friends over the game. Not having voice chat in 2024 is just unacceptable.

2. No myCareer story - They removed the story entirely, so there is basically no reason to play single player myCareer. If I want to play single player games, I will just use player lock on myLeague. 

3. MyCareer is too hard - I usually play myCareer on HoF difficulty, but this year it is impossible to do so. My teammates cannot make a single open shot and ALWAYS take contested layups or midranges. On the other hand, the CPU makes everything they take, even if they are contested. I even dropped the difficulty down to allstar, and it is still not enjoyable.

4. No Myteam - Never really got into myteam, but they basically took it out entirely. I feel bad for anyone who actually bought 2k for myTeam.

5. Season progression is WAY too fast with NO rewards - I have played 16 rec games in 17 hours on the game, and I am already lvl 40 on the season pass with 39 days until the season ends. What am I supposed to play for now? There are no good rewards in this game that warrant me to put the time in. I feel bad for anybody that bought the season pass, because the rewards are awful. You unlock mascots, but not really. You unlock the OPPORTUNITY to spend $100 worth of VC to buy one.

6. Too many hackers - There has got to be an anticheat...there just has to be. Park is LOADED with hackers, like literally one on every court. Rec isnt as bad as park, but I have played with one on my team, and it just made the game not enjoyable. This is only day 5, I am sure they will get worse as time goes on.

7. Everything is too expensive - 2k forces you to spend money on VC if you want the game to be at least somewhat enjoyable. The 100k VC I got from the League pass edition only put my character to a 72 OVR, that is just not fun. Now I can only get 1000 VC per game, which means I have to play like 300 games just to get my player to a 99...Ill pass on that.

In conclusion, these are the main complaints I have, but I am sure as I keep playing I will find more. The fact that they took away more features than they added - and charged FULL PRICE - should be illegal. This game can be fun, and I am sure I will enjoy myleague (I hope), but it should be $10 MAX. I hope 2k listens to these reviews, since it is now top 2 in all time negative reviews on steam.

2K, PLEASE FORGET ABOUT MONEY AND JUST MAKE A GAME PEOPLE CAN ENJOY, IN THE LONG RUN, EVERYONE WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. FOR NOW, I HOPE EVERYONE CONTINUES TO BEAT YOU DOWN UNTIL YOU LISTEN, YOU GREEDY SON OF A GUNS!",1694648481,1694648481,False,410,11,0.945930004119873047,8,True,False,False

It's the only basketball game that has a player base and is remotely playable. The real problem is that there are no competitors AT ALL to take the throne from 2k. 2K knows what they're doing and it's disgusting.

To talk about the actual game, the game itself is just 2k23 next gen ported over essentially. I guess the only props I can really give it is thanks for making the pass all inclusive between game modes??? Though it's a fucking crime that you all have added even MORE micro transactions with the HOF Pass and shit. There are still animation bug physics and sometimes you can literally do nothing to stop people from pulling you into a poster animation. AND YOU CANT PASS UNTIL AFTER A DRIBBLE MOVE ANIMATION IS DONE?? This isn't how basketball even works. Not to mention the obvious cheating going on by like 33% of the community (I beat most of you anyway because you're still trash) that 2k doesn't want to address in the slightest. 

This is money laundering at it's finest. I wonder what nefarious crimes Ronnie has done. And Mike Wang should never hype up a 2k release ever again.

Despite 2k23's notorious and very real predatory monetization practices I was able to play the game as a SINGLE-PLAYER game due to a relatively robust MyCareer mode in '23.  There was a ""story"" with ""choices"" of varying quality, but regardless provided a way to play the game and develop your player without having to spend money on microtransactions.  The career mode was more than enough ""game"" for me that I never felt the need to play online until I had completed several full seasons, and by then had a pretty solid build that I could at least keep up online if I wanted to (again, without spending any money on VC because I was able to earn it through the pretty fun single-player game).

Yes you can still create a player, but they've removed all of the actual content down to just the basketball games, so there is little motivation to grind game after game without it being broken up by the story beats, player choices, and some interesting challenges that fed into the overall narrative in '23 (ex, playing through your college games).

So what is 2k24 offering players other than a new location and updated rosters?  After 2 hours it felt like LITERALLY the exact same game as '23 but with a large chunk of content removed.  I refunded and will just re-install '23 if I want to play more bball.

I understand that the majority of NBA 2k players are in it to spend a ton of money on VCs so they can ""compete"" online...  If you are someone who just enjoys the NBA and the game of basketball 2k23 at least gave us a story mode which gave me some fun and a reason to ""grind"" up my character.  With this removed 2K is telling me they only want me playing online and they removed the most interesting (and microtransaction-free) way to build my character, essentially pushing players strongly to skip everything and go straight into online, which obviously will encourage players to spend more $.

Yuck.  Don't buy this game.",1694521572,1694521572,False,6,1,0.545153021812438965,0,True,False,False

Despite the name change, it feels like a minor update at best, with the previous installment, NBA 2K23, offering a more enjoyable experience overall. In this review, we'll break down the reasons why NBA 2K24 falls short and why some of the decisions made by the developers have left players feeling frustrated.

Lack of Innovation: NBA 2K24 disappointingly fails to bring any significant innovation to the table. Many expected a leap forward in gameplay mechanics, graphics, or features, but instead, the game feels like a slight rehash of its predecessor. It's clear that the developers prioritized incremental changes over groundbreaking improvements.

Stale Gameplay: The gameplay in NBA 2K24 feels eerily similar to NBA 2K23, which makes one wonder why this game needed to exist in the first place. The core mechanics, animations, and AI behavior have seen only marginal adjustments, if any. This lack of innovation results in a stagnant gaming experience for long-time fans.

Questionable Decisions: It's hard not to mention the controversy surrounding Mike Wang and Ronnie, who are often perceived as being disconnected from the community. Fans have expressed their frustrations with their decisions regarding player ratings, in-game purchases, and the overall direction of the franchise. These controversies have left a sour taste in the mouths of many players.

Inconsistent Visuals: While NBA 2K games have been praised for their realistic graphics, NBA 2K24 has its share of graphical inconsistencies and glitches that disrupt the immersion. These issues can be distracting and take away from the overall experience.

Overall Experience: NBA 2K24 falls short of expectations and does not justify the purchase for players who already own NBA 2K23. It lacks innovation and fails to address the concerns of the community. The questionable decisions made by the development team and the continued emphasis on microtransactions are frustrating for fans of the series.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 feels like a missed opportunity to take the franchise to new heights. It's a game that fails to distinguish itself from its predecessor and leaves players longing for a more innovative and satisfying basketball gaming experience. Whether the feedback from fans will lead to meaningful changes in future iterations remains to be seen, but for now, NBA 2K24 leaves much to be desired.",1694467568,1694467568,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

Been playing 2K on PC since 2K15, and played consoles on and off for years before that.  This is the only time I've ever felt compelled to write a review because everyone knows we're getting last gen (no way I'm calling Xbox X and PS5 next gen when they're half a decade old), everyone knows MyTeam is an arcade money grab, and everyone knows our pool of players is just smaller.

The reason I'm recommending to stay away is that I have had success avoiding the usual PC cheaters that plague Rec and Park by sticking to Play Now Online.  Sure every once in a while in earlier versions you'd come across people who greened 99% of shots regardless of defense, or position as long as they were past half court, or you'd match up against the infinite steal gods, but that was sporadic.  This year though, I've matched against more clear cheaters in the few days it's been out than any other year (not combined obviously), and it sucks the fun out of games.

Besides the regular all green cheaters, there's the losers that pause, cause the game to have an error and disconnect, and then are awarded the W.  Why play multiplayer online if you're going to cheat?  How is that fun?  Why doesn't 2K have an easy cheat report option like every other game in 2023?  

I'm not a salty noob either.  I play over 1k games of PNO yearly, and my average win rate is 76% with varied teams.  I've played this game enough to instantly recognize cheating, and have accepted it will happen in small doses on PC because that's a natural outcome to a game where developers don't care about your platform, and on a system that makes cheating inherently easier than consoles.

This version of the game was advertised very vaguely. ""Use the revamped player builder to create a MyPLAYER that suits your skillset, so you can play to your strengths and get the most out of the updated Badge system."" As the consumer I assumed that we would also get the builder from next gen from the words ""revamped player builder"" and ""updated Badge system"". Was I wrong? Not entirely but the ""revamped player builder"" was from the Nba 2k23 next gen.  

As a player that kept coming back to the pc version of the game because of the love of basketball, I was hoping for something refreshing with the build. But no, we get the same things from last year with just a ""fresh start"".  

I do not know anything from the marketing/business side of 2k but pc players should have the option to buy next gen or current gen just like ps4/ps5. Pc are powerful enough to run next gen games and I see no other reasons to not offer the option to have next gen.

This has to be the most stripped down, copy pasted NBA I've seen this far and I've been playing 2K since 2K10. Everything looks identical with a different skin, probably patched together by a few interns.

Gameplay wise there is not much different other than changed sliders and a few new animations. Basically it's easier to score now and defense also got a bit of a boost. Other than that the game hasn't changed at all. Cheaters in the game within 24 hours.

Awards are locked behind a paywall and it's super easy to gain levels this year. I think this was done intentionally to get people to buy this battlepass to get the rewards. You can even buy these levels, but what sane person would buy them if you get a level basically every game?

On top of everything - they added a bunch of lights to kill epileptic people.

These points are ordered by most to least annoying, but please don’t let the order of my personal gripes with the game make you think that this game could possibly be worth your money.  Please do not buy this game.  It is bad.

1.	Constant Crashes – I have a decent computer, and it runs games fairly well.  I can play games like Baldur's Gate and Hell Let Loose (far more demanding games) without any issue.  I can barely get through two games of NBA 2K24 before the game crashes, and I have tried almost everything.  This is my biggest gripe with the game and the reason that I am writing this review, because despite the game being extremely bad every single year, at least in past years I could actually play the game.  In 2K24, I can barely even start playing it before it crashes, even though I can play much more graphically intense games without issue.  

2.	Rampant Cheating – Please don’t think that I or anyone else is understating the amount and level of cheating that goes on in this game.  In past years of 2K on PC there has been the same level of cheating, and this year is no different, even though some of us hoped that it would be. 

When I say cheating is rampant, I mean rampant.  Every second game that you play online in 2K will have someone cheating.  2K has never, and in all likelihood will never, do anything about these cheaters.  They are blatant, and they are everywhere.   The players who are cheating are not hiding, they’re not covert, they do not bother to even attempt to hide that they’re cheating, because they know for a fact that they will not be punished for it.

3.	Next Gen and Removed Features – If you know anything about 2K on PC, you will know that 2K has never given PC players the “next gen” version of the game that PS5 and Xbox players get.  2K gives PC players the “current gen” version of the game, which is a completely different game.  Let me be clear, the next gen and current gen versions of the game are two completely different games. I don’t mean that the graphics are different, I mean nearly everything from top to bottom is different.  The current gen version of the game is always embarrassingly bad compared to the next gen version, but the amount of effort that 2K has put into the current gen version of the game has been steadily getting worse and worse over the years, and is exceptionally bad this year.  

Just as a small example of things getting worse over time, in 2K22 there was a game room with a cool prize wheel (and a bunch of other mini games around it) that you could spin every day to get a fun little reward for your character like clothing, power-ups, and other things.  In 2K24, it’s literally a signpost in the ground that says “DAILY PRIZE” on it.  You click it, and receive your reward.  This is the definition of low effort, and it is embarrassingly bad.  I know this might sound like it’s not a big deal if you haven’t experienced it, but so much of the game is like this and it’s jarring when you see it.

If that example was too small for you, we can talk about the complete lack of a story line in 2K24 on current gen.  In past years, although it was less immersive than the next gen story line, there was still a story line that you could take part in on current gen (although that experience had also been steadily eroded for quite some time).  In 2K24, you are instantly in the starting line up on your team, there is no story at all, shoe deal on game three.  Truthfully, the story lines in 2K were always lame and you would probably skip large portions of it, but sometimes there were some decent memes that came out of how ridiculous it was, and there was the (very) rare piece of dialogue that was actually funny or interesting.  Regardless of how lame the story line was though, it’s just another piece of the game that has been stripped away, and for what?  What did we get instead of the story line?  Did the developers spend more time on making the actual basketball aspect of the game better?  Possibly, but I seriously doubt it.




That’s all I can think of for now.  If you made it this far, thank you for reading.  I’m sure there’s more I could type out, but I think I’ve covered the worst parts of the game (in my opinion) well enough.  I never write Steam reviews unless I really can’t stand a game and the way it treats its players, or I really love it and want to let others know about it.

I don't play 2k because I like this game or this series, I play 2k because I like basketball and it's literally the only option. Every game mode has it own unique way of attempting to squeeze every dollar it can out of the player, as if the game isn't already costing at least $60 with a new one coming out every year. There are very few changes year to year, the things that do changes are small tweaks that somehow end up costing the player even more money. Charging for a season pass in a full priced game is a scam. Removing the auction house in MT is a subtle but aggressive move towards shutting down the internal economy of the game and forcing otherwise resourceful players to spend money on in game currency.

1. NOT NEXT GEN, ITS CURRENT GEN MEANING ITS NOT THE SAME GAME EVERYONE IS STREAMING. ITS A 

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NBA2K24 FROM WHAT YOU SEE ONLINE. IF YOU WANT NEXT GEN YOU NEED TO 

BUY A XBOX OR PLAY STATION. YOU CANNOT CROSS PLAY!!!!!!!!!! FPS DROPS FROM 200+ to 60 FPS. 

WHEN ROAMING MY PARK YOU GET 200 PLUS FRAMES PER SECOND. AS SOON AS YOU PLAY A MATCH, IT 

LOCKS AT 60. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE.




2. MICS DO NOT WORK AT ALL. IN THE MYPARK YOU HAVE TO SQUAD UP FOR MICS TO ACTIVATE, AND 

EVEN WHEN THEY ACTIVATE EVERYONE'S MIC STATICS, AND LAGS. TERRIBLE MIC SYSTEM. 




3. CANNOT ADD PEOPLE YOU PLAY WITH IN GAME.

Pros:
 - Kobe is on the cover 

Cons:
 - Didn't get the 100K VC (mamba edition) A fix online says to restart the game and if that don't work uninstall the game and reinstall. Exactly what I wanna do reinstall a 120+ gb game.

(UPDATE: After deleting and reinstalling all mamba edition items showed up including the 100K VC, but still an inconvenience.)
 
 - The park, what the hell happened here, who thought it would be a good idea to make a directory and have more loading times, it really defeats the purpose and takes away from buying a bike and/or skateboard. 2K should have really stuck with a more open world concept.   
 - No story line for MyCareer.
 - The amount of forced shots teammates do in the 3v3 VR is ridiculous. Along with the amount of shots taken with players back to the basket.
 - There is also one shot i have yet to see miss, but what happens is when a player is driving to the basket and another player goes underneath in front, the player with the ball brings the ball down below their waist and then brings is back up for a little lay-in. I see it happen a lot in the VR 3v3 Simulation games at My Court and it hasn't missed yet.
 - Created a 6'7""SF with a 6'6"" wingspan and because MP is a 60 overall i get out rebounded by Steve Nash, somethings just don't make sense. Because your overall is so low no matter how many good shot contests you have you won't ever stop the offense.
 - Movement is clunky, i play better defense walking around than i do in a defensive stance. 
 - Passing delays happen from time to time with teammates and MP. I passed the ball when the player was open but MP didn't pass the ball until after my teammate took 5 more steps, which then my pass got stolen. MP called for a pass cutting wide open to the basket but the teammate didn't pass the ball until the defender caught up to me, which then forced me to take a bad shot near the hoop. 
 - PG was dribbling down court (ball on outside hand), MP was running along side of him and I hit the steal button MP stopped and swatted at where the ball was as the PG continued dribbling down court. It shouldn't take an 80 overall in stealing to know a player is not going to stop and swat at the ball when they would simply try to poke or hit it away. 

Conclusion:
 - It feels like 2k put all their resources in one basket when they took a year off to fix their WWE game and that ended up compromising their NBA 2K game. The game itself just does not play, feel, and look like an NBA 2K game.
 
 - Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.",1694196607,1694273677,False,48,6,0.782366394996643066,0,True,False,False

This annual installment of the popular basketball video game franchise has always been a go-to for fans like me. However, as much as I enjoy the gameplay, there's a critical element that I feel has been lacking - a compelling narrative in the MyCareer mode.

For many of us, MyCareer is the heart and soul of the NBA 2K series. It's the mode where we get to experience the journey of a budding basketball star firsthand. Each year, we anticipate that this mode will evolve, offering us richer and more immersive storytelling options. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), there's tremendous potential to take MyCareer to new heights. 

In conclusion, Dont take me wrong! I enjoy playing this game but while I remain a devoted fan of basketball and the NBA 2K franchise, I cannot help but express my profound disappointment with NBA 2K24's MyCareer mode. It's disheartening to see such potential go unrealized. As fans, we long for a MyCareer experience that truly captivates us, with rich storytelling and impactful decision-making. It's my hope that the developers will heed this feedback and prioritize the narrative aspect in future releases, so we can once again embrace the MyCareer mode as the heart and soul of NBA 2K.

To my utter disappointment, this installment chose to completely abandon any semblance of a narrative, leaving players with a hollow, directionless experience.

Gone are the days when the MyCareer mode was a dynamic and immersive journey, where you forged your path to NBA stardom through trials and tribulations. In NBA 2K24, the absence of a storyline is nothing short of a colossal letdown. It's as if the developers decided to scrap all creativity and innovation, opting for a bland, lifeless shell of a game mode.

Without a storyline to guide your player's journey, you're thrown into the NBA without purpose or motivation. There's no rags-to-riches tale, no rivalries, and certainly no character development. Instead, you're left to aimlessly grind through endless games with no narrative thread to weave it all together. It's like playing a glorified exhibition match simulator, and it gets old fast.

The MyCareer mode used to be a unique opportunity for players to become emotionally invested in their created character's story. It allowed us to experience the highs and lows of a budding basketball career, making every victory and defeat feel meaningful. But in NBA 2K24, it's all about cold, soulless basketball statistics. There's no heart, no soul, and no reason to care about your player's journey.

The absence of a storyline has also had a detrimental impact on the game's overall immersion. Instead of feeling like an integral part of a dynamic basketball universe, you're merely a cog in the machine, endlessly grinding for meaningless rewards. The lack of narrative context for your actions makes it difficult to stay engaged, and it's hard to shake the feeling that you're just going through the motions.

In previous NBA 2K titles, the MyCareer mode was an unforgettable experience that combined basketball gameplay with a compelling story. NBA 2K24's decision to abandon this formula is nothing short of a betrayal to loyal fans. Without a storyline to anchor the mode, it feels like a shallow, uninspired addition to an otherwise great basketball simulation.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24's MyCareer mode, or lack thereof, is a severe disappointment for longtime fans of the series. The absence of a storyline robs the game of its depth, meaning, and emotional connection. It's a glaring omission that leaves players with a bland and uninspiring basketball experience. If you're looking for a MyCareer mode that actually delivers on the promise of a captivating narrative, you'll have to look elsewhere, because NBA 2K24 falls far short of expectations.",1694221115,1694221115,False,8,0,0.563302755355834961,1,True,False,False

Theres no story. You get to choose which team you want to play for and get to be the starting lineup right away. 

The build, the gameplay, are exatcly the same as the last year  (and years before). Safe to say its only roster update.

📣 Attention all basketball fans, it's time to discuss NBA 2K24, a game that falls disappointingly short of its potential. Despite the hype surrounding its release, this latest installment in the NBA 2K series fails to deliver an enjoyable and fulfilling gaming experience. Let's dive into some of the reasons why NBA 2K24 leaves much to be desired. 🚫

🌟 Stagnant Gameplay: NBA 2K24 feels like a rehash of its predecessors, offering little innovation or improvement in terms of gameplay. The mechanics remain largely unchanged, resulting in a monotonous and repetitive experience. The lack of fresh features and gameplay enhancements leaves players craving something new and exciting.

📉 Regressive Graphics: One would expect a visual upgrade in each new installment of a game series, but NBA 2K24 disappoints in this aspect. The graphics fail to impress, with character models lacking the level of detail and realism seen in previous versions. The overall visual presentation feels lackluster, failing to capture the essence and energy of a real NBA game.

💸 Excessive Monetization: NBA 2K24 continues the trend of aggressive monetization seen in recent sports games. The game bombards players with constant reminders to purchase virtual currency, hindering the overall enjoyment and progression. Unlocking basic features and progressing in the game becomes a tedious and expensive task, creating a sense of frustration and unfairness.

🕹️ Glitches and Technical Issues: It's disheartening to encounter a myriad of glitches and technical problems while playing NBA 2K24. From players clipping through objects to game-breaking bugs, these issues disrupt the flow of the game and hamper the overall experience. It's clear that the game was released without thorough testing and optimization, resulting in a frustrating and unpolished product.

⚠️ Lackluster Career Mode: The career mode, a highlight of the NBA 2K series, fails to provide an engaging and immersive experience in NBA 2K24. No storyline. The progression system feels slow and unfulfilling, diminishing the sense of accomplishment and progression.

📉 Overall, NBA 2K24 misses the mark and fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. With stagnant gameplay, regressive graphics, excessive monetization, technical issues, and a lackluster career mode, the game leaves players longing for a more enjoyable and innovative basketball gaming experience. Let's hope that future iterations of the NBA 2K series bring back the excitement and quality that fans have come to expect. 🏀",1694189540,1694189627,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a PC and Steam player, my experience with this game has been nothing short of disappointing, plagued by inequality, mistreatment, bugs, and server issues. i think if me and my friends attempted to learn computer programming for two weeks we can come up with something better than this garbage. my park is completely unplayable and pay to win.

The biggest gripe I have with NBA 2K24 is the lack of innovation. It feels like I'm playing the same game as the previous versions with a fresh coat of paint. The gameplay mechanics, graphics, and animations hardly seem to have evolved since the last installment. It's disheartening to see a franchise with such potential stuck in a never-ending cycle of repetition.

On top of that, PC and Steam players are often treated as second-class citizens in the NBA 2K community. Console players receive updates and content much earlier, leaving PC players in the dust. It's frustrating to see this level of inequality, especially when we're expected to pay the same price for the game.

Bugs and glitches have been a long-standing issue in the NBA 2K series, and NBA 2K24 is no exception. The game is riddled with numerous bugs that can significantly impact the gameplay experience. From AI issues to game-breaking glitches, it's clear that quality assurance is not a priority for the developers.

The servers in NBA 2K24 are yet another source of frustration. Frequent server outages and lag spikes make online play an exercise in patience. It's incredibly frustrating to invest time and money into a game only to be constantly reminded of its technical shortcomings.

In summary, NBA 2K24 continues the unfortunate trend of offering little innovation while perpetuating inequality and mistreatment towards PC and Steam players. The prevalence of bugs and server issues only adds insult to injury. It's high time the developers take a long, hard look at their franchise and start delivering a truly fresh and engaging basketball experience, rather than repackaging the same game year after year.",1694171018,1694171018,False,329,8,0.93635094165802002,9,True,False,False
