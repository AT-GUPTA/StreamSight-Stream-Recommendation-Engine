Where laughter reigns and colours play,
There lies a world both bold and bright,
A carnival of joy, a pure delight.

In Fall Guys' realm, the stage is set,
With obstacles that challenge, yet
The little beans, so full of glee,
Embark on quests to reach victory.

They bound and tumble, stumble, soar,
Through dizzying heights and corridors,
Their jelly legs a comical sight,
As they chase the crown with all their might.

Amidst the chaos, friendships bloom,
In this realm where joy consumes,
For every fall is met with cheer,
And every triumph draws them near.

With costumes wild and patterns grand,
They navigate this whimsical land,
Through seas of slime and towering walls,
Their determination never stalls.

So let us join this merry throng,
In Fall Guys' world, where we belong,
And in the falling, find our grace,
As

One, its just not my kind of game. But recently what's really turned me off is they introduced like... community made levels. And then they started to make those standard? I saw lots of playlists featuring them... But some of them are just straight BROKEN by an update. Unplayable at times. Some levels have a pit where if you land.... That's where you are stuck... until the time runs out.

So its just sorta... EH. I feel the developer stepping back and trying to keep this game alive with community fuel so they can sit back and make money off micro-transactions.

Before EpicGames: New maps with different themes; dynamic item shop where everything could be bought by crowns or kudos (both earned through playing the game); listened to the community - kinda

During EpicGames: No new maps - they rely on community made maps which are not properly made and are difficult but you have to play them unless you want to play the same levels they've had for the past 2 years; removed the trios playlist like they did in Fortnite but they haven't added trios back; new store items but they have to be bought using real life money; they don't listen to the community at all; shitty battle pass - classic EpicGames

Recommendations: add constant new levels, revert back to the old item shop where you could buy anything you want by grinding the game, get rid of the dumb battle pass, add proximity chat and boom the game will blow up again.

Overall, it's an enjoyable and laughable experience. As an example, when playing Squads, I admire how specific sections of a stage usually changes every run despite having the same objective.

However, my biggest complaint is directed at Epic Games. The whole system of earning Fame, an in-game currency, for obtaining unique skins, patterns, colors, animations, backgrounds, and tags for one's character is absurd and greedy. Not only is it impossible to exchange Kudos, another in-game currency, for Fame but the purchasable options are limited in comparison to Fame. It is also impossible to sufficiently earn Fame without engaging in micro-transactions.

And i have no clue how people get girls that are nude in this game, i seen people post pics of their girl characters nude in the community section but none of them have explained how they did it and the game itself does not explain it either so therefore i assume its done with mods of some kind cus you cant play the game with girls. i feel like you lied to me so I'm not going to play this game anymore and am giving you a thumbs down.",1705815230,1705815230,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

On top of that, many critical bugs and issues (awful performance and crashes on Switch, abysmal round and show variety, aforementioned unfair SBMM in solos and squads, matchmaking getting stuck on ""waiting for server"", invisible faceplates, physics glitches, desync, level publishing errors, creative levels failing to download, infinite loading bug, etc.) have yet to be resolved, let alone acknowledged, by what remains of the dev team. Each new update to this game literally introduces more bugs than it fixes.

The game has also been needlessly downgraded across all platforms in order for it to (barley) run on the Switch. It just isn't right for all players to suffer these setbacks when it's beyond their control. And no, as underpowered as the Switch is, it's not Nintendo's fault that these developers can't optimize the game sufficiently for the console.

The only slightly positive thing that's happened to this game recently is that they're slowly unvaulting levels, but it's a case of too little too late; said unvaulted levels rarely appear due to horrible round selection parameters. Also, some of the unvaulted levels are STILL broken, if not simply buggy in some areas, which sometimes has led such levels right back into the vault. Their negligence to keep these rounds glitch-free and playable after the rounds have been removed from the game for so long ultimately defeats the purpose of the whole vaulting fiasco, which was, in MT's words, to improve stability and deliver bug fixes more efficiently.

This is why we need to have more legislation for the gaming industry (and the entertainment industry as a whole). Corporations should not and can not get away with screwing over well-established IPs forever with their profits-first mindset and malicious lack of quality control.

I had hesitation on viewing Epic Games as an evil corporation in the past, but that has changed following the downfall of this game.

Rating: 7.5/10

Fall Guys is a fun F2P multiplayer game that deviates from typical free-to-play games. Although it has minor flaws, Fall Guys is still an enjoyable experience with nothing to lose.




I don't know who's reading this review, considering Fall Guys isn't on Steam anymore (owned by Epic), but I'll put it out anyway. (I am trying to review every game I have 100% achievements on)

I have owned this game since the ""golden era"" of the game, 2020. The first season was some of the most fun I have had online, although it did come with a $20 price tag. I had a lot of fun until I eventually quit around S4. Although I played it and kept it installed for the most part, I fully came back to the game during the Free To Play Update. It was a breath of fresh air for the seemingly abandoned game. 

Of course, being a free-to-play Epic Game, there is an ""item shop"" with cosmetics available. Don't worry; it is nothing but items for your character. In my opinion, the game doesn't try to push paying too much, and paying no money starts you off with the best experience.

The overall gameplay of Fall Guys is pure fun. It works well on KB+M and controller, and although there are some dud maps, for the most part, they are fun. It's not the most competitive game, so casual players will feel fine. 

In my opinion, this is a ""better with friends"" experience. It works okay when you are by yourself, but as a multiplayer game, playing duos or squads is great. There is also a map-maker, if that interests you, although it was a little underwhelming to me but very easy to learn and capable for most.

The biggest issue with Fall Guys is repetitiveness. This is especially clear when playing solo, but it is still apparent when playing Duos or Squads. After playing the same maps over and over again, it just feels bland, and unlike other free games, such as Fortnite, there isn't much that changes up the games. I suppose custom maps have somewhat fixed this issue, however. Along with that, the map rotation changes every season, which definitely brings my friends and I coming back to play.

Another issue is the fact that you have to own an Epic Account to play. This is definitely annoying, and the entire Epic Connection system is messy. If you don't want to be connected to Epic, don't play this game. It doesn't ruin the game; it just leaves a bad taste in the mouths of me and many other people.

Overall, Fall Guys is a breath of fresh air from typical shooter games and the like. Although it isn't the best on its own, it shines with friends, as do many other F2P multiplayer games. With solid gameplay and only a few issues, Fall Guys is multiplayer done right, and for the price of free, it definitely should be a game you should check out on Epic.

Achievements: For the most part, the achievements in this game are easy, and the majority of them happen without even trying. Unfortunately, a few of the achievements are cosmetic-related. When I got these achievements, cosmetics were free, and you could buy them with kudos, an in-game currency earned by playing. Unfortunately, these achievements now are basically pay-to-get (I'm not sure if you could get these for free). The rarest and by far the trickiest achievement is Infallible, earned by winning five games in a row. My tip is to wait for an easy LTM where win chances are much higher, which is how I got it.",1597249500,1705631212,True,2,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

While Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout isn't nearly as popular as it was around the time it launched, it still remains a perfect video game for what it sets out to accomplish. Its presentation, gameplay, low skill floor and price tag make it accessible to anyone who'd want to give it a try. If you're looking for something refreshing to play with a group of friends, even those who might not be big on video games, then look no further. 

Gameplay-wise, it is the best Wipeout or Ninja Warrior game (n?)ever made. You know, those shows where people have to beat an obstacle course in order to win the prize money? Here it‚Äôs a bit different, with up to 60 players thrown into a match, consisting of several rounds. At the end of every round, those who fail to complete the objective in time are eliminated. Not every round is an obstacle course however, but can be anything from a vast plethora of minigames spread into six different categories. 

For example, Race rounds will always task you with reaching the finish line of the course before a certain number of players manage to. Survival rounds will require you to not get eliminated before a certain number of players does, or a timer runs out. These are then further differentiated by themes and obstacles. One Survival round might have you balance atop of an ever-moving platform, dodging projectiles launched at you, while another will place you in an arena with three giant Rhinos attempting to knock you out. Team rounds, which require you to work with random players towards a common goal to prevent your entire team from being eliminated are all about scoring points, but can either be a game of basketball, football (the soccer kind) or collecting as high of a number of eggs as possible. 

In the main game mode, a match must always start with a Race and end with a Finale ‚Äì the most suspenseful, final round of the match, usually a Race that only one player can win or a Survival round that keeps going until the last man standing. Other game modes, both fixed and rotating, focus on specific categories or levels themselves. There are also custom matches you can make for you and your friends.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618963922

Even if all rounds across a category follow a certain pattern, none ultimately feel the same. Additional obstacles will sometimes appear on maps they were previously absent from, so the game can still throw you a curveball even when you think you have them all memorised. 

Still, some are clearly better designed than others. Door Dash, a Race round, is a course consisting entirely out of doors. Some of these are openable, while the others aren‚Äôt ‚Äì with there being no way of telling between the two until you try going through them. It almost completely eradicates the momentum of the match. If you go for an unlocked door consistently enough, you‚Äôll qualify. If you don‚Äôt, tough luck. Other levels that solely consist of multitudes of the same obstacle have a similar effect, though none are as bad as Door Dash.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2618967222

The controls are quite tight due to how limited they are. You can jump, grab (players, ledges, objects and some objectives) and dive, so the game requires a total of three buttons to play ‚Äì excluding movement. A controller is ideal, but the keyboard and mouse perform almost just as well.

Progression feels good, but it could be better. Winning a round will net you a Crown, the game‚Äôs ‚Äô‚Äôpremium‚Äô‚Äô currency awarded solely through wins or milestones in the current Season‚Äôs battle pass-like progression, called Fame levels ‚Äì limited to 50 per Season and increased by XP, which is awarded for each match you play. Each Crown you acquire also increases your overall player rank, which awards you cosmetics upon leveling up and is separate from your Fame level. 

Besides Crowns, there are Kudos, a second currency awarded at certain Fame levels, as well as upon completion of a match regardless of whether you won or not. Kudos can also be purchased through microtransactions, in bundles as costly as $50, more than twice the game‚Äôs price. While the game isn‚Äôt by any means stingy with its rewards, the progression does feel a bit staggered and the inclusion of microtransactions can‚Äôt help but make me think of some marketing analyst or currency designer figuring out how to optimize it best to incentivise a purchase. Even when they aren‚Äôt intrusive, they‚Äôre there for a reason.

Your rewards can be spent in the store for cosmetic items. Some cost Kudos, some cost Crowns. There‚Äôs a fixed number of items that can be displayed in the store at a time and they reset once a day. Simple as. Customization options for your Fall Guy are quite varied and some visually striking combinations are possible, even without playing much.

Visually, the game is a colorful joy to look at, with the audio making it all the more appealing. The Fall Guys make cute ‚Äô‚Äôoofs‚Äú and other sounds when they collide with each other, and scream of excitement when an obstacle launches them into the air ‚Äì all of it heightened by a groovy, bass driven soundtrack. It just oozes fun.

Performance wise, the game ran great on max settings, at a steady 60 FPS. However, the animation LOD distance wasn‚Äôt that great, as players and obstacles further away would be running at a notably lower framerate. I don‚Äôt know if this is simply the way the game‚Äôs optimised, or something affected by the limitations of my specs. Weirdly enough, the game would sometimes drop down to 30 FPS while waiting in the lobby or the post-match recap.

While the game‚Äôs current player numbers are a far cry from what it once had, it still maintains a healthy population, both on Steam and outside of it, thanks to cross-play. I wholeheartedly hope that Mediatonic can keep Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout in such a state, as it‚Äôs a fun game that truly anyone can play. Even if you don‚Äôt end up winning, the little animation your Fall Guy does during the post-match summary shows that he‚Äôs had a lot of fun even participating, just as you will. Here‚Äôs to hoping it can keep going strong in the years to come, at least as long until there‚Äôs a worthy successor.

It's extremely frustrating. There is also some issues with certain minigames, especially the ""Tail Tag"" games and all the team games. For the tails, with the latency, it creates a very unpleasant feeling when someone who, on your screen, is far away from you, is actually much closer and is able to get your tail. When you are the one trying to grab a tail, you almost have to be inside of them. I also mentioned team games because it's just not fun to lose your streak to some monkeys in your team performing extremely poorly and even shooting into your own goal in Fall Ball.

tl;dr. It is a fun game but I do not recommend it until Mediatonic fix their game.

UPDATE: They fixed the cheater problem apparently, the other problems are still there amongst others. There is surprisingly still a bunch of connection issues especially when queuing as a party.

UPDATE 2: Team games and maps that heavily utilize broken grab mechanics are still present. This game is not enjoyable with those. I would change my rating if we'd had the option to remove team games and/or maps that use the grab such as Wall Guys.

UPDATE 3: The game is in a better state right now but there are still too many team games or really bad maps.

Its a good game. But the rise in the number of hackers is slowly depreciating the experience. I have won multiple episodes, but I would have won more if it weren't for hackers.
To be one of the last two players on Hex-a-gone, just to find out that the other player is flying in the sky somewhere is absolutely pathetic.

You can jump, dive or grab other people to mess with them or ensure your survival.

Minigames range from races, team games, survival rounds, scoring points to qualify.

The game works in seasons, each season the game gets a new theme, new maps and costumes/cosmetics. As you play you earn money that can be spend on cosmetics or emotes in the shop and you also earn experience which fills up your season pass which rewards you with something each level all the way to 50.

Months after release, the game recieved Squads ( que up with 3/2 or just one other friend and compete against teams of others), events where you have to complete tasks to get sets of points for special cosmetics ( like Ratchet and Clank costumes ) and special game modes that where you play the same map over and over until you reach the finale and try to win.

The big issue I personally have with the game is the content loop and while I understand that demanding updates frequently is not realistic, the way this game does it just isnt for me anymore. The experience for me was like this:

1. New season comes out. Play it as much as possible because its gone in 14 days. ( new levels always have a timer and then they get added into all the gamemodes, they are not gone forever but you cant specifically que them just like you would at the start of a season, why is that the case I dont know, it doesnt make sense at all since seasons last months )

2. Get burned out because you played too much. ( might aswell no life first few days if the new season only game mode is leaving soon )

3. Take a break because you are not having fun.

4. Come back near the end of a season, grind again to finish the season pass for cosmetics, quit again because the grind makes you dislike the game.

5. Repeat step 1

During season 4 I told myself that I dont really like this loop im kinda stuck in but I figured since it has been a bit early to judge the game Ill just keep playing and hopefully the game gets better in the future.

I wish I knew why are the developers alergic to reworking past minigames to make them more random instead of ""if I always go like this I never get hit"" bs. Its a bad way to describe it so lets just say if your strategy works once it will always work but it really shouldnt.

I also dont get why the season pass is only up to level 50. Once you reach it, there is nothing else to get, no extra levels that reward other ingame currencies, nothing. 

And finally the shop size stays the same despite adding tons and tons of new cosmetics every season, lets keep the shop nice and small to force players to check every day just incase there is something they want. Its stupid, the size should have been increased months ago.

And here we are over a year later and the game still does the same things over and over again and I cant lie to myself anymore and pretend that things will get better in the future. They cleary wont and its a damn shame.",1643146254,1704125386,False,7,0,0.566905081272125244,5,True,False,False

Every game now a days requires you to spend money on a battle pass in order to gain decent skins, emotes, tags, and etc. This game's current currency is called Showbuck, in which if you want to buy a nice skin, you must at least spend 9 dollars for 1k currency and every since they integrated them into this game the kudos became completely useless. The amount of players needed to play the game went from 60 to 40 due to lack of popularity. Obstacles just got more complicated for no reason and would usually come across the same obstacles 7 times in a row when playing with teammates. Progression is extremely slow when gaining XP in this game. They  disrespected some OG players by bringing back OG season pass outfits to the shop.

Part of the reason you get so bored easly is because you always get the same 10 maps or so. It has so many more maps and some of them I haven't even played and I've played a considerable amount. Just increasing that pool of 10 or so maps would be a huge upgrade from the game nowadays.

It is a fun game that is blissfully free of the toxicity of other games by not having a chat function in game. It allows you, the player, to focus on the game. I have played this game Since at least season 2 or 3, I don't remember exactly. As of writing this I have played this for 1,670 hours and several minutes. Even though I did get all the achievements, Before Epic Games took over!, I still enjoy playing this game. Not everyone will enjoy this as much as I have, but I am pleased to say that this game is still receiving new maps to play every couple of months. Or as of this post every few days thanks to personally created maps by other players which have become so popular that some got added into the game for others to play!

It can seem repetitive to some people but the silliness of it all keeps you hooked. Some people may get frustrated by the randomness of certain rounds (team battles) but it is easy to jump back in and try again.

the microtransactions aren't intrusive and are very rewarding for low prices, so people who are willing to spend can get the best value out of it. the battle pass is even free! And the soundtrack just fills you with an adrenaline rush overall, this game is for those who value fun over competition and winning and it really pays off to just enjoy it. Have fun falling!

The Good: The physics are really good, the graphics are nice, and the movement is so easy. The room searching is quick and the online gameplay is great compared to other online games. There are lots and lots of gamemodes, maps, costumes, events, and lots more that make the game great. There's even a thing where you can make your own level!

The Bad: For some people, there is this weird thing where the player gets a black screen for a long time when they press play, and have to wait for like 3 minutes before they can accualy play. However, there are many videos on how to fix this. Another thing is that sometimes you dive into one of those tilting platforms, and then you just glitch through the ground of the platform. Then another really frustrating thing is that for some reason, usually in the FINAL round, all the other players seem to be AFK and just stand motionless at spawn, but you can still move. Yeah that may seem nice, but that's a really annoying error. For example, a player gets that error, gets really close to the crown and BOOM!!! AN ERROR HAS ECCOURED screen pops up and the player has one choic. Can you guess what that is? To leave the server. Ouch!

The Ugly: If you are far away from a fall guy and they are moving, they tent to lag discustingly compared to the other great graphics in the game.

Personaly, I have never got one of the errors and I just love the game. I hope you trust my feedback and I hope you enjoy FALL GUYS!",1701012985,1701014451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update:
I no longer recommend this game at all, epic games are moving all of our games and putting it behind their doors for new users, not to mention that I cant even run the game anymore without workarounds because I have moved from windows to Linux.

Epic games, if your reading this, please consider making this game steam deck verified. Many Linux and steam deck owners that have previously purchased your game would really appreciate it. Maybe you guys can make a deal with Valve about the revenue split or something maybe we can all be happy.

Absolutely a great game to play, it is very fun and charming and I love the Steam exclusive outfits. 
I reccomend this game for anyone to play.

ALL I ever do here is RAGE! Crying, screaming, swearing, SQUEALING! Once I lose so many times in a sitting, I start acting suicidal, posting screenshots and commenting on how much of a @#$%ING GODDAMN LOSER I AM and how much I wanna just KILL MYSELF FOR IT...MUCH to the annoyance of my friends and even some of my BEST friends.

SCREW THIS GAME; it's not worth losing great friends over just because I get too suicidal for ALWAYS LOSING ROUNDS! I'VE HAD IT!


Starting out: Imma noob and the game lags but boy are there funny moments... üòµ
After 50-100 failures: @#$%!! ü§¨
After 1000 failures: üò≠


I already have some ideas for new minigames myself (ones I might actually WIN...sometimes), like these.


- Odd Card Out (Logic)
- Calcu-Later! (Logic)
- Bing, Go! (Survival)
- Count, Down (Survival)
üëë The Final Count, Down! (Survival)
üëë Key to Victory (Race)
üëë King of the Ring (Survival)

And probably a few others... üí°

Fourth...as of this edit, a single player mode where they face off against Bean Bots, maybe dressed in the Crash Tester costume.

Finally, since I'm such a LOSER, maybe there should be ""special"" reskinned costumes regarding the number of times users get Eliminated, in-general and in certain types of Rounds, with each costume having ""LOSER"" scribbled on somewhere.

What would make this game all the better, at least for Steam, is Steam Trading Cards. I'm sure countless of players have been wanting to craft Fall Guys-themed Profile Badges to place proudly on your account, along with emojis and profile backgrounds to boot. But naturally, with so much time and effort that the people who worked on Fall Guys made already, their reasons for not coming up with Steam Trading cards would be justified but still possible to produce someday. That, and bringing back the costumes that were ""limited editions"". üòê

If the producers/developers read this, feel free to let me know.

Update: even though they made new Show variations to choose from and more Crowns from the Level up system, that still doesn't change the fact that I CAN'T WIN, nor does any of the updates and game fixes help with the FPS rate on my current laptop. In fact, I nominated Fall Guys for the ""BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT AWARD"".

...Yeah, I hate it that much. üëø And yet during Season 1, that was the reason why I wanted to keep playing it. ü§®

Update: according to the wiki, the Big Tease Achievement ""appears to be currently bugged, and will not trigger despite the conditions having been satisfied"". Why haven't you people fixed it yet?!

At this point, I'd recommend this to masochists who love being frustrated and miserable. üòí[/strike]",1598737756,1700666854,False,2,1,0.498098880052566528,7,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.",1621471364,1700599507,True,3,6,0.446261554956436157,0,True,False,False

Pros:
[list]
    [*] A lot of customization options available
    [*] Regional servers are available with almost no downtime
    [*] Can play in short intervals
    [*] In-game music is fantastic
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*] Team games are part luck and part skill-based
    [*] Item shop induces FOMO
[/list]

All in all, I would definitely recommend playing this game.

Update in 2021: Still going strong with all the updates like crown rank, squad mode, different game modes, live events, cross-play, custom shows, daily challenges, report system, level variations, news feed, crown shards, fall feed, and many collab costumes.

Update in 2022: F2P, delisted from steam, show bucks currency, overhauled shop, voice chat, full cross platform, themed shows, and expanded fame pass.

Update in 2023: Mainly creative mode is new. Although I mostly play on my ps5 now, hopefully one day I'll cross 1000 hours of gameplay on pc.",1599942652,1700596535,True,1,1,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

You can still get the in game currency for free (both kudos and star bucks) but at a much, much slower pace, and it will take forever to unlock any of the more unique cosmetics without paying. I don't really care about the cosmetics and generally use this game to veg out after work or kill some time.

The finals were actually a walk in the park because all you had to do was shuffle back and forth and hop over spinning bouncy bars of death for 6 minutes. Insane how I fumbled so bad but still managed to win like I was the main character in a G rated Squid Games spinoff lol.

Edit: You can see the proof if you checkout my ""Victory!"" achievement which I just got!
I wish I recorded it because I thought I was gonna lose like I do every time. Somehow didn't, and there was so many times it looked like I was lol.

This game was a lot of fun for the good-natured goofiness of just running around and being silly little beans. But as a collector, the crown-exclusives took away that kind of enjoyment and instead of motivating me to play more, had me clock in less. Having to place 1st and within a season's period of limited availability made it a lot less enticing to play. Devs could've easily fixed this by just making crown exclusive items exchangeable for a large amount of points, but they didn't. Having to compete with more than fun in mind and was a huge turn-off from continuing to play the game. If this was meant to keep people playing, well it didn't. Could've easily done the same thing and kept more casual players with the point implementation. There would also be a lot less trolling and in the earlier days, cheating, if crowns weren't such a highly valued currency.",1698953707,1698955116,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Welcome to the wacky world of ""Fall Guys,"" where the laws of physics and logic take a vacation, and jellybeans embark on the most chaotic obstacle courses ever devised. This game is so hilariously chaotic that even your grandma would don her jellybean costume and dive headfirst into the madness.

In ""Fall Guys,"" you play as a plump, jiggly jellybean with a singular goal: be the last one standing in a series of absurd challenges. Whether it's navigating rolling fruit, surviving giant swinging pendulums, or racing up slippery slopes, you'll quickly realize that ""graceful"" isn't in your jellybean vocabulary.

The best part? You're competing against a bunch of other equally inept jellybeans. It's a laugh-out-loud battle royale where you'll trip, stumble, and occasionally achieve moments of heroic clumsiness. And when you fail, it's not a loss; it's just a funny accident waiting to be turned into a GIF for the internet to enjoy.

You'll soon discover that ""Fall Guys"" is a game of pure nonsense. Where else can you see a jellybean crowd cheering for a lone jellybean rolling a giant ball up a hill, only to have it roll back down and flatten everyone like pancakes? It's like a game show hosted by a bunch of caffeinated maniacs on a sugar rush.

Customizing your jellybean is a blast. Dress up as a pirate, a hot dog, or an astronaut, and strut your stuff on the catwalk - or, more accurately, the obstacle course. Winning crowns to unlock new outfits is almost as addictive as the gameplay itself. Who cares if you don't win the game? You've got the fashion game nailed!

But don't let the hilarious chaos fool you; ""Fall Guys"" can be surprisingly competitive. The struggle for that elusive crown can be intense, and you'll find yourself shouting at your screen in both joy and frustration. It's the only game where you can celebrate a victory by doing the chicken dance in a medieval knight costume.

In summary, ""Fall Guys"" is a belly laugh-inducing, physics-defying, and costume-customizing delight. It's the perfect game to play with friends, whether you're laughing at each other's failures or celebrating a well-deserved victory. Just remember: in ""Fall Guys,"" the only thing more ridiculous than winning is losing. So dive in, laugh it off, and may your jellybean dreams of victory be as squishy as they are sweet!

edit: not neat anymore, the new maps look like their license expired to use the props from before so they just stuck with low res, shit physics whatever you wanna call it. i hope the original devs got decently paid at least. As a person who paid for the game before it went free and off steam, all i got as compensation was like 70k kudo coins which essentially do nothing since 99% of the store is a new currency that requires micro transactions to buy anything.

""Fall Guys is no longer available on the Steam Store""

Epic Games bought out Fall Guys and immediately pulled it from Steam because they didn't like that they had to give a cut of the profits to Steam.
Then they made a PAID GAME into a free to play game, modifying the cosmetic shop so you can buy the cosmetics with real money (which degrades the value of the cosmetics, seeing as they were originally earned with crowns) and adding a battlepass with a premium track.

The game has since been going downhill. I really must wonder at what point developers will learn to not let Epic Games buy them out, and I'm also wondering when people will stop giving money to a corporation that clearly hates them.

[i]There will be a TL;DR at the end[/i].

~

Fall Guys is built upon the foundation of a novel concept: 
Take the expensive idea of the Wipeout game show and make it accessible to all.
The execution is about as well as you might hope for, and it creates a certainly enjoyable initial experience as you tumble through increasingly impractical physical trials.

Fantastic presentation throughout - fantastic music and juicy audio enhance the otherwise plain aesthetic.
Simple controls - easy to read and grasp. Its not a bad game if you're new to interactive media itself. You could get your grandma to play this game and even she'd be able to wrap her mind around the controls in a short while.
A lot of hard work and effort is clear in the final product. It's visually polished and the moment-to-moment gameplay is smooth.

However, playing the game reminds me of cotton candy.
It is vaporous and passing; Fall Guys is a fading sugar high of empty calories that is bound to let you down in a hurry in spite of its profound efforts to grip you with its flavor.

The game is simply insubstantial.
There is a disturbing lack of dynamics in the game, which makes a benefactor out of young audiences and newcomers that might struggle - but ends up too shallow to be stimulating in the long run.
Muted - yet unsafe; the game is obviously aimed towards kids, but battle passes and paid cosmetics make it predatory in nature... you're going to want to keep any impressionable or wide eyed tyke away from playing this on their lonesome. it offers them little more than jingling keys anyhow.

There's also a fundamental problem in the game's basic feel - the texture of its engagement.
The better you are, the more trivial the victory. The worse you are, the more hopeless it might seem. Iv'e seen pro players waltz through matches without tripping or stumbling once to secure the gold medal - but I more often see wide swaths of players standing idly and waiting for their inevitable defeat, having accepted their inadequacy.
It's surprisingly easy to get discouraged when having a bad time, yet it's difficult to feel engaged when the match isn't a challenge. Chasing that narrow victory is passing and hollow - and just about never leaves you with any satisfaction.
Players will either feel like someone more experienced aced them, or that there's little competition.
There isn't much in between.

The game also has a disturbingly high amount of down-time with nothing to keep you engaged between the long periods of inactivity. It takes quite a bit to hop into a match, waiting to load into the match, waiting for the intro - then, when you're done with the level - waiting for all of the slowpokes to catch up, then waiting for the outro, waiting for the next level. Rinse and repeat until you leave the game and have to wait through your awards ans a completely separate loading screen that kicks you to the main menu.

What's also disappointing is that Fall Guys has the same dopey target demographic as every new game:
Wild and crazy cross-promotion cosmetics with kooky appeal and recognizable (and misplaced) brand recognition.
While the aesthetic of these crazy additions to the game fit with the title's over-the-top presentation of garish colors and gaudy cosmetics - the sad truth is that this demographic has been catered to by a myriad of Fortnite-chasers that want in on that corner of the market. In the end, Fall Guys doesn't feel special because this exact business tactic and cosmetic roll-out has been done a million times and notably better.

There are better party games, even for kids.
It has little to offer mature gamers and will spoil the appetites of younger audiences.

On the upside, it's a game that you can sit down and play with your young children.
On the downside, there are better games out there to engage them through and this one has a scummy predatory market.

I felt like I had experienced all that this game has to offer me by the second hour.
The rest of my playtime was me slowly realizing that this was all that Fall Guys has to offer.

~

[h2]TL;DR[/h2]
[b]4/10[/b].
Fall Guys is a [b]Below Average[/b] game.
While inoffensive and safe enough, it does little to stand out on its own.
While I didn't hate the game, it simply failed to impress with its humble selection of itinerant tastes. 
It's a novel concept, but it only has one good idea that fizzles quickly.
While not bad, it is all fluff and no substance. There are simply better experiences out there.

I found myself in a situation I never could have imagined, serving time for a mistake I deeply regretted. In the confines of the prison's recreation room, a fellow inmate had managed to smuggle in a gaming console, and it wasn't long before word got out about this quirky and entertaining game called Fall Guys.

The moment I picked up the controller, it was like a burst of colourful, chaotic energy entered my life. In the game's whimsical world, I became a jellybean-like contestant, navigating through a series of obstacle courses, racing against fellow inmates, and forming alliances as we aimed for victory. Fall Guys became an unexpected source of laughter and camaraderie, momentarily easing the tension that permeated our daily lives.

As days turned into weeks and seasons of Fall Guys came and went, our prison crew transformed into a formidable squad. We cheered each other on and shared the joy of both victories and defeats. In the midst of adversity, this game brought us moments of pure joy and friendship.

Playing Fall Guys in prison reminded me that even in the most challenging circumstances, there can be moments of light and connection. It was a reminder that, no matter where you are, the bonds formed through shared experiences can transcend the boundaries of reality and provide a glimmer of hope in the most unlikely places.",1605998762,1696595268,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now the only exclusive skins are the steam ones (glados and chell) and the charity skins (Ninja, G2 and aimlab).

Anyway, I bought Fall Guys when it's was still in its paid access stage. It was around December 2020. I was really blown away with the game at the time. It was definitely worth the ¬£16 that I had paid for it. There was so much and you nearly never got bored of the game! It kept me entertained for hours on end. 

Anyway, when Epic Games acquired Fall Guys, they treated it like it was a new game. I missed out on the first season as you then had to sign up for an Epic account, which I was not interested in at the time. I eventually gave in and did though just so that I could play again, and I wasn't all that impressed with the changes. 

The new Fall Guys looked completely different, as it had kind of become a Fornite type system: you had to pay for everything within the game, and you still do! It makes sense considering  that the game was made free. 

So, overall, I would still say that the playing experience is still really good! It's just the in games purchases that are a problem now. But I would definitely recommend this game to people who like competitive types of games.",1694295966,1694295966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

*there is no season pass anymore, only fame passes
*the pass isn't free anymore, and only some tiers are free
*a really small portion of the shop has things you don't have to buy with real money
*you don't get kudos from playing anymore, only from quests
*crowns are now only for crown ranks, and you can't buy anything with it anymore. when you win in main show, (i'm sorry, solos), you don't even get kudos because you won, no, only a crown, which is only for your crown rank. the crown rank and crowns as a currency could have coexisted, but I guess not
*the maps for this season are made in the level editor, and they are in the main show.....
*i heard something about vaulting, yeah that's not great...
*some of my emotes dissapeared
*why is the fall guys logo not in the lobby anymore? seriously, what's the point of that? it's so empty now...
*if it's so hard to buy things from things you get by playing, and most of the stuff in the shop you get by paying real money, what's the point of playing? all i can think of is +1 crown for your crown rank.

You play it more thinking, ""If I just get a little better with the mechanics, then I will win more and have more fun."" But no. Getting better barely improves your odds, because a large majority of the game's physics and outcomes come down to sheer luck. That's the problem with this game: There's not enough opportunity to really excel in many aspects of gameplay, and your character, being a fat slob, does not obey you. The game could be so much more, but it isn't. Roll the die and see if the odds are ever in your favor this time. Most people are going to lose, sure, but you want to lose for the right reasons, because you were outskilled or out-strategized, because your teamwork was of a lower quality.

Also their most fun mini-games are played the least, like sportsball (what I call soccer), volleyball (is that still a thing?), and snowball roll, and the generic games get annoying.

- I'm rating Fall Guys in two ways: before and after New Season 1.
- Most of the pro's are aimed at everything before New Season 1.
- A lot of the con's are aimed at everything after New Season 1.
- I have owned and played the game since the original Season 1.
- I have played every single season and every minigame, with the exception of any I might've accidentally missed in New Season 4.
- I have all the achievements.


Pros:
- Fun party game with friends.
- I love that you can make private lobbies, even if you need a bunch of people to do so
- Even if you don't have friends who own the game and you're riding solo, this is still pretty fun on your own.
- Crowns were an amazing way to flex your experience in the game and force players to ""git gud"" for the cool skins.
- The physics and atmosphere are hilarious, I have plenty of moments with friends when the goofy physics have made for some memorable games.
- Thank you Mediatonic for not giving us stupid edgy/anime skins 24/7 and leaning into the goofy side of the game, TAKE NOTES FORTNITE >:(


Cons:
- This game's identity was completely lost once the new Season 1 started and basically turned into Fortnite: Bean Edition.
- All Steam Users have effectively been screwed and are forced to make an Epic Games account to play, why is this even needed?
- Hope you got this game during new Season 1 and didn't pay for this game prior, otherwise you aren't getting a refund or any worth while items in its place.
- Removing crowns as a currency makes the replay value diminish greatly.
- Back in the day, I remember buying the fall guys pass during Season 2 for extra rewards, then never again. Now I gotta buy a new one every season? Thanks, I was really looking for a new outlet to waste money for.
- Compared to Season 6, all the new seasons feel like you have to grind for rewards.
- This company had the audacity to call New Season 4, ""Creative Construction"" when they literally reused the Kraken Slam OST from New Season 3 as the main theme. Luckily they made a unique OST for New Season 4 now, but I'm not overlooking that level of laziness from a company that is now consider an AAA Studio.

Summary: As of now, I don't think Fall Guys is worth it at all unless you are fine with being a free to play. If I was rating Fall Guys prior to New Season 1, I'd give it a 9.1/10 with the only downside being the physics in the game can cause you to lose games and some minigames are a bit unbalanced.

As of New Season 1 prior, the gameplay is still fine, it just feels like the entire identity of Fall Guys is lost entirely, because it just feels like Fortnite now. No more crowns, unnecessary purchases, and it doesn't feel fun anymore. Honestly, I give it a 4.7/10 thanks to the loss of identity, feeling like a clone of Fortnite, and a complete disregard for all platforms who play the game.

As a wise man once said: ""If it's not fun, why bother?"" -Reggie",1683210178,1693509895,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my grandson, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my grandson for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my grandson since my wife had died.

In S1 I purchased it for ¬•56 and played nearly 380 hrs from S6 to SS4(actually S10),
but I was gradually losing interest in repeating completing daily missions and playing boring levels.
Obviously Mediatonic doesn't put their heart into running FG well now.

In any case for me it's the best on steam with Tower Unite, in a style certainly more childish than the latter but just as fun. Then frankly combining Party Game and Battle Royale with too cute little guys is not the class?
Children and adults will be able to meet without any worries in complete safety given the absence of IG chat. We will therefore avoid any toxicity to leave fun and frustration alone in control.

You can of course play it with your friends but in a limit of 4 players max unfortunately.

We will also note a small lack of content, 25 maps of course but on which they quickly went around (Only 4 for the final) I even find that there are several that clearly lack interest and fun.
From what I currently know there will be a rotation with new maps every 2 and a half months or so.

Like Rocket League, you have access to a kind of battle pass to level up and earn items (Costume, IG Currency, Crown, Colors etc.). For now it's free so I hope it stays that way.

Otherwise the game itself is super fun, colorful and refreshing. The only thing we will have to watch now will be the player base which will determine whether or not the game will hold up in the long term or if it will have to be free to play to get there. 60 people to bring together each time is still not nothing and in a few weeks / months it could be more complicated.. Wait & See.

Still sucks that they took the game of Steam, at least it works on Proton for now and we can still play it on steam. 

Happy Jumping everyone!

Seems to work out of the box with Proton Experimental On Linux, but I'm not sure if it's official as in they added the Easy-Anti Cheat file.

Edit: Unplayable for all Linux Users after they started using Easy Anti Cheat and you cant get a refund...

I love how this game has evolved over time! This game has gotten the treatment it deserves from the dev team now it just needs the same treatment from the community.

People keep defending microtransactions saying that you need money for servers and that's total bullcrap because you already have a lot of money from just selling the game. This isn't a free-to-play game so get your microtransactions out of your non-playable game since you cant be bothered to fix your damn servers issues that ""justify your microtransactions"".

Team games shouldn't exist, it removes all elements of skill at this point if you get bad teammates and there are even some games that you can AFK for half of the duration and it wouldn't matter at all. You also sell top and bottom parts of the costume for what? Another sign of greed there because you can buy Kudos to spend on those top and bottoms parts. This isn't about customization, if you really wanted customization then you can easily sell them as a whole package but still have two parts. This was just an excuse for you to promote buying Kudos. You remove Steam names and replace it with generic garbage because of UI breaking and displaying profanity? Like wtf is even really wrong with you people. You made a great game yes, if I will only judge it from gameplay but that also has some serious flaws but I will judge this game as a whole and it's really bad. Microtransactions in a paid game, unplayable servers and very bad executive decisions like banning steam names. Otherwise then it's a pretty fun game to just mess around with but unless they fix their crap then this review stays.

Microtransactions can go to hell where they belong. ""Devs need money for servers and stuff that's why it's justified to have microtransactions."" That's just pure greed. Pure effing greed.

Give us back our beans

Edit: The dailies just broke, lol. No seriously. They're gone for many, if not all, people. This means (1) we can't obtain currency until it's fixed, and (2) anyone who spent $$$ on the season pass is now royally fucked. (XP/progression is virtually impossible outside of dailies/weeklies.)

Besides that, I've had several matches where the game crashes inexplicably, losing my progress. So many game-breaking glitches. Could not recommend this less.

Edit 2: Dailies are still broken after 24 hours. Apparently this doesn't affect everyone, but it makes me suspect this ""bug"" is a tactic to force people to buy Season Pass skips. I myself fall into the ""Can't complete the Season Pass without dailies"" group... Luckily, I bought my pass with F2P-earned currency and don't care about completion.

- Season 4 introduced creative mode witch the dev's will also use to create official levels going forwards. 
- Legacy (pre f2p) items have started to appear in the store for real money. 
- The vaulting of nearly half of the maps and game modes with no communication on if/when they will be playable again 
- Match player counts being cut from 60 down to 40 either due to lower player numbers or the stupid idea to port the game to the now extremely rotten potato that is the Switch.
- The dev's have now scrapped the Seasons system and will now only focus on adding new fame passes every month/ish with little to no info on if any new maps/other content will be added alongside the fame passes.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

Fall Guys is an absolute riot and has provided me and my friends with 41 hours of pure laughter and chaos. It's the perfect game to play with a group, and its whimsical graphics and absurd challenges make for a genuinely enjoyable experience. It's a party game that never fails to deliver on the promise of fun times and uncontrollable fits of giggles.

However, my enthusiasm for Fall Guys is dampened by my strong dislike for the developers' decision to remove the game from sale in Russia. Seriously, what were they thinking? It's like they took a page out of a comedy playbook, aiming for a punchline that nobody found funny. Denying an entire country the chance to join in on the fun is a baffling move that has left me scratching my head in disbelief.

While I can't deny the sheer enjoyment I've had with Fall Guys, I can't help but feel frustrated and disappointed by the developers' poor judgment. It's like they've set up the most entertaining party ever and then locked the door on some of the guests for no apparent reason. It's a misstep that casts a shadow over an otherwise fantastic game.

So, despite my reservations about the developers' baffling choice, I have to admit that Fall Guys is still a must-play game if you're lucky enough to have access to it. The laughs, the challenges, and the ridiculousness of it all are enough to make it a standout in the party game genre. Just be prepared to shake your head at the developers' puzzling antics while you're at it.",1624634860,1691481061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But due to the cheaters in this game, it's not funny anymore. It's not fun when a cheater is flying in the air at full speed and almost instantly push the football into the goal. It's not fun when a cheater is jumping above all the obstacles. And it's not fun  when developers put their trust in only their anti cheat system - others have already reviewed about this. We can't see the cheater's steam name because the game uses unique ID and we can't even report the cheater, so all we can do is pulling our pants down and take it.

And not to mention all the bugs like getting hit real hard by a falling obstacle so you fly through the map, and the lag which gives an unfair advantage. What are the developers doing about these problems? Nothing. They add a new season, add some new maps and just change some colors of the other maps, and add to be honest kinda ugly cosmetics.

Overall this game feels like a project made by students like me who's studying game programming at a folk high school - specifically C# in Unity - rather than a full release game. This game is something I would definitely work on at school and show for other students, but release it on Steam with this price tag in it's current state? Hell no.

[b] Edit: [/b]

I just downloaded this game again to try it out, despite the devs selling themselves to the fucking Epic Games store crap. I made it pretty far, placed first in the second round and was in the last 20, then during the third round the game just closes and the audio keeps playing. I found a Reddit post about the same problem which was posted [b] 3 MONTHS AGO [/b], and what the hell have the devs done to fix it? Nothing. I literally just downloaded the game and it wasn't running for long at all. I pity the people who are dumb enough to sell themselves to the Epic cunts and it's even worse when they make their game absolute unplayable for a certain OS users.",1599043682,1691155708,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I first played in 2021, I adored this game for a multitude of reasons, but the main one was that it was a battle royale game I could really enjoy playing. I tend to prefer platformers over shooters, so this game ticked that box immediately, but what really made it for me was it's cartoony art style and fun level design.

This was completely absent when I jumped back in.

The new, community-made levels that pop up in the show selector have no visual flair whatsoever; the same backgrounds, building parts and in some cases, stage designs or obstacles. This is no fault of the community itself, mind you, but a complete lack of any option to make them such from the dev team. Feels like Super Mario Maker on Wii U where they failed to give you some basic features or designs if that makes sense, and as a result the levels feel same-y. What's more, the maximum amount of players that can be in a game has been lowered from 60 to 40, which honestly removes some of the chaotic mad rush caused by an enormous mob of players trying to reach the end of the stage. 

There also doesn't appear to be any new dev-created stages since I last played, it's the same levels that I played multiple times, which you can only enjoy so much before it becomes tiresome. Combining them with the community levels only exacerbates the problem. I got bored of playing pretty quickly, which is a real shame because I know how much fun Fall Guys is from a conceptual gameplay standpoint, which was nailed in 2021. For whatever reason, the devs have taken a complete step back, and have given the community very little to work with. I don't think I'll be coming back to play again unless future updates look genuinely impressive and address the issues, and even though it's free to play now, I personally wouldn't recommend picking it up until then either. Not that you can on Steam anyway, considering that Devolver decided to make it exclusive to Epic.",1690079594,1690079594,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Forget it, as soon as you win even a round the system starts pairing you up with less casual gamers, making it yet another grind in stead of the lovely experience it was. Yet another thing ruined by schlEpic Games.

Edit: Steam saw I played it a bit recently and wanted me to revise my review, and as a matter of fact I got something to add: Ever since the start of the new ""season"" (factually three small seasons, making it harder to earn the ""premium currency"" to keep buying season passes and upping the FOMO significantly) It's been plagued by random crashes that the devs don't really seem to care to fix. Happening every time I play at least once.

The Fall Guys that launched and had 6 solid seasons is long gone. Oh how I long for the days of rounds with 60 Beans and all those classic maps that are now ""vaulted"". That's right, most of the maps you enjoyed which were huge hits through the first 6 seasons are long gone. Why? No idea. My guess is they had some kind of internal vote or a closed community vote and everyone who sucks at the game voted the more challenging maps, you know, the fun ones, out. This game caters to a younger generation so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the larger, challenging maps are gone. God forbid kids have to work at something and get good at it and earn a prize. Now you get shards for doing nothing at all. Any challenge that remained up until the overhaul is long gone unless you like community maps made by people who are obsessed with making the most insanely difficult, virtually impossible maps to get through in the game. Most of the community maps are just frustrating junk that maybe a handful of psychos can get through and you'll only be competing with a few other people if you are lucky. The latest co-op maps are almost completely empty at this point. Enjoy playing a multiplayer game alone. Fun.

So what the hell happened to Fall Guys? Like every game that's been taken over by a large corporate entity, micro-transactions have all but ruined the experience. The quality of the game has taken a serious hit and for nearly 6 months before the complete overhaul, we were stuck playing maybe 7 or 8 of the most boring, tedious maps over and over and over because some super genius decided to vault all the good maps. You actually knew what map was coming all the time and it just became a nauseating nightmare slog to get a crown. It was pretty obvious at that point that whoever was running the show had money on the brain instead of keeping the game interesting and challenging.

Low and behold, the overhaul came and sure enough it's basically just a money grab at this point. It's transactions for skins and transactions for season passes. Most of the good, old school maps are vaulted. Remember that season, Satellite Scramble? I think maybe one of those maps survived and it's the lame finale. That season had amazing maps and they are all GONE. What was the point of even having that season? Winter Knockout? Medieval Knockout? All gone. At best you might get a finale or maybe a stupid jump through the hoops round.

One of the biggest thrills of Fall Guys was checking in every morning to see what skins were available in the hopes that you'd finally get a rare one you were looking for. And you needed a lot of Kudos to get those skins. Now Kudos is pretty much totally worthless unless you are interested in a lame pair of sunglasses or a belt for your Bean. Dumb. Now you can just buy whatever you want. There's no more thrill to collecting skins, at all. They're all on rotation and they can all be easily purchased. In fact, they have to be purchased unless you want utter crap.

For me the biggest let down of all was vaulting the good maps in favor of easy junk to appease the toddlers who play the game for free. These are people who don't even support the community.

Creator Content is an okay addition and I've even made a few maps, but it's never going to make up for vaulting most of the good maps in the game. That was the dumbest decision they could have made. Also, whatever happened to 100 player rounds? Guess that was a lie. You don't even see 60 player rounds anymore. They've whittled it down to 30 or 40 at most if the server is even full.

The only redemption for this game is going to be bringing back the hundreds of classic maps that were vaulted and also bringing back some sort of opportunity to score good skins for Kudos. All those DLC skin packs? Bring them back in the old format of random tops and bottoms for huge amounts of Kudos.

As of right now, this game is in a death spiral for me, 1,600 hours in. Shame.",1598624388,1689637702,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game still has cheaters, but at least there's a report function, but ONLY to report the winner of the match.
Mind you, just because you cheat doesn't mean that you'll win. The fact that you cannot report specific players that are cheating, is just mind boggling.

There are now more maps, which is good, but the majority of them seem to be community created, which the Fall Guys devs have then refined, so...
Also, you'll be forced to make an Epic Games account if you want to play this game now. A huge, HUGE let down.

I use an RTX 2080 Super and this game lags heavily on my end. Doubt that it's my system, because Cyberpunk 2077 runs just fine at 60fps with RTX at medium settings.


The game is a lot of fun for 2-10 hours or so, but gets really stale soon after.
It's biggest problem is the repetitive nature of the stages at the beginning.
A person can only have so much fun playing the same stage over and over again, while being showcased a variety of stages during the loading screen after every won round.
No stage is difficult enough to be deemed as a ""progression reward"" for playing.

E: The game is completely overrun by cheaters at this point.
There is absolutely no way of reporting anyone and the game devs don't seem to give a rat's ass about dealing with this issue.

The map rotation is terrible, team modes aren't fun at all, tail tag boils down to the last 5 seconds with an awful grab mechanic (the game favors people with high ping, so they can steal your tail without making any contact) and jinx is full of exploits that the devs don't seem to care about fixing (such as jumping out of map and out of reach of others, jumping onto an invisible platform, etc.)",1598910602,1689534379,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This party game extravaganza offers a refreshing and lighthearted experience that appeals to players of all ages. From the moment you dive into the vibrant and colorful world of Fall Guys, you'll find yourself immersed in a joyous and hilarious adventure.

One of the standout features of Fall Guys is its unique take on the battle royale genre. Rather than intense firefights, the game replaces bullets and violence with an assortment of fun-filled obstacle courses and wacky challenges. As a jellybean-like character, you'll navigate a series of increasingly outrageous and unpredictable levels, competing against other players to be the last one standing. The gameplay is fast-paced and addictive, as you find yourself constantly laughing, cheering, and sometimes even screaming with delight as you dash, jump, and tumble your way through each zany obstacle.

Fall Guys excels in its accessibility and pick-up-and-play nature. The controls are simple and intuitive, making it easy for players of all skill levels to jump in and start having fun right away. The game's emphasis on lighthearted and goofy gameplay fosters an inclusive and welcoming environment, perfect for both casual gamers and seasoned players looking for a break from more intense titles.

Visually, Fall Guys is a treat for the eyes. The whimsical and vibrant art style, coupled with adorable character designs, creates a world that is bursting with charm and personality. Each level is meticulously crafted with colorful and imaginative themes, from towering obstacle courses to bouncing platforms and slippery slides. The attention to detail in the visual design adds an extra layer of immersion, making each level feel like a playful adventure.

One of the standout aspects of Fall Guys is its multiplayer experience. Whether you're playing with friends in a party or joining random players online, the game's multiplayer mode is a chaotic blast. The combination of teamwork, competition, and sheer randomness creates moments of both camaraderie and hilarity. Collaborating or competing with other players to reach the finish line or snatch victory in a team-based challenge adds an exciting social element to the gameplay.

It's worth mentioning that Fall Guys' reliance on server stability has caused occasional issues, including connection problems and matchmaking delays. However, the developers have shown dedication in addressing these concerns and working towards a smoother experience.

In conclusion, Fall Guys is an absolute delight of a game, offering an irresistibly charming and uproarious multiplayer experience. Its whimsical visuals, accessible gameplay, and infectious sense of fun make it a standout title for parties or casual play. Fall Guys is a testament to the power of a lighthearted approach to gaming, creating moments of laughter and joy that are truly infectious. So grab your friends, get ready to stumble, and prepare for a hilarious adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end.",1689124456,1689124456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I say this as someone who played the first season for about 40 hours and just now picked it up again, in season 4.

Now that Epic bought Mediatonic, I think it's only a matter of time before it goes free-to-play as an Epic store exclusive.
I'd recommend trying it out when that happens.

Players that bought the game received awful rewards for buying it after it got free to play, and all the crowns we earned were turned into Kudos, a currency that is now obsolete because Epic created their own currency, the Show Bucks. Now most of the items use this new coin that players can only get by spending money, making the game less fun to play. In the past Players could get most skins if they were skilled enough for free, but now 80% of the good skins need to be paid with an exaggerated price, these skins are way to expensive for what they are worth especially considering they were obtainable with the old currency of the game that was free and could be earned by just playing it. It is so ironic that players that pre-ordered the game received a Gordon Freeman skin, a character made by Valve the creator of Steam, for the game now leaving Steam and join Rocket League on one of the worst Gaming Companies possible. I really feel betrayed with the decisions of the game devs because I always supported the game even in awful situations like the cheating problem, now to see everything *fall* apart, very sad to know that money can change anyone and make the worst mistakes ever. Last but not least I don't understand how people could accept this situation, why should these type of decisions should be accepted nowadays, if something like this happened in 2012 people would riot for a change, but nowadays it is something normal that people are used to, sadly. This may be the biggest reason why I prefer old games, no lazy unfinished products at day 1, no microtransactions, just a simple good game with good unlockables FOR FREE. Gaming companies are greedy and will want more, and in the future things will be way worse. We really shouldn't accept these actions, but sadly I guess we're too late.

Fall Guys is a battle royale platformer game where you try to be the last ""guy"" standing out of 100 players. There are a variety of game modes and maps, with many more coming in future updates. While not every game mode is stellar, the sheer variety of modes on display means that even if there are 1 or 2 that you dislike, there are still plenty more modes available. The graphics, controls, and vibe of the game are great, and helps it stand out in a sea of battle royale games.
The only complaint I truly have about this game is how long loading times can be. In between each game you'll be waiting for sometimes minutes for the next round to start. This causes for matches to take much longer than they should and also causes for awkward pacing in what should be a fast and snappy battle royale.
While there are in-app purchases and the like in this title, they are, just like Fornite, only skins, and do not actually impact the gameplay at all. If you want, you don't have to spend a dime on this game and still get the full experience.
Overall, while I do have a few issues with Fall Guys, I would still recommend downloading it on the Epic Games Store to at least try it out. It is free after all, so there's no harm in trying. While this game is definitely past its glory days, I still enjoyed my time with it and I still come back to it every so often.",1688615160,1688615160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Crowns were a currency, which meant you had to win matches or finish quests to get certain rare items.

After the ""new season 1"" update, that is completely changed. The game is now free (in comparison to about $8 before) and there are many in game purchases, through a currency called Show-Bucks, which is just V-Bucks from Fortnite in Fall Guys.

The season pass now costs money, and it is up to Lvl 100 (in comparison to Lvl 60 before.) However, crowns are no longer a currency, making them a LOT less valuable, and all you can get with them now is Lvl up a little meter can grant you prizes.

UPDATE
The game is no longer one of the best games of 2020 now
The updates take half a year and add barely any content, half of the rounds are being removed due to switch port issues (just turn off switch cross play at this point jesus christ) kudos are now useless since you cant buy anything of value with them, creative mode is extremely limited and poorly designed, and the mediatonic made levels are a thousand times more soulless and boring than the player created ones which you can only access through a code in custom lobbies. this aint mario maker, theres no mode where you can play random community levels because that would actually make sense. the game is awful, its always had its problems since day one, and with each one they fix 5 more get added. we waited 5 months for the creative update and its trash. 5 months of the same 3 rounds being played over and over, with no new content. 5 months and we get this.
I've always had a soft spot for this game but my optimism and hope is completely gone. I wouldn't even mind if it got shut down due to lack of players at this point. It's honestly deserved.

Additionally, you spend the majority of your time loading, watching the map intro videos and watching beans fall off the board than you actually play the game. There is no excuse to spend this much time at these sections. 

In theory, I really like this game but the developers do not seem interested in fixing the core issues. 

If you can look past these, you'll have a fun time as there are many excellent stages so I recommend it to most casual players but I can't recommend it to someone who wants to sink hours into the game without these being fixed. These issues make the game too frustrating to play for me now.

Fall Guys has some excellent stages thanks to some talented people over at Mediatonic, the costumes are usually well designed, the price provides incredible value, the battle pass system format is second to none and they have an engaged community / social media team. They just seem to be lacking developers to help them fix the main issues.

Core Issues: 
- Server Desynchronization. The game has been out for a while now and it's becoming clear that this is not going to be fixed. What does this mean? Well, let's say you're in a Hex-A-Gone final round, there will be some people who are jumping on non-existent tiles that you already used from your perspective. It could also mean someone is behind you in a Fall Mountain final but they manage to grab the crown on Fall Mountain as they are actually ahead of you. Originally, I thought this was a heavy server load thing but as player population has continued to drop, there hasn't been much improvement. 

- Character Stability. Your character will fall over for no reason. Season 1 felt (mostly) fine. It got worse in Season 2 and it doesn't feel much better in Season 3. Sometimes, you fall on a Jump Showdown final due to this stability (even when you are not standing on the crack) and you will lose as your character decides to ragdoll randomly. Plus, ragdoll physics don't provide any value and the amount of time it takes to get back up can also be nearly random. 

- Character Collision. This goes hand in hand with stability. The number of players means that character collision shouldn't be this aggressive. It also feels like complete RNG whether bumping someone will push you off something or do nothing at all. You could be happily jumping near someone on a Jump Showdown final, you two bump each other midair but only one of you falls down while one of you is unharmed - despite jumping at the same time. The little beans just aren't stable enough to have this sort of collision in the game. It is far too much of a RNG element. 

- Wasted Time (loading, round animations, matchmaking). These all take way longer than they need to. You should avoid this game if you have limited time to play when you're gaming. You start out with some of the slowest matchmaking that I've ever seen for a game that has a decent player population (10000+ average players online) to find just 56-59 others (average, 43 seconds). When the game decides to find people, we then watch the scrolling screen of rounds to select from and wait for the game to pick one (on average, 20 seconds) (here, it should be loading the selected round in the background during this animation but seemingly, it does not). Next, we sit at ""Waiting for Players"" to load the chosen round (on average, 10 seconds) (we shouldn't wait here if it was loading it in the background during selection. These 10 seconds could be caused by players on HDDs, those with poor connections or a server-side issue). Now, when the round finally loads, it isn't time to play yet - it is time to watch a needless stage cinematic. The game then goes to a 3-2-1 countdown after the cinematic to begin. When the round is over, we watch the ""Round Over"" animation come up on the screen followed by players that lost drop off of a board (from the time you see the ""Round Over"", including the watching of the players fall off the board and ending with the next stage selection starting - on average 21 seconds) (again during this time, in the background, we could select and load the next stage but the developers don't seem to do this). You now proceed to repeat the process to select a stage, load the stage and watch the next cinematic before getting to play the next round. This adds up to 1.5 minutes or so including matchmaking. It's all far too long for a game of minigames in the age of NVMe drives and 1Gbit down/up connections.

- As a whole, the game is catering to a less skilled audience with Season 3. The modes were traditionally 50% skill and 50% luck (which was already too high for luck). The scales feel they've tipped in the luck direction even more with some of these new stages. 

- The new stages are far weaker than Season 1 and 2. Big Fans, Knights Fever are examples of stages to strive for. The Season 3 race even has advantageous spawn positions instead of being balanced (Freezy Peak). The game has fun, skill focused stages where you can learn the tricks and timings of the stage to improve. However, for each good stage, there is round where it can just come down to luck. Unfortunately, the game seems to be trending in the latter direction.

- The new Season 3 finals are far worse. Hex-A-Gone and Jump Showdown are still the best finals but Thin Ice is so common now. Fall Mountain could be good with bugfixes and lowering the maximum player count.",1608188247,1686537555,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

It brought friends together in a tough time with an engaging and undeniably goofy experience that just felt good to play. But with its refusal to create meaningful variety or adequately reward its playerbase for sticking around, the game just makes me sad imagining what could have been. Despite the promise of its premise, no opportunity for fun goes unignored.

Part 1 - The Fall

This is a game about falling over. It's simple, it's stupid, and it's brilliant. I love seeing a new course and finding out the new ways it can cause the players, myself included, to land on their face as they contend with an unfamiliar challenge. But a course is only fresh for the first few days of its release, and the moment it's understood, onto the pile it goes. It's just one more line of obstacles to churn through, with no real challenge left to offer you. You've stopped falling over.

When variety dies, fun dies with it. I'm not just talking about a lack of new stages. The amount of individual courses is perfectly serviceable as it is (the Vault notwithstanding), and it would be foolish to ask that the developers just keep churning out new and unique maps. What's missing is a way of shaking up the maps we already have. Once upon a time, some effort was made in that regard. Some stages have sections in which the typical obstacles can be randomly swapped out for different ones, or a wildly-swinging hammer may appear in select areas where it can knock a skilled player toward victory. These instances, however fun, are rare, and the developers appear unwilling to add more; this leaves an enormous chunk of levels completely static in their function. What's more, any effort put into these additions does add unfamiliarity to a level, but only for so long. At some point, you've just seen it all. But variety can itself be expressed in a variety of ways, and by their combination, we can multiply the level possibilities for very little additional effort. More possibilities to confuse the player, to get them to fall over.

My preferred solution is random stage modifiers. Give any course a chance to inflict a gameplay-altering effect that challenges the player to rethink a familiar course. I could list off modifiers all day, but here's a small taste:

Dizzy - Reversed controls!
Flightless - Jumping disabled! You can still dive.
Slippery - Ice physics!
Leaping - Jump is twice as high!
Startling - Grabbing another player causes them to jump!
Ghostly - Players do not collide! You can still grab.
Fishy - Run speed greatly reduced! Use dives to move quickly.
Wild - Several Rhinos are placed randomly on the course!
Tiring - Jumping has a 3-second cooldown.
Xtreme - No respawns, only elimination!

By no means is it one-size-fits-all, as not every stage can be completed with every modifier, but it would exponentially increase the total number of unique level combinations and ensure that even an experienced player would need to stop and think about what they're doing instead of always following the same practiced line that gets them to the end the quickest. They will approach with caution, they will be confused, and they will fall over. And falling over is the fun part.

Part 2 - The Guys

The bean-shaped playable characters in Fall Guys, are, by their design, nothing. When you boot up the game for the first time, you are given a naked pink Nothing Man to play as, which seems perfectly appropriate for the kind of game you're playing. After all, playing the game is half the fun, the other is how the game plans to reward you! ""Great,"" you say, ""I can't wait to unlock some outfits so I can stop being so nothing!"". And you're half-right in your assessment: You will find outfits, but you will never stop being nothing.

With no intention to spend money on this free-to-play game, and certainly not the 8-or-so dollars the game expects for any of its premium outfit packages, your options may seem limited. By slowly accruing Kudos over days of play, however, you can expect to eventually afford a shiny pair of spiked wristbands and a neat sunhat to keep your Nothing Man looking stylish. If you wear the both of them together, maybe you can put together a pretty swanky new look for yourself. Oh, but what's this? Upper, Lower, Faceplate, Color, Pattern... Where's the Accessory tab? Surely you don't mean to tell me that if I wear these spiked wristbands, I can't wear anything else on my entire top half? And yet, this is exactly the case for every Kudos outfit: You may wear gloves, wristbands, glasses, or a hat. Individually, these costume pieces look great! But ""individually"" is all you get without Show Bucks, the freemium currency of which the game will toss you a few crumbs each month for dedicated play.

Aggressive monetization is to be expected from any free-to-play game, and Fall Guys is no exception. If you want your character to feel less naked, it's either play every day or cough up the dough. However you choose to acquire a nicer outfit for yourself, put it on and experience the freedom of your new polar bear costume! I just hope you don't mind the dead-eyed stare of your Nothing Man's faceplate looking back at you. Regardless of your outfit choice, it will have a gaping hole in the middle, ensuring the bland non-design of your playable character's face will always stab through the fun outfit and into your eyeballs. There's a Nothing Man inside that costume, the game says, don't forget about the Nothing Man. In the great paradox of Fall Guys' art design, it seems no price is high enough to hide the aspirin tablet with limbs they spent so long not designing.

If the character's face must be shown, why make it so devoid of identity? The treatment of the character as a strangely-shaped person, rather than a blank slate to be dressed over, is particularly problematic when the likeness of an actual human is hideously stretched over the cylindrical shape of the Nothing Man's body, complete with an artificial tan faceplate to remind you of the dark deed that has taken place. Wouldn't the task be better served by a character with a slight identity rather than none at all? Given the chance to step back to the beginning and present a different design, I would simply replace the slippery clumsy ""people"" with slippery clumsy penguins. An animal character has instant appeal no matter what outfit it's given to wear or what silly game show stunt it's asked to perform, which cannot be said for the Nothing Man. And if you still insist upon the face being seen, don't worry, at least penguins are cute.

Part 3 - The Ultimate Knockout

The switch from the pay-once model to free-to-play resulted in a change to the players' focus -- it has blurred to the point that it can be hard to see a reason to play at all. Before free-to-play, ""premium"" outfits were bought with 5 Crowns, one of which was awarded for each win. Crowns are no longer a spendable currency but instead go toward a linear and unchanging list of exclusive unlockable outfits for increasingly sweaty players to wear as status symbols (which, due to the aforementioned character customization, eliminates the ability to wear anything else). If you wish to wear the outfits you've purchased, whether with free or premium currency, winning has been effectively disincentivized.

Fall Guys is a game that deserved better than it got, and the window for any kind of real change closed years ago. When I turn back to take a look through that window, I see a better game. With every glacially slow season, it slips ever further into mediocrity, and I wish more and more to return to the first year of playing Fall Guys with friends before we discovered that occasionally being new and shiny was the best this game was going to get.",1598536705,1686048841,False,2,0,0.543859660625457764,0,True,False,False

EDIT:

fuck the team games. they're absolutely pointless and a waste of time.

EDIT 2: changing to not recommended. The devs of this game seem clueless to the fortune they've stumbled upon with their game. They're not releasing nearly enough patches and updates to keep even a toddler engaged. It's the same shit over and over and over again. Mind numbingly boring after the first few hours. This game as it stands now has no longevity whatesoever, and is not worth its price tag. Wait for a sale of at least 50-75%.

The game's bright colours, silly sound effects, and playful animations make it a joy to look at and play.

Although it's easy to pick up and play, the gameplay can be quite challenging at times, especially as the rounds progress and the competition becomes tougher. While the game can be frustrating at times, especially when getting griefed by garbage players, its absolutely incredible when you win.

One of the strengths of Fall Guys is its variety of mini-games, which are all distinct and challenging in their own ways. From racing to the finish line to battling it out on seesaws and spinning platforms, each mini-game offers a different kind of challenge that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Durch das neue Update deutlich verschlechtert. 

- Noch immer kein Support f√ºr Leute mit einem 21/32:9 Monitor, das Spiel l√§uft nur auf 16:9
- Dazu bei mir mit einem 3840x1600 Monitor nicht m√∂glich, wenigstens in WQHD 2560x1440p zu spielen, nur FHD 1920x1080p einstellbar. Das ist ein Witz f√ºr ein Spiel im Jahre 2023
- Offensichtlich keine neuen Karten hinzugef√ºgt oder so selten, dass man sie nicht zu Gesicht bekommt (ca. 30 Durchl√§ufe jeweils Duos, sowie Einzel gespielt, keine einzige gesehen), nur alte Karten wieder hinzugef√ºgt
- Etliche neue Bugs, vom st√§ndigen Freeze, Lobby nicht verlassbar, Hauptmen√º verbuggt, im Spiel selber Charakter nicht steuerbar, mit dem Controller hartes Delay beim Laufen/Springen alles dabei. Vor dem Spiel in √ºber 100 Stunden Spielzeit vielleicht mal 2 Abst√ºrze gehabt
- Neuer Creativmodus f√ºr die Tonne, Creator-Maps h√§sslich und schlecht, und selbst in diesem Modus gerade einmal 8-10 neue Maps, die angeblich vom Fall-Guys Team sind, aber so aussehen und sich spielen lassen, als ob ein Dreij√§hriger gebaut h√§tte. 
- Gibt jetzt pro Season nicht mehr ein Season Pass, sondern 3-4, die jeweils nur kurze zeit laufen. Der Alte hat vermutlich nicht genug Kohle abgeworfen.

Alles in Allem ein extrem mieses Update, welches kaum was an Content hinzugef√ºgt hat, daf√ºr aber das Gameplay und die Performance massiv verschlechtert hat. War das Spiel vor dem Update noch bedenkenlos zu empfehlen, ist nun durch die seit Monaten immer selben ""richtigen"" Maps die Luft raus, st√§ndig dasselbe, und der Creator Modus ist eher eine Alpha, und selbst da hat man nach einem Abend spielen alles gesehen, solange man die Motivation hat, das Spiel st√§ndig neu zu starten.

P.S. Der Trick mit der ""NativRes.exe"", einer inoffiziellen Datei, welche das Spiel in das gew√ºnschte Bildformat und Aufl√∂sung gezwungen hat, sorgt nun daf√ºr, dass man im Hauptmen√º nun alle Overlays und Boxen √ºberlappend hat und unten das Bild abschneidet, also ist das auch keine Option mehr. Ob die Entwickler absichtlich daf√ºr gesorgt haben?! Zuzutrauen w√§re es ihnen, so vehement sie sich gegen einen ordentlichen Support f√ºr Widescreen Monitore str√§uben.


New update s*cks

- Still no support for 21/32:9 screens, only playable in 16:9 
- With my monitor at 3840x1600 its not possible to play it at least in WQHD 2560x1440p, only FHD 1920x1080p is available. For the year 2023 its a massive joke.
- Apparently no new maps in the normal rounds or extremely rare (played approx. 30 rounds of Single and Duos each, never played a new map), only added some old maps again
- Tons of new bugs, freeze all the time, cant exit the current game, main menu bugged, sometimes character not able to move, and if, then massive delay on the right stick and while jumping. In over 100 hours of gameplay before the update i had maybe two freezes
- New creative mode extremely bad, Creator-Maps ugly and no fun, and even there only maybe 8-10 new maps from the FallGuys developers team. But from the looks, could be designed by a three-year old.
- Not one, but 3-4 season passes within one season, each a little bit cheaper than the big one before, but alltogether more expensive. Guess getting money once from you wasnt enough.

Long story short, shitty update with almost no new content exept massive new bugs and problems. Before the update hte game was a no-brainer, very fun, but since theres no new content for the ""real"" maps its getting boring and repetitive. New creator modus is more like an early alpha and even there you've seen everything on a saturday evening, but only if you are motivated to restart the game every few rounds.

Oh, and the trick with the inoffical ""NativeRes.exe"" which you can find on Google, where the file forced the game to work in desired resolution and wide screen format, doesnt work anymore. The main menu doenst let you change the game mode (Single, Duos etc.) and at least 30% of the screen is cut off. Intentional from the developers?! Could be, from their perspective its obviously not wanted that any of you wide screen users are having fun with the game.",1684445303,1684447275,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a game that makes you feel like a kid again, except you're constantly losing to actual kids who seem to have way more coordination than you do. It's like being in a pinball machine, but instead of flippers, you're using your clumsy little bean arms to navigate through the chaos. The game is essentially a mix between Takeshi's Castle and a kindergarten playground, where the only thing you're really competing for is a fancy little crown that will make you feel like the king of all jelly beans. It's a game that makes you laugh until you cry, and then cry until you laugh again, all while trying to avoid giant balls and spinning discs.

It's so addictive that it's like a drug, except the only high you'll get is from winning a round and the low is from getting eliminated early. It's like playing a game of Russian Roulette, except instead of a gun, you're using your own incompetence and the bullets are brightly-colored bean-shaped obstacles.

Overall, Fall Guys is a hilarious, chaotic mess that will make you forget all about the real world for a while. It's a game that will have you screaming at your screen one moment, and then giggling uncontrollably the next. So, if you're looking for a game that will make you feel like a kid again, but with a dash of ridiculousness and a pinch of frustration, then Fall Guys is the game for you.",1596637134,1684245867,True,107,723,0.824168920516967773,0,True,False,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh my god has this game fallen off. The developers never fucking update the game. They leave the game as a buggy mess with half the playerbase not even being able to fucking play the game. They literally release a major update every 6 months with content that gets dry after about a day its fucking horrible. What they SHOULD do is make a season last about 10-12 weeks like other popular games e.g. fortnite. They should also release a round a week instead of just all of them at once and spread them across the 12 allowing for a more enjoyable gameplay experience and a reason to come back and play the game.

Do not buy this game its just not worth it anymore.

The last update to this review was in season 6 and IDK why I'm even updating a fucking review for a game you can't play anymore but whatever. Creative mode has saved this game for me (FOR NOW) and the promise of 40 new rounds across the season on top of the 20 new ones we have now sounds fucking awesome

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1683576231,1683576231,True,0,1,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

- Not that fun if you play alone/not with friends.
- After playing the stages a few times, understanding the mechanics of each level,  it gets quite boring and repetitive quickly and sadly new seasons take an eternity to be released! (therefor the game become even mroe repetitive and boring).
- Each new season offer very little novelty in the lovel design and mechanics (most are uninspired revamped stages) and very few new levels (yet they take months to release seasons!)
- Physics can be very frustrating sometimes
- Some games mechanics are plain stupid (example : the ""catch the tail"" level, where you jsut have to start chasing the tell the few last seconds, no need to spend the whold round chasing. They should do like for some others levels : the more you escape with your tail, the more points you gain)
- No local multiplayer! Wtf... That's litteraly the perfect type of game for a local couch gaming!
- Cheaters (yes, even after they said they fixed it, i still have seen on different occassion, some guys moving at x50 speed etc.)
- No Steam names in games (just random games given to players, so it's impossible to know who is who in order to play again with some people if you liked gaming with them)
- No ""matchmaking""
- The game has been bought by Epic Games, meaning they force you to play on Epic Games now, they force you to create an Epic Games account and to link your steam account to Epic... not even mentioning the very shaddy practices of Epic Games in general.

But I gotta admit, ever since the Epic Games takeover, this game have gone downfall significantly.

From nice cosmetics that used to be obtainable by hard grinding the game (which honestly, feels more worth it), to be easily available just with some real money transaction. There's no real point really why I want to grind in this game other than completing the battle pass (which I don't even feel motivated to finish it nowadays).

Second of all, there's isn't really any big improvement to not just the game itself, but the developers as well. Lack of communications between players and developers, messy state of the game with all those hackers and delayed progress (it took almost a damn year from the Free-For-All update announcement for the developer to actually implement the level builder mode). Why even bother announcing it when you can't even manage to deliver it on time?

Heck, even the official community page (Twitter, Discord, etc) feels very different compared to those prior to the Epic Games takeover (OG players probably know what I'm talking about)

In summary, thanks Epic Games for ruining what I used to say, my favorite game of all time.

Firstly, the Orange Chicken was absolutely delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the orange sauce was tangy, sweet, and packed with flavor. The dish had the perfect balance of savory and sweet flavors, making it a truly satisfying meal. The chicken was also perfectly cooked, with a crispy exterior and a moist interior. Overall, I would highly recommend the Orange Chicken to anyone who loves Chinese cuisine.

Next, the Chow Mein was equally delicious. The noodles were cooked to perfection and had a wonderful texture that complemented the flavors of the dish. The vegetables in the Chow Mein were also fresh and flavorful, adding a nice crunch to each bite. The sauce was savory and delicious, tying all the flavors together perfectly. Overall, the Chow Mein was a great addition to the meal and provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the Orange Chicken.

In conclusion, the Orange Chicken and Chow Mein are both excellent dishes that I would highly recommend to anyone who loves Chinese cuisine. The Orange Chicken is packed with flavor and has the perfect balance of savory and sweet flavors, while the Chow Mein has a wonderful texture and is full of fresh and flavorful ingredients. Together, they make for a truly satisfying meal that is sure to delight your taste buds.",1683186531,1683186531,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a fun game for the most part, but some of the minigames are just not fun at all and it didn't look like anything was being done to fix them. The new season brought almost no changes to existing maps, and 4 new games. I liked the new race, thought wall guys was ok, but I'd groan every time the new egg or hoop game got selected.

Also, I get that its a goofy bean man game where you're supposed to be clumsy and it shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it does get annoying when whether you win a game is out of your hands or not fair. Getting your tail sniped from lag in tail tag is annoying, having a single hiccup or getting unlucky and having a ball fall on your head in fall mountain guarantees a loss, for the ring game you need to get lucky and have them drop near you, and whichever team has the weakest start in the egg game is pretty much guaranteed to lose. 

I'd say I have a lot to complain about with this game, but it is a lot of fun for a while when you start playing it so I can still overall recommend it. I sadly don't think it's shown itself to have long lasting appeal though

Season 3 update:

They added a lot of new stuff this season, and it was enough to get me to hold my interest for a little while this time. However, I feel like the clunkiness of the game that started off as a fun element wears off and gets annoying after a while. I've gotten a bit tired of how much you stumble and trip around, and a couple bad minigames are enough to ruin a set, so I don't think I'm going to be revisiting this much now

Season 6 or something update idk:
A lot of things are much better now! Playing in squads is great, and *most* bad games aren't in anymore while the new games are all pretty solid. No more losing to BS in later rounds with tip toe and fall mountain :)

This new battle pass is some donkey ass though, and sucks since I had bought this game. You can't work hard and save up wins for the featured skins anymore, and I don't think doing the entire free battle pass even gets you one of them either. I get that it's f2p now but it's still very annoying that you can't really earn the skins you want anymore, esp since I had bought into the game early.",1606065244,1681347933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game features a variety of mini-games in which players compete against each other to be the last one standing and win the coveted crown.

The game's graphics and visuals are bright and colorful, with cute character designs and whimsical environments that create a lighthearted and fun atmosphere. The game's sound design is also well-done, with upbeat music and sound effects that add to the overall fun and silly vibe of the game.

The game's gameplay mechanics are simple yet addictive, with easy-to-learn controls and a variety of different mini-games that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. The game's multiplayer aspect also adds to the fun, as players can compete against each other and engage in friendly rivalry.

One potential downside of the game is its lack of depth and replay value. Once players have experienced all the mini-games, the game may start to feel repetitive and lose its appeal. Additionally, the game's reliance on luck in certain mini-games may frustrate some players.

Overall, Fall Guys is a fun and lighthearted multiplayer game that offers a unique and engaging experience. The game's charming visuals and sound design, as well as its addictive gameplay mechanics, make it a must-play for fans of party games. However, its lack of depth and reliance on luck may make it feel somewhat shallow for some players. I would rate Fall Guys a 4 out of 5 for its fun and addictive gameplay.",1680815153,1680815153,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Every other game some kid with uncle issues will just start flying towards the finish line on round one. Honestly though, those kids annoy me less than the ones that are actually semi-okay at the game and only cheat to win the final, because at least with the awful hackers I can leave the game instantly rather than waste 15 minutes of my life before someone displays the gaming equivalent of a chav honking at 12 year old girls from their Corsa in a McDonalds carpark.

In fact the only thing more frustrating than the hackers themselves is Oliver Aged 24, the ""Community Manager"", who seems to think joking about the situation and then begging people not to post videos or report hackers 'because it will stop people wanting to buy the game', is a good example of what a community manager should do. They also claim that the hackers get banned at the end of matches, which seems unlikely because it's rare you'll see one that isn't displaying an outfit which cost a minimum of 7 wins and a completed battlepass.

Was a great game in the beta, love the mechanics, love almost everything about it. I've played for almost 200 hours since launch, plus 100 in beta, and I've got 100+ wins, so I'm not review bombing the game unjustly. Fix the hacker problem now as a priority and stop making jokes about it and asking people not to talk about it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Hackers, as far as I'm aware, are no longer a problem. Removing the crown for wins has made the game much lower stakes which, to be honest, it probably needed. My main complaint would be that they have created 100s of levels at this point, yet you always seem to play the same ones.

Whether you're dodging giant fruit or trying to navigate a chaotic obstacle course, Fall Guys keeps you on your toes and keeps the laughs coming.

Of course, the game's physics can be a bit wonky at times - I'm pretty sure my bean-shaped character has defied the laws of gravity on more than one occasion. But honestly, that's part of the fun. It's like the game is in on the joke, and we're all just along for the ride.

One downside is that the matchmaking can be a bit hit-or-miss at times, with occasional long wait times or connection issues. But honestly, I'm willing to overlook that for the pure joy that Fall Guys brings.

Overall, I'd give Fall Guys a funny and fun 5 out of 5 - it's the perfect game to play with friends or to unwind after a long day. Just be prepared to lose a few brain cells from all the laughter.",1680035168,1680035168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, but the biggest thing that ticks me off about it is that I didn't get the game for free like most of the people playing now. Just a few months ago, the game cost a full twenty bucks, and I purchased it at that price. I bought the game a month or two before it was announced that Fall Guys was becoming free to play, and even though I received some passes, it wasn't twenty dollar's worth. Now the game is filled with players who either payed money for the nice items or just pretty much wear the free, basic stuff. Fall Guys isn't pay to play, as you can only buy clothes, but if you won't put money into this game, your choices of attire are pretty lame. However, this game is still fun, even if it is filled with noobs. All events and levels are available without purchases.

The skill based matchmaking (Sometimes) and rounds picked were and still are driven down to the ground and the item shop doesn't help. What rewarded you for playing the game skillfully worked but nooooo, you have to buy the items now with real money and have to wait 4 seasons to get enough of the special currency which wasn't even in the game before the free to play model so you can get enough to afford one of the battle passes. That means you have to grind so much of the game just to get each currency in the battle pass. A battle pass here costs 1000 of the currency and gives 300 of the currency for every battle pass, but the last 100 is at the end of the pass, meaning you need to devote so much of your time for mindless grinding while also having to deal with the matchmaking I mentioned from earlier, equalling a shit time that is overcomplicated than the game before it sucked.

The game is easy to pick up and play, with simple controls and a straightforward objective: to be the last bean-shaped character standing. The game's cartoonish graphics and silly sound effects also add to the game's overall charm and appeal.

Another strength of Fall Guys is its replayability. With a variety of game modes, maps, and randomized obstacles, no two games are exactly the same. The game also features a leveling system and cosmetic rewards, providing players with a sense of progression and accomplishment.

However, the game does have some weaknesses. The gameplay can sometimes feel repetitive, especially after playing for an extended period of time. The game's reliance on luck and chance can also be frustrating for players who prefer games that are more skill-based.

As a result, many players have grown tired of the game and moved on to other titles.

You Probably bought this game when it first came, same for me. Either u hate or love this game whether it be season 2 being bad or the good vibes from the first season it all comes down to your personality. Not played it for a while nor have i heard of it from social media apps. ""Its Dead"" is probably the most commented thing for this game but it all comes down to your liking's. For me its a fun game to play with your friends but honestly not good for grinding . I grind-ed it day and night when the game came out. Trying to get all skins I still remember the golden hot dog (glizzy) or the golden knight when it came out being a huge achievement but now its common to see. So whats my verdict well its complicated but honestly try this game out again, give it a chance. I hope this helped :)",1602773677,1679332856,True,2,1,0.509452581405639648,0,True,False,False

-rubbish awards for legacy players like myself
-over monetisation with micro-transactions needed to get anything decent now

Why you will enjoy it:
-like those wacky tv shows where you go through assault courses except you play as an animated blob you can dress up 
-many new maps and game modes to play 
-good replay ability 
-you soon realise no matter how bad or good you do 80% of waiting for the next trial is watching the last low IQ players repeat the same actions in comedic fashion
-always a good game to jump on with friends or to kill time solo if you aren't sure what to play

The game's colorful and cartoonish aesthetic, coupled with its engaging gameplay, make it a standout title in the battle royale genre.

The game's premise is simple yet effective, as players compete against each other in various obstacle courses and challenges, with the goal of being the last one standing. The game's controls are easy to learn, but mastering each obstacle and avoiding the other players can be challenging and rewarding.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of ""Fall Guys"" is the way it encourages players to be creative and strategic in their approach to each challenge. With multiple paths and options for completing each obstacle, the game encourages players to experiment and find the most effective strategy for their play style.

Beyond its engaging gameplay, ""Fall Guys"" is also a visually appealing game, with its colorful and whimsical art style adding to the game's fun and lighthearted tone.

Overall, ""Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout"" is a fantastic game that is well worth your time.

The game is plagued with inconsistencies, bugs, and lag, which can give players an unfair advantage. Killing other players is far too easy, and suicide is even easier, which can be frustrating for players who lose because someone decided to kill themselves and take the player with them. Accidental kills occur frequently due to poor collision detection, and the physics in the game are often unreliable, leading to unavoidable issues. In its current state, I cannot recommend this game even if it were free, as it is simply a mess.

An update from ss3: dead game
An update from ss2; this game will never be good again, all we can do is play this rotting corpse until it has nothing left, im gonna go enjoy this sinking ship, everything i say after this is true, but i still will play to enjoy the last few moments of this being somewhat tolerable.

Oh. my. God. this game has been a rollercoaster of emotions, from pure joy to slightly less pure joy and then simply sadness, i can't put into words the happiness highs that this game has given me, but i also cant explain how sad this game makes me feel...
The negative:
Its like a person with dementia, a first, nothing is that bad, some signs of things going wrong are showing, in this case the first minor sign was s4's rampant dlcs, you say its not that bad, but it still sucks, the next sign is slightly stronger, those small discreptancies would usually just be small discreptancies but when you know that something will go wrong (since epic bought it) those small things make you think of whats coming next, s5.2 was the next sign, the new shitty UI reminded everybody of the corporateisation of the game, and yet we smiled through the pain, then s6 hit... the goddamn epic games accounts reminded everybody of where the game was going next, and then it struck """"""s1"""""", its not s1 and if they try to tell you it is its not, they can never replicate the pure joy of s1 and them saying that its s1 pisses me off, like they are trying to tell you it will be the same, but it isnt s1 its ss1 with microtransactions and so much bullshit that even if its free, for older players it doesnt justify what they have done to the game, *look at what they have done to my boy*, they have turned this game into a cash cow, all of a sudden a previously 16 pound game is now selling you two legendary skins for ¬£26 ¬£10 MORE THAN THE GAME WHEN IT WAS PAID, WHAT THE FRICK??? THEY EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY THAT?????? anyone who actually buys these skins are fools, they are playing right into epic game's plan, ruin the game game and then make you pay for it... WHAT??? and i know mf's who are actually buying the skins, I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT ¬£65 ON FUCKING SKINS, PAYING A COMPANY WHICH IS DIRECTLY SCREWING THEM OVER, WHAT?!?!?!??
The positive: 
This game's older seasons s1-s5.1 were goddamn GOLD, they were an example of some of the highest order of game design, seriously a fucking master piece, grinding out crowns in s3-5.1 was so fun and even though there werent many players, it was a loveley tight knit community, these seasons are the reason i still play today, because in my mind i trick into believing that its as good as it was then, and even though im telling you its not, i still can't accept it in my real mind, i still long for old fall guys, when it was funny bean game, when the game was decent and it was just ""ohoho flal gu ded gam!! heheh lel jk this game is good!!"" i still long for a time when there was a wonder around getting a win, and when those wins actually counted for anything, when you could get kudos through playing and when you could spend crowns on the shop, seriously listening to some for the older ost tracks makes me want to cry, i love this game, but what they have done to it isnt justifiable, oh yeah, this game's ost, for being a battle royale about beans, this games music is so good, its just so exciting and happy, too bad i cant feel happy because my favourite game is ruined.

This game could be easily fixed while still remaining F2P, My idea:
You can keep the show bucks and you can keep the microtransactions, but do one things, let us get kudos when we win, make wins feel even just slightly better, you only need to give us like 100 kudos, not that much, secondly and most importantly, make the battle pass be like a premium pass, what i mean by that is that it would allow you to get show bucks by just playing, well more like by winning, it would give you like 10 showbucks every 3 wins to keep it grindy so some ppl would still pay, but allowing us ""will never pay"" people a chance to get some shiny new costumes, also add back crowns as a currency, seriously they make the game so much better, if kudos can buy common items, allow crowns to buy uncommons/rares make the costumes tough to get, like maybe 40 crowns for a rare piece and 25 for an uncommon, another thing, just keep the game on steam, egs barely works anyways and the majority of new players are on console, literally 0 people use egs apart from fortnite kids.
I wanna end this off with; this game WAS so good that it is the sole reason i want to be able to turn back time, even though the last ""good"" season was only a year and a half ago, i still get nostalgia for s3 and s1, i still get good memories like when i bought my first crown skin, the tomato top in s1, I was so frickin happy, or when i got the icecream in the crown pass, i was overflowing with joy at that one dumb skin ""YOO I GOT THE ICECREAM SO COOL IM SO GOOD"" now i have golden witch and im not as happy as i was then, this game literally makes me want to cry sometimes just because of how much i miss the older seasons... So long partner, you have brought me true joy, i guess all things have to end and this game being truly fun has ended

Enjoy the old reviews from the ""legacy seasons"" aka the good times, enjoy!

Fall guys is a fun game, but it could be better with more maps and less glitches, also please be weary that there is a lot of hackers so don't be sad if you loose! also the game is hard... it is not recommended if you rage easily*

Well, this is me in the future, it is update 3.5 and there are no more hackers, there are definitely more maps and the game is a lot better, it is still not recommended if you rage easily, but this game has climbed up the ranks, DO play it.

It is now season 4 and the game is still fun, However i am not going to recommend it as much as in season 3.5 because i think that saying this game is a lot better is false, as it is really only somewhat better, i still think it is a good game but I really think that if you aren't a huge fan of online competition, if you are looking for relaxed fun, fall guys does not deliver, however if you are a very competitive type, go ahead...

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The graphics are bright, colorful, and cartoonish, which adds to the game's charm and accessibility. The controls are simple and intuitive, so even if you're new to gaming, you'll be able to pick up the game quickly and start having fun.

The game's premise is simple: you play as a wobbly, bean-shaped character who must compete against other players in a series of obstacle courses and party games. The courses are varied and challenging, and you never know what's coming next. The party games are equally entertaining, and they range from soccer matches to memory games.

One of the things that makes Fall Guys so addictive is its unpredictability. You never know what's going to happen next, and that keeps you on your toes. The game is also very replayable, as each course is randomized, so no two runs are ever the same.

The game also has a great sense of humor. From the goofy sound effects to the ridiculous costumes you can unlock for your character, Fall Guys is just a lot of fun. The game also has a great social aspect, as you can play with friends or with strangers from around the world.

Overall, Fall Guys is a fantastic game that is well worth the price of admission. It's easy to pick up and play, but it's also challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. The game's mix of platforming and party games is a winning combination, and the bright, colorful graphics and silly sense of humor make it a joy to play. If you're looking for a fun, lighthearted game to play with friends or by yourself, Fall Guys is definitely worth checking out.",1676910775,1676910775,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

? The controls are purposefully a bit clunky, so you end up sliding and bouncing around because of your own momentum, which can be very fun and very frustrating. it's unique

- Wait times and load times between each stage/ level take so SO long to get through. The game is at least 50% looking at loading screens or level previews which can really grind your momentum to a halt, makes playing very tedious

All players are awarded with in-game currency based on their performances. The currency are then used to buy cosmetic items for one's character or name tag from the in-game store, which rotates its merchandise daily. The appearance & vibe of this game is very light-hearted & goofy, but yet the gameplay can become surprisingly frustrating as the little character you control moves as clumsily as a toddler. 

The game is a fun time killer, but I don't think it would hold a gamer's interest for long term, unless that person has a tendency to be a collector, aka: a loot hoarder. This multi-player game, unfortunately, does not support voice or text chat, which is a MAJOR LET-DOWN for any multi-player game. Without friends to group up with & a 3rd party app such as Discord to provide voice chat, your communications with the other 59 random players are limited to the in-game taunt animations, which people tend to ignore. 

If you have friends who already own this game, the purchase will definitely be worth it if you guys play regularly with a 3rd party voice chat app to cheer or heckle each other. Otherwise, the replayability of this game will be dependent on how much of a loot hoarder you are.

Seriously Fall Guys, Y U NO have chat support?!?!?! 

UPDATE: Voice chat among group members have just been added. It still would be nice to have voice chat among team members, not just group members, and text chat among everyone else in the game.",1646598190,1676571348,True,11,2,0.559340119361877441,10,True,False,False
