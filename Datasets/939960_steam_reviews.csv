It is Far Cry but they hired someone from the Division Team i think to work on this game. You can shoot shit in the face and it take 150 rounds from a M60 to kill it. The head shot boxes on animals do not exist, and on actual enemies apparently a pair of BMX goggles can stop sniper rounds to the head. If it is wearing a Motor cycle helmet holy shit that is better then any bullet proof armour i have ever seen. This is supposed to be a post apocalyptic world with stuff nowhere near as good in the old world and these idiots can take 150 rounds to the face. It is lazy programming to say the least. Now granted i am playing on higher difficulty level so i understand the make it harder by buffing health but it is the realm of stupidity in this game. Just be prepared for the frustration of getting owned because you simply do not have enough ammo to kill everything you need to. Oh and they can see you from across the map behind a mountain as well so be ready to be seen by everyone while you cannot target a enemy unless you are up their assess. They also have enemy levels now as well and you cannot perform take downs on said enemies if you do not have the perk for that unlocked. I made that mistake and got killed for it. Whoever thought that 1 up needs a kick to the balls imo. Other then that its a good story that leads on from Far Cry 5 that was well done i havn't finished it yet but it id good so far.

""Far Cry New Dawn"", released in early 2019, is a gem that often goes unnoticed in the vast sea of open-world games. As a standalone sequel to ""Far Cry 5"", it managed to carve out its own unique identity in the franchise while retaining the core elements that fans have come to love. In this in-depth review, I'll explore every facet of this captivating post-apocalyptic adventure.

""New Dawn"" takes place seventeen years after the catastrophic events of ""Far Cry 5"", in a world forever changed by nuclear warfare. The story is set in the vividly crafted Hope County, which has undergone a breathtaking transformation from lush countryside to a vibrant, neon-soaked wasteland. The world-building in New Dawn is nothing short of remarkable; each location tells a story of its own, from the verdant beauty of the lush oasis known as Prosperity to the grim, graffiti-covered remains of a once-thriving city.

The narrative follows the player as the Captain, a silent protagonist, aiding a group of survivors in the fight against the ruthless Highwaymen twins, Mickey and Lou. While the plot may seem somewhat formulaic at times, the unique characters and the evolution of Hope County more than make up for it. The interactions between characters are compelling, and the moral ambiguity of some choices keeps players engaged throughout the game.

At its core, ""New Dawn"" is still unmistakably a Far Cry game, but it introduces several new game-play mechanics that add depth to the experience. The introduction of a tiered weapon system, which uses resources and crafting to upgrade and customize weapons, adds an element of strategy. Scavenging for resources becomes a crucial part of the game, creating a satisfying loop of exploration and combat.

The Expeditions feature is another standout addition, offering players the chance to venture beyond Hope County to exotic locales such as an aircraft carrier or a theme park. These missions break up the open-world exploration, providing fresh challenges and rewarding loot.

The companion system also deserves praise, with unique Guns and Fangs for Hire who bring distinct abilities and personalities to the table. These allies can turn the tide of battle and provide moments of humor and camaraderie.

In terms of visuals, ""Far Cry New Dawn"" is a visual spectacle. The world brims with vibrant colors, lush vegetation, and stunning post-apocalyptic vistas. The neon-infused aesthetic of the Highwaymen's strongholds contrasts brilliantly with the natural beauty of the surroundings. Dynamic weather and day-night cycles add further depth to the visuals, making the world feel alive.

The soundtrack and sound design are equally impressive. The music sets the tone perfectly, whether it's the serene tunes accompanying exploration or the adrenaline-pumping tracks during intense battles. The ambient sounds of a world reclaiming itself after devastation are immersive, pulling players deeper into the experience.

As usual, ""New Dawn"" offers substantial replay value. Once the main story is completed, players can continue to explore Hope County, tackling side missions, hunting for collectibles, and engaging in expeditions. The tiered weapon system encourages experimentation, as does the new game+ mode, which allows you to replay the game with your upgraded weapons and abilities.

Multiplayer and co-op modes are also available, adding even more hours of enjoyment. Whether you prefer solo play or teaming up with friends, ""New Dawn"" always has you covered.

Ultimately, ""Far Cry New Dawn"" is an often overlooked gem in the Far Cry series. Its captivating post-apocalyptic world, engaging characters, and innovative game-play mechanics make it a worthy successor to ""Far Cry 5"". The game successfully blends the familiar Far Cry formula with fresh ideas, resulting in an unforgettable experience. While it may not have garnered as much attention as some other titles in the franchise, ""Far Cry New Dawn"" is a must-play for fans of open-world games and post-apocalyptic settings. Give it a chance, and you'll discover a thrilling and beautifully crafted adventure that's well worth your time.",1694275757,1708991635,True,2,2,0.511755883693695068,0,True,False,False

Lore: 
-In Far Cry 5, the villan was the Father, the leader of a cult.In order to arrest him, you had to get through his familly, which were unique characters(certain references are taken from the Bibile, which is really cool). This whole ideea was original and well executed. Do you know the name of the villains in Far Cry New Dawn? ""THE HIGHWAYMAN"".This is something i would expect to hear in lego ninjago, not in a major ubisoft game.Do you know who leads these HIGHWAYMAN?.TWO BLACK TWINS who have less character development then a MCchicken.
-Remember the cool protagonist from FC5, yeah no they buchered him.They turned him into a mindless slave of the Father, who has 0 lines in the whole game and who has no finale to his plot, exept be a part of the new protagonist's roster.
-All the other characters from FC5 serve no purpose here (lore-wise), like pastore Jerome.
Mechanics:
-Fighting:they are the same(not a bad thing, allthough vehicles are not as fun, cuz you can't really fight with them)
-Healing:This is a problem i have encountered. I ran out of medkits, so i wanted to get some.I wanted to craft them, but after searching for 30 min for the ingredient in the middle of the crafting box, i gave up and searched on google.Google told me that i should look for medkits while doing missions, in order to find them that way, but guess what, I ALLREADY DID ALL OF THE MISSIONS.So i was stuck with 0 medkits.
-Objectives:Half of the objectives in this game are to ""FIND A WAY INTO THIS BUILDING"", with a massive search zone.So that is fun.
Some more bad things that i noticed:
-My sniper riffle does 50% the damage a wood bow does, so that is cool.
-Enemies get 5xlife and 10xdamage increase because they painted their armour? (FR5 had a good explination for this, that being that the cult members were using the bliss).

TLDR; great for the first half of the game. late game most weapons are useless and stealth becomes a cheesefest. most of the companions are dumb as shit, suicidal, or friendly fire the player. and the villains are infuriating to deal with because of their stupidity and railroading.


1: the weapon scaling and stealth scaling are horrible.
headshots with lower tier weapons still instakill higher level enemies.. but only after you destroy their helmet. which has a set amount of hp and is affected by the tier'd damage penalty if your weapon is underleveled.
as a result if you're using the tier 2 LMG on tier 3 enemies. it ends up being a detriment to try and get headshots. their helmets take somewhere between 10 and 15 shots to destroy. which is about as many as it takes to kill them outright with body shots. helmet shots dont deal any damage. so if you hit a mix of body and headshots it results in your headshots dealing 0 damage. and it just feels horrible.

this isnt a huge issue once you get tier 4 weapons as once you do most of the enemies have a reasonable amount of health and the helmets get destroyed in a few shots. but if you're like me and chain missions together back to back without going back to base to upgrade gear. you'll run into this problem during your playthrough and enemies will feel like they're just invincible to headshots. pair that with higher level enemies dealing enough damage to kill you in a few seconds and it gets pretty annoying.

oh. and dont even attempt to use any of the snipers. tier 3 50.cal sniper gets deflected by tier 2 enemy face masks and takes 3 shots to break tier 3 helmets. i didnt bother testing tier 4 enemies with it.
meanwhile the tier 3 bow can one shot tier 3 enemies with body shots for some fucking reason.

the game also feels like it funnels you into the wrath perk really hard if you dont get tier 4 weapons. since unupgraded punches with wrath can legitimately solo any ground mission in the entire game. as long as you're willing to wait in cover to let it recharge.

2: stealth is fucked late game.
Timber is doodoo at marking enemies. so much so that i've been spotted before he spots enemies more than a few times. Timber's range for marking is relatively small. but the big issue is that it seems to be LoS based outside of a very small radius. so your better off marking the entire camp yourself for stealth. marking loot is great. but thats about all he's good for.
and marking the entire camp yourself doesnt work on max tier compounds, because tier 4 enemies are cloaked for some reason? once you mark them their icon is only visible when you have LOS to their head. if they go behind a wall it fades away. this gets really irritating because they also tend to move around a lot, and sometimes have a dog with them. which makes it hard to take them out silently. theres also the fact that they're more or less immune to headshots from anything that isnt the bow and fucking arrow. (i dont mind the bow being good, i mind the bow being the ONLY good stealth weapon in the entire game and it being SO GOOD that you dont even need to get headshots)
The ghost perk from eden's gift also trivialises all stealth. to the point where you can full sprint through open areas and not get spotted. but since it doesnt apply to the 1 or 2 dogs that are in the max tier camps those dogs will spot you from half way across the map and start chasing you around. making it super wierd to actually use. 
once a dog spots you it will chase you and beep loudly. THIS DOES NOT ALERT THE CAMP, but its enough to freak you out the first time it happens. then when the dog SUICIDE BOMBS near you. the camp investigates the explosion. STILL IN STEALTH.

if no dogs are present; ghost mode is overpowered to the point where you can run from person to person doing takedowns as long as they're not 5 feet away from each other facing each other
if dogs are present; its useless because trying to use it like you've been using it will get you spotted by the dog immediately. and you'll probably have to resort to normal stealth anyway.

3: horatio is the only companion.
everyone else in the roster does fine until you start going to maxed out camps. at which point the only 2 that can do anything without immediately dying are gina and horatio. with gina having massive issues actually finding targets, and getting obliterated by flamethrowers. while horatio can litteraly solo an entire god damn max tier camp by infintiely reviving himself. and as long as YOU dont get spotted they wont sound the alarm and IT COUNTS AS AN UNDETECTED CAPTURE.

i could go on for a little while about the companions individually. but the short version is that everyone else in the roster is either too fragile and dies after getting 2 kills (nana), actively commits suicide or kills YOU on a regular bases (jerome, carmina and timber), or has a really slow AI that feels like its conflicting between staying in stealth and shooting back (gina and judge).
just because the PLAYER goes into stealth mid-fight (usually unintentionally). doesnt mean that the AI should immediately try to enter stealth as well and completely disengage from the fight, without actually leaving the fight. resulting in them just fucking standing there getting shot by an m60. (gina does this the worst, but she has the health to tank it so its kind of fine)
the only AI that doesnt do this stealth conflicting thing is horatio, hence: why he ends up having the most success OFFENSIVELY. dispite being labeled as a the tank.


this last point is just me; i dispise the twins as characters. i'm all for an evil villan. but the twins aren't evil. they feel dumb as hell and cocky as hell and theres nothing else to them. one of them is slightly more sane than the other and thats about it. they remind me of middle school bullies and it legitimately made me angry.",1708670587,1708670587,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Let me begin by saying that I played this game completely in coop as I thought it would make for a more fun experience, and [b]oh boy was I wrong.[/b]

Don't get me wrong, me and my friend already played lots of bad games, but this one takes the cake. The experience is so miserable we just couldn't wait for it to finally be over.

Well, I can't really say it's all bad though, the game has one thing going for it, and that's its graphics. They look really nice, very bright, colorful and lively, definitely one of the prettiest in the Far Cry franchise.

However, that's all it really has in its favor, the gameplay is the biggest offender here. Everything has been designed to be as grindy as possible, you need multiple resources to craft pretty much every equipment you need, if that's not bad enough, they also have 3 different levels that you need to upgrade before you can even remotely consider putting a good fight against the enemies. But you can cut down that grind if you are willing to shill out a few bucks for some ""Far Cry Credits"".

Either way, me and my friend pressed on and grinded out the resources to get our characters a chance to fight, and what do we get for it: a few level 4 weapons that can barely kill the most common enemies and, a bunch of useless skills. [i]yay so much fun.[/i]

Now that I mentioned the enemies, they also have levels and what that means is that they will refuse to die unless you have a weapon of a higher level than them. So if you got a level 3 shotgun you can't effectively kill a level 3 enemy. Sometimes they don't even die with a level 4 weapon that deals 1200 damage (this is the maximum ammount of damage you can get without upgrades by the way).

But even then, you might be wondering: [i]""The story must be good right? it's like a selling point for Far cry games"".[/i] Let me tell you that the story is godawful. The two main villains are just annoying, and you don't feel any connection to them like you did to Vaas or any other Far Cry villain.

Anyway, the plot involves you helping to build a base called ""Prosperity"", at no moment I felt compelled to build this base as it's just another way to force you to grind for useless junk. Moving on, after a while you meet with our old pal Joseph Seed from Far Cry 5, but now you are supposed to feel sad for him. Even though we were trying to kill him in the previous game for being a nut job psychopath, but whatever.

I won't spoil the ending here, because I am sure there is someone out there that really cares about the story. What I will tell you though is to stay the hell away from this sorry excuse of a game. Even if you managed to get a few laughs like we did, it's still not worth the time and money.

[b]Just go ahead and buy a good game instead.[/b]",1708552821,1708554016,False,3,0,0.535440027713775635,0,True,False,False

Get on the vehicle? Nah, I'd rather you stand next to it and yell inane nonsense. It's really fun when civilians JUMP IN FRONT of your vehicle - even when you try to dodge them. Difficulty is also a joke. It does not take several mags to take down a cougar regardless of what gun / caliber. Motorcycle helmets do not stop bullets. They do in New Dawn! 0/10.

EDIT:
I almost forgot the invisible fire - great job on that - I love burning alive without knowing it. Well done, Ubisoft! It's also nice when the Ubisoft overlay takes focus of mouse control. It's awesome not being able to use the mouse until I toggle into and then out of your garbage software, Ubisoft!

Further update:
I fell through the map. That was nice.
It also appears my grappling hook is borked. I can attach and climb up but I can't climb up and off.

This game is garbage.

It's not a secret, that ubisoft is the most hated s**tmakers in modern gamedev.

Some time ago, I purchased the only ""alright"" modern ubisoft game, Far Cry 5, and got ""New Dawn"" for free in addition.
So, a few years later, the time has come, and I decided to give it a shot.

Wow, fellas. 
That was shockingly bad.
Absolutely disgusting SJW/woke garbage. 
Like ALL the american/european games nowadays.

First, I wrote a looooooong text describing each and every bad part of this piece of crap, but eventually I changed my mind.
This garbage doesn't deserve that much attention.

Characters - absolute s**t.
Music (sorry for the word ""music"") - f**king horrible, made my ears bleed, modern rap.
Gameplay got cheaper and worse.
0 motivation to do anything for these characters and stay in this game longer. [strike]Just seeing them all dead.[/strike]

The only GOOD things about this game are the beautiful sceneries.

I see some improvements and addition to the gameplay, but with a story and characters as bland as U2 songs, it is nothing more than a completionist's wet dream. I had no interest in uncovering the next plot point apart from the fact that it would cross another objective off the map. It's the type of game that is best enjoyed in the background with a Discord call as the main experience as there are a ton of objectives to complete and items to collect. If you're into that then this could be for you, but for an engaging story you're better off without. 

The puzzles (""treasure hunts"") are quite engaging and fun.

Quick notes as I played:

+Visually impressive; the fauna/flora is dense and beautiful.
+Settlements are fun to conquer, especially so if done undetected.
+Treasure hunts are fun puzzles, akin to climbing towers in earlier Far Cry games.

Thematically it seems a little confused, because you have the Mad Max thing going on with the highwaymen and the Joseph Smith-style cultist who acts as though he's a religious prophet. The aesthetic is really pleasing, though, particularly the use of deep shades of pink and green alongside a world that is both abandoned and strangely blissful. 

This game has microtransactions which are really unncessary since you don't need to access them to get any of the content, but it's very distracting, particularly if you play on the hardest difficulty. The enemy types are split into ""tiers"", so you need higher tier weapons to kill higher tier enemies. At first it's confusing, but after the game becomes strangely puzzle-like as you unlock new things in the most efficient order, it becomes a lot of fun. In the second half if you get the better weapons you can pretty much just churn through everything. 

There's 22 story missions and some other side missions. Some are mandatory because you need to upgrade the home base area to progress the story. The expeditions are actually more fun than the story missions. You get dropped off in a helicopter, run to an area to pick up a package, and escape to a set location to be picked up by the helicopter. You also get the obligatory ""take over the base"" missions, but in this game you have to surrender them to get harder enemies to occupy them to get more ethanol. Ethanol is what you use to upgrade the base and create weapons. You also collect scrap parts, but they're everywhere so you never need to go hunting them down. The crafting system is really quite simplistic. The only thing you need to farm for are these motherboard-looking items but the games gives you them for completing the expeditions so even that doesn't really matter. 

Beyond that you also have perks. You can get points for the perks by completing many optional tasks. There are so many optional tasks that you really don't need to go hunting down the perks. The game gives you way too many points for doing very basic things like freeing citizens that are trapped or hunting certain animals you come across. The open world is actually a lot of fun to explore. There's not really a reason to 100% complete this game since you get everything you need to beat the game by finishing about 75% of the content. 

This game's combat is a lot of fun, and just like the other Far Cry games, there is an emphasis on using stealth to sneak up on enemies to make the fights easier. I really like the parkour aspect. You can grapple up walls, climb ledges, and one of the perks gives you a double jump. Unlocking the right perks early on makes the game a lot easier. There are also a ton of different weapons and it's fun testing them out to find out which ones are the most effective. The saw blade launcher is the most effective weapon against difficult enemies. There's also a stealth pistol that deals exceptional damage.

The game overall is very easy once you know how to play it, but the second-to-last boss fight is very difficult. It took me about a half hour to complete because the AI plays defense and new enemies are constantly being spawned onto the map. It's a bit like Far Cry Primal, where the whole game is easy but the final fight is tough. You also unlock companions who will revive you during some missions. This makes the game way too easy since they will revive you whenever you die, but you die so easily that the game would be way more frustrating if they didn't do this. You can't use them during certain missions, however, so the game still has some very hard parts because of this. 

Overall I really enjoyed this game, but it does feel more like an expansion than a full-fledged Far Cry game. If they would've added in about ten more hours of story content or side missions I'd put it up there with Far Cry 1,2 and Primal as being just plain excellent. I did find the NPCs very annoying, however. At the same time they are some of the most expressive and lifelike NPCs I've seen in a video game so it sort of balances out. The animation and graphics are exquisite, but the audio needed a few additional songs since the game plays the same exact song during every combat sequence.",1706176096,1706176096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some people say this game is underrated. I can't see how. People also say it's just Farcry 5 DLC and in some ways that is true, but I don't think that's why it's bad.

Farcry New Dawn ""reuses"" the Farcry 5 map. However, in practice it's so hard to tell. They changed the map so much you would never know unless someone told you or you look really closely. The map 'feels' completely different. Although Farcry new Dawn is a direct sequel to Farcry 5 so when it comes to the theme, it makes sense. The game isn't priced the same as Farcry 5. It's clearly a spin-off Farcry game rather than a mainline entry and it has quite a lot of content. The problem isn't a LACK of content, but the content itself.

The quests and missions are VERY boring. It feels like they took a lot of player freedom away in how you approach missions. I couldn't even bear finishing this game, I never even really got past the first real section of the game.

The boss fights are just mag dump bullet sponges and that's it. It's boring and not fun. The leveling system is horrible. Gathering materials to upgrade my base was so tedious and boring. If you thought the story would be this game's saving grace, think again. The villains are laughable, even if you didn't compare them to previous Farcry villains.

All in all, there's nothing here to really enjoy. It's clear that Ubisoft experimented with a lot of new ideas for this game. Unfortunately, they were bad ideas, as is typical Ubisoft fashion",1706117581,1706117581,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry New Dawn is a standalone sequel to Far Cry 5, released in 2019. It takes place in the same fictional Hope County, Montana, but years after the events of Far Cry 5. Here are some key aspects of Far Cry New Dawn:

1. [b]Post-Apocalyptic Setting:[/b] Far Cry New Dawn is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Hope County after a nuclear catastrophe known as ""the Collapse."" The game features a vibrant and colorful environment, contrasting the traditional grim and desolate post-apocalyptic landscapes.

2. [b]Continuation of Far Cry 5's Story:[/b] The game continues the narrative of Far Cry 5, exploring the aftermath of the nuclear event and its impact on the world. Players encounter both new and returning characters from the previous game.

3. [b]Twin Villains:[/b] The antagonists in Far Cry New Dawn are Mickey and Lou, twin sisters who lead a group known as the Highwaymen. They are ruthless and unpredictable, providing a new dynamic to the series' tradition of memorable villains.

4. [b]RPG Elements and Expeditions:[/b] Far Cry New Dawn introduces RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade their character and weapons through a progression system. The game also features a new ""Expeditions"" mode, where players can leave Hope County to explore other locations and complete missions.

5. [b]Survival Mechanics:[/b] Players must manage resources, such as ethanol, to upgrade their home base and unlock new abilities. The introduction of a home base, called Prosperity, adds a strategic element to the gameplay.

6. [b]Guns and Vehicles:[/b] The game includes a variety of makeshift weapons and vehicles crafted from salvaged materials, reflecting the post-apocalyptic theme. These weapons and vehicles bring a unique aesthetic to the Far Cry series.

7. [b]Open-World Exploration:[/b] Like its predecessors, Far Cry New Dawn features an open-world environment with various activities and side missions. Players can explore the map, liberate outposts, and engage in dynamic encounters with both human enemies and mutated wildlife.

8. [b]Cooperative Gameplay:[/b] The game supports cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to team up with a friend to tackle the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world together.

While Far Cry New Dawn received positive reviews for its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and continuation of the Far Cry 5 story, some criticized it for recycling elements from its predecessor. However, if you enjoyed Far Cry 5 and are interested in exploring the aftermath of its story in a post-apocalyptic setting, Far Cry New Dawn might be worth checking out.",1706023787,1706023787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The world of Hope County is colourful, neon, crazy but just beautiful. The scenery is gorgeous to look at and I found myself just enjoying the view of the world again and again.

The gameplay is incredibly fun in co-op. It's definitely nothing new, but typical Far Cry Gameplay: You fight your way through the world, conquer outposts, kill masses of enemies and what was particularly great here was the four-level system. Enemies, weapons and vehicles are divided into 4 levels. Killing golden enemies with level 1 weapons is therefore almost impossible. Many players didn't like this. But I thought it was kind of good. Because your character only feels really badass once you unlocked the golden weapons. The whole thing lends the game a certain uphill climb that lasts until the end. The skill tree is also very good (not too much, not too little) and the abilities you get at the end are a nice add-on.

The story is short, but interestingly long enough. There is little blah blah and more boom boom.

I also thought it was great that John Seed comes back in this sequel to Far Cry 5! Well integrated and with his own little story.

The map is a decent size and the fact that there are so many fast travel points makes the game very enjoyable. You don't spend hours travelling around like in other games in the series.

This is my first Far Cry game and I can't wait to play more of them. I can't believe I've waited this long to try this series because I love the gameplay. It also has graphics and the game runs super well. 

The controls, especially on a controller, are super intuitive and it was a really easy game to learn. There's definitely strategies to learn with stealth or going for certain objectives, but it's pretty forgiving if you mess up a mission or die. You're not punished by losing resources or set back super far. It's nice to have a shooter game that balances being challenging and fun well.

Somewhat fun to play
somewhat fun combat and some quests

nice landscapes

Ugly main character (played a female)

Linear treasure hunts, devs did their best to force you to complete them exactly the way they imagined
Stupid main antagonists, they posture and babble around you unarmed and exposed in a situation where you could just reach out and shoot them, if it wasn't scripted otherwise
Very few clothing options, and they are grindy to get

There is a sentiment that this content could have been better suited as downloadable content (DLC) rather than a standalone game. The attempt to differentiate itself from Far Cry 5 while using the same foundation seems to have resulted in a less favorable outcome.

While I approached the game with an open mind, I encountered notable disparities in mechanics when compared to Far Cry 5. Certain restrictions and what seem to be artificial difficulty enhancements, such as inflated enemy levels, were particularly off-putting. Additionally, the absence of features like the arcade and editor, which were enjoyed in previous Far Cry games, was a noticeable omission.

The reload timing proved to be noticeably slow, and character progression felt less in-depth with limited perks. The requirement to purchase base perks before engaging in certain activities, turning the game into what feels like a puzzle, was an unexpected and less enjoyable aspect. It's essential to note that the known controller issue during driving or flying, present in Far Cry 5, remains unaddressed.

In essence, the experience with this installment can be likened to a 'Lite Version' of Far Cry 5, lacking some of the positive elements. My suggestion would be to forego this and instead explore more of Far Cry 5's custom maps for a more satisfying gaming experience.",1590254668,1705714608,False,2,0,0.496580034494400024,0,True,False,False

U get a base of operations called Prospairity. it has a madmax/fallout feel to it. u craft ur own weapons and ammo insted of buying them so even high teir weapons look like they were hodge podged together from scrap and actual parts.

 There is pay to win but its not realy impacting the game provided u have the will to ignor it.
It almost turned me away at first. but i gave it a shot game progress like anyother game pay to win allows u to unlock shit early such as endgame weapons beffor endgame.

The first thing that struck me was the breathtakingly vibrant and unique setting. The game's portrayal of a world recovering from a nuclear catastrophe is both haunting and beautiful. The landscape is filled with stunning hues of pink and purple, creating a surreal atmosphere that kept me mesmerized throughout my entire playthrough.

Gameplay-wise, Far Cry New Dawn offers a seamless blend of intense action and strategic thinking. The introduction of makeshift weapons and vehicles adds a refreshing twist to the familiar Far Cry formula. The Expeditions, in particular, are a brilliant addition, offering diverse environments and challenges beyond the main map.

The characters in the game are memorable and well-developed, each contributing to the overall narrative in their own distinct way. The bond between the player character and the supporting cast adds an emotional layer to the story, making every mission feel personal and impactful.

The game's soundtrack deserves special mention. It perfectly complements the on-screen action, enhancing the overall experience. Whether I was engaged in a fierce firefight or exploring the vast open world, the music added an extra layer of immersion.

Far Cry New Dawn's attention to detail is commendable. From the dynamic weather system to the realistic animal behavior, every aspect of the game world feels meticulously crafted. The result is a game that not only looks stunning but also feels alive and responsive to the player's actions.

In conclusion, Far Cry New Dawn is a triumph in the post-apocalyptic gaming genre. It successfully builds upon the strengths of its predecessors while introducing new elements that keep the experience fresh and exciting. If you're a fan of open-world shooters with a rich narrative and breathtaking visuals, this game is an absolute must-play!",1664672948,1705186711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, after several dozen hours and several years, I finally see what the problems are. It irritates me that Ubisoft chose such interesting worlds to present. The colorful post-apocalyptic world is original and very rare. I can't name more than three games with a similar setting. I like the colors, collecting scrap, loot, but this game is just stupid. A cool idea made without any input. I may be wrong, but there is no sign of any will to do something big here, and there was potential for it. I love the Far Cry series, so it's hard for me to say negative things about these games. The game is not completely prepared for co-op play. The missions get spoiled and are boring, lackluster and undemanding. Poorly done grinding system. The weapon level system is stupid, I don't know who thought it was a good idea. The weapons are already prepared, the silencer, magazine or scope cannot be changed. Literally no casumization, I played with a person who doesn't like weapon skins and that can't be changed either. The silent protagonist. There are a lot of things I like here, for example expanding the base, bringing people to help in the fight, but these people have no soul. If it was like in Dragon Age or Metro, it would be phenomenal. As I said earlier, the pink and purple world after the bomb explosion is beautiful and interesting, but what if the locations don't present anything of themselves? It's nice to walk through the ruined lands from the fifth installment, but if the locations were as plot-driven as in The Witcher, it would make sense. The antagonists are irritating and stupid, maybe because they are women. Fighting these two bitches is tragically embarrassing. And that touching scene at the end, all I want to do is puke. There is a tragedy in the plot, and although it usually turns out positively when someone takes drugs and does some work. Here someone took the wrong drugs and made up shit. And back to Coop, only the host can talk to NPCs and improve the base. When playing as the latter, you have no plot or contact with the characters. The problem with reviews on Steam is that you can only choose that it was great or not great, so the option of descriptive reviews is useful. The game is average, and according to Metacritica one of the worst parts of the series. I used to think that each part was equal, now, after experiencing each of them several times, I conclude that FAR CRY 6 and FAR CRY 3 are the best games in the series. Far Cry needs a rebuild, a phenomenal plot, world and characters to return to absolute heights. It won't be easy, but I would love to see a slightly more serious part with plot dilemmas, a lively and interesting protagonist and antagonist, a full and diverse list of weapons and their parts. Additionally, more different takedown animations. I know that Far Cry is a fun game, we kill our opponents by exploding them and their vehicles. And it would be best to take the best aspects of each Far Cry part and combine them into one game. The Far Cry series needs love and passion, new ideas and a clear plan for itself. Less crocodiles in T-shirts, more showing guerrilla warfare. Far Cry 6 was close, but not there yet. Overall, this sequel and FAR CRY PRIMAL had the potential to be something positive. It turned out bad, the only thing you can see is that Ubisoft wanted to fix the mistakes and FAR CRY 6 already looks very good. To sum up, the game is average, you can have fun with it, but it is also irritating and strange.",1705001118,1705001118,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

So I just finished this game clocking in around a dozen hours. And I gotta say, I liked this one a lot. It is flawed and has some classic Ubisoft problems but overall it is better than the reviews make it out to be.


So what is this game about? Well it plays years after the events of Far Cry 5. You play some random dude or dudedette (your choice). You are on a train and supposed to help rebuild the country with some other people when shit goes south. You get introduced to ""The Twins"", the villains of this story and after a tutorial mission you get set out into the world.

First let me talk about the tone of the game. I know a lot of people didnt like this change but I personally enjoyed the more silly approach that this game takes. This tone is not only reflected in the charakters and world but also in the mechanics. I havent played many Far Cry games but I personally think this silliness works pretty well and I wish they would embrace that more often in future Far Cry games.

Gameplay was where New Dawn really shined for me. It's an FPS with an open world. You got weapons, vehicles, companions and perks to unlock. You do most of that by either spending ressources or doing missions. The gunplay is fine and the vehicles have that Ubisoft jank to it. But it overall works prerry good. Now there is one thing I REALLY liked and I wished the game had embraced even [b]more:[/b] [spoiler] You can get... ""super powers"". I dont know how else to call them. Half way through the game you unlock a certain power that lets you double jump, get a rage mode and other stuff. And I thought that was really cool and fun to use! [/spoiler]

Now the visuals are pretty neat aswell. I like the heavy use of neon-pink mixed in this post apocalyptic setting. It looked very appealing to me. And while there are a lot of copy pasted buildings, the stuff that is unique looks really cool.

In terms of audio I dont have much to say. There are a couple radio tracks to unlock, voice acting is mostly fine and the guns are... well... ok-ish. They lack punch. But they dont sound too horrible. So nothing to write home about really.

For the story... well. Thats a difficult one. It is overall... ok. You can smell the plot miles away and there are some things that I thought were plain stupid. Most of the charakters are also just... ok aswell. Except for a few they were mostly forgettable. 
And I think the weakest part by far are the villains. The Twins. Essentially two sisters with daddy issues. They dont really do much of anything, except showing up to shittalk you and then leave... And their final mission is a bulletsponge slog and just annoying. 
Also the ending was kinda weird and stupid... [b] BEWARE SPOILERS FOR FAR CRY 5 AND NEW DAWN! [/b]: [spoiler]I dont get Joseph Seed's arc... like how... after being responsable for the nuclear destruction of the entire world... it takes the death of his spoiled and power hungry son to realized that maybe, just maybe his views are flawed? And that he might have misinterpreted the ""voice of god"" wrong??? Are you fucking kidding me???[/spoiler]

Overall though the game is pretty cool. I had a lot of fun with it except for the last two missions (2 very bad boss fights). Sure the game has a lot of Ubisoft issues. It is, after all, a DLC for Far Cry 5 being sold as a standalone game. And it shows.  There are a lot of copy & paste environments and missions, micro transactions and the way they did difficulty is... odd... to say the least. Also there are no achievements, which is a shame. [b]BUT[/b] despite all that I still had a lot of fun! Mindless run and gun fun. But still, a lot of fun!

[b]Verdict:[/b]
I bought the game on sale for 11‚Ç¨ bucks and I think I got my fair share of fun with it. If you are looking for a loose and fun FPS (maybe in between some serious story heavy games as some change) to turn your mind off and enjoy some stupid shenanigans? Well, then look no further. Just make sure to buy it only on sale. Because 45‚Ç¨ is way too expensive.


[i] If you've made it this far then thanks for reading!
I hope you have a fantastic day!
Cheers![/i]

I recommend skipping this game entirely, even on a sale. Some people say this game is underrated. I can't see how. People also say it's just FC5 DLC. In a way that is true, but I don't think that's why it's bad. Let me explain.

To address the FC5 DLC stuff. Yes, FCND ""reuses"" the FC5 map. However, in practice it's so hard to tell. They changed the map so much you would never know unless someone told you or you look really closely. The map 'feels' completely different. Also FCND is a direct sequel to FC5 so thematically it makes sense. The game isn't priced the same as FC5. It's clearly a spin-off FC game rather than a mainline entry and it has quite a lot of content. The problem isn't a lack of content, but the content itself.

The quests and missions are very boring. It feels like they took a lot of player freedom away in how you approach missions. Part of the problem is the RPGification of the game. There are tiers of enemies and weapons. Trying to use a Tier 1 weapon on a Tier 4 enemy would basically be impossible. The game tries to add railroads to the open world by placing harder enemies where they don't want you to go until you unlock higher tiers of weapons.

At least, that's how they wanted it to work. FCND retains the one-hit-kill to the head of other FC games. If you have AP rounds you can one-shot every enemy except animals and bosses. This makes the best gun in the game a silenced pistol which isn't even the highest tier. This makes weapon variety nonexistent. On top of this the enemies are very stupid. They feel even dumber than FC5 enemies. I don't think this is actually the case, but due to how much health they have they can survive things they shouldn't be able to which in many cases breaks the AI.

The boss fights are just pure mag dump bullet sponges. Boring and very unfun. The leveling system is horrible. Gathering materials to upgrade my base was so tedious and boring. If you thought the story would be this game's saving grace, think again. The villains are laughable, even if you didn't compare them to previous FC villains.

All in all, there's nothing here to really enjoy. It's clear that Ubisoft experimented with a lot of new ideas for this game. Unfortunately, they were bad ideas.",1704674116,1704674116,False,7,1,0.530240654945373535,0,True,False,False

Far Cry New Dawn is a game that I have fond memories of. I think the game is underrated by people. I can call it a colorful variation of the post-apocalyptic world. The plot of the game is crazy, let's be honest, but I will consider this a feature of the game. The plot is strange, predictable in places, but at the same time quite specific. Like fun and absurd.
A beautiful, bright, colorful open world. The weapon crafting system may not appeal to everyone, because in order to have enjoy playing, you need to loot a lot. I love to loot, so the game was satisfying for me and in the style of ""one headshot one kill"", which I love.
I personally really like the soundtrack in this game, it stuck in my memory. The radio in the game is really nice to listen to, although after a while the tracks start to repeat and it starts to get a little boring.
Much of the credit for the Far Cry New Dawn goes to Far Cry 5. Therefore, to enjoy this game, you need to complete the last part. Having completed Far Cry 5, it will be much more enjoyable to play this part. So you better go ahead and buy Far Cry 5 + New Dawn Bundle.

+ upgrading system for gun damage
- they simply removed gun customization.
- side quest are boring like all other ubisoft game's.

If Far Cry 5 was the black sheep of the franchise, Far Cry New Dawn is the redheaded step-child. I've seen a lot of complaints about the changes New Dawn makes to the Far Cry formula, including the RPG elements sprinkled in. Here's an overview:

Some of the base gameplay systems have gotten an overhaul. Outposts can now be scavenged to allow enemies to take them back, which then allows you to attempt to retake them at a higher difficulty. Weapons now also have an explicit rank, indicating which corresponding enemy ranks they are effective against. For example, a level 3 AK-47 will shred through any level 3 or below enemies, but a level 2 AK will give you a harder time. I've seen some complaints about these RPG-ification elements, and while personally I dont mind, if you do care about them, it might be worth your time to think carefully about picking this game up.
Personally I think the changes are fine. Retaking the outposts can be annoying since you can't discern the alarm towers ahead of time, and Ethanol is probably too scarce, but I managed to get the most important upgrades before taking on the final bosses. There were only a couple times where I needed to go scavenge items to craft a weapon I felt I needed.

The story is a bit hit or miss. The antagonists aren't particularly charming, and I feel like the previous game presented the taunts from the antagonists better. It also feels like the 4 of Far Cry 5 are better fleshed out than personality and lore-wise than New Dawn's twins. I sincerely cannot tell the two apart.

Additionally, the game plays upon the assumptions you had from the previous game. You're sat there listening to the story and at some point are presented the following thesis: What if Joseph Seed was right all along? You already get a sense of that at the end of Far Cry 5, but here it really challenges your notion of wrong and right, and if the ends justify the means. What is God's plan, actually? Was it good to have mowed down Joseph's siblings in the previous game? Do the ends justify the means? There are interesting questions here, and no clear answers.

The environments are just as beautiful as before, with some pinks and purples sprinkled about to spice things up. Clearly the environment team worked hard on this version of Hope County, even if it feels like they stopped talking to the environment team for Far Cry 5 about halfway through development.

The Guns for Hire mechanic returns, although you can no longer have two at a time. The roster is well balanced, and I didn't feel like I wish I had a companion from Far Cry 5. I did however, have an issue with one of the missions to recruit a GFH.

One of the worst missions I've ever played has to be the mission to recruit Gina: ""Mo' Mommies Mo' Problems"". An absolute nightmare of RNG hoping that she and the AI enemies don't ram into random explosive barrels, failing the mission. Just awful, took me legitimately 20 tries to kill all the enemies before Gina's car randomly explodes. Including the time the mission bugged out after killing all the enemies and just soft locked itself. Very frustrating, but luckily this is optional, and the only mission I really had a problem with throughout the game.

Another thing to mention are the map changes. Not sure entirely, but the map feels smaller than in Far Cry 5. The outpost count is significantly reduced, and a good portion of the map (The North) goes unused except for in 2 missions. This is explained away in the story as the dam having burst during the collapse, flooding the surrounding lowlands. In addition to that, the area is covered in Bliss, making passage impossible except for a select few.

The music selection is... fine. Nothing too special, a couple oldie hits here and there, with some odd choices from the late 2010's added for good measure.

Overall the game is fine. It serves as a good followup to Far Cry 5, and thematically feels more like a less buggy Fallout game than it does a Far Cry game. Is it worth the face value of $40? Hard to say, I'm sure I've paid more for worse. Is it worth picking up on sale? If you're a fan of Far Cry, definitely. If you're disappointed with Fallout 76, this is a good post-apocalyptic alternative. For everyone else, I understand if you chose to skip this one, but I definitely think it's worth a playthrough. I powered through in only 17 hours and had fun, for the most part.

 A downgrade of Far Cry 5, full of political messages (female supremacy, misandry, anti-Christian, anti-human...). 

 The trademark Far Cry gameplay is still there, but the downgrade with weapon and enemy levels alone takes away from the game. If you take this into account weapon selection is probably the worst in any other Far Cry game that I‚Äôve played so far. Despite its strong anti-Christian message, Far Cry 5 was still massively better in terms of gameplay.

 As with the other Far Cry games, the story is short and terrible (high school project level). In fact New Dawn seems to have the shortest and worst story so far (compared to FC 2, 3, 5 and primal). The nice upgrade system for weapons from Far Cry 5 has been removed and instead we have mostly butt ugly weapons made of junk that we can't customize, only upgrade their damage. There's also some level system where lower level weapons are handicapped against higher level enemies. With enough resources you can upgrade weapons to have whatever damage you want, apparently. I've upgraded a bow with 1200 damage points to 3000 and killed almost anything with one shot... 

 I don't have many words for the story as it made me cringe so hard I had to reset my face with a hammer. To add to it, there are obvious political comments and gameplay elements relating to real world politics and ideologies. I don't want real life politics in a game that is not about politics. Even if uplay (ubistoft launcher for their games) wasn't as bad as it is (an update of uplay deleted my Far Cry 5 saves), this game has left me with such a bad taste that I am not even considering buying Far Cry 6, or any other ubisoft game, ever again.

i love every farcry game, i have 29 hours in farcry 3, 60+ in farcry 4, and 400+ hours in farcry 5 and counting, and like 60+hours in farcry 6. this game is the only exception, just a genuinely bad sequal to a great farcry entry, this should of been some kind of dlc instead

gunplay is not fun
every enemy is a bullet sponge, even more than fc6
pushes you into buying dlc
story is okay but is lacking compared to farcry 5
map is barely even the same, most of jacob's region is entirely empty and inaccessible 
they tried doing a sad backstory for the villains but it is really bad and makes no sense its literally ""my dad was abusive so its okay that me and my twin murder and enslave people""

On one hand running around the world exploring things is pretty fun, the gun play feels fine, and overall I do think it's enjoyable both alone or with friends. Definitely a better experience with friends though because the friendly A.I. that can accompany you are pretty on the slow side. Also it looks good overall, I never had something out of the ordinary or a texture glitch through my whole play time so I'll take it. Nearing the end you also get some fun things that make the game extremely enjoyable so take that for what you will. 

Also being able to fish from the shore line and watching my pet dog rip a guy's throat out on the other-side of the river is a big positive, Love Timber and Nana, good A.I. friends. Hurks almost there but I swear they gave him the least brain cells because it's Hurk so he's definitely on some spectrum. 

Also I promise blowing people up mid cut scene may be the funniest thing I've seen in quite some time, this game cannot process that properly so it may break the game entirely, be careful. 

On the other hand grappling is still broken, your companions are almost worthless a lot of the time alone, and when you finally get around to finishing the story it's nothing remarkable. Villains seen before, stories already told, and really meh melo drama nearing the end will turn ya off from the main story. I've played it before on Xbox with another friend and the story really leaves you with nothing. Also repeating outposts is kinda lazy design so they wouldn't have to make any more, gotta play each one three times? So you put a marker of 30 outposts that need to be done? Lazy. Just like reusing the same map from far cry 5. It may be cool exploring key sections of the previous games areas after the bombs fall but uh, it's also lazy too bub sorry. 

Also asides from the licensed music used for certain mission segments throughout the game, the radio's gonna have a bunch of this weird techno crap? It sure fits with the highwaymen since they're a bunch of buffoons anyways but having to listen to it's gonna get old fast. Music may be subjective, but this stuff is crap. Bring back the 80's please I was born in the wrong musical era....

This games, weird....rating it feels wrong because it feels like a perfect middle of the road game that gets really fun when your not playing the main story. Just, a game that exists if you will. If I could pick a middle option I would but because I feel the game does enough good to not be worthless it's a thumbs up.

I caught it on a Black Friday sale and bought it after having looked at it a few times before. Honestly what grabbed my attention was the graphics with all the bright colors and the post apocalyptic look the game gave off. I have to be honest as well that first person shooter games aren't really my forte because I really suck at the whole run and gun ordeal. However it did offer quite a few times in the game where I was able to scope out an area and make my plan of attack which this I was able to excel in far more easily. There are parts of the game where it involves some problem solving skills and you to complete some puzzles to complete a task which I loved this part of the game.

 There are some great guns for hire that make going on some of the missions far more easier. Gina in my opinion really gets MVP in this department, Timber easily takes MVP in the treasure hunt department. After maxing out all of Timber's skills by gaining his 40 kills Timber is able to tag and highlight where the treasure locations are which makes it super easy to find and collect everything! Horatio is quite a force to be reckoned with when heat really starts surrounding you from enemy attacks. His fury skill makes him a total tank and being able to revive himself as well is another amazing perk that is very handy. Carmina is great starting as someone to start out with and honestly I found myself sticking with her until I managed to get Gina. Pastor Jerome is okay but until he manages to unlock all 3 of his skill perks isn't the greatest to take with you when you are liberating an outpost, Carmina is a much better choice until unlocking Gina. Even after getting all of Pastor Jerome's skills unlocked I still didn't find myself using him really that often. I'm sure Granny probably would have been a good gun for hire as well but sadly she was the only one I was unable to unlock because I was unable to complete the sharp shooter test in the allocated time. All in all I was able to complete the game in about 80 hours (of course this was taking my time, doing tons of exploring, fishing, collecting all of the treasure, the only thing I didn't finish was the getting granny, and all of the expeditions along with  maxing all of the facilities, collecting all of the photographs and tape players) with my guns for hire only being level 3. All of the side missions, main missions, and treasure quests were completed. 

From a non biased standpoint I don't see why this game gets as much hate as it does. The graphics and colors are beautiful, the game in my opinion was truly a lot of fun. There were plenty of interesting characters in the game, and being a x box controller user on my pc I can say that the controls were very easy to learn and use. I only had a couple times where the sound of my game would start to lag with kind of a skip but this was quickly resolved with a simple restart of my computer and the game. I'm not sure if the issues stemmed from the game itself as I had no sound quality issues running anything else from my pc or if it was from my pc...either way it was a pretty quick and simple fix. 

I would definitely recommend this game if you're someone that is into story based games, first person shooter, open world, exploration, or even just post apocalyptic settings. From the gathering of my knowledge while playing this game playing this is evidently a sequel to Far Cry 5 so I would probably play that game first.

Game is alright. 

The main villain are boring and were not interesting at all. The backstory of the villain should have been shown early on in the game and this would explain their motivation. 

The map is good and attractive to look at and I liked the crafting and the looting. It incentivised me to go get materials. The expeditions are a very good addition to the game. The weapons are designed very well but I wish that Ubisoft Montreal would have made the feeling of the higher level sniper, ak, smg different from the lower level sniper, ak, smg. 

Gameplay is the same as the older Far Cry games. Nothing wrong with that. The chaos is fun. 

Story is really, really bland.

Side characters were not as interesting as the characters from Far Cry 5. Putting Joseph Seed as a side character that appeared maybe 5 times in the story was bland. It would've been sick if he could be put as the Roster with Eden Powers. It would have made the story better and it is innovative.

Overall, I can't recommend this game. This game had the potential to be as great as Far Cry 5.",1703660773,1703660773,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise it's the most pleasant and addictive Far Cry I've played, I sat and played these 20h throughout 3 days. Yet, I understand why it got so much hate on a release.
The map is small and mostly recycled from Far Cry 5 which is a prequel to this title. There are even Joseph Seed and Eden followers in New Dawn.
The twin sisters are good antagonists although cliche as f*ck, but every time they appear on a screen some interesting things happen.
I liked the RPG-ish system implemented here. Enemies can be on four different levels of difficulty and you won't do much to them If your weapon is underleveled. On the other hand If you already obtained super powerful weapons the enemies on lower levels are laughably easy to bear.
Some people may say this system is unnecessary, but I personally really liked that possibility to gear yourself as fat as possible and feel like a super fast killing machine.
There is just a tiny bit of grinding to achieve this, but the gameplay - as said above - is very pleasant, so conquering outposts or participating in events that get you resources was actually delightful.

Ah... and the world completely doesn't feel like post-apo. They have everything, clothes, weapons, cars, food, water, electricity is running everywhere. A few mutated animals and ruins don't do much to the overall narrative.

Far Cry New Dawn is a short, but well packed piece of a game. Story and gameplay are very easy going. Crafting better equipment and gathering stuff to upgrade our base makes it addictive.

If you're like me and just consider the new Far Cry game to be like the new version of FIFA: the same game you've always liked with just a few tweaks, then you'll be right at home. If you're hoping that there will be another major leap like 1 to 2, or 2 to 3, you'll be disappointed. This is basically another incremental change to FC3. The shooting feels good. Being the apex predator feels awesome. The tacked on RPG mechanics suck. The villains aren't terrible, but their presentation and the story sucks. Further degraded by the fact that the game constantly forces you to give up your weapons, watch terrible things play out to your friends, then get captured/beat up in first-person cutscenes, knowing full well you'd be more than capable of ending the game's conflict in the first 30 minutes if the game would just give you control.

But cobbling together improvised post-apocalyptic weapons, setting traps, and tearing through unsuspecting bandits is rad as hell. I also really dig the aesthetic. Just hanging out in the world is fun. Seeing how the characters have progressed since FC5 is also pretty cool (other than one major spoilery thing that kinda retroactively ruins FC5).

Chances are, you already know if you like this game. If you've gotten bored with Far Cry, this is not gonna change your mind. If you're still having fun with the formula and just want a new map with new weapons, you'll have a good time.",1702652565,1702652565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They switched to this really weird leveled combat system which, just sucks, all the enemies have levels 1 to 3 and Elites. And they have hitpoint bars like in Borderlands.

These levels are also reflected on the weapons. If the gun play is going to be crappy like in Far Cry 5 I at least want to use my favorite gun that looks the coolest. In New Dawn you cannot have that. In Far Cry 5 I stomached the gun play cause I could use whatever gun I wanted to, and could customize it with my silly little skins and attachments how I wanted it and it didn't matter cause all the enemies die in a single head shot. 

Not the case this time around, in New Dawn the main difference between the levels of the enemies is it gets harder to hit them in the head, Level 1's have no head protection, Level 2's have a face shield, and level 3's have a full helmet so just can't tap them in the head anymore. Level 1 weapons do PATHETIC damage to Level 2 enemies, and vis versa level 2 to 3. Not all guns can be each level, so I can no longer use the guns I liked using in Far Cry 5 in the end game of New Dawn because they're not Level 3.

Why this game even bothered making ""crafting"" your weapons a selling point, because you really don't craft your weapons you basically just buy them for resources, they're ugly, even from a post-apocalyptic design prospective. A screwdriver as a bayonet? You SERIOUSLY couldn't find a knife??? You cannot change the weapons attachments or anything about them besides upgrading them with resources to be more powerful. 

And no you cannot make a weapon that is level 2 good against level 3 enemies, you CAN infinitely upgrade a weapon but the sheer resource and time investment to make your level 2 weapon good against level 3 enemies just isn't worth it.. 

The Expeditions were cool, loved them, they're unique and probably the freshest breath of air from this game. 

If this game had the weapon customization and gun play from Far Cry 5 I probably wouldn't hate it. But why they chose this weird borderlands style for this game was just confusing and it feels like they seriously stripped away a lot of the individuality from you the player. Also not to mention the story itself, it's weird and doesn't make a lot of sense that Eden's Gate decided to become cavemen, and now are good guys, and all the magic ooga booga stuff. I feel like it could have been written and designed better, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder in that regard.

The game reuses the map and is basically made out of Far Cry 5 assets, I have even found props floating around they forgot to delete when editing the Far Cry 5 map. (Which in this game is like 1 third smaller). I personally don't mind a recycled sequel.

I don't mind a recycled game if it does a good job closing it's predecessor. But it just feels like they removed so much, from quality of life to content from Far Cry 5 that it's like, why was this even a game and not just DLC for Far Cry 5...",1702215331,1702215331,False,28,3,0.677717506885528564,3,True,False,False

This Farcry game makes me want to actually cry at how poorly created it is. Poor story, and on a technical level (the programming etc.) is also very poorly done. I think the worst example of poorly implemented RPG elements is putting a full magazine from a lvl 1 LMG into a static (buggy) lvl 3 enemy and not having them drop -  that's nearly 50 rounds. I had a Wolverine take an entire mag from a Kriss Vector. I can only suspend belief so much. How many direct hits from an RPG does it take to drop a human? If you think one, then you're in for a shocking surprise!

I wont even get into the two most insufferable boss characters I've ever come across.

The gun play and vehicular interaction are both satisfying & combat is challenging enough on hardest difficulty to still feel rewarding. The engine is stable & runs fine with very few bugs. The usual hilarious npc routing, dialogue & physics abound.

I am incredibly disappointed however that main questline has the player bash several dogs to death in order to progress the story. Dogs in the overworld can be dealt with at the players discretion, but for this quest its beat down these doggos or the story stops dead. Highly tone deaf of Ubisoft, no surprises there really. This cowardly roleplay rests squarely on the heads of the project leads.

The exact same issue is present in the arena questline.

- Resource collection, crafting, upgrades & progression system feel the best of any Far Cry game so far. Gathering resources actually feels like a useful activity, and you can keep upgrading your character perks and guns, seemingly forever
- An upgradeable homebase is always a good idea. It was a throwback to Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal 
- Expeditions are a very fun new type of mode. I really enjoyed these, and the gameplay is much better than the regular overworld outposts. I only didn't like not being able to run 3 star difficulty straight away. It felt a bit boring to HAVE to play the lower difficulties first
- It's cool visiting locations and characters from FC5 and seeing all the changes. This game should probably have been a FC5 expansion
- Amazing Graphics
- Amazing Sound Design
- Similar to FC5, very great gunplay
- There's automatic health regen now. Much appreciated
- The lore pages. They're probably not as appreciated as they should be. They always tell interesting stories or give you useful hints, often related to environmental storytelling, enemies, or some gameplay mechanic present right there. As a dev myself I was inspired reading these.

[h1]The meh[/h1]
- Weird Microtransactions. They didn't need to be in this game, it makes it all feel like a mobile title. At least they are optional and not too intrusive
- No Far Cry arcade. It wasn't expected, but would have been nice
- Ability to play coop, but no matchmaking. Feels a bit useless.

- The villains are horribly written. They're boring. They're not interesting. They're barely present. They're not memorable. It's a shame because every Far Cry game prior to this had villains ranging from at least somewhat interesting to just incredible.
- Unlike FC5 there is no weapon attachment or weapon skin system. I missed it.
- Outposts are incredibly boring compared to FC5, and just like the expeditions require you to grind through lower difficulties before getting to the higher ones. Once you do play higher level outposts, the enemies are on ridiculous alertness levels, with the entire camp being alerted instantly even by your silenced shot from 10km away. I did manage to 3 star everything, but it was just plain annoying and incongruent with the rest of the game to have these outrageous AI pawn perceptions, and a mandatory low difficulty playthrough grind to go through.
- No quest unlocks after freeing outposts. Barely any dialogue variety or dialogue progression throughout all of the game. It's a step down from FC5. I'd say there are even very few quests in this game in general
- Just as the Living World activities seemed to have dialed back a bit on FC5, on this game they went back in the wrong direction. There's always enemies, loot goblins, care package drops, trucks that need capturing, hostages that need freeing, everywhere at every time. It doesn't matter what you're doing, it doesn't matter whether or not you've freed the nearby outposts. It's too much. You can never catch a break. 
- The hostage trucks seemed to be just broken in this game. Either I couldn't damage the driver cause of its weird spawning and driving pattern, or I could, but instantly killed the hostage as well with my single bullet. 
- Guns for hire are just terrible in this game. You can only have 1 instead of the 2 on FC5, and the one you do get is utterly useless in combat, even after max upgrades. It's a shame because in FC5 they were actually somewhat useful to have by your side (at least in singleplayer)",1701030874,1701031160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry, which was known for so much immersive storylines and eye grazing environment, now lies in a gravestone, with New Dawn adding extra depth to it. New Dawn is what should have been an Add-On for the Far Cry 5 game, and not a standalone game in itself. The game could have been the Resident Evil 7 for the series, but it chose to ignore everything. A game with no valid storyline, the characters are lifeless, using the same places with a little makeover, the gameplay itself is very non-immersive. I usually play and complete all the Far Cry games, even replay them again and again, this one however I was not able to complete, and left it in about 60% completion. I'm really dissapointed in this game. People say Far Cry 5 being the weakest Far Cry, I agree yes but atleast the game had good story and it was realistic.

The game is beautiful and really is a perfect extension to FC5.

I just bought this yesterday and did all Ubisoft wanted me to do and then, 15 hours into the game it crashed. When I was able to launch the game again, I CANNOT GET BACK INTO MY UBISOFT ACCOUNT! I reset the password link they emailed me and now Ubisoft Connect is telling me that it cannot verify my ownership of the game!

*EDIT*
Sadly, I liked the game enough to buy it a second time, while hopefully, Ubisoft gets its act together, and its the standard version for less, just so I could finish it and leave a fair review. I requested a refund for the original purchase of this game, since, Ubisoft Connect screwed something up and made it inaccessible. Of course, Steam declined, they don't even read the notes, just seeing that it has been played for more than 2 hours is enough for them to wash their hands of it. Anyway, I removed it from my account, bought the downgraded standard version and activated it with Ubisoft Connect using a 13 year old account. That's right, the one I created new when I bought the game got obliterated but the one they should have deleted years ago bc of non-use is the one that works (HACKS!!) Now, I can't find the original version of this game in my library, but, the review of it is still here - that's right, you're reading the review I left for the game that I lost access to, and, not in my library, yet, the review remains! Crazy!! 
I finished the main story line and I actually enjoyed the game itself. At least the developers at Ubisoft seem to know what they're doing. I'll be sure to update again or maybe even delete this review and post a more positive one in the future.

+Nice graphic
+Good optimization
+Interesting story

Cons:
-Weapons are extremely limited in customization and you get the pre-made weapon that you need to unlock some tier first, and then get some resources to craft. 
-Resources are a challenge to find, but it's a useless chore. (illusion of content)
-Small bugs here and there, like getting stuck after character's death.
-Some games are like pea shooter. You shot tons of bullets into the animals and they are not dead.
-Enemies have tier: the higher their tiers, the harder they are. If you dont have stealth skill to kill that high leveled tier, YOU CANNOT STEALTH KILL IT.",1675179233,1700710207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The time it takes to finish this game is possibly the same duration you would spend on Far Cry 3 or Blood Dragon. The game-play is the same as Far Cry 5 but a little bit more simplified for quick uncomplicated enjoyment.

[h2][b]Let's start with the bad things: [/b] [/h2]
FC: New Dawn is a smaller game than FC:5 and of course it shows, the map is a lot smaller (which isn't really a problem) where it does show tho is in the number of bugs present in the game. There's a lot of annoying issues plaguing the game, in my time playing it ive found stuff like enemies getting stuck inside rocks on cliffs (They can shoot you, but there's no way for you to shoot them). Vehicles despawn EXTREMELY fast when left alone, it reminds me of GTA Vice City in the ps2 where you would just turn around and the car you've been driving for the last 10 minutes just despawns. 
Also overall, the AI is very very dumb compared to FC5. 
My other gripe with this game is how badly designed the ""rpg elements"" are into the game. 
Enemies in this game have a health bar and a level that goes from 1 to 4 (or ""elite""). Just like in Far cry 5, the world becomes harsher as you progress trough the story, the regular enemies that wander the world become progressively a higher level, and they become harder to kill, have better weapons and wear better armor. To counteract this, the player has to engage in the open world content and side activities to grind for materials and Ethanol to upgrade a their homebase in order to unlock progressively higher level weapons and vehicles. 
The problem with this system is that you can basically just grind out materials, upgrade EVERYTHING and then just tackle the story missions with overpowered gear, making any sense of challenge just evaporate. That leads to a feeling of disconnect between what's going on with the missions and the current state of the world, since you'll be oneshotting everything with lvl 4 weapons while the enemies are stuck in level 1 or 2. It honestly feels so disconnected it takes away a lot of the fun (at least for me). 
While we're on that topic, the amount of microtransactions that are possible in this game are just laughable. You can buy materials, weapons, vehicles, outfits. But thankfully you can just unlock everything just by playing, and grinding materials doesn't really take much time at all, they are very generous with the amount of stuff there is to loot in the world. 
Finally, the story is, in parts very very weak (not to mention super short). The twins as villains are just awful, not fleshed out at all and you only get to see them like 3 times and they're annoying more than anything, and the whole ""prosperity"" story just feels like it goes nowhere, it doesnt really feel like the settlement is progressing nor that the people there is going anywhere. Spoilers for the ending: [spoiler]Also, deciding the fate of the twins and joseph  feels very impactless and the ending doesnt feel rewarding at all. [/spoiler]

[h2] [b] Now, onto the good things: [/b] [/h2]

[h3] The map [/h3]
While the map is small and shares the same layout with far cry 5, a LOT of care has been put into the vegetation, and to what happened to every building that was there in all these years since the apocalypse happened. Every landmark has a past, a lot of details, visual storytelling through the environment and written notes about what has happened there. Just exploring was a lot of fun in this game overall. The lighting is on point all over this game, its overall a very beautiful game to look at.
While the open world activities are very few (it's basically just capturing strongholds) they're very fun to do and the difficulty ramps up pretty nicely with the ranks. 

[h3]Expeditions [/h3]
This is a feature that i mostly overlooked when i bought the game but ended up being my favourite.  They consist of a total of 7 maps where you have to find and extract a backpack, and survive until a helicopter arrives to get you outta there. 
The maps themselves are very high quality, well thought out and have very interesting themes attached to them (An abandoned british aircraft carrier, a crashed space station and literally alcatraz, just to name a few ). These are pretty difficult and offer quite a lot of replayability since you can do them multiple times with increasing difficulty and very good rewards attached to them.

[h3]Story[/h3]
While the story is very short and very weak at parts, there's also a subplot where we explore what happened to the cult of eden's gate after the apocalypse, how their beliefs have changed (or not) and what/where Joseph has been up to all this time. There's a lot of supernatural stuff going on, and I wish there was more story focused on this part of the plot (but the story is very short overall). You get to meet a lot of characters from the previous game and get closure as what to what their fate has been in the apocalypse. Spoilers for the story: [spoiler] You even get to see what happened to the main character of far cry 5. [/spoiler]

Overall, I believe the bad stuff and the good stuff at the end just balances out and this ends up being a pretty nice experience, it's like watching a mediocre action movie on the TV in a rainy saturday afternoon, its a rewarding experience even if its not the best Far Cry nor the best game overall.",1700423250,1700423250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To simplify . this game DOES NOT feel like a direct sequel to FC5 . 

The good:

-The music is really good. 

-the neon lights and paints look cool and give it a fresh look.

-Enemies are much smarter and operate several different tools like mortars , rockets and more.

-The enemies are cool I suppose.

-Companions are fun., . Carmina Rye is the toughest 17 year old girl i've met and you are usually happy to have her by your side,But the star of the companions is the pig . that little guy is a true clutch hero by self ressing and the rezing you it can save you from a wipe and the Sniper grandma that makes up for stealthly clearing out bases a breeze. as long as you are not in active combat Nany (the mentioned grandma) will clear up everyone without raising an alarm even in hard mode.Gina (the former Highwaywoman is a beast as a commando and will probably save your beacon more than once. The dog can be useful too, the little rascal saved me from a few chaotic expeditions .memorable mentions as useless companions: The judge for not killing absolutely anything,and being mute , Jurk Drubman Jr for dying all the time, hardly killing anything and having annoyign diologues and Pastor Jerome for setting himself and you on fire ..

-Difficult setting is really difficult, they are not pulling their punches here. the enemies will not miss and being discovered by the enemy and the alarm triggered is truly terrifying as enemies are really tough.

The bad:

The game does not feel like a sequel. like the cult is not even as evil anymore. they removed the several layers deep plot from the first one and they simplified it with ""bad guys vs good guys"" ""gangs vs civilians"" the story was overly simplified and it is not as deep or terrifying as FC5 as the main villains are your typical bad girls antagonist mad max style. it no longer explores the dangers of extreme cultism and far right which was the plot of the first one. it feels like a whole different director said ""naw, far right is cool ! it is the criminals that you need to be afraid of""

-enemies are divided by normal, rare, epic and elite . and if you are shooting bullets at an elite enemy with blue weapons you may as well hit them with your fist .this artificial gate keeping takes away from the original far cries and it turns it more into ""The Divison"" where  heavily armored enemies and even animals are hard to take down unless you have the right weapons.

-companions can be pretty stupid. not moving out of the way of incoming mortars or just standing there in the open facing 5 enemies at the same time while you are running away. ressing companions costs resources now which makes it suck more as their stupidity is costing you .

-The world could had been set a bit more apocalyptic ,people drive cars and even helicopters as if fuel is not an issue. you would think people should be riding horse instead , There is plenty of ammunition so no need to use more improv weapons like saw launchers or bows and arrows .Speaking of which:

-Bows are different now as enemies are armored . so even though arrows hit harder than bullets (imagine that) they dont have armor piercing arrows so hitting an elite with an arrow will result in them running to sound the alarm ,silenced weapons is better in every way.

-Tons of grinding to upgrade your base.


summary: I feel like this game is the last jedi of far cry 5 . it completely re-writes the story of the first one (fc5) and you feel like you are playing something else completely. it is like the director that took over this expansion did not get the point of the first one.The director of the second sequel (spoiler ahead) implied Joseph Seed to be an actual profet and not a crazy far right extremist .Never mind him condoning torturing, brain washing, drugging and dispossing of people (angels) like trash.It just does not make any sense at all.

Unless you are really hungry for a FC game (that does not even feel like it) I would skip. or even better. play FC6 instead.

This Game as a spin-off did good job. But we excepted more, The story was so simple and didn't have anything special in its sleeves, it wasn't so fine by me, If you are a Farcry fan and have played other games of this franchise you must know that Farcry games are known by their weird story! especially in Farcry 3.
But as I said before it's just a spin-off and it only tries to complete the uncompleted things on Farcry 5.
So we're not gonna take it seriously.

The outfit set and vehicles weren't worth it either. 

On it's own, New Dawn is alright. It's 5 with a new look, and by new look I mean pinkness. 
Now don't get me wrong, I do have to say I like the vibrant colour choice, rather than the often used boring looking apocalyptic colour set (brown, brownish green, grey etc), but otherwise It's not really impressive looking.
As for gameplay, again, it's mostly like 5 with some changes. The first change is no weapon customization.
Which I find lame because, even tho the weapon customization is very limited (literally just a sight/scope, silencer and extended magazine), it atleast allowed me use a gun I liked, with or without a silencer, with a sight I prefered, and uh, with extra bullets. 
The second change is RPG elements. Instead of enemies being the same, with or without armour, with or without an LMG or flamethrower, they're now in tiers. 
1st tier: Grey, 1 bar of health, no armour, Low damage weaponry.
2nd tier: Blue, 2 bars of health, tiny bit of armour (prolly just cosmetic), Medium damage weaponry.
3rd tier: Purple, 3 bars of health, armoured, High damage weaponry.
Elite tier: Gold, 4 bars of health, heavily armoured, High damage weaponry.
This change is, interesting, but personally I don't like it. Doesn't fit Far Cry in my opinion. (Weapons are also in tiers btw)
Third change is, well It's... [spoiler]magical I suppose you can say.[/spoiler]

I had fun just like in 5, but with the limited replayablity [spoiler](no new game+, story isn't as interesting imo, taking over the same outposts over and over again for more diesel isn't fun, especially since the difficulty gets higher until it hits elite and you need to start using armour-piercing rounds, unless you got the perk that allows you to take em down, no far cry arcade ;c)[/spoiler] I don't really think it was worth it.

Just like my Far Cry 5 review, everything's the same.

There are audio issues when you change your devices as well, because the game doesn't play any audio at all if you change any devices right in between the game.

Overall the game is an interesting continuation of Far Cry 5 and I do recommend getting on a sale just keep in mind it feels more like a ""DLC"" rather than a standalone game.

Pros:
- Performance was very good on max
- Beautiful graphics; more vibrant than Far Cry 5
- Base upgrading and weapon crating/upgrade
- Interesting story to wrap up Far Cry 5 and some old characters are back
- The guy at base with the Guitar! Amazing songs, just wish there was a function to sit on the damn bench
- Music
- Pet dogs :)

Neutral:
- Story was nice and interesting but still felt that it could have been further expanded
- Gameplay flow is almost the same as previous titles
- Not much weapon variety but there are some new interesting weapons
- Expenditions, although being a nice addon they are too few and they are just there to gather resources and make game ""feel"" bigger
- Perks are just okay, but it could have used some more unique perks instead of just upgrading the old ones half of the time
- Characters feel plain and not memorable; Except for guitar guy and doggy :)

Cons:
- Feels more like a DLC to Far Cry 5 than a standalone game
- Some characters from Far Cry 5 just disappeared without wrapping them up
- No steam achievements
- Requires Ubisoft launcher
- Although having a ""base"" feels nice, it doesn't do anything apart from upgrading some buildings. They could have added raids or other events or some more freedom in designing it
- Higher tier enemies are literally bullet sponges even with higher level equipment
- Map is almost the same but smaller than Far Cry 5
- Too much pink!",1699052345,1699052345,True,24,0,0.734662890434265137,0,True,False,False

Game description key-points: Quality time to spent on a decently made AAA Game

Overview:
Honestly I dislike the FC3, mainly because of the GUI and inventory! and then liked playing the FC5

This Game strikes with vibrant colours and freshness of the juice!
After finishing the game, it felt like it was short!
Liked the characters and Eternal <3 and respect to Joseph character! He really does set the atmosphere of the game and whole world, no wonder he has so many followers!

This honestly feels like a DLC rather than a standalone game, and like 5, it's definitely worth it if you get it on sale like I did. It has recognizable locations and characters from 5, but it remixes them a little bit which is fine. it still has the same outpost clearing gameplay they've been doing since Far Cry 3, but now you can let bases be re-captured by stronger enemies in exchange for more resources which I thought was cool. The map also feels way smaller this time around. Hope County in 5 had so many interesting locations, but here I really didn't feel the urge to explore. The story was passable but I didn't like the villains as much this time around. The Seed family in 5 had clear goals and motivations which made them really interesting but also satisfying to take each of them down. But Mickey and Lou are just kind of Assholes who want to oppress and bully people because it's the apocalypse I guess.

Overall I would definitely say that this game was fun and worth my 8 bucks. The gunplay is still Far Cry 5 which is still incredibly solid. However I think my experience was bogged down by the small map, lackluster villains, and short length.

The story is so insanely boring. Feels like they are forcing you to have empathy for the villain and just take a massive dump on the FC 5. 
Its just the same same as all the games. But its way worse. Bringing nothing new, actually less then the previous games. 

I would think that the game would be good after many years of FC. But its just not. I'm not trying to compere it to much to the other FC in the franchise , But when a game have less content the its predecessor. I don't mind the lvl mechanic, but i hate the HP bar enemies have. Also the weapon rarity makes it even worse. If you like one gun for its simplicity, but it is common. then you will struggle to do harder things. only because its marked as grey. Since the games is incredible easy following this toddler mechanic. I would strongly recommend using mainly grey or blue tier weapons throughout the game. Don't bother killing animals except when you find a ""Legendary"" animal. The loot you are getting is something you will get anyway just when you loot bases. 


The game have 0 replay value, with most linear story telling. Without spoiling to much, but I really don't see how some of the characters have survived and why everything is ok as it is. 

As for graphics. There are some visual stuff here and there. but that is common for Ubisoft games (sad to say) Beside that, the vibrant collor is pleasing to watch and i don't mind it. 7/10 I guess? 

I wish i was a brain-dead person that played this game. I am to logical playing this game, i see so insanely many plot holes in the story it makes me sick. And the side mission are just not fun. You are suppose to learn about new people, but after that mission, you will just end up never seeing them again. Perk set is okey. Most typical you find in these kinda games. Just made it more boring to acquire. Some is just so unrealistic it makes me just sad. 

I had the most fun, when i throw rocks at my friends or some slight trolling. Beside that, we are just coping that the end will be good, but as for now we are doubting. Getting close to finish the game. 

The target demographic feels all over the place. Sometime its brutal, like a 18+ game other time its so goofy you are wondering if you want you 8 year old brother to play instead.",1696268647,1696268695,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

However, the game has too little unique content. The main story is laughably short, the map is only a fraction of 5's, and the weapon tier system is flawed at best. While New Dawn is often compared to 5, it's warranted as the game was built entirely off of it.

The constant forced hallucinations or drug sequences, the crazy dlc concepts, and the out of the norm spin offs like primal and this. The game is good, I actually liked it better than 5 in some respects but it's short and in classic Ubisoft tradition the story is flaming hot garbage.

Positives:
The post apocalyptic setting was great, they made it really colorful and I found it more visually appealing that the base area in FC5.

I really enjoyed the addition of a main hub area that could be upgraded. The past Far Cry games felt like towns were mostly just a place to stop for the missions or to refill ammo, there was never any attachment to them. In this game you're main area is the town of Prosperity and acts as an anchor for exploration and adds some purpose to your actions.

The expeditions were also a great addition and I was disappointed there was only 7 of them. They overcome one of the hurdles that an open world game has, you can't make areas too unique or they'll clash with the map theme, but if everything is the same it can feel repetitive. The expeditions have you fly to a separate area to harvest resources, and the maps for them were overall more visually interesting than the basic outposts in the game.

They give perk points for almost everything you do and perks don't feel like they're always just out of reach. Then there are several that can be upgraded endlessly so after everything is unlocked you can just constantly pump up your ammo supply.

Finally being able to shoot Joseph Seed in his stupid face (heart but I'll take what I can get), not sure if this was supposed to be an emotional or conflicting moment for the player but I was spamming the fire key as soon as he started raising the gun to himself. There were maybe a few nanoseconds that could be shaved off between when they gave me the option and his death.

Neutrals:
They swapped to a more RPG gameplay style where gun hits show visible damage indicators. The tiers that were added make you go through different guns instead of just finding your favorite ones and using them constantly, but they removed all the gun customization so you can't change sights or add silencers, so some tiers won't have a weapon you like to play with the attachments you'd like. Having some enemies pose more of a threat can add some extra strategy to who you want to take out first. However, at the same time having outposts get retaken and upgraded just ranks the enemies up 1 tier but keeps almost everything the same. If you managed to take it without being detected once you'll probably be able to do the same copy pasted tactic again. Each higher tier enemy requires another perk to perform takedowns, but this just comes off as unnecessary at best and frustrating when you manage to sneak up on an enemy you can't kill yet. Just like in FC5 the DLC undercuts some of the balancing that the tiers add as well with a few tier 2 weapons and a tier 3 car being available from the start.

Negatives:
The story is crap, the twins are very 2 dimensional characters and they only show up a couple times before you kill them, they have no real presence. The friendly NPCs aren't much better, they tried to make an emotional moment over the death of one of them but I actually couldn't even picture who they were talking about when they said he'd been captured. It also has the FC4 problem of forcing you to step into an obvious trap. You have to leave your weapons at the door and they even expect you to handcuff yourself, who in their right mind would do this? All to save someone who is obviously going to die if you completely incapacitate yourself. 

The game is pretty short as well, it seems to have the least outposts of all the games with about 10. The map is the same as FC5 but the north 1/3 of it (Jacobs area) is irradiated and is only used for a few story bits. The last two boss fights, the twins and Ethan, are pretty much one after the other. Ethan is only an antagonist for a couple minutes and his fight seems like a yeti reskin.",1694899067,1694899107,True,2,0,0.504132270812988281,0,True,False,False

First of all, I didn't know whether to recommend this game or not, so this is more of a mixed review. Let's start off with the good things. This game is gorgeous; the environments are amazing, there is gratify and a lot of flowers everywhere. The world looks so beaten but vibrant at the same time and If you're a fan of the color pink, you're definitely going to love this one. 

The gameplay is a mixed bag. It starts off really tedious, some enemies are bullet sponges, but once you unlock a high-tier weapon, the game starts feeling like previous FC games. Some weapon animations are an improvement over FC5 but there is no weapons customization whatsoever which is quite disappointing. The story and characters here are very weak. I didn't care about any of them. The antagonists are weak and cringe, and a lot of the characters are just silly and generic. It's like they're not even trying with these games anymore.

The performance is good. I couldn't maintain a smooth 60FPS, but the drops weren't bad, definitely an improvement over FC5. 

[b] TL;DR I'd say if you liked FC5, you'll like this one, as long as you don't take it too seriously. You're going to have a fun time blowing stuff up.[/b]",1694391401,1694619886,True,3,0,0.563145339488983154,0,True,False,False

But what finally won me over are the expeditions.

Rating: 3/5

Far Cry New Dawn, the latest installment of the beloved gaming series, brings colors, chaos, and hope to a post-apocalyptic world. The game offers a diverse mix of action, adventure, and challenging combat, all seamlessly woven together. However, as a player, I couldn't help but notice one significant oversight ‚Äì the absence of catboys!

Catboys, those cute characters with animal ears that can bring a touch of life to even the most dramatic moment in Japanese culture. While the game features many animal characters and creatures, I missed the option to don kitty ears on my character. It would have been an excellent opportunity for individual stylization and the creation of a completely unique protagonist.

Developers could introduce catboys as a cosmetic accessory, perhaps earned by completing difficult tasks or obtaining rare items. We could choose from various types of ears ‚Äì from classic cat ears to wolf or bear ears. This functionality would not only add visual fun to the game but also motivate players to explore the game world in more detail.

All in all, Far Cry New Dawn continues to be an enjoyable experience, offering plenty of action and adventure. However, as someone accustomed to diverse fashion eccentricities in games, I must express my disappointment at the lack of catboys. The ability to create a character with cute ears would undoubtedly enhance the game's amusement and uniqueness.

Although the game lacks catboys, I would still recommend Far Cry New Dawn to fans of the series and players seeking an action-packed and adventurous experience in a post-apocalyptic setting.",1691265592,1692814795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally enjoyed the more manageable size of the game compared to something like FC6. What truly deserves praise is the level of effort invested into changing up the whole feel of the world.

I loved this game before I even opened it.
The graphics were very nice for a game from 2019, the story was very attractive and wants you to play more and discover secrets and upgrade your weapons to become better.
The difficulty set to normal was ok, until the last missions where it became more difficult and I liked that. And I don't think you can finish the last missions without weapons in the legend category.

-The map was better,smaller,it was more colorful,the vegetation was more rich.

-The takedown animations were 10x times better.It made stealth more satisfying.

-The OST is much better than the previous one.

-The character costumization was better in this game,since you could have seen yourself now and then,it made more logic.

-Eliberating outposts was more fun.

-The perk system was better,not thousands of perks,just the essentials.

-Seeing The Deputy,as The Judge,it was nice,didn't really expect it.

The things i didn't quite like are those:

-The guns looked worse,some of them at least,they looked like some toys made out of scrap,not really my taste.

-Uncustomizable weapons,they should have left that in the game.

-The Saw Launcher..the worst gun i have ever seen in my entire life as a gamer. The gun itself is so stupid,i can't even look at it.

-The game has bugs,not many,but it has them.And they are quite unpleasant sometimes.

-The story.It felt very rushed,at some points it was good,but overall the story itself it's not that good.The twins were very annoying and their story wasn't very well explained.I didn't understand their motive. Joseph was back,but it wasn't something wow.He was the same as he was in the previous game,until the end,when he realized what he's done,his ending was good.If i have to rate this story,i would rate it a 6.5/10.

This game has it's flaws,but it has some good things too. In my opinion,if you played Far Cry 5,then you should play this one too,you might like the story,or the game itself more or less,It depends on you.Also buy it only at a discount,i don't think it's worth the full price.

Graphics were nice when they rendered as the devs intended, but character models frequently spas out and twitch unnaturally and textures also occasionally wig out and look artifacted/glitchy.  Everything else was a garbage fire and a downgrade from any previous Far Cry game.  Everything in this game felt like a joke.  The story was nearly nonexistent and not told in an at all immersive way, the charachters were goofy and overblown (in a lame way, not a funny way), the game mechanics were exactly the same as in the previous games; except poorly implemented.  Hunting animals is pointless and more or less a waste of time and ammo, there were no real choices you got to make as the main character, reviving teammates uses plants instead of syringes/medpacks and them dying means nothing except that you feed them some plants in the game menu then call them back, and they bring transportation with them so letting them die is anything but a bad thing.  i could go on but in a nut shell terrible/lazy writing + thoughtless/repetitive game mechanics = a rather lame experience.

The special missions to get recources are fun for a while. The thing that bothered me the most was the way enemies and weapons worked. Enemies ""leveled"" up as you got further into the game so you had to get stronger weapons. But to get stronger weapons you have to upgrade your hub. And to upgrade your hub you have to do the main quest line. Once you get the strongest weapons there is little customization possible. You can't switch scopes or barrels or whatever. 

And what really bothers me is that there are two assault rifles at the higest level both with silencers both with scopes they just look and sound different, but im still using a rocket launcher from 1 level lower because there is only a barely functional grenade launcher at the highest level. 

If you want to get this to play with a friend well there is better stuff out there. I played the entire game with a friend just as we played FC5 and are now playing FC6 together. This was just really really boring to me. Doing the missions you are stuck for many many minutes watching NPC's walk and talk or stand and talk or act out emotions. Maybe your friend wants to see all the cutscenes because he/she/they want to know the story. I know its FC but shit damn i feel like the cutscenes are half the game. My friend doesnt like to fast travel and while driving around, we didnt really get distracted. We just drove to the location. Thats not OK for a FC game I think. There should be random stuff happening en route. I was happy when we finished it, because i could uninstall it and never ever touch it again. Also why tf is there an option to use real life money to buy recources in the game?! I was baffled about this in the last FC but in the DLC with this little content you can use the recources on?

Tip: Liberate Outposts and Upgrade till you get Fast Travel. You can do a few and then try and get the trucks that have Ethanol on them and return them to the Outposts, get as much Ethanol as possible so you can upgrade the weapons crafting to purple/gold. Gold Weapons are crazy good but to get the circuit boards you have to kill the Beasts or do Expeditions and cost a lot of other resources so purple is probably easier earlier.

There's a TL;DR at the end.

My enjoyment of this game was mostly carried by my infinite and undying love for Far Cry 5. That being said, my same love of Far Cry 5 also soured my experience of this game. I will draw several comparisons between the two as this is meant to be the direct sequel. I had low expectations going in, was positively surprised within the first 10 hours, but then quickly realised that this is one incredibly under-cooked game. 

[b] The Graphics and Performance [/b]

Visually this game is jaw dropping, it's so damn beautiful and the scenery is incredible. The visuals were spot on and some places were honestly breathtaking to look at. I played on High graphics settings and it ran mostly stable 90-120 fps on a 3080. Sometimes the fps would randomly shatter for no reason but it was very occasional and barely worth mentioning. This game is quite GPU heavy though, so if your rig is closer to a 4-slot toaster than a functional setup, I'd be careful.

[b] General Gameplay [/b]

Gameplay-wise it's fun with some wrinkles. First of all, I don't mind the addition of damage numbers and such RPG-esque elements, I actually think it's kinda cool and the enemy ranking makes it fun to progress. At the same time though, the progression is way too easy in this game. A few hours of casually doing outposts undetected and I had already maxed out most of Prosperity, which was underwhelming. Enemy spawns are really weird and some AI mechanics had me puzzled. One time I saw a helicopter randomly pulling up in the middle of nowhere followed by two highwaymen plummeting to their deaths from said helicopter. Perks were pretty standard for a Far Cry game but I was very fond of the perks gained from New Eden. Double jumping was incredibly fun and practical, and it helped really pick up the pace of the game. Ghost was incredibly useful and is actually helpful; as for Wrath I found myself using it more defensively than offensively, and for an occasional traversal boost combined with double jumping.

[b] The Villains [/b]

I don't think the villains are inherently bad but there is a lot of untapped potential here. They weren't threatening or likeable, had no redeeming personalities, had a really vague backstory that I didn't care for one bit because it wasn't explained for more than 45 seconds, and it wasn't even satisfying to see them go down. Comparatively, FC5 portrayed a much more fearsome, don't-fw-me villain roster than Mickey and Lou. Even when you see them blow out Rush's brains in front of you, which barely served the plot in any way, it still didn't help their image as a villain. It would've been much better if they weren't so obnoxious and there was some way to distinguish the two in terms of personality. They would've benefitted from separate story lines for each so the characters are individiually fleshed out better, similar to how FC5 had regions dedicated to the 3 siblings, and through them Joseph's development as the antagonist was weaved into the storyline. They could've taken inspiration from FC3 and had one of the siblings and the main character to mix things up. You get the idea, there were so many things they could've done and they just didn't. For a game franchise that prides itself on incredible villains, this didn't cut it.

[b] The Missions [/b] 

To be honest, most of the missions were pretty fun. I had a good time with a majority of them. The little prison raid was awesome though it felt rushed. The derby thingy was one of the funnest missions in the franchise. The fight arena thing was great too. A lot of missions were very good, but a lot of missions were not so good, including all of the 8 side missions which were rushed way too hard. Some redundant ""protect these structures"", ""shoot these targets"", ""find this thing"" etc. etc. Although most main story missions were fantastic, the final fight against Mickey and Lou was the most abominable thing I've experienced in my lifetime of gaming. I won't explain why, see for yourself. Also, I won't bother mentioning the fight with Ethan, that deserves a wall of text on its own and I'm lacking the willpower to fully discuss how this game pulled a Riverdale and introduced supernatural elements for no reason.

[b] The Story [/b]

The story felt very promising at first but as it progressed it seemed the writing of it deteriorated significantly. It feels like this story was written by a Fiverr author who was given 10 bucks and a Snickers bar. My main issue isn't the actual content of the story but specifically how many broad jumps it took. In FC5 you had to really work your ass off to progress the story and it did a very good job of building up the villains, the sense of community and your own emotional commitment as a player to seeing the story reach its end. Here though, the sense of community, that should've been this game's major selling point, was not taken advantage of to the extent it should've been. There was barely any time to truly appreciate all the characters. I say ""all"", but there weren't even that many to be honest. There were plenty of old FC5 characters, which was super cool to see, except once you bring them to Prosperity you basically never see them again. Also, I wish there was more done to fill in the gap between FC5 and FCND, because it seems the lore is full of holes and difficult to piece together, and the game does not instill a sense of ""what the hell happened here?"" that would be fitting for a post-apocalyptic game.

[b] Completionistic Stuff [/b]

I achieved 100% in the game and mostly enjoyed the process of doing so. I'd like to note that I enjoyed the prepper stashes a lot, I think they were surprisingly polished and fun. I also liked the photo collectibles, I think those were very nice reminders of the pre-nuclear Hope County. The material collecting stuff was redundant as hell and it has Ubisoft plastered all over it. If you're doing this yourself, I suggest upgrading Timber as he'll highlight materials around him. The outposts were fun and refreshing, the level design was really quite good and there's so many ways to clear them. Expeditions were mostly boring, I wish I didn't have to repeat them 3 times each, that's dumb and a waste of my time. Generally, all of this grindy stuff would've been much more welcoming if there was an exclusive reward for doing so but there wasn't one so you'll only find enjoyment in it if you're picky about doing everything.

[b] Crafting [/b]

I don't mind the crafting element of this game as it fits thematically, but I'm disappointed that more wasn't done with it. There is absolutely no option to customise any of your weapons which is completely counterintuitive to a DIY weapon themed game. No scopes, suppressors or anything of the such which would've been the bare minimum. They could've expanded with some unique upgrades that are only unlockable through special means, such as collectibles, side missions etc., but I guess Ubisoft killed the golden goose when they settled on what was finally implemented.

[b] TL;DR / Summary [/b]

I think this game is definitely worth playing. The slating tone of this review mostly originates from me wishing it was a more worthy successor to FC5 as this game only lives up to about 40% of its true potential. However, standalone, this game is good and worth playing. Thinking about what this game could've been compared to what it is makes my eyes water. That being said, this game isn't bad at all and I would recommend giving it a go.",1678321333,1689768130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

939960,142241391,76561198052168697,0,9,1476,0,1476,1689556602,"Honestly this feels like the weakest entry in the Far Cry series. The story which is by far the weakest part of the game is what really drives this home. It feels phoned in at best where I never once felt any sympathy or real relation to any characters. The antagonists are poorly written and cringey at best with barely any reason to be evil other than a quick flashback of their mother saying ""please don't be evil like your dad."" Some how this is supposed to sway you not to kill them in the end despite all the psycho killing they did where there's really no redemption. The other characters don't get off easy either as they each have 1, 2 missions tops of their small banter to give them the stereotypical character they are and move on. The other main good guy who is killed by the twins I couldn't feel any emotion for him dying as he has like 2 minutes of cut scenes and they are just more him being a hardass and bossy man without showing much in redeeming qualities other than ""he knows stuff to survive."" i.e. He's the stand in important character that dies to give you a reason to hate the villians. 

All that aside the RPG aspects I feel make the early game frustrating and annoying at best. The tier of gun you use only has the killing capacity for the same tier or lower enemy. This wouldn't be bad if the missions didn't keep taking away your guns to give you tier ones from enemies to fight tier threes. And the tiers make no sense either as my biggest gripe is that biker helmets are able to completely negate head shots. Yes the helmet will break but, only if you use the same tier or higher other wise you gotta mag dump your tier one into the tier 3 enemies head to hope it breaks the helmet since you'll use all your ammo on body shots otherwise. It's really bad for a stealth player since this will immediately alert enemies despite you getting a good shot at them and then basically being punished for not shooting the body or using a take down. The scavenging for parts isn't too bad except that end game you have to grind expeditions or hunting elite bison for computer chips because there's no other way than paying IRL currency to get parts which is also a major issue. The game almost limits some progression behind a paywall if you don't want to hunt or do expeditions so the crafting is annoying if you want those tier fours. All this comes into the issue that you have to do the higher level quests early on to get the better stuff. The game honestly doesn't get to be fun until you're at tier 3 which there's only 4 tiers. At this point you're at least on par with all the enemies except the elites but you actually have a fighting chance. 

The vehicles I honestly almost never used as the driving was poor and for some reason vehicles can only take like 2 shots before exploding. About 90% of my deaths were from a car blowing up next to me after having two pistol rounds shot at the tire. It honestly was better on foot as if you do scavenge you have to get out of your vehicle all the time anyways. Another big gripe is the wingsuit. This was a favorite of mine in the previous games but now unless you airdrop in you almost can never use it as the prompt almost never comes up until your 2 inches from the ground about to die from fall damage. Jumping from a cliff I'd expect it to let me use the suit given jumping 3 feet off some stairs gives the option for a parachute, but for a  150 foot drop the game assumes you're not gonna wanna use it then.  I can't comment much on the guns for hire since I refuse to use them as my experience with companions in games are poor when it comes to stealth and since Far Cry 3 I've preferred to be a lone assassin.
 
Overall I would skip this one, it feels more like a phoned in cash grab from Ubisoft. There's barely a skeleton of story. All characters are forgettable at best and the gun play isn't good until the end game. If you like to grind, stay away from vehicles, and can care less about story or characters than this game would be tolerable for you.",1689560481,1689561102,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My expectations were again low for Far Cry 5 so I still enjoyed it but I had really decided that maybe enough was enough. New Dawn should have followed in the ""different"" style of Blood Dragon and Primal, but it wasn't. It was effectively an extension of Far Cry 5 with a few variances and not much else of interest.

The ""open world"" essentially consists of 4 different POIs repeated 10x. Moving around the open world feels horrible. Your character makes jumps in cutscenes that kill you if you make then in-game. Jumping down hills can kill you. Made even funnier by your character surviving much faster falls when using the parachute. The movement all feels very ""gamey"" and not in a nice way.

The game is plagued by technical issues. The most annoying is that the game's icons on the open world (quest markers, supply drops, and so on) are literally broken on non-standard resolutions such that looking directly at an icon means it can disappear so you have to look off to the side to get it to show up. Other games have this problem too, but not games that actually say they support non-standard resolutions.

The RPG elements are unsatisfying at best, and meaningless at worst.

I genuinely hope whoever was behind this game got fired and is never allowed to make a game again. A terrible, dreadfully boring story, nowhere near as humorous as the previous Far Cry games, or even as good. You would think, a game about one mans exploits, the consequences of one mans actions, would be about him. You would think Joseph Seed, the person who caused this apocalypse in the first place, is the focus of the story, but he's not. Its some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pair of idiot twins who somehow worked their way up to the top of the food chain. Joseph is practically a side story, you have like one or two quests with him, then the last scene involves him. The rest of the story? Following the other idiots, who somehow survived in this wasteland. The ONLY interesting characters, are Nick Rye's family, past that? Everyone else has the worst stories. Mickey and Lou? The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• twins who somehow rule this pathetically small world? They are awful villains, their banter is actually annoying, and their boss fight is ridiculous. They have health bars that are beyond reasonable, even when you knock their stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• helmets off, you don't deal any more damage than you were before, even spamming headshots. The definition of bullet sponges, while they also deal maximum damage to you, even on the easiest difficulty. I had to actually take the game out of the hardest difficulty for this fight and it still took a half hour. There is absolutely no reason for the second to final fight making me spend the over a half hour, running around in circles, on fire, and being sniped, surrounded by dogs that constantly stun lock you, OH and the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• twins constantly stun lock you as well. The worst boss fight in any video game I've ever played. And their sappy ending? Their sudden sentimental behavior towards each other and the main character, even though they've been sadistic, murderous psychos the entire game? Was a horrible excuse to try making me feel bad for killing those pieces of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The one following that? Even ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• worse. Tenfold. I mean its easy to avoid damage since its a melee boss, but god ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• dammit it has to have double the health of both twins combined. Sure, maybe the story surrounding the final fight had me intrigued, because I only cared about about Joseph and his story. Joseph is not the final boss. Oh, remember when I said pathetically small map? This game should have been a DLC for Far Cry 5 with the size of the map. In 5, you had 4 massive segments of a giant map to explore. In this one? You have maybe a quarter of one of those segments. And yet, somehow, in the smallest map possible, it is still impossible to find quests. The majority of the hours I have on this game, were spent wandering around the same few places trying my hardest to find the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• missions this game provided. Oh yeah, the selling point? The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• super powers you get? Are also pathetic. You get a double jump, a speed boost, something that makes you a tiny bit more stealthy, and like one other stupid, minor effect. I was hesitant to trust the bad reviews, but I wish I did, I wish I got the time wasted on this dumpster fire back, I wish I never spend a dollar on this game, but the past is in the past, and all I can do now, is warn other people not to even bother. The story is garbage, the missions are repetitive and downright stupid, the ""powers"" are pathetic, the game is a bore, the villains are terrible, and the map is practically microscopic compared to literally any other game. Please, do not waste a dime on this game. Even if its given to you for free, don't waste a second playing this garbage. The ONLY thing I can really praise, is the land you play on. Its beautiful, floral, and full of unique wildlife. That's it. That is the only part of this game I will sing praise to.",1612175026,1689027189,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have a tier 2 gun, you do almost no damage to tier 3 enemies, but you one-shot tier 1 enemies. The funniest part is, the enemies you kill don't drop their weapons if it's a higher tier than yours. This applies throughout the entire game and serves as the main way to guide the player throughout the story/map.

Granted, you don't HAVE to follow the easiest path, I absolutely brute forced my way into capturing a few tier 3 bases with my tier 2 guns, but be prepared to die A LOT while doing so.

This entire feature absolutely KILLS the fun of Far Cry. In Far Cry 3 or 4, immediately after they let you loose. you could run and take over ANY enemy base you wanted, even at the complete opposite side of the map. Their way of ensuring difficulty was TYPE of enemy, AMOUNT of enemies, and WHERE the enemies are. Not some artificial ""tier"" that grants their gun the power of a .50 cal sniper rifle while maintaining the fire rate of an AK-47.

It seems odd even from a logical standpoint, the visual ""upgrades"" from the different tiers of weapons is that they look less like generic weapons and more like random trash bolted together in the SHAPE of a weapon, wouldn't that do less damage?

Speaking of that, no weapon customization, at all. There are presets and that's all you get, if you want a suppressor on your rifle then pound sand. You either have to find another rifle with a suppressor on it, or choose a different silent play style. (Within your own tier, of course!)",1688401189,1688401189,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

I'll tell you what happens, you make Far Cry worse. 

The actual gameplay is still good, but Ubisoft seemingly took all of the worst things from RPGs and looter-shooters and put them in New Dawn without any care for how it would impact the play experience. The antagonists (the sisters) are also kind of unengaging. I'm writing this review a year and a half after giving up on the game so I do not remember their name. The guy who definitely isn't just a fictionalized version of Jared Leto is still a fun villain, though.

I genuinely hope whoever was behind this game got fired and is never allowed to make a game again. A terrible, dreadfully boring story, nowhere near as humorous as the previous Far Cry games, or even as good. You would think, a game about one mans exploits, the consequences of one mans actions, would be about him. You would think Joseph Seed, the person who caused this apocalypse in the first place, is the focus of the story, but he's not. Its some fucking pair of idiot twins who somehow worked their way up to the top of the food chain. Joseph is practically a side story, you have like one or two quests with him, then the last scene involves him. The rest of the story? Following the other idiots, who somehow survived in this wasteland. The ONLY interesting characters, are Nick Rye's family, past that? Everyone else has the worst stories. Mickey and Lou? The fuckwad twins who somehow rule this pathetically small world? They are awful villains, their banter is actually annoying, and their boss fight is ridiculous. They have health bars that are beyond reasonable, even when you knock their stupid fuckin helmets off, you don't deal any more damage than you were before, even spamming headshots. The definition of bullet sponges, while they also deal maximum damage to you, even on the easiest difficulty. I had to actually take the game out of the hardest difficulty for this fight and it still took a half hour. There is absolutely no reason for the second to final fight making me spend the over a half hour, running around in circles, on fire, and being sniped, surrounded by dogs that constantly stun lock you, OH and the fucking twins constantly stun lock you as well. The worst boss fight in any video game I've ever played. And their sappy ending? Their sudden sentimental behavior towards each other and the main character, even though they've been sadistic, murderous psychos the entire game? Was a horrible excuse to try making me feel bad for killing those pieces of shit. The one following that? Even fucking worse. Tenfold. I mean its easy to avoid damage since its a melee boss, but god fucking dammit it has to have double the health of both twins combined. Sure, maybe the story surrounding the final fight had me intrigued, because I only cared about about Joseph and his story. Joseph is not the final boss. Oh, remember when I said pathetically small map? This game should have been a DLC for Far Cry 5 with the size of the map. In 5, you had 4 massive segments of a giant map to explore. In this one? You have maybe a quarter of one of those segments. And yet, somehow, in the smallest map possible, it is still impossible to find quests. The majority of the hours I have on this game, were spent wandering around the same few places trying my hardest to find the shitty missions this game provided. Oh yeah, the selling point? The fucking super powers you get? Are also pathetic. You get a double jump, a speed boost, something that makes you a tiny bit more stealthy, and like one other stupid, minor effect. I was hesitant to trust the bad reviews, but I wish I did, I wish I got the time wasted on this dumpster fire back, I wish I never spend a dollar on this game, but the past is in the past, and all I can do now, is warn other people not to even bother. The story is garbage, the missions are repetitive and downright stupid, the ""powers"" are pathetic, the game is a bore, the villains are terrible, and the map is practically microscopic compared to literally any other game. Please, do not waste a dime on this game. Even if its given to you for free, don't waste a second playing this garbage. The ONLY thing I can really praise, is the land you play on. Its beautiful, floral, and full of unique wildlife. That's it. That is the only part of this game I will sing praise to.",1687743405,1687743635,False,41,7,0.695363640785217285,0,True,False,False

New Dawn is just OK. It looks much better than it seemed like it would from all the bad ads and preview still-shots I'd seen. It has good graphics, if not a little skimpy on textures in places, and the colorful scenery has some the update features of FC6, like destructible trees while bombing through the forest. The interface is a little different, which is fine. But the gameplay is more arcadey to me. A little too much focus on constant, fast action with rarely any time to just cruise around and explore. It's hard to try and discover new areas without constantly running into those blm/antfa types every 30 seconds that can take 10-15 .30 cal lmg or 3 or 4 .50 cal BMG slugs to the chest before they go down. Luckily many of them are so wrapped up in spray painting everything with hot pink graffiti that you can walk up behind them and take them out before they can gang up on you. It's an OK game, but I think the producers were just focusing on the wrong things much of the time, instead of trying to tie good gameplay and good storyline together, along with the obvious and unrealistic demographics going on. For me, post apocalyptic settings are always an ideal setting for a great game, this game just feels more like a quick cash grab that's aimed at the younger generations with lower attention spans that are attracted to bright colors and constant action that doesn't necessarily have to make sense. 

My score for this game is 6.5. Not horrible overall, but a pretty shallow and uninspiring, fast action type of game, with TOO MUCH PINK. (there, I said it) I'm not very sure that I'm going to finish it.",1687464283,1687731284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good story (play FC5 before this one), good game play, I like guns/ranged weapons and there are lots to choose from with pros/cons, loadouts can suit your owns strengths.  You can run through it for a challenge, or grind/collect stuff to level up and gain advantage over the enemy.  This game is well focused for an open world game.   I liked it about as much as Assassins Creed Valhalla (although that game is much bigger and longer).  Nothing revolutionary here (like Horizon Zero Dawn) but a strong and solid game.

I actually enjoyed playing this game more than Far Cry 5.  I'm almost 40 hours into this game, and I feel like I might be close to finishing it,  So if that's true New Dawn will take me half the time to beat as Far Cry 5.   This takes place in the aftermath of Far Cry 5, so it is essentially the same map re-skinned, however it was visually different enough that for me it was an advantage (I loved the landscape in FC5 so much I was daydreaming about moving to Hope Montana - minus the cultists).  New Dawn was new but at the same time familiar.  This game is clearly much more than a large DLC pack, but maybe not quite big and new enough as Far Cry 5.  

Why did I like this better?  Being my second Far Cry game, maybe it was because everything was already familiar to me.  The weapons, vehicles, the flow of the game.  I had already developed a bit of a strategy by end of the first game that I was able to walk into this one more prepared.  In this game I used a bit more stealth (re capturing Outposts) and it made the difference.  I liked the enhancements of this game, visually, also the Roster was simpler (I didn't really take advantage of the specialists in FC5).  I liked how you could re capture each outpost at higher difficulties each time.  I also like that you can make the difficulty fit your needs.  Too difficult?  Grind/collect a little more to level up and gain an advantage.   Do more challenges to get more Perks.  Do some expeditions to get more raw materials to craft.   And re-capture outposts to level up your home base.  New Dawn felt more focused (maybe more arcadey as others put it), but as someone who isn't a hard core gamer who doesn't like to be an expert at the game (like Witcher 3), I liked the streamlining from FC5.  Took me a while to discover armor piercing and incendiary bullets, but once I did it was an absolute game changer.  I no longer even needed my wingman most of the time.  

In Summary, I think people who didn't recommend the game were upset because it wasn't exactly what they wanted.  But I think this game went a long way to accommodate multiple types of player strategies, skill levels, and experience levels.   It definitely gave more structure vs FC5, but I think that was a good thing.   In the end, go in with an open mind, see how the aftermath of FC5 plays out, play it the way that suits you, and have fun.

But when I restarted game (after enabling HD textures), it had forgotten my login. This happened 2 times in a row. Now it does seem to have saved it for some reason. Clearly an issue on your side to have to enter your data multiple times. Gladly I wrote my login info down yesterday from The crew, but still. Then constantly theres this Ubisoft connect window and it was making quite some issues like Steam/Ubiconnect not even starting the game.. Tried playing New dawn offline and i had to click thru like 8 things in Ubiconnect to be able to play. Most of it not even working with controller. No steam cloud which I was looking forward to to have my savefiles always at one spot even if I change systems (and not in 15 different accounts at different game publishers). I am not sure whats the benefit for me of having this game on Steam like this. Its pretty dissapointing as I am a huge fan of Ubisoft and love these games. I can see the advantages for Ubi and other publishers of their own launchers, but for your customers? There is no benefits. Its just annoying. I think you really need to change this. 
  
For some reason this was better with the Crew but I havent started it again so maybe when I do, there will be the same issues. At this point it makes more sense to use the seemless, convient, fun, awesome, amazing, user friendly, free launcher by that crazy emp girl to enjoy these games. Or just play them on console (but damn it looks so nice on the 3060!!). Great work by the dev team behind this game, but the management of Ubi really needs a huge change to become player friendly because I dont see me buying anymore games by Ubi on steam except they are like $5 and from what I read in the other reviews of your games...

I don't hate it, it looks nice, runs nice (130~ FPS RTX 3070 & AMD 5800X3D), there's a pretty interesting but ultimately underwhelming tier system for outposts and other off the map missions but its nothing special.

Overall I would only reccomend this game to a fan of the series who's already played the other ones, other than that, I would just play FC3,FC4, or FC6, they are all much better.

(Spoiler for Far Cry 5 a little bit into the review)

Rating: 4/5

Far Cry New Dawn takes players on a thrilling journey through a post-apocalyptic world, serving as a standalone sequel to Far Cry 5. Developed by Ubisoft, this first-person shooter game injects a vibrant mix of action, exploration, and storytelling into a familiar open-world formula. While it may not revolutionize the genre, Far Cry New Dawn offers an enjoyable experience with a unique twist on the franchise.

One of the standout features of Far Cry New Dawn is its stunning visual presentation. The vibrant and colorful post-apocalyptic setting, juxtaposed with the ruins of a devastated world, creates a striking contrast that is visually captivating. The game's attention to detail is commendable, from the lush landscapes to the dilapidated structures that populate the environment.

The story of Far Cry New Dawn is set seventeen years after the nuclear catastrophe that occurred at the end of Far Cry 5. Players find themselves in a world where society is slowly rebuilding amid the chaos. The narrative introduces new characters, including the ruthless twins Mickey and Lou, who make for compelling antagonists. While the overall story might not reach the heights of its predecessor, it offers enough intrigue and emotional moments to keep players engaged throughout their adventure.

The gameplay in Far Cry New Dawn remains true to the series' roots. Players will engage in a variety of missions, which can be approached with different playstyles. The Gun for Hire system returns, allowing players to recruit specialists with unique abilities to assist in combat situations. The addition of makeshift weapons, crafted from scavenged materials, adds a layer of customization and resource management to the gameplay.

The game's world is filled with outposts to liberate, treasure hunts to embark upon, and side quests to undertake. While some of the activities may feel familiar to series veterans, the post-apocalyptic setting injects a fresh sense of urgency and desperation into the experience. The expeditions, which take players to new locations outside the main map, are particularly enjoyable, providing a change of pace and a chance to discover valuable resources.

Far Cry New Dawn's cooperative multiplayer mode allows players to team up with a friend and tackle the challenges of the wasteland together. This adds another layer of enjoyment to the game, as players can strategize and coordinate their actions, further enhancing the sense of camaraderie within the chaotic world.

One area where Far Cry New Dawn falls slightly short is in the depth of its mechanics and progression system. While the gameplay remains solid and satisfying, the RPG elements and character progression feel somewhat limited. The upgrade tree lacks complexity, resulting in a sense of shallowness that could have been further explored to add more depth to the experience.

Overall, Far Cry New Dawn is a worthy addition to the franchise. Its vibrant world, engaging storyline, and action-packed gameplay provide an entertaining experience for fans of the series and newcomers alike. While it may not push the boundaries of the genre, it delivers an enjoyable adventure with enough twists and surprises to keep players invested. If you're looking for a post-apocalyptic shooter with a familiar but captivating formula, Far Cry New Dawn is definitely worth a try.",1586640337,1686510374,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

How long is it?: It is short and I was able to 100% the full progression and buy/unlock everything there is to in only 53 hours. Are the Graphics good?: The graphics while not being as good as its predecessor (FarCry 5) are still beautiful and I found myself admiring the environment multiple times. Hows the story?: Honestly its story seemed limited since it was so short, in my opinion maybe if it was longer they could have done better with it and the villains of the story were just straight villains with a sort of ""I'm an ass, just because"" and even when the game tried to make them have a backstory or anything it didn't really change anything and left me still thinking they could've been more fleshed out. The best thing about the story is that it follows up on its predecessor after the bombs had been dropped, which I think is a very cool concept since this explains what happened to everyone's lives after and how they survived. Overall Rating?: Everything considered 6.5/10, the game is a spin-off which I can understand for why it's so short but because of that so much is practically cut and leaves the anticipation after finishing FarCry 5 to a sort of ""let down"" feeling. They took a huge concept and minimized it to its bare bones.

As for this one, the follow up? Fallout: Far Cry? It's feeling more like an arcade game with each game. The animals have gotten so ridiculous and extreme now that you can unload an LMG into one and not even stop it from attacking, let alone kill it. Enemies are accurate beyond belief, nailing you all the way to the horizon when you're moving evasively and at full sprint. The perk system isn't as good as 5, having less perks and far less utility in the ones that are there. Weapon selection consists mainly of just multiple skins of the same weapons that have stats depending on how expensive they are. Despite being a full price title, every attempt is made to push micro transactions to make getting the best weapons easier.

Graphics: Pretty much the same as 5.
Sound: Ditto.
Gameplay: Roughly the same, but with tougher enemies, especially animals.
Story: Basic bullies and trying to take over, take them out.

The take? It's a step down and more repetitive despite having far less to do. I give it a 5/10.",1685507399,1685507399,False,4,0,0.506762921810150146,0,True,False,False

(NOTE) : This is Full Far Cry game that sets years after the collapse happened, which depending on how you play it, it might took you 20 hours to beat it first time. 

(WORLD/ENVIRONMENT) : Despite the Apocalyptic settings, the Environment are still lush, instead of dead depressing wasteland instead we got an Apocalyptic world that is lush and colorful but still includes the Ruined and Abandoned remnants of what was Hope County

(GRAPHICS) The graphics were uh.....for me it looks worse than Far Cry 5, The coloring which makes Far Cry 5 looks realistic is totally absent. But definitely has it own apocalyptic art style thats pretty on its own way. Performance wise, im a mid end user but likes playing on higher settings....I notice more FPS drop and stuttering in New Dawn compared to FC5. but im, sure if you have a nice rig you wont notice a different.

(GAMEPLAY) : Though still a Far Cry. this game tries to be a bit different in terms of Gameplay. its a bit more RPG-ish not only theres enemy leveling, but also Weapons and Character Attribute, some people not like it, but i appreciate what they were trying to do with it. besides it makes combat more difficult (of course you still can play on easy). and for weapons they entirely removes the customization system, Which i despised :(

(EXPLORATION) : From my experience. i liked to explore Hope County after The Collapse. but as the game progressed i just sort of dont care about it at all even still there are interesting collectibles and story you'd find while exploring.

(OVERVIEW) : This game tried to be different, but in the end it still has those repetitive gameplay loop that other Far Cry games has, and this game has no replay value whatsoever. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone, even if that someone played far cry 5. This game feels like an unnecessary sequel to it. i give it a (6.8/10)

Components and crafting are great, I love the Expeditions which feel almost arcade like and take you out of Hope County.  Good catching up with New Eden again and working through the story with a nice nod with the Judge. Lots of opportunities for taking objectives in new ways.

On the story it doesn't really bother me.  I like the feel of the game since the world has ended and your're fighting a larger organisation (The Highwaymen) of which the twins are only a small part (hence the supply drops from other chapters).  The fact that the place is still riddled with Highwaymen even after areas have been liberated is also great. Farcry 5 has nobody to kill once you have wasted all three siblings so it gets a little dull!

Only downside is Herk.  Absolute car crash of a companion.  Constantly complaining about dying, constantly shooting his rubbish rocket launcher badly and constantly not reviving me when I am down.

That's honestly why I really liked New Dawn: It's about 1/3 of a Far Cry game.

$40 is a bit steep, but if you can get it on sale for $10-$20, New Dawn is a fun time.

The Twins are nothing special as antagonists. I don't think they deserve the hate I've seen, but they're by no means iconic. Still, I was so painfully bored by the generic villains in Far Cry 5, The Twins actually come across as doubly interesting by comparison.

The series belongs every bit in the same conversation with the other full 3D shooters that laid the groundwork for the genre, beginning with the frantic evil of Quake (which Bethesda has most graciously granted a recent update which utterly revived the game), progressing with the high adventure and chatty NPCs of Half-Life, followed by the brilliant RPG and stealth elements added by the original Deus Ex, which gave us the first real taste of non-linear game-play and open world exploration (notably also recently revived by a brilliant mod called Revision, available here on Steam), and then expanded into further open world goodness with the first Far Cry.

Far Cry New Dawn isn't the best in the series, but it isn't the worst either. Those honors, in my opinion, belong to Far Cry 2, Far Cry 4 and Far Cry Primal. I won't say any of those games are ""terrible"", but some of the Far Cry entries set a very high standard, notably Far Cry 3, which still felt entirely enjoyable by current AAA gaming standards just months ago when I played through it again. With the exception of the first two games, Far Cry and Far Cry 2, the entire series maintains high fidelity graphics to this day. Some of the Far Cry games do have better settings and game-play mechanics than others (by mechanics, I mean stuff to do in the game, more than the gun-play, which has been remarkably consistent throughout the entire series) and for that reason I'd say Far Cry 3 is still my favorite (c'mon, Citra, the classic pixel-babe experience of our time), followed by Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (which was an absolutely rocking fun and stylish game, a real booster shot for the series), then Far Cry New Dawn and last place would go to Far Cry 5, which I felt barely made the grade. It was a shame that the Hours of Darkness add-on for Far Cry 5 suffered from so many performance issues, and Far Cry 4's setting just didn't appeal to me visually or geographically, a game I found too dull to get into, especially after just having had an utter romp with Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

So Far Cry New Dawn takes Far Cry 5's gameplay (much the way Blood Dragon was an extension of FC3) into a vibrant post-apocalypse (not a bad twist, considering the existing abundance of shooters set in a drab post-apocalypse) and adds some colorful spins on the resident wildlife, as well as some weapons that stand out from the rest of the series. While it doesn't boast the 3 juicy add-ons that Far Cry 5 received (FC5's add-ons were great, they were each like a whole new game within the game with huge maps of their own to explore), it's still solid, classic Far Cry in all it's open world, shooty goodness.

Animals are, ONCE AGAIN, stupidly bullet-spongy, but I suppose, since in this entry of the Far Cry series the world is full of mutant animals, and the animals appear to have boss versions and such, they decided to go a bit the ARPG route. It's not quite as bothersome as it is in say Far Cry 3 or Far Cry 5, where those games are presumably supposed to be realistic (but just aren't, ever, because Ubisoft's designers make braindead decisions with their otherwise great games...).

I preferred the ability to salvage outposts and let enemies retake them so that you could re-capture them at a higher tier over Far Cry 5's ""Outpost Master"" mode, as it felt integrated into the game. At first I felt Far Cry New Dawn's map was too small, but when I realized this replay element it changed my outlook on the game, and brought the game up to speed with what Far Cry 5 offered for gameplay. That and the addition of some mini-maps inside the game via the available ""expeditions"" really rounded out the content-to-value ratio for me.

Sadly the game suffers from occasional performance issues which require you to reboot periodically, similarly to the Hours of Darkness add-on for FC5. Also, I found several of the weapons just wonky-looking, a shame, since the game is better than FC5 but has inferior weaponry. Also not sure that I enjoyed the weapons having ""levels"", a large deviation from the rest of the series, and quite unrealistic.

8/10 - the series, once again, COULD GREATLY MERIT FROM SURVIVAL ELEMENTS THAT MAKE USE OF ALL THE MEAT AND FISH YOU HUNT. C'mon... Talk about 1-dimensional game design.",1680563596,1683428575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set 17 years after the events of Far Cry 5, the game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the player has to survive and fight against a new enemy, the Highwaymen.

One of the main features of Far Cry New Dawn is the open world, which is stunning and immersive. The game takes place in a vibrant and colorful world that is both beautiful and dangerous. From lush forests to desolate wastelands, the environment is filled with a variety of wildlife and enemy factions. The graphics are impressive, with vibrant colors and sharp details that make the world come to life.

Gameplay-wise, Far Cry New Dawn is similar to its predecessor, with a mix of exploration, crafting, and combat. The player has to scavenge for resources, craft weapons and gear, and take on missions to progress the story. The combat is intense and satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from. The game also introduces new elements, such as the ability to recruit specialists and upgrade facilities.

One of the highlights of Far Cry New Dawn is the story, which is engaging and well-written. The game follows the story of the player, who is a survivor of the nuclear apocalypse. The player joins a group of survivors known as the Prosperity, led by the charismatic Thomas Rush. The Prosperity is under attack from the Highwaymen, a group of raiders who are pillaging the countryside for resources. The player must work with the Prosperity to defeat the Highwaymen and restore order to the wasteland.

The characters in Far Cry New Dawn are well-developed, with their own personalities and motivations. The player interacts with a variety of characters, including the members of the Prosperity, the Highwaymen leaders, and other survivors. Each character has their own story, and the player's choices can affect their relationships and outcomes.

Overall, Far Cry New Dawn is an excellent addition to the Far Cry series. The open world is stunning and immersive, the gameplay is engaging and satisfying, and the story is well-written and engaging. If you're a fan of the Far Cry series or post-apocalyptic games, then Far Cry New Dawn is definitely worth playing.",1683048179,1683048179,True,2,0,0.467496544122695923,0,True,False,False

I did enjoy seeing the aftermath of FC 5 and that honestly was just about the only thing I liked about New Dawn. I was also nice to have closure for Rook.

From the overall, look, artistic style, voice acting, and some really unfortunate, at times, dialogue.  This is like a B-Team version of a Far Cry game, with some similar assets, but without the polish.  You might say, some aspects they dropped the ball, but I'm not sure if they were ever carrying it THAT SAID....

I did enjoy this game, in all of it's imperfections.  This feels like something 10 years older than it is.  The Twins were quite diabolical and were among the best voiced characters with the better dialogue.  They could have been better fleshed out, to make them more interesting, but they definitely gave me the feel of really wanting to destroy them, so in that aspect, they did the job quite well.  There is at least one weapon introduced, that I have not seen before, that I got quite a bit of fun out of.  I played it on Hard difficulty, and a few of the companions are just dynamite, quite fun to play with.  I also love the idea of revisiting Hope County many years after the collapse to see who survived and get some closure on the story.  I wish they would have really treated this as one of the numbered releases, and bump up the overall quality of most of the elements.  The final boss fight, actually requires some strategy to work out, so that was fun as well and a welcome change.

If you grab it on sale, you really can't go wrong.  Enjoy it for what is it and revisit some old friends.",1682552254,1682552254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 5 set a high standard for me for New Dawn and there are some things that I like about the game but there are also some things that I don't care for. I like that they made it mandatory to hunt different species due to the trade system instead of just selling skins for money like Far Cry 5. It's also nice that it isn't just find a grinding method for money and get all the guns that you want and that you are forced to collect different materials in order to craft the weapons that you want.  I also like that then enemies will get more difficult through out the game making it necessary to upgrade your stuff through out the game. Now what I don't like. I personally played Far Cry 5 stealth and I did really well but it is very difficult to do in this one from what I find. I would love to be able to add a suppressor to any gun I want even if I needed to get materials to craft it. That is my one biggest complaint with New Dawn and it isn't just the lack of being able to put a suppressor on any gun but just the lack of gun customization in general. Other than this one big complaint, it is a great game and is really a good game when comparing to Far Cry 5.

I mean, seriously, this game is like a clingy ex who just can't take a hint. Every time I tried to shut it down, it would just keep running in the background, begging for my attention.

For those who haven't played it, Far Cry New Dawn is a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter game where you play as the Captain, a survivor trying to rebuild society in a world ravaged by nuclear war. And while the game is a lot of fun, it's also a bit of a stalker.

No matter how many times I tried to quit the game, it would just keep running in the background, hogging up all my CPU and RAM. 

But despite its clinginess, I have to admit that I had a lot of fun playing Far Cry New Dawn. The open-world gameplay was as engaging as ever, and the post-apocalyptic setting gave the game a unique twist. Plus, the graphics were really impressive, and the storyline was surprisingly engaging.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun and engaging post-apocalyptic shooter, then Far Cry New Dawn is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for a game that just won't take no for an answer.",1680469636,1681944896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been having fun with this game but I wont exactly recommend it. its playable, but its like they tryed to copy every other post nuke game and got all of it partly wrong. Gold star. 

comparatively to the main game, everything is ""crafted"" and in tires, however each a level 1 gun will do little to no damage to a level 3 enemy, resulting in some guns just being strait up better then others. without customization, it severely limits your choices, and with increasing rarity materials, it limits it even further. You can also just buy, as in real world cash, some guns. Im not surer why every tire of the saw gun causes it add more saws so it fires like a shotgun, id rather just have it single. 

for whatever reason they also made some things, mostly custom parts, drop from a chance pool at specific areas. it effectually pads out the replay ability of the node, if you wanted something specific, but again, you can just pay real world cash for it. the replay system also gets harder the more you do it. 

One of the things I will say I like was the expedition thing. It is required to craft max tire gear as its the only source of circuit boards that iv found so far (other then some epic trade ins, but you need epid gear to be able to damage them), but it gives enough to craft a gun within one or two runs. The reason I like it however is it drops you into a semi large open map area with drastically different locals. These are often reuses assets from the DLCs and cut areas from the main game, but its a nice change of setting. Some of these areas seem to be very far away from where the game is ment to be set (Montana to Alcatraz prison being about 19.5 hours), and we are asked to believe that the raiders adhear to the same style and command... but at that point im just nit picking. 

Pading out the gamepaly seems to be a theam with it, and thats why I will say its not woth the full price its being asked for. On sale, maby. its amusingly fun. but do not expect a full game.",1680586544,1681697735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story was solid, not super repetitive, unlike its predecessor, and took about 16 hours for me to complete. I also finished all of the side missions and outposts to three stars. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the game. After Far Cry 5's storyline was ""meh"" (despite having beautiful graphics and fun stealth mechanics), I was intent to wait for Far Cry 6 to go on sale some time after release. I think this game rekindled the fire for Far Cry and showed me again what it could be. Lots of great challenges, great scenery and graphics as usual, and the classic enemies you love to hate. I'm not sure why this game didn't get more attention, but I know that I'll most certainly be tuning in for the series' next installment later this year.

The environment is one of the ""only"" good things about this game, with pretty much everything else feeling like a cheap knockoff of the Far Cry series.

I've 100% Far Cry 5 and had a blast doing so, but this game does not even make me want to 50% it due to reasons here:
- Horrible UI
- Shitty gun play (feels worse than every other Far Cry)
- Basic Story
- MICRO TRANSACTIONS FOR ALL UPGRADES (Not forced however)
- Stealth feels useless (Can be detected from a mile away)
- Shooting has very little feeling, more like a point and click adventure.
- Awful health bars above every enemy and animal.
- Empty world space (the optional places feel useless)
- Perk system is waay worse than Far Cry 5
- The fucking fonts are basic on the introduction scenes lol
- Etc.

+Gunplay. It's not the best I've ever seen but it's well done and enjoyable.

+Good ties to Far Cry 5. You see how some characters have grown up, got children, and how some never did grown up.

+Soundtrack. Some amazing tracks and some good ones. Overall very nice.

+I like the post apocalyptic re-design of the weapons.

+It gets rid of the repetitiveness  of the main missions from 5 where you do a couple of missions then blow up a building then repeat.

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

-Glitches. My god. I played this game 3 months after release and it's still buggy. Missions won't finish and require a restart. Following NPCs is a chore since they never go to the mission and hunt anything outside their path and start trouble with nearby enemies I can't even see. Whenever I fast traveled I got a glitch that has a chance of maybe 75% happening, the statistic is out of my ass but to me, It genuinly happened most of the times, I cannot move when fast travelling. I have to fast travel again to another place then back and hope it doesn't happen again. or I have to die completely then respawn. Also happens when you fast travel but sky dive. You just stand there in the air.

-Unfortunately it takes a lot of the negatives of 5's story. Slow pace, nothing is meaningful.

-Bad villains. like really bad. Cliche to the bone.

-As much as it is a [i]sequel[/i] to 5. It really isn't. Yeah it has some characters from before but nothing really happens. At the end they just tie some loose ends very forcefully.

-Silent protagonist. I just don't like them. i might tolerate them in a choice based game but not in this.

-RPG elements feel tacked on. All they do is make the main mission's impossible without grinding out to get more resources to put in the camp so you can just get [i]stronger[/i] weapons to be able to damage the enemies.

-Because of the RPG elements. There is no longer weapon customisations. Which is a bummer. Weapon you like but not the scope you like? Too bad.

-Only 1 new weapon. [i]one![/i]. They are lazy as lazy can be.

-It shares a problem with 5. Weapons are below your armpit so you can't really see them while your playing. It just looks dumb. I like to admire my weapons while playing an FPS, Not see the tip of their nose!. And don't come to me with ""it's more realistic!"" [b]You can double jump in the game![/b]

-Near the middle of the game Joseph seed gives you some extra skills that are superhuman. I like them, like double jumping and super strength and stealth. But while playing CO-OP, It doesn't transfer to your buddy.

-MTX. Most skins are now purchasble with the [i]far cry currency[/i] but in order to actually make you pay, Unlike 5 where it was easy to get them, Now you have to do a single camp multiple times and every time there's a percentage to get 1/4 from the armor set specific to that camp.

-Recycling of NPCs. I saw the same NPC like 8 times. And she isn't a background character, She gives you the treasure missions like 5.

-Typical Ubisoft open world design of filling the map with boring things to collect and do.

-I did all the of the main missions and unlocked nearly every specialist and partner and did most of the side missions I got and still I haven't unlocked the whole map. This game barely uses it's map. Unlike far cry 5 where I unlocked it all while normally playing.

Its Far Cry, but about 1/3 of what you would expect. This shouldve been $15 FC5 dlc 

Ok for $8.
Total ripoff for $40.
Dont buy the Deluxe as its just useless skins and junk. 

-22 story missions. 
-A whopping 8 side missions. 
-Expeditions that basically just repeat themselves with harder difficulties. 
-30 outposts, but its actually only 10 and you can do them 3x each with harder difficulties and get more resources. 
-Horrible antagonists with terrible dialogue, (hope you like the F word repeated over and over). --Over 100 locations will collectible resources, but you dont really need to do much of them because the main/side missions are so short. 
-Dog companion is the best. He is the best boy.
-You can change your outfits, but only get to see them in a few cutscenes so its basically pointless. 
-Joseph still rambles on about cultist crap and other nonsense and is annoying as usual. --Ending tried to make me feel compassionate for the antagonists...Nope, y'all mofo's can die a slow miserable death.

They have changed the formula for Farcry games for a while now and in my opinion is only making the game go downhill, even though this is a full price game it is filled with enough bugs and glitches or even AI issues that you would most likely encounter at least a handful in a play through of the game. I am or was a fan of the Farcry series but the direction that the team producing Farcry is heading not a good one as there was a lot of weird/terrible decisions featured in Farcry New Dawn. For example, why is there paid micro-transactions in a singleplayer story game? and i know there will be people who says that there is multiplayer gameplay and it isn't fair to call it a singleplayer game but the co-op experience doesn't do anything for the game at all, it's the same content that you play in singleplayer without a dumb AI companion running around. Speaking of content, there is no replayability, there isn't anything cool that you get hunting unique animals, there isn't anything you can do with the base or ethanol after you maxed it out so its just sitting there,there is no point to leveling up certain skills as they have little to no use, you can scrap the outpost for ethanol that you don't need(after a certain point). 

I'm just writing down what comes to mind as i write this review so it might not even be coherent but so is this game.

If i knew how the gameplay and systems was like before purchasing Farcry New Dawn, I would have payed for a game that actually deserve my time and money.",1679427781,1679427781,False,4,2,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False

This game ties up some of the loose ends left in Far Cry 5 and gives a satisfying conclusion to the story of Joseph Seed however it isn't without faults. It removed many of the things I liked about FC5 and things I did not like. It is much more grindy, lay heavily into crafting new weapons and vehicles with resources that supposed to be scarce but you end up with so many that it doesn't really matter, adds base building that is relatively unimportant visually and story wise, and the driving force of any Far Cry games, while compelling are underdeveloped and could of heavily benefited from more interactions and backstory. However, it is not a bad game, the gunplay is awesome, something as a gun nut, I appreciate a game trying to at least be somewhat accurate at time to functionality and appearance. My favorite guns of FC5, the Sin Eater and MG42 made a reappearance which was great.  The graphics are great just like in the original however the varied scenery of FC5 is not as noticeable and certainly seeing Purple everywhere gets old after awhile. The Highwaymen are some of the coolest looking bad guys in the series in my opinion, I love the design behind them and once I got my hands on a highwayman outfit, that is what I wore for the rest of the game. Also, one of my main complainants with most Ubisoft games on Steam is that they do not have Achievements. In the end, I wish the game was a little longer storywise, more things to do on the side that aren't repetitive, and the Twins, the main villians, to be a little better developed however it was a blast to play at times and the Treasure hunts were fun. I would suggest you get it on sale in the Far Cry bundle like I did.

Instead of weapons doing real damage to every enemy, it can takes entire mags to kill one dude. The fact that dumping 20 rounds into a bear's head doesn't kill it is frustrating and moronic. FC5 allows you to (usually) kill an enemy instantly with a headshot, encouraging accurately placed shots instead of spray and pray. Weapon tier system is trash, AND they removed weapon customization so screw you, you can ONLY use weapons that come with a suppressor pre-attached if you want to use stealth. Saw gun thing is okay, but I really don't like using it. Only real benefit is it's ricochet mechanic.

Same exact gameplay as FC5, yet botched. Enemies instantly see you half of the time, so stealth is idiotically difficult. Ubisoft decided to change keys around, so parachute is now ""f"" instead of the spacebar and you can no longer use the scroll wheel to switch between weapons. Why would they do this? FC5's controls flowed nicely, then this game comes along and scrambles it up.


Scavenged parts system is fine, considering it's semi-post-apocalyptic. It's cool to see old characters. If want to buy it on sale, fine, but know it's not nearly as good as FC5, which wasn't especially ""good"" to begin with.",1679107622,1679107622,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The twins make little sense and is a huge step down from joseph seed as the main antagonists. They have so little backstory nor motivation towards why they would murder and pillage. There's really no good explanation how their group started nor why so many people would follow or join this strange group. 

It just wierd that the biggest group of people would be some murdering mauraders while we have ""normal"" civilized poeple building new communities next door.

The good: a relatively slick, polished game that could be said to refine the Far Cry formula. More streamlined than Far Crys 3, 4, and 5 - in a good way. Looks and sounds very good; runs almost flawlessly. On my first play-through (2021), I had a solid 60fps maxed out at 1440p on my system of the time (i7 9700k, GTX1080, 16GB RAM). The game delivered over 50hrs on my first play-through. Playing a second time two years later, I streamlined things considerably by using fast travel and skipping some dialogues. This cut the play-time to just under 30hrs. The story is moderately compelling and generally doesn't impede the free-play mayhem until later in the game. The (still expansive) open world edit of Far Cry 5's Hope County focusses the gameplay. The mechanic of repeatedly taking outposts with more alarms, rewards, and higher-level enemies works well. Repeatable away missions to other, smaller, play areas were a nice addition. Also fun were the light puzzles and problem solving sequences involving hunting down parts at locations or opening abandoned prepper stashes. This is something that might be developed further as it provides a relaxing counterpoint to combat. 

The less good: certain game mechanics that impede player choice and/or bear witness to weaknesses in writing. For example, the repeatable away missions to seven other locations are a great idea and generally fun, but I disliked the 'hold the fort' mechanic at the conclusion of these missions, where you have to hold enemies at bay for a few minutes whilst waiting for a rescue heli. The option to perform these missions entirely via stealth (a la the outposts in the main game space) would seem more in keeping with the overall logic of the game. Later in the game, there is a somewhat frustrating race-the-clock sequence of rescuing hostages before bombs go off. More puzzles that the player can solve at their leisure and that, perhaps, flesh out the story would seem more in keeping with the open-world game-play that, in my view, is the strength of the Far Cry franchise. Finally, the end-game sequence includes a couple of boss fights. Whilst this is a matter of personal taste, I found these slug-fests a bit tiresome.

On the whole, Far Cry New Dawn did not engage me quite as much on a second play-through, but was still enjoyable overall. The open-world gameplay, taking down outposts via stealth, etc., and the RPG-esque ability to upgrade your character and weapons were, for me, the most appealing parts of the game. Like many similar games out there, things can become less enjoyable when, in its drive to tell its story, New Dawn forces the player into more linear, pre-scripted scenarios and sequences - but I admit that this is very subjective.",1609449567,1678576440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The antagonists are by far the LEAST intimidating and THE WORST characters written into a video game. Throughout the campaign, the main character (you) are placed into situations you could easily get yourself out of and kill the Sisters, quickly ending the game.  From being disarmed (Multiple times) and chained to the ceiling like an idiot, these are only a few moments where the Sisters prance around, acting tough, and being incredibly cringey until you scream at the monitor in frustration over the horrible writing. 

They could have made these two Sisters WAY more intimidating and interesting. Not two dimensional and fucking annoying. Just like the entire soundtrack to this game in particular. 

Do yourself a favor........skip this game and grab FarCry 6. Which is superior in every way!

Post apocalypse Montana isn't that different from the open world of Montana in FC5: just with mutants, radiation, and people LARPing Mad Max in full cosplay with live ammunition. The story takes place years after the ending of 5, though it does give you some follow up and ties up some loose ends. If you were disappointing by the ending of 5, this might make up for that, despite how predictable things tend to get as it seems Ubisoft still uses much of the same formula with their writing.

If there's anything different to be said about gameplay, its that its FC5 with just more options to be ridiculously OP by mid to late game. With the Gifts of Eden you get berserker damage, invisibility, and double jump all while unaccounting for the workbench that lets you craft weapons and upgrade them to absurd amounts of damage. By endgame, with the combination of skills and upgrades, you'll likely have more bullets and rifle rounds on you than the entire US with more missiles than a rogue nation overcompensating for penis envy, while being nearly invisible to most enemies until you decide to finally give them every flavor of death you have. Expeditions make an appearance in this game, which is welcome due to the amount of materials you get from them and can farm them which brings me to one of the drawbacks: the grind. This game is more grindy than FC5, waaaay more. You always have room to increase certain skills, you can always upgrade your guns just a slight more. Sky is the limit with how far you can push your ammunition capacity in addition to weapon damage and throwable capacity. If there is a cap, I sure don't know about it, and I'm already capable of holding dozens of rockets, and thousands of bullets and flamethrower fuel. Once you get to midgame/endgame, it really does feel like just an exercise in how broken you can get.

Do I recommend? Sure, if you don't mind the material grinding. Otherwise its just FC5 with a post apocalypse paint job and super powers.",1678221376,1678221376,True,15,3,0.684749245643615723,0,True,False,False

This has kind of been somewhat of a thread with Far Cry games in and of the past but in essence on older technologies it wasn't such a big deal only that today with really beefy hardware it's a bit of a shame really.  As the saying goes: Can it run Crysis? But, can it run Far Cry?

The game is playable and enjoyable enough though, even though somewhat janky with framerate drops in certain areas and during certain situations which isn't the end of the world because overall it feels smooth enough, I just wish that it ran more stable/consistent on higher frame rates but the content is really what matters here and this is what I really like about these games and generally from Ubisoft games, is that the games are in essence fun to play and offer decently good storylines with pretty good voice acting and action. Again, optimalization could and should be better IMHO but that is looking and hoping to the future for.

(Far Cry) Games do look amazing though, and this is I think a balance that's been struck between performance and visual quality that has to sacrifice some smoothness in order for its presentation to be in effect as it is.

Talking of quality, I really enjoy the storytelling that is interweaved with basically constant action in game and in a way since Far Cry 3 (Far Cry 1 and 2 had sort of a minimalistic approach to storylines/storytelling but that doesn't mean that those were bad) this has been something of a reoccurring theme and something that has been keeping me coming back for more, because next to the casual/loose/funny/entertaining storytelling the game has the tendency to sometimes make a serious point in its (literal) storytelling just like with some scenes it depicts so whenever a new game comes out I tend to think what will it be and to wonder, what will it show next? Opposite to just always complaining how the formula is copy and paste in which sense as the old adage goes: if it's not broken, why try to fix it?

I am kind of fine with it.

I like what is on offer here and hope that there will be more games brought out by Ubi, here on Steam and in a way hope that it will be possible ea. that the company will have a long life to continue to give.",1678052622,1678053948,True,4,0,0.576842844486236572,0,True,False,False

Better game than 5 in story, performance, graphics, gameplay, gun and enemy variety, and polish. But in doing so it feels like this is the game that 5 was meant to be or at least the mechanics and lvl of polish of this was suppose to be on or a part of 5 and was instead cut so they could push out 5 half baked and rebundled and resold the good ideals as this game. It feels like blood dragon but IMO better with a better story but loses to blood dragon in humor, self awareness, satire, and crazy weapon types (no lazer ninjastars and portable mini guns). I do feel it's a bit pricey, about 10 dollars more than it should be priced and that if you own five, you should definitely play this one, but wait for a sale especially if you bought 5 full price. However if you're a new player or a fan of the series and didn't play 5 I would say this is a must buy but again the price is a bit much for a non-mainline game so buy at full price if you're truly interested else wait for a sale. Also I would recommend you skip five completely. This is a much more fun game and feels like the snappy gunplay you expect from a FC game where 5 did some strange things so that all the guns felt very samey and also introduced projectile speed where every other FC game was hit scan. The damage in 5 was also tweaked in a weird way so that technically on paper different guns did different damage but in practice almost all guns took the same number of shots to down the same enemies with few exceptions. For example even though revolves in 5 deal 1 or 2 points (out of ten) more damage than most other pistols, it felt like they took the same number of shots to kill most enemies. Only difference was that the other pistols had less recoil, faster fire rates, and could support attachments including silencers.

All that changes here. Each gun feels unique again and they all have interesting feelings that differentiate them. No longer are all revolvers the exact same and barely stronger than non revolver pistols with the lack of attachements. Now in this game magnum type pistols do much more damage than their regular counter parts and you can feel that in the form of significantly few shots to kill. Non hand cannon guns have their own advantages such as better handleing, more ammo, better accuracy and fire rate, all things that truly make them still viable with reduced damage where as in 5 the handling and damage difference was barely noticable but the accuracy and recoil felt like the only major difference. Unfortunately you can't select your attachment of choice but this forces a variety of gameplay styles and gun types that didn't exist in 5 cuz everything there was so similar. People might not like being unable to customize but the way it was done in 5 stripped variety and worth from guns in the same class with few exceptions. Here each gun feels like it has a role and works well. For example a rifle with a bayonet will let you do take downs on enemies who have spotted you if you have a running start and they are faster to transition from melee and shooting than regular melee, ever so slightly.

Cons:

However nothing is all sunshine and rainbows. This game is filled to the brim with microtransactions and completely designed with them in mind. Nothing is hard to get but they system is there to remind you that it is there to capitalize on everything. Every weapon can be upgraded to do an extra 5 percent more damage of it's base value and this can done infinitely and the price to do so doesn't change. There are certain skills that are also like that such as the amount of ammo you can carry or med packs you can have at one time. Weapon upgrades cost resources you can farm or pay for. It's annoying but the upgrade system further fosters the variety by allowing a player to upgrade the damage of a gun they like even if it's not legendary teir to a level more powerful than a legendary. But yes the game is designed to keep you grinding and if you like the gameplay loop of classic farcry then this is for you but it will get old very very quick because of how small scale this game is and the lack of a new game plus mode. The materials for weapon upgrades are easy to get but if you pay money you can ""buy""-pass grinding completely which is where this milk machine shows it's true colors. I haven't started a new game yet so I don't know if upgrades to weapons carry over and only your character is reset but whatever the case the microtransactions are completely not worth it and shouldn't be in the game

Edit: Last I remembered, you lose all your upgrade progress on weapons, gear, and skills if you start a new playthrough. Like I said, no NG+.

Conclusion:
This game is only good for the story and gameplay and they are very fun with nice characters and could have been so much more. It's great given how short it is though and I'm actually impressed that this game got me to remember the story more than all of FC5. You do lose a fair bit of impact if you didn't play FC5 and imo it definitely does make new dawn feel a lot better knowing the context of 5 and how much certain characters have to change to with the world. Former badasses are nobodies now and old enemies have new purpose and reflect on what they've done. You get to judge if it was right or wrong.",1550763882,1676851970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I originally wanted to play as Rook again, I'm actually glad that wasn't the case. Seeing what *was* our character a shell of their former self was just devastating. Especially bringing them around other characters and hearing their interactions.

It's easily possible that I missed notes, recordings, and graffiti, but one little flashback is not enough for me. If anything, Rook falls in line with the franchises previous villains more than Mickey and Lou could ever hope. They both came off like a pair of brats that were having a tantrum, and the only real depth added to them is at the end. Ethan is the exact same. He wanted something, didn't get it, and proceeded to have a tantrum.

Fixing and adding onto Prosperity seemed interesting at the start, as did re-exploring Hope County, but it wore off very quickly. Especially with the repeatable outposts.

It's not necessarily a bad game, but sometimes it does just feel like nothing more than a reskin of far cry 5
The base building aspect is cool, but apart from letting you craft a couple new items, it serves as nothing more than a story building system, although it does force you to go out and explore in order to upgrade, which i find quite cool.

I'm actually a fan of the antagonists, the calm/crazy aspect of them and how they essentially balance each other out is quite cool. I just wish they played a bigger role in the story.

The lack of currency is definitely this game's biggest drawback from both a lore and gameplay standpoint, let's take the Fallout franchise, for example, lore wise, society and the world as a whole are ravaged and destroyed, with a few pockets of civilisation here and there, yet they still manage to have a semi-functional currency system, while in this game, where lore-wise society is rather restored and functioning, they rely on the trade of raw materials, gameplay wise, you'll almost always find that you have an excess of materials, sort of rendering the whole system useless, while in far cry 5, i often found myself short on cash.

Other than that, the core gameplay loop differs from fc5 only slightly, while this could be seen as a negative, i'd say it's a positive, because it retains what made fc5 good

overall, i'd give it a 7/10, it's defo worth picking up and playing and not as bad as people make it out to be, but it has its drawbacks",1676548452,1676548619,True,29,0,0.737775981426239014,1,True,False,False

Now... there is a lot of talk about this game being some shallow reskin of Far Cry 5, and that really couldn't be farther from the truth. I'd go so far as to say that people who garner that opinion have probably barely played the game and likely just sat there AFK in order to get some hours in order to make their review look legitimate. Yes, there are some locations from the original story that survived for the sake of this games story, like Jacobs ranch being re-purposed as the Prosperity settlement. But that is because the game IS the sequel to Far Cry 5 and takes place years after humanity has begun to repopulate - in Hope County. Most of the locations are new and original, overtaken by plants and wildlife changed by the Bliss and radiation.

Now, the gameplay is essentially the same as FC5 with a few tweaks and even some supernatural powers near the end (getting that double-jump is the best thing to ever happen in a FC game). There is a clear attempt to make FC more RPG oriented and it comes off more like a excuse to hide a butt-load of secrets and player choice options. Like, Ubisoft REALLY wanted people to explore and dig into this world. The 48 hours I have played this game do not include completing all of the challenges, buying all the weapons, vehicles, or even all the difficulty versions of the expeditions. Nope, and I didn't obtain all the cosmetic options and costumes yet either. Holy crap!

One major issue, in my opinion, is that the vehicles are underutilized (which I found to be a issue in FC5) but here its even worse. For all the cool rides you can buy and play with, there really isn't any reason to do anything with any of them. There is literally multiple tiers of vehicles and I used them for maybe a quarter of the game. The rest of it, I spent just running around because I was doing challenges and collecting everything in all the areas/conquering all the tiers of each base. This game, THESE games, really need more vehicle challenges so we can use these cool vehicles we can get.

Anyhow, I'd say this is a definite gem. It's best played after a whole lot of FC5, and it'll give you a little something different when it comes to after-world asthetics, yeah?",1593906435,1675221504,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The weapon system was also heavily downgraded just to make a false sense of difficulty to the game. My only positives are that the game itself looks very vibrant and nice. The other positives, they already perfected in FC5 and just took the assets over. Overall, Far Cry New Dawn should've been an additional DLC to Far Cry 5 that isn't worth its retail price.

Honestly, its a shame this game got slept on. Its gunplay is fun, and it takes a lot of mechanics from FarCry 5
that I thought could use some improvement and fixes them.

Previously you were kind of disincentivised to do side quests and radiant rescue missions, because it gave you Resistance Points and would get you kidnapped into a mandatory story mission when you were just trying to drive across the county to unlock a new Gun For Hire. Now instead of Resistance Points you get perk points, which helps you level up faster, so yeah, now I actually want to rescue people I find on the road rather than run away from them.

Supply trucks after a point became useless, because the weapon they'd have in them is already in my inventory. Now they ALWAYS contain craftable ingredients, and the Ethanol trucks that can sometimes spawn will help level up your home base.

Your home base! I love the base building mechanic, not only getting passive perks from upgrading your base but also seeing it visibly change. Now unlocking new vehicles and weapons isn't something you just assume will happen with story progression, you can see what is needed to do it and beeline towards it.

At first I was a bit iffy about the RPG mechanics - health bars over enemies, damage numbers when shooting, tiers of enemyes etc - but it helps me work out if the weapon I have will actually kill an enemy rather than pinging off their helmet, and it works well.

Outposts! Previously you just liberated outposts... cause, well, it was something to do I guess, and SOMETIMES it would unlock garages (but sometimes not even that). Now you get ethanol from them AND you can choose to pillage the place and abandon it, meaning bad guys will come back stronger (and with better loot!)

It even does a good job of tying into the FarCry 5 plot and answering ""whatever happened to that guy?"" without you NEEDING to have played the last game to get it.

Honestly if you like arcade style shooters and post-apocalyptic sessions, this honestly is a pretty fun post-apoc game. You can even use the multiplayer to have a friend tag along.

Overall, FC games are pretty cookie cutter.  This one adds a 4 level rank up to gear and other gameplay elements.  It adds expeditions which are like standalone assault/capture the flag missions.  Crafting is a necessary part of ranking up your gear but isn't too painful.  There is a goofy ""sawblade"" gun that's a bit OP and I'd rather they just didn't have.

The big problem I have with the game is the animal spawns are ridiculous.  I often reach some minor location to find all the bandits dead and some random animal(s) in the area that killed them.  NPCs will be in the middle of quest dialog when *bam* wild animals show up and try to kill us.  The worst are the legendary animals which are max level regardless of your stage in the game and, far from being hard to find, I run into them constantly.  I had one show up right after the Sharky mission right at the exit.  It feels pretty sucky to wipe out an entire base of bandits and then be all ""oh no, a yellow level pig, let's sneak around the long way and hopefully it won't notice us"".

This has to be my third favorite entry into the Far Cry series for the gameplay, it's vast, more brutal than ever, and offers a ton of content for being one of the expansions in the series. Weapons are chunky, stealth is viable, gun-for-hires are diversified and individually useful, and the all new crafting system is great for grinding. 

But f*ck me is the story pretty awful.

The twins, main villains of the game, are boring, stereotypical, and forgettable. They hardly do anything evil and when they do they act like it's AMAZING when it's just meh. Major spoilers ahead.

Joseph Seed returns, with a son. Where did this son come from, and bore from who you may ask? Dunno and dunno. At first, he's very intriguing and entertaining, but as the story progresses it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of the ""good guys"" are equally uninteresting and shallow, save for a few returning characters. But their characters are barely built upon either. Even when they kill important character A and make it seem like you've known this guy forever and it's such a tragedy, you realize that he had maybe 2-3 minutes of screen time and did absolutely nothing but moan and complain. I understand this isn't a full fledged entry but if you're going to make a semi sequel then at least put some effort into the story. 

I don't let this take away from the fun, though, because there is plenty more gameplay than story and that's what you really play this game for anyway. I hope to see implementations of the gameplay loop reused in FC6 if it EVER COMES TO STEAM BECAUSE I AM NOT GONNA BUY IT FROM THE GODFORSAKEN UBISOFT STORE BECAUSE F*CK UBISOFT AND F*CK UPLAY THEY SUCK AND I HATE THEM

In the Aftermath, we see a transformed Hope County & a plot that one part Borderlands & another Fallout inspired.  We're reintroduced to some characters that was seen in the original Far Cry & visually Hope County in a Post FC5 looks beautiful visually.

Everything you've done in Far Cry 5 can be done, but you're operating a Base and upgrading it this time, but much of the game world is excluded(the areas which were Jacob & Faith Seed's areas are left out in New Dawn mainly with slight exception to the Prison Complex).  Combat is about the same as FC5, you interact with the world, hunt & trade your spoils for parts, seeking out treasure hunts, with the upgrading of the homebase, you also allow yourself to craft better weapons from Common to Elite Tiers, and the same goes for vehicles whether Ground, Sea or Air though limited on those.  As for Outpost Liberation, there are quite a few in the area, but one option added is the option to Scavenge Ethanol after a Liberation which basically makes the Highwaymen take it over again and you gotta take it over on a harder difficulty.

Story was Meh, but it had everything that made it Far Cry, but since it's a spinoff there's no DLC & it is scaled down from FC5.

Starting a new game can sometimes require a bit of patience, especially when you have to do what the game wants you to, instead of what you want to do. Getting into the story, meeting people, with a whole land to explore and discover is however something I really love! I love the randomness of just choosing where to go and doing something there!

Much like in Far Cry 5, we now have another pair of bad guys (girls?) running stuff, making life miserable in Hope County, Montana. You're weak, you have more or less nothing except for what you pick up, and all you gotta do is get a move on, and start working.

Everything is so worth exploring, because it can only get you stronger, and you get to know what the hell happened in this place! You reach a certain point where things get easier, but also again harder. I played on HARD-ASS difficulty and felt I had control through the entire game, but ofc...sometimes you die...sometimes you die alot.

After completing everything, I finished the game, and even though I felt I had enough of the game in the end, I really had much fun with it, just like the other Far Cry games. Just buy it.

On top of that, the story is meh, the dialogue is cringe, and I want to shoot all of the characters - not only the enemies, but the supposed allies as well. In fact, I want to shoot the allies more than I want to shoot the enemies.

The issue with Far Cry (and Ubi games in general) is not that they keep repeating the same basic formula, it's that the execution is always shoddy, and the same issues appear again, and again, and again.

Pros:
- doggy and big ass murder piggy as companion choices
- some of the mutated wildlife looks cool
- the map twist this time is pretty cool with weird flower fields and such, very nice
- the shotguns feel nice, but they are also the only somewhat useful weapons in the game, so this is not really a good point

For the uninitiated, the main Far Cry series has become something of a mildly absurd take on Dictators or the Apocalypse or some other very dramatic scenario, that is then followed by what I refer to as 'half games'. What amounts to a very big, stand alone expansion. However, in New Dawn's case, it's the only one (so far) that is remotely narratively connected to the events of its associated full game. That said, almost all Ubisoft games reference at least some other Ubisoft game.

I will also state that these half games started after Far Cry 3. Far Cry 1 and 2 remain unique entries in the overall series ‚Äî I have not yet played Far Cry 6 at the time of writing. FC3 has Blood Dragon, FC4 has Primal. FC5 ‚Äî New Dawn.

[h3]There's one major flaw with this game[/h3]
You may be aware that Ubisoft recently left Steam and has now slowly made their way back, as a result many of their titles do not have Steam achievements. Well, who cares, right? The game has achievements itself and they unlock things on Uplay ‚Äî conversely, who cares about achievements at all. 

All valid. However, ever since Far Cry 3, this series has become a checklist simulator. Without said achievements, personally speaking, the 'checklist' aspect of this game feels underwhelming ‚Äî Clear the outpost, find the treasure, climb the tower, open the map, do the random events that show up ‚Äî in fact, this game even allows you to [i]very literally[/i] hand over the taken over outposts back to the perceived enemy such that it increases the difficulty of said outpost and thus rewards you with more resources to upgrade the base. I suppose it's pertinent to mention the idea of the game~

[b]General Premise:[/b]
You'll play as 'Cap', a customizable character that is tasked with recruiting specialists and upgrading the facilities in Prosperity by obtaining resources for both crafting weapons and gear as well as the facilities.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911357223

The cast of characters in Far Cry has always been rather odd, perhaps placed just for levity in an otherwise serious situation. Irreverent.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911356934

The game's map is just a re-imagined version of the map of Montana used in Far Cry 5. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2911357857

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
Much like most game series these days, it's 'more-of-the-same' ‚Äî though, this one feels like it breaks the proverbial fourth wall a bit more than its predecessors regarding its gameplay.

By far the worst antagonist in the series. Completely unlikable with no goals other than to just be complete c#nt$ to everyone. Writers try to redeem them at the very last second but I was so ready to commit domestic violence that it ruined any possible empathy. They were seriously so annoying I would cringe any time they open their mouths. 
Gameplay is super meh, to an offensive extent. Guns and shooting is good, but they really push you towards micro transactions if you don‚Äôt do the lame missions to gather materials. The last bossfight with the twins is SO BAD. They were just bullet sponges that would literally eat dozens of c4 charges AND shots to the head without dying. Meanwhile you are being attacked by dogs which are just as annoying as usual. After that the ending is so unnecessary and ridiculous, I can not put it into words. Just google it and be completely confused. 
To sum it up, it is an EVEN MORE UNFINISHED version of far cry 5 without the redeeming attributes such as interesting characters. At least ubisoft had the mercy to end it in half the time of the other games. Despite this, it is worth 5 bucks on sale, but I would be furious if I paid full price for this medicore game. Even at $10 I feel ripped off though.

Take Far Cry 5, throw out half of the good stuff, keep all the flaws, sprinkle some additional artificial difficulty on top and wrap it in saturated magenta wrapping paper. That's how you get Far Cry New Dawn.

Here are some things they added that make this game so much worse than the others:
- Stupidly long reload times. Just adds artificial difficulty to stretch out playtime. It also constantly ruins the flow of combat.
- Unnecessary Tier System. Basically turns enemies into bullet sponges if you don't have the equivalent tier weaponry against them. Once again, unnecessary difficulty.
- Sprinkling crafting materials across the entire map and forcing you to hunt for them. Just another way to artificially extend playtime because you need the crafting materials to craft weapons.

See the pattern yet? This game fundamentally lacks enough fun and interesting content. All this artificial difficulty might be tolerable if the game itself is fundamentally fun, but it unfortunately isn't. The NPCs are bland and boring, so you don't particularly care for them. The antagonists feel more like entitled teenage brats rather than a terrifying psychopath, so the cutscenes lack impact.

While the main story is pretty short(only took me 12 hours and I was taking it extremely slow for a second playthrough) the post-game is great. You can upgrade your guns to be wildly OP and just obliterate enemies while retaking outposts or completing expeditions. I bought this game and Far Cry 5 for 20 bucks during the Christmas sale and I believe that's a steal. I would take these two games over Far Cry 6 any day of the week! Please buy this game when it goes on sale again it's well worth the price!

 I hope Ubisoft starts making Far Cry games like this and Far Cry 5 again. The mute protagonist allows you to create whatever character or characteristics you want for your player! The customization on the otherhand is VERY watered down or even non-existent compared to Far Cry 5. You can't customize aspects of your gun and there is a very limited amount of outfits in the game. The story is short but sweet same with the map. Personally, I'm fine with them reusing the Far Cry 5 map. I think it adds more lore and character to this side of the Far Cry world. Similarly, it was a joy catching up with the cast from the original game. This game feels more like a continuation or extension of Far Cry 5 and I LOVE IT for that! 

At the end of the day, if you hated Far Cry 5 than you'll most likely hate this game. But please give it a shot. For 10 bucks on sale this game is a STEAL! I would even call it better than Far Cry 6!!! While I still haven't been motivated to even finish the Far Cry 6 campaign I have loved grinding both this game and Far Cry 5's post-game.",1672117351,1672117351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The weapons are extremely under powered.  It takes 30 to 40 shots to take out anything over rank 1.  Even the sniper rifles need multiple shots to take down anything over rank 1.
The skill tree is really weird also...  It's like they just didn't put much effort into it.
Don't get me started on the aggressive animals.  They just attack ALL the freakin' time.  Try to sneak around a base, get attacked by a cougar...  try to run overland, get attacked by a bear, or a moose, or a dog, or a boar...  it just doesn't let up.

So I was genuinely happy when I finally completed this game, I was glad it was over...
The storyline is extremely short (12 main missions in total!). The game can be completed in around 5 hours if you didn't have to spend time upgrading your base and finding components for better weapons. 
The levelling system in this game is pathetic, the enemies have 4 levels ranging from, I could sneeze and kill them, all the way to unloading over 200 rounds of ammo to remove half of their health bar. 
I know that it is based on the Far Cry 5 map, but this is the most cut down game I have experienced - the number of outposts has been cut down, and the only way to make up for that is by allowing you to essentially hand it back to the enemy so you have to take it down again - with the caveat that the opponents are going to be more difficult the next time you try to take it and you get some base building material from it.
Also, compared to Far Cry 5, stealth is much harder, the enemies can see you much further, can fill up their spotting bar much much faster and their hearing is incredible - this all makes for a frustrating experience if you enjoy playing stealth.
Another issue is that the gun levelling system is stupid, 'oh look ive put some ducktape on a rifle increasing its damage by 100%'. So the level 1 assault rifle will take over 1000 rounds to kill a level 4 standard enemy, stick some tape on it and some plumbing components and suddenly it can take them out in 10 rounds. 

My main issue with this game are the two main protagonists, the Twins, are evil for the sake of being evil. Their actions are utterly bewildering. All other Far Cry leaders have reasons for being evil, Vaas was on drugs and being mentally abused, Hoyt was a slaver. Pagan Min was a dictator and they really spent time on his back story. The only redemption of this story is that it completes the character arc for Joseph Seed (The Father), it wasn't the worst ending for him - but the fight with the Twins is ridiculous - The fight with Ethan is stupid too, and has more in common with Dark Souls than it does with any Far Cry game. 

Positives... I do like the base building aspect but I wish every upgrade visually upgraded the base - I want to see what my hard work has achieved. The specialised loot locations are actually ok, some might dislike it (if they like to discover things while out exploring) because the game tells you where to find these components - personally, it forces me to see places on the map that I would probably never visit. The game is very pretty, very vibrant colours and graphically very impressive- however, the game does stutter quite often (even if running on decent hardware).
Overall, not sure I would even recommend this game even if it were on sale at 90% off - just use that money to buy Far Cry 3/4/5 instead, or use that money to save for Far Cry 6 instead.",1671564709,1671564709,False,33,2,0.736708700656890869,0,True,False,False

A little weird how most of them were silenced at Tier 2 / 3 and 4. I really liked the Tier 4 Blood dragon bow with explosive rounds. Would have been nice if there was a sniper rifle with a better zoom in like 8 or 16x considering there was 3 or 4 tiers of sniper rifles.

The outpost takeover and retake over was nice. A nice challenge taking on epic and elite enemies. Expeditions were awesome too.  That was a nice touch.  

I felt like this game came up a little short. I like the Far cry series, they usually chock the game full of goodies but New dawn felt like they rehashed FC5's map and characters and just added ""enough""  considering they have put out a lot of titles. I think they easily could of added some content. The map itself was altered after the nuke and its like the mountains disappeared and a huge flowing river came out of it as well. I think they dropped the ball, the map could of been GTA V big.

 You had the story mode which was short. The outposts for your base and  expedition was to make up for that i guess ?

  I dunno, they could of put in some extra missions or side stories, find some aliens and a cool alien weapon. Maybe some ppl got mutated Fallout style and you got hunting them.  You could only fly from a air drop, no real mountains, grappling was once in a blue moon.

Other than what i mentioned, a solid game, could have been a little bit more and hope 6 is bigger and better than this game.  I would hate to think Ubisoft is like EA and cookie cuttter the frig  aka butcher a game.  Ubisoft delivers.",1671054157,1671056678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story: A very engaging but very short story in terms of cut-scenes and character back story. The story mostly is stretched out by needing to upgrade various attributes to easily beat the remaining story missions. 

Graphics: The game looks beautiful even without the graphics update. Keep in mind this will depend on your PC. A mid-end PC should be able to run this game no problem. 

Gameplay: Similar tasks, controls and exploration as any other FarCry game. Lots of weapons, tools and options for taking over outposts. It is a huge improvement that outposts are now re-playable at higher difficulties when you choose to. Most of the world is open right from the beginning after you reach your new base. 

Value: For getting it on sale it was worth it for about 30 hours of fun. The last 10 hours was me just chasing around all the collectables I missed. I probably won't play this again but moving on to other games. There just isn't much to replay value once you have finished the game.

As a post-Apoc game it is ridiculous: very little radiation, no human mutations, animal mutations that have done little more than change the color of their antlers. 

As a Far Cry game it isn't bad.  Much better than FarCry 5, the source of both the map and the assets used in this game. Not once did the game pull me out of exploration and base-attacks to follow some stupid story. FarCry 5 did that to me constantly. It may not be as big as it's papa, but it has more than enough since it costs less. 

When the game first came out I got it for $40 for the Play Station. It is probably worth that to any fan of the franchise that doesn't need a compelling story. The two female villains are just as realistic as the comic book villain of Far Cry 5, except in this game you can avoid dealing with them most of the time. 



conclusion

If you can, get it on sale. Unless you must have to see deer with maroon antlers. It is a bit of a cash grab. New story, old assets. Same experience as any other Far Cry game.",1670275299,1670275931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(I'd recommend playing on easy to have a good time)

[b]what I like:[/b]
- Game is aestheticly pleasing.
- The weapon system is really good, better than far cry 5.
- Story is incredible and alot different that I had expected.
- They took alot of the good parts from far cry 5 and left the bad parts out.

[b]what I don't like:[/b]
- radio music is kinda awful alot of the times

I would give this a 9/10 and I'm definitively gonna play it again in the future :)

All the things FC5 did well have been removed, virtually no weapon personalization which I enjoyed even in its mediocre form on FC5, Its not a big deal, but why remove it?

Gameplay has changed from having fun tackling outposts in the FarCry way whether with stealth or Wide open combat, to basically its always war. And everything is a bullet sponge and basically nothing does damage unless its a ""High Rank"" weapon which is stupid... just give me weapon stats and let me build my way to play from there.

To go hand in hand with that crap, ubisoft has yet again created a pay to play which is annoying as hell. I tried to enjoy it but as someone who put well over 300 hours into FC5 on Xbox with friends, this is a huge downgrade.

For start, I think it's one of the worst post-apocalyptic games I ever played. The setting feels naive and childish, like Madmax mixed with Wasteland and put into kindergarten lunchbox.
There is pink colour everywhere, which feels annoying at some point, the Highwaymen gang looks like circus clowns - guys like these would be cut down one by one by peggies survivors in no time. What can I tell if they turn their music (kinda cringy and out-of-place looking in this setting) on full in outposts. They walk into motorcycle helmets all the time and that looks stupid.
But two main nails in the coffin of this antagonists are their bosses - two wanna-be Harley Quinn twin sisters. You feel no threat when you see them, the only time they really beat your ass is when your protagonist makes dumb move to let them look cool. They are the definition of ""A lot of bark but no bite"". Honestly, I was hoping the real gang boss will show up after I finish them off, but no, these clowns is all the game has to offer. You just cant take them seriously and feel yourself like an adult in the room of unfamiliar first-grades in McDonald's happy birthday party.
About killing these walking graffiti markings - they have levels now. And I was pretty surprised when I decided to clear my first outpost three times in a row (yes you can clear any outpost an infinite amount of time now, mainly to get an X currency and some outfit parts) and noticed that to kill 2 elite soldiers which spawn on lvl3 outposts, you need, say, to shoot them like 10 minutes of real time with first-tier weapons you get at the start. And you cannot kill them from stealth - you need a lot of perk points to learn to do that. That felt just disgusting.
To get perk points you still need to complete achievements which became stupid in this part. Like, kill X enemies with low-tier type of weapon, after that medium-tier, etc. Not that hard but but feels poor-made and at some moment you may find out that you did not kill enemies with shit-tier SMGs, for example, and miss some points. After all, you need to spend 2 mags of a gun into enemy to kill them if, said enemy is one-tier higher than your said gun. Looter shooters are just idiotic mess when you need to spend 50 rounds into enemy's head to kill them.
To not die that fast and to kill faster you need currency. A lot of currency types and a ton of each for decent upgrades and guns. So prepare for some grind at the start. And boring looting process. At some point you can perform expeditions which give you wnough materials for one legendary-tier gun craft - so just do that instead of sniffing every rock around for 2 cogs or 1 circuit.
The upgrades of your camp came from FC primal, but now you only need the currency given mainly from outpost clearing. And you now 'must' clear them, if you don't wanna end in bossfight with low-tier weapons or one hp-bar and guarantee yourself hours of 'fun' with them.
To sum cons of perks and currency situation - I have some good news for you - you can get those with one click - and filling up your credit card info tab, because you can pay-to-win here. Yes, like after first minutes in camp you can just upgrade everything to level two and make this game feel easy-breasy with not power of skill, but power of $$$. I see that it works with clothing and transport skins, but when you can literally make your character invincible with microtransaction it just  makes you feel betrayed.
The only good thing this game has to offer is Joseph Seed story part and ending. And still, the fate of our character from previous game - FC5 - who is presented here - is kinda non-logical. The only thing that didn't make me feel like I threw time and money in the void here.
If you are a large fan of Far Cry and FC 5 in particular, you can play this for last hours of story and outposts clearing, otherwise - walkthrough it on YouTube or play some Rage 2.

Far Cry New Dawn has faced its fair share of criticism, in my opinion for no reason. The game looks absolutely beautiful and breathtaking and is a great sequel to Far Cry 5. The game is one of the few games that are actually able to make me feel at home and happy. The story is the main thing most people arent happy with, and to a degree i can understand that. The twins arent really interesting characters and the final boss fights against them are a pain in the ass. But make no mistake, they are just a means to the end. The main story is the one with Joseph, for me at least. The twins are only there to bring a challenge. To bring a reason to defeat outposts, and thats about it. The main part of the story is indeed with Joseph and the people from New Eden. The game perfectly shows human behavior but it also opened my eyes in many ways. The way we destroy and kill just for our own pleasure. Far Cry New Dawn made me aware of a lot of things and i never regretted playing it for a second. Deffenitely check it out :)

Ubisoft makes high quality games when they name their series with a number (Far cry 4, 5, and 6), and in between they desecrate out garbage titles such as Far Cry New Dawn and Far Cry Primal.

This one in particular is especially pathetic and just completely sad because it piggybacks off the ending of Far Cry 5, kinda teasing a worthy sequel. What you will get in return is nothing compared to the caliber of Far Cry 5. You will chase the high Far Cry 5 left you with, and you wont make it 30 minutes until you conclude that playing this trash was a bad decision.

It takes all the good, seriously enjoyable aspects of Far Cry 5, throws them in the air with a bunch of other useless reskins and remodels of the entire game like a tossed salad, and ultimately spits out an unfinished and not well thought out ""Far Cry""

I still haven't finished this game 2+ years later, and I have no intention to do so. It loses me every time I try within 48 hours.

Cons:
Every car drives at like 40mph
No more planes (unless I gotta upgrade the garage or something)
Looter shooter crafter upgrader game. Weapons can get upgraded infinitely, some perks can get upgraded infinitely (though I assume perk points run out at some point). This means that half of the game is hiding from level 3 guys, and the other half is running around punching people's helmets clean off. This also means that the weapons you find are borderline useless.
Some plot points are stupid. [spoiler]There's a bunch of times that you meet the twins, and you could go siko mode on them, but the game makes you wait. After they're gone, you turn the whole base upside down with nothing but your fists.[/spoiler]
The specialists are downright forgettable. I even forgot about Rush. Then they have this scene with everyone around his grave, and the second that cutscene is done, I'm back at Prosperity, and this npc says ""You and Rush sure do great work keeping everything in order"".
The twins especially do this thing after you complete a mission where they'll say ""That was mine meany, I'm going to kill your family"". While it paints them as bad people, it's actually understandable. Every villain (or once was villain) has understandable motivations. Even though this game probably isn't cannon, in this hypothetical Joseph Seed definitely gets ""I told you so"" points. The highway men might be terrible dog eaters, but 1. It's the apocalypse so go ahead, and 2. They have every right to be scared of a dude who can 1v1 fistfight a bear. The twins sending those radio messages are basically just doing the bare minimum to keep them from getting overthrown by the mob.

Pros:
Otherwise, normally the npcs have good lines that detail what's going on in the world.
Some of the lines in the sidequests/specialist missions are absolutely great.
Triple A amenities like great graphics, controller support (With some buttons broken like Far Cry 5), tons of side missions, bases, animals to hunt, fish to catch. Ok stealth, vehicles, gunplay, and of course, online Co-op 2 player multiplayer.
Throwing is still great. Throw your weapons, throw a rock any time you like, throw bodies. What's new (if I remember) is shield throwing. Shields are really fun to pick up for the sole purpose of throwing at enemies.
Some fun weapons, like the saw launcher 2.0, the slingshot, the bats. The upgrade path style of the game kills the fun of all the other ones for me. Even the slingshot/the fists are fun, until you upgrade the hell out of them and become one punch man.

While this game is semi short, fundamentally flawed, and mostly not fun, it's good to have another game on the Far Cry engine. It might not be fun to shoot someone's head 5 times to get their helmet off, but it is fun to throw bait and watch them deal with wild animals. It's fun to throw remote c4 onto a person, punch them and detonate it. This style of game is great for the main line of the Far Cry games, but looter shooter games (even borderlands) have this serious tone to them, like ""I have to take this base over so I can get my upgrades"" and it takes the life out of the game. All of the fun you can have in this game, you have to go out and earn it. In games like battlefield, pubg, even Far Cry 5, you'll find yourself in these situations whether you like it or not. There will be a bear that pops out of nowhere and you gotta fight for your life. There will be a tank and you gotta blow it up. There will be someone else looting in the building you're in and you gotta decide whether to go after them or hide. In Far Cry New Dawn, you just punch that fucking bear and go looking for more bears to punch.
Every pro in the list has some sort of asterisk. 6/10 still good, but there are much better games to waste your time on. (Wow, even the conclusion is an asterisk) I'd just play it for its short story then uninstall.",1668392243,1668392243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Of course that's spoiled by the fact that the game is based around micro-transactions so you'll be forced to grind outposts and expeditions to level up your base and craft higher tiered weapons.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
You need at least some shooting skills. And there are some smaller riddles that you need to solve. 

‚å¶ Story writing (4 = Original)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
It¬¥s overall a good story. The main story is a little bit short for my taste and the game uses many side quests. Additionally, the story felt a little bit superficial. Still, the story has potential and is enjoyable.

‚å¶ Playing Life Span (4 = Playthrough / Multiple days)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
The main quest itself isn¬¥t that long. The main thing is that you are forced to explore the map at some point to farm some levels. This takes a little bit of time. 

‚å¶ Price (3 = Take my money)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
When I bought it it wasn¬¥t cheap. I would¬¥ve wished for more content for that price. It was still a fun playthrough with my friend so I don¬¥t regret anything.

Ingredients
140g plain flour (this is about 200ml/7fl oz)
4 eggs (200ml/7fl oz)
200ml milk
sunflower oil, for cooking
Method
STEP 1
Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8.

STEP 2
Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into two 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or two 12-hole non-stick muffin tins and place in the oven to heat through.

STEP 3
To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in 4 eggs until smooth.

STEP 4
Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper.

STEP 5
Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes.

STEP 6
Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned.

STEP 7
Serve immediately. You can now cool them and freeze for up to 1 month.",1665349994,1665349994,True,0,0,0.467741936445236206,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is 20-25 hours (depending on if you're a completionist), and I know we're circling the drain for good content in a game, but the content is pretty limited and dull. At first I was excited about having a base and allies I could upgrade, but the lack of depth in the base upgrade process (basically just go out and sack Outposts(which you're going to do anyways) for resources), left me wanting more. No quest-lines within the various people you recruited to your cause after recruitment, no special base defenses, etc. The story itself was predicable and flat, and not that long. Upgrading the main base advances the storyline, that's about it. The perk tree (not a tree, just a grid) was small and I had 50+ unspent perk points towards the end with nothing to do.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
 + [b]Upgrades[/b]
I love the total gameplay but what I liked is the upgrade mechanics. I mean you can upgrade anything in this game. You can upgrade your weapons (all of them), and some of your perks are upgradeable as well. And your home base is a bonus! Hope they continue this mechanic.
 
 + [b]Weapons[/b]
I didn't know how to use the piercing ammo until now. The weapons have a lot of abilities that vary depending on the enemy that you'll encounter. Though they removed the customizations which exist in FC5, however, I'm still impressed with what they did on weapon mechanics. Good job!
 
 [h1]Cons[/h1]
 - [b]Achievements[/b]
Again, Ubisoft, let's not put achievements that require an online buddy. Not all of the players have a buddy playing the same game. Come on. 
 
 - [b]Expeditions[/b]
Just like on [i]Achievements[/i], I just hate this mission because it is just fun to play when you're with a buddy (I don't know, maybe I just wanted to play alone). And also, they tied 4 achievements for this mission. What a shame. 
 
 [h1]Neutral[/h1]
 ~ [b]Story[/b]
The story is amazing! For starters, the story takes place right after the FC5. But as much as I like the story, it's just too short. Seems to me this is just like a DLC.
 
 ~ [b]World[/b]
Since this is just a continuation of FC5, expect that the map will be the same, except it is a smaller version and post-apocalyptic setting. But they still managed to create a wonderful post-apocalyptic world (can you believe that?

[hr][/hr]


So, all and all, this is a wonderful game. Buy this if you want a story continuation of FC5 and you enjoy the FC series.  

So the $50 question, should you buy this at full price or not? The short answer is don't. The game is too short and some of the repeating mission is just good to play when you have a buddy. Buy this on sale.",1664374093,1664375522,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is incredibly scattered, and literally everything but the aesthetics feel like an after-thought. Everything is just copied over from Far Cry 5.

I've only ever played this and Far Cry 5, and a little bit of Far Cry 6, but New Dawn is just horrible. I would have preferred it to be a DLC than a stand-alone game.

There are 22 main story missions. Yes, 22. The content is extremely lacking. You will go and take over about maybe 12 outposts. Recruit a few specialists. Recruit a few partners. Then speed through the story with the only obstacle being how much you upgraded your base. Then the twins have B.S. levels of plot armor and your npc friend whom you're supposed to care about somehow always gets captured so you have to go save him so you can be subjected to the Twin's monologueing. And while they are infuriating and makes you really want to get at the twins, they don't hold any semblance of good character or compelling traits.

They're simply extremely blind hypocrites. And then you finally get to fight them in a lackluster mission that doesn't even resolve the problem. Since the game alludes to the highwaymen being controlled by more than just the twins.

They introduced a nice element with expeditions, which each have their own map and the location of the package to steal is random, and the entrance and extraction is random so its really good replayablity.

This game continued the plot from far cry 5. And imho, doesn't do it very well either. But i found it more forfilling than the twins atleast. So I give that a C+ over the Twin's F.

Ubisoft needs to get over themselves in regards to how much they like to cradle their villians.

I suppose I will start with the good parts.

-The guns for hire have a mix of new faces and old. I particularly like the shitkicking grandmother ""nana"".
-the new system of crafting weapons and vehicles in tiers was pretty cool. I actually liked the aesthetic of the weapons, barring the vomit inducing paint schemes you are forced to have on many of them.
-It was fun to drive through areas and go ""hey wait a second I know where i am!""
The game is BEAUTIFUL. I have the advantage of running a very powerful machine but even so, the game looks great.
-There is actually a nice progression system, at least in my eyes. I remember in the previous title you were fairly overpowered from the start but in New Dawn you have to be careful to be equipped for the enemies youre going to be facing.
-*beards and mustaches for male characters*

And now for the bad. Be prepared, this will be a long read.

-First and foremost, the game is WAY too short. Seriously, there is less than half the content in this game than there was in the falls end region in 5. I managed to beat the entire game in a day.
-The guns for hire system was changed to only allow one at a time. This was upsetting because a: it required me to do more work and b: i miss the quips they had with eachother in the last game.
-There isnt any customization to the weapons in the game. Find a rifle you love and would like to put a suppressor on it for stealth missions? Too bad, you gotta see if there is a similar weapon that has one and use that.
-There is a severe lack of customization in the game compared to 5. There are few outfits, no skins for vehicles or weapons and as mentioned before there is no weapon customization.
-While the game looks pretty, the colors are seizure inducing. it seems the developers love hot pink. But on top of that, we also have shit that just doesnt make sense. White deer with red antlers, animals that have somehow evolved bone patterns on their fur, fields and forests of flowers in all kinds of colors. and the water is actually, genuinely blue.
-The map has its recognizable spots, but for the most part I couldnt tell where I was. I beat fc5 three times. I know the map well. I can understand there being some landscape change over almost twenty years but not this much.
-The vehicles are few in number (which is understandable i suppose) and in my opinion all look kind of the same. white paintjob, red decals and weird welded diamond plates everywhere. theyre honestly pretty ugly to look at.
-Most characters from the previous game do not return and their fates remain unknown. That wouldve been fine if it didnt exclude so many characters. 
-Some parts of the map I just never visited because there was nothing to do there except collect resources. by the time i got halfway through the game, i already had more than I needed.
-The lore is far harder to come by. Not so much for lack of it, but the fact I beat the whole game in half the time it took me to fully complete the falls end's section in 5.
-The tier system was cool and all, but it was only there because enemies are tiered too now. There are several sections where your weapons are taken from you and you end up having to use tier 1 weapons against tier 3-4 enemies. Just isnt feasible.

Overall, I am very disappointed in this game. It shouldve been a 20-30 dollar expansion to Far Cry 5.",1662865927,1662865927,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is garbage and the antagonists are the worst in the series by far.
The only redeemable element for solo play is the environmental graphics. The devs responsible for those are on point.

Those saying it's pay to win are kind of off base. You *can* pay for the convenience of a higher tier weapon immediately but all the enemies in the game are scaled to where you are at story wise. Even then you can one shot a tier three enemy with a tier one gun if you break their helmet and get a headshot but by the time you see a tier three enemy, outside of wildlife, you should naturally have tier 3 or 4 weapons.

Difficulty is never an issue with this game since stealth is completely broken, the AI are braindead even when fully alerted by unsilenced gunfire, and toward the end of the story you get sicko mode and just can blitz any outposts with a machine gun.",1604470046,1662770219,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway, here's a short fragment of my experience with the game so far.
I saved a woman from some Highwaymen and seconds later she got killed by a wolverine. Fast forward a few minutes and an outpost I was attacking called in reinforcements who were killed by a couple of skunks which ultimately helped me liberate the camp. After the outpost liberation cutscene, a bison immediately trampled me and was instantly attacked by a bear as I was getting up to run away. A few hundreds of meters away from the previously dangerous location, a wolf jumped me, at which point my ""doggo"" companion Timber [i](which you can pet at your leisure)[/i] fought the wolf long enough for me to take it out [i](I was done running...fu(k it)[/i], [b]AND[/b] he also mauls, mangles and mutilates all my enemies. Oh right - he can also ride with you in vehicles [b]AND[/b] brings you gifts every chance he gets.

Eventually, I decided to return to my settlement and call it a day, only to be welcomed by some random dude who said, and I quote - ""There's an old lady out there called Nana who can shoot the d!ck off a mosquito.""
I decided not to call it a day anymore. I went after her. The rest is history. [b]AND PRIVATE![/b]


But all jokes aside, [b]fu(k me![/b] This entry in the amazing ""Far Cry"" saga, although viewed as more of a huge DLC for ""Far Cry 5"" [i](though you won't be annoyingly kidnapped anymore in this one)[/i], is [b]extremely well optimized[/b], has beautiful graphics, a really cool soundtrack, tons of replayability, an awesome story with some very memorable and unique characters, [b]AND the best and funniest part of it all - it's WAY better than Cyberpunk 2077![/b]

And all this for [i](if you don't get it on sale)[/i] only 45 bucks. What more could you want? It's like ""Far Cry"" and ""Fallout"" had a pink baby! Now I don't know about you guys and gals, but I'm enjoying the heck out of it.
[i](oh, and there's a new, semi-settlement builder mechanic which is actually quite fun and motivating at times)[/i]

conclusion: 
Good game if you are into open world shooters and If you are not (like me) it can still be a good game but may be boring to some. I bought this game in a deal (far cry 3, 5 new dawn premium) for 20 euros and its worth it for that price  so wait for a sale and dont pay 60 euros/dollars for it.

so buy if on sale because you can always refund in <10 hours but you wont

the boss is a different story, i ended up having 1 tier 3 shotgun, 1 tier 2 LMG and 1 tier 2 shotgun, fully loaded with incendiary ammo

had to switch difficulty down on the final bosses to the lowest, and even then it still took me nearly an hour to even get close to beating it, that and the atrocious damage of C4 against enemies, the rpg element of this game is terrible, along with the awesome addition of the final bosses being able to revive each other

i've still not completed it fully as i refuse to get high tier weapons later on in the game since even the best tier 3 cannot even get close to shredding through the end bosses, 

final addition being the prison escape, which at the time the game had not prepared me for
a grueling 2 hours later i had unlocked the proper perk for it and then beat it

Long version: I'm playing this game WAY later than it was released and roughly 3 years after I played the original Far Cry 5 game. New Dawn is an okay game for the most part, but If you liked the story around Far Cry 5 and are expecting MORE Far Cry 5, you are going to be greatly disappointed. The game play is all there fore sure, but THIS story writing is sub-amateur at best, and that's being polite. You're not given very long to make an attempt to care about the characters. The antagonists are a GREAT idea, but poorly executed. The whole time I was left wondering ""why don't I just kill them now? Why go through all this?"" Yes, I realize ""there would be no game then"", but if that's the defense, then that just justifies my claim about the poor story writing. Unless it was $5 and I had nothing else to do for the next 16 +/- hours, I wouldn't waste your time. Just watch a ""Let's Play"" of the game, if one was ever made.

I finished the game before reviewing

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
I liked it. If you can get it cheap on a sale and want an allright open-world FPS with crafting and upgrades then you'll enjoy it.

If you are tired of Far Cry formula then skip it ‚Äì it doesn't do things that much different to peak your interest.

If you like Far Cry formula then this is another variation of it and you will get what you expect for the most part. Do bear in mind that this is probably one of the worst Far Cry games.

[h1]Description[/h1]
It's a goddamn Far Cry game for crying out loud. If you played anything in the series from Far Cry 3 onward then you know what to expect, so I won't describe the game here. Look to my review of Far Cry 4 for a description.

I will, however, talk about features specific to New Dawn:
it uses same map as Far Cry 5, but it's set in a post-apocalyptic future of that area where most of the civilization is now a ruin overgrown with vegetation.
There are resources which can be obtained in many ways, from looting enemies or finding hidden caches to capturing enemy outposts.
crafting is used to make every weapon and vehicle as well as improving some other features like effectiveness of healing. Each weapon/car needs to be unlocked through crafting before you can equip it at a base. You can also loot weapons from defeated enemies, but that won't unlock them for equip at a base ‚Äì you will only have it until you get rid of it. You can also unlock new tiers of weapons and vehicles by upgrading your main base.
Each weapon, vehicle and enemy, even animals, is now tiered from tier 1 to tier 4. Tiering is important to keep in mind because you will do noticably less damage to enemies of higher tier than your weapon. This may lead to some tedious upgrade grind if you don't enjoy the mechanic.
You gain perk points used to buy skills through completing objectives and challenges like killing enemies with specific weapons on each tier. This encourages engaging with enemies and exploring even if it's not a part of a quest.
Other mechanics like buddies (NPCs that follow you and help in combat) or stealth takedowns, throwing rocks to distract enemies, even mission and gameplay structure etc. are very similar to Far Cry 5.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Still as fun as other entries in the series[/b]
I've seen a lot of people complain that Far Cry doesn't evolve and why are people play this series when every game is the same.

It's true that Far Cry has a formula ever since FC3, but is this a bad thing in itself? Look at how many people keep winging at Blizzard for killing Diablo with Diablo 3 and Immortal. Or how Fallout 3 killed the franchise. Or Baldur's Gate 3, Doom 3, Doom Eternal, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 7 were polarizing for changes to formula.

Ok, point here is that if you expect a Far Cry game, then New Dawn is that. It has some new things added onto it's already establish skeleton, but it generally feels similar. If you want a different game, then play a different game. It's not enough IMO to hate on a game just because it iterates instead of revolutionizes.

[b]+ Presentation[/b]
Lush, colorful landscapes filled with high grass and forests and overgrown ruins are pretty to look at. Audiovisual design and quality is on a good level. I had fun just walking through the map, exploring different locations and scavenging for resources.

Noteworthy are the animals. There are all mutated, strange-looking versions of animals we know. For example ‚Äì deer have white fur with red-pinkish antlers. While they are still functionally just the same deer as in Far Cry 3-5 ‚Äì the visual distinction makes them more interesting and I like it.

[b]+ Good variety[/b]
Because of the mechanics of the game encouraging you to do different things for materials ‚Äì this entry feels somehow less samey. That is only if you are willing to do all those different activities and don't find them tedious.

Resource economy gives you several ways of obtaining different materials. If you don't want to engage with resource grind for crafting weapons then you can just do quests including expeditions which reward a lot of craft mats.

Both outposts and expeditions can be repeated with increasing difficulty levels for more rewards. You can't repeat them on low levels, but there are enough of them to get all resources you need before advancing to the next difficulty tier in my experience, even if you are crafting lots of weapons.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Microtransactions[/b]
Real money transactions have no place in single-player games that you have to buy. If you want a freemium-type mechanics then make your game free, you assholes.

However, I will admit that the way I usually play games - exploring, doing side content at my leasure and going out of my way to grab optional resources and search for new areas to raid ‚Äì I did not experience a starvation of upgrade materials.

It's still a shitty thing to include microtransactions in a non-free game.

[b]- Stupid story[/b]
My main issue is again with how unlikely this all seems. We have a bandit faction that numbers in thousands in force and I am supposed to believe they really have problems with a small group of local survivors? It's even stated in the game that the bandits are spreading all over United States, so they are literally a standing army united by the main antagonists. 

FC4 had 2 military forces constantly in combat and felt much more authentic and plausible. FC5 was more ‚Äûout-there‚Äù, but it was implied that peggies weren't really being violent or aggressive before the events of the game, so it would be more understandable that there would be more normal people living around the area.

Honestly, I don't even fully understand how such regimes filled with bad guys are united by a single ruling pair of sisters. If you propagate a culture of stealing and murder then you can fully expect your own men to steal and murder each other, very possibly yourself. Relying on an army of ‚Äûloyalists‚Äù recruited from the biggest scum on the planet seems like a good way to have a bunch of trigger-happy and ambitious morons to try to take you out for a chance at being the man in charge.

And then we have Joseph Seed and his antics... to say more would be spoilers, but I'm severely disappointed in how the plotline is set up and resolved.

This is the worst story and the worst plot by far...

[b]- Characters[/b]
‚Ä¶ which would still be fine if the characters worked, but they don't. The villains are boring and bad. It's funny that whenever games try to sell a female villain nowadays they always have to be dumb meatheads who punch and shoot people. Pagan Min was a much more effective villain despite killing 1 and lightly injuring 1 more person on the screen, compared to the twins who kill people whenever they are on the screen.

Villains aside, the rest of the cast ain't any better. Story characters like Seed aren't given enough time to flesh them out. The new companions aren't much better. Hurk is still the comic relief, but so is the granny sniper. Yes, granny sniper. I prefer games to choose a tone and keep it. Meanwhile we have scenes where children are given unpinned grenades to hold, while at the same time having idiocies like the sniper granny.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
This is the worst Far Cry game I played (the only ones I didn't play was Primal and 6) and it still sits at the level of quality that can objectively be enjoyed. It all depends on the player ‚Äì if you wanted more Far Cry, then you will find this to be fun. Probably less fun than others, but still engaging enough to play through it.

I'd give Far Cry New Dawn a
[h1]5/10[/h1]
It's overall a mediocre title. I recommend getting it on a discount as you wait for Far Cry 6 price to drop to something reasonable  considering how formulaic the series is. They are simply not worth full price.

playing this after far cry 5 has already brought me to tears & i've barely begun XD. i truly believed everyone died at the end of far cry 5 in the collapse, & all my efforts were for nothing. but honestly, meeting carmina? & then seeing KIM?? & GRACE? & NICK? ALL ALIVE? bruh. the joy that filled my chest was like no other & i GODDAMN CRIED BC I THOUGH THEY WERE ALL DEAD. 

onto the game itself: the crafting system of this game is giving skyrim/elder scrolls online. it is slightly annoying, but still. the music makes me think of pacifica in cyberpunk (RATATATATATA). i like how the controls carry across games and you don't have to relearn anything. it's great. & the landscape is so unfamiliar, yet so familiar, at the same time. i also like how they turned john seed's old ranch into their new base, lol (it's what they deserve, honestly). & i like how you have to build it up with ethanol & actually work towards a goal, etc., & seeing remnants and forgotten memories of eden's gate. yes, i spoiled myself for who the judge is, and it breaks my fucking heart. (i also cried in the ending of far cry 5 bc of ending up in the bunker with everyone seemingly dead... i got the canon ending). & the links between this one & far cry 5, OOF. we stan.

Far Cry: New Dawn is essentially a continuation of Far Cry 5, with some recurring characters. You play in the world that has slowly begun to flourish again after the bombs fell. People have been steadily rebuilding civilization... until there had to be an opposing force, known in this game as the Highwaymen, lead by the Twins, Lou and Mickey.

It's hardly any different than any other more recent Far Cry game. You help the good guys operate missions against the bad guys, the bad guys push back and take from you, and then you retaliate and wipe them all out for good. I enjoy open-world games that give you a lot of guns and a lot of freedom to roam about, like the Far Cry series, but I can understand that not everyone is that excited about seeing this formula being recycled yet again.

The guns feel a little recycled from earlier games as well, but there's also plenty of ""apocalyptic weapons,"" i.e. weapons that have been made from scrap. I dislike how a lot of the Elite-rank guns require circuit boards that you can only get from grinding Expedition missions. Especially near the end, I wish that instead of that being the only source, you could also get them from Elite enemies or something, or supply drops.

As for the story, it started off strong. The Twins are intimidating and unpredictable, and there is quite an uptick in brutality compared to earlier titles, but honestly it became mediocre near the end and the decimation of the kingpins of the Highwaymen was also anticlimactic. 
Also not really a fan of the return of Joseph and Eden's Gate in this game. I would rather have them move on from the closed book that is Far Cry 5 and not add them as a bit of a side-aspect of the story in this game. It just feels out of place.

All in all not a bad game but it really is no breakthrough in the Far Cry series. They should soon ditch this style and come up with something more innovative, as the franchise is getting stale by now, if it hasn't before New Dawn already.

And for the love of God... leave Hurk out of the franchise already.",1659526893,1659526893,True,15,3,0.667214572429656982,0,True,False,False

-REVIEW-

Ok, so I was aiming for a funnier intro, seeing as how it took me this long to find a more recent Ubisoft game that I actually hate, but‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôll be honest, I had a feeling I‚Äôd finally run into a game that I‚Äôd actually have some beef with, but what hurts even more is the fact that this is coming on the heels of my discovery of Ubisoft‚Äôs decision to turn off all online features to their classic game lineup, which means all the DLC will also die on September 1st.

I guess I‚Äôm just getting sick of how foolish Ubisoft is becoming. I mean, you have bad games? Sure, I get it. The classic games are super old and likely don‚Äôt have quite as much attention? Yeah, I can see that being something to discuss. What isn‚Äôt okay is when this announcement comes right out of the blue, with only a short time for people to back up their files before they‚Äôre screwed. It certainly doesn‚Äôt help that multiplayer isn‚Äôt the only thing we‚Äôre losing. Honestly, why does DLC still require online access.

If you ask me, I think the only game that should‚Äôve been dropped by this table flip is the game I‚Äôm covering right now. Seriously, how do you make a post nuclear apocalypse game WORSE than Fallout 4?!

Ok, guess we‚Äôd better wade through this purple haze river. The story begins some time after the nukes drop and Hope County is now shrunk to half its size(I really wish I was making that up). The people have come out from their vau-er, underground hidey-holes and slowly begun reclaiming the earth. Hopes are high at first, until a group of ne‚Äôer-do-wells led by twin sisters begin raiding and stealing from the innocent. So the hero has to stop them! The greatest hero of all, the‚Ä¶*reads* SECURITY CAP-wait, what? *reads again* Security captain. Aw, crap.

Yeah, let‚Äôs be clear here: the story absolutely sucks. I am absolutely baffled how we can go from a fanatical family of siblings putting a young rookie cop through layers of heavenly hell as (s)he seeks to save Hope County, only for the end result to be more akin to the book of revelations, to ‚ÄúOh no! Neon colored bandits zomg!‚Äù That‚Äôs pretty much all it is, and while the two featured villainesses are certainly big on style and have excellent voice acting, they have virtually no substance. There‚Äôs maybe one scene that takes a passing glance at their past and that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs one other segment involving Joseph Seed and his new family, but all that leads to is a villain born of jealousy, something we‚Äôve all seen before. It would‚Äôve been at least somewhat interesting if you‚Äôd‚Äôve gotten to choose between Joseph and this other villain, but even that wouldn‚Äôt save the game from annoying predictable moments, watered down versions of characters featured in the last game, and an overall sense of emptiness that just makes the plot so ‚Äúby the numbers.‚Äù

Speaking of by the numbers, gameplay is pretty much the same, and does little to improve things. In fact, one of my least favorite aspects is how base capturing works. As opposed to past games which just gave you a whole bunch of bases to nab, here, it goes like this: each base can be captured multiple times, each subsequent time more difficult and more rewarding than the last. While it does add things like more alarms and more guards, the major letdown is the fact that you‚Äôre essentially going after the same bases over and over and over again. The only other big gameplay feature is the ability to go to other locations in the world to participate in glorified fetch quests. These quests may throw in their own unique rewards, but it‚Äôs just more of the same: sneak around and kill things, only this time, grab their stash and haul back to your ride. It‚Äôs something, I guess, just more of the same that barely adds anything. Even crafting got shafted; now all we can make are premade weapons and vehicles. That‚Äôs the worst part of gameplay in general; if it hasn‚Äôt already been done to death, it takes a step backwards.

What really frustrates me is how such a bare bones game still manages to look as good as it does. While the graphics haven‚Äôt taken any big leaps forward, it‚Äôs still all very pretty to looks at. Hell, between the bandit bases and the environment in general, this may be one of the most colorful Far Cry games out there. In terms of music‚Ä¶yeah, it‚Äôs not as good. Granted, it‚Äôs subjective, but I‚Äôm not sure anyone‚Äôs going to jump for joy when their great american classic rock got traded in for the biggest hits from the‚Ä¶40s? 50s? Seriously, I feel like New Dawn was trying unnecessarily to be Fallout with the music choices. The bandit tunes are marginally better, but I didn‚Äôt get into them as much as I hoped. I wouldn‚Äôt say that stuff is terrible, but then you turn around and play Cyberpunk 2077 and wonder if the New Dawn bandit tunes were CDPR‚Äôs ‚Äúrejected tunes‚Äù list. It‚Äôs just so in your face that it feels like it doesn‚Äôt belong.

For those who follow me on r/SeriousSteamReviews, I‚Äôve officially decided this will be my last Ubisoft game for quite some time. The only one I really have on my radar at this point is FC6, and that‚Äôs really only because I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúplay as the villain‚Äù DLCs are good stuff. I‚Äôm not happy making this decision, especially since I‚Äôm certain there‚Äôs some good Ubisoft games out there, but between the Assassin‚Äôs Creed roller coaster and the very badly made decision about scrapping older online content, it‚Äôs safe to say this company has fallen far from what it used to be, and considering how the latest AC games have microtransactions on them as well, I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre going to recover anytime soon, and that‚Äôs assuming they even care to.

Far Cry New Dawn is definitely Far Cry. So your mileage may vary.

There is a tight story here, and unlike Far Cry 5 they don't lock it away behind hours of grinding if that's not your thing. The villains are pretty meh for a FC game. The silent protagonist thing is still here, with all the drawbacks that comes with. But there's fun to be had, and a progression system that actually feels like progression, which is better than it's been since FC3, probably.

I went into this thinking it'd be more of the FC5 experience, but it was surprisingly different enough to be enjoyed while similar enough to be interesting. All in all, not half bad.",1659236401,1659236401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It seems like with every game Ubi makes, the worlds become more bland, the story is more barebones, and the games become more grindy. Far Cry 5 was already the worst Far Cry game they've made, and now this is even worse.

This game 100% wants to encourage you to buy microtransactions. As soon as you start exploring the world you'll find enemies that are a higher ""tier"" than your weapon class. So you'll collect materials, loot locations, and buy upgraded weapons to stand a chance. The problem is, the endgame (as in, the final 2 boss fights) is designed around the ""elite"" tier weapons. And to get these, you have a to grind out special co-op focused missions to get a material that you can't get anywhere else in the game. (bet you just want to make it easier and just buy it huh?). The structure of the game and the drive to ""buy"" more with real money is truly disgusting.

Most of the game, I was doing quite already with tier 2-3 weapons. But the final boss fights were such utter miserable slogs against enemies that have 1,000,000 health, that you basically have to fight them with elite weapons or you will just have a miserable time. Which I did. And while fighting the Twins, there is a constant stream of dogs that chase after you, grabbing your leg and unfuriating the fuck out of you.

[spoiler] The whole purpose for me helping Joseph seed was to turn around next second and massacre him with baseball bat. But thanks to you, killing him was his idea and whole fun of killing him and revenging Hope County died with him. THANKS A LOT! I was so mad i couldn't kill him however i wanted i almost punched a hole in my desk. And please explain to me WHY couldn't i pick up Joseph after i killed him like any other npc? At least you should have allowed me to throw him in a fire or down the dam. Now for the killing scene of the twins. Tell me ONE good reason why shouldn't i be able to command my dog to kill her?!! Where is the fun in finishing of half dead character with a bullet or an arrow. And i almost lost my shit when game switched my outfit for a derby and when i changed it to dark hunter and died, the game changed it back to derby clothes. Of course i haven't noticed and when the game ended i walked dressed like fall guy on LSD.

Ubisoft can u tell your people to add options for when i am in the air? Because i don't see a reason why i can't change bindings for parachute (opening and closing). I died three times because i pressed every other key other than F or E.[/spoiler]

If you are thinking about buying this game (and ""BUY"" is the plain wording on every Steam store page), be aware you may only be able to play it for the next 6 weeks, before Ubisoft REMOVES it from your library.

Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  

The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.

Read some reviews that said this should be a DLC as it was short, and while it was shorter than the other recent games, it still took me 23 hours to beat this game as there is alot you can do if you choose to.

Game had some solid challenges to it and looked, sounded, and had excellent characters as well. 

After the exciting start (as is the signature of this series), the first thing that jumped out was just how colorful this game is. The colors were bright and vibrant (which is also a reflection of the events that had happened) and it looked amazing. The game play is pretty much the same as it was starting in FC3 (maybe 2, but I didn't like 2 that much), and since I played FC5 and this game back to back, everything was easy to pick up as they are mostly the same game (what isn't nowadays) which is probably why I liked this alot and think it is an underrated game.

This game takes place 17 years after the events of FC5. Seeing the land and some of the familiar faces was pretty cool and how it all changed and remembering what it looked like before was a little insane. I thought they did a cool job with this game and I think if you play them back to back, you will get the same feel I did. 

Had a few different things to do in this game, but for the most part, alot of the changes were just a way to grind out resources so you upgrade to the next level or weapon which was fine, and offers a good challenge, especially with each level you push it.

Also, I was able to max out the settings, and this game will strain your CPU (unless you spent about 10 grand on it) but It ran at an average of 90FPS which was awesome. No screen tearing and ran very smoothly except for a couple of spots. Ran great, looked great, played great.

I feel like someone spent ages coming up with backstory for them, making sure each sister had a distinctive personality and ambitions. Then someone told that writer that they already made the game with their first draft. Basically boiling them down to PINK SISTER ANGRY GRR and BLUE SISTER SMART BUT ALSO ANGRY GRR. And this falls so flat because there isn't anything shown to the player that these characters are intimidating at the least. I would compare them to two girls whining to their father that they weren't able to kill the bad man/woman who keeps killing their friends. NOTHING is fleshed out about these two, most of their dialogue is through vague threats at the player and their lackeys for doing/not doing the thing that just happened. There was a point halfway through the game where you are FORCED to do something stupid with no alternative so the twins can be ""Badass"" with no repercussions. Again, I feel sorry for the writer/ writers that were on this game, because they obviously did not get enough time to write the story they wanted to write.

Also, even placing an OPTION to buy guns with REAL money in these games is just insulting to the average player. Mobile game versions of monitization DO NOT belong in pc/console games. Its like having a man in a business suit ask you for 5 dollars to get you a soda from your fridge so you don't have to get it yourself; and if you don't pay he straps 20 pound weights to your ankles so you can ""Feel like you deserve it.""

Don't get this game. Not for the cut content nor the story. There is nothing here.",1657327920,1657327920,False,7,0,0.499299734830856323,1,True,True,False

Far cry New Dawn is just Far Cry 5 1.5 with minor adjustments to the gameplay except for the RPG mechanic which I will mostly highlight the review on. 
 
RPG mechanics are an interesting feature for the game but are kinda lackluster and kinda badly implemented since trying to use any weapon beneath the enemies rank like a rank 3 AK will still take about 2 whole mags or more to kill a rank 4 enforcer. LMGs are also turned into a joke against rank 2-4 ranked enemies even if the LMG is rank 3 and the enemy is rank 2, he will still take 20 rounds. 
 
Stealth has also been affected by the RPG mechanics i feel like since you need perks to takedown higher ranked enemies and have the same ranked bow to successfully one hit kill an enemy which make stealth annoying sometimes, throwing knifes also don‚Äôt one hit kill rank 3 (maybe even rank 2) and all enemies rank 2 and above have helmets so ranged stealth kills are focused on the boy except if you have piercing sniper ammo. 
 
The base rusty guns with slow and janky reloads are a nice addition along with the makeshift attachments like screwdriver bayonets, random pieces of metal around the gun or some electrical tape to either hold together the gun or an attachment that really adds character or make the guns seem different to the generic black/gray guns that in other games all melt together. The biggest problem with guns is the general lack of them, there are about 69 guns in total which sounds like a lot but that number has to be divided by 5 for each weapon like SMGs and ARs. 
All guns also have presett attachments so maybe only one of the assault rifles suits you because it has a suppressor which wouldn't be a problem in FC5 since you can add suppressor to any gun(not really). The lack of guns complaint is definitely me being spoiled but seeing that FCND is just a smaller version of FC5 which had much more guns is kinda disappointing. 
 
The big usage of purple in the apocalyptic Hope County is a nice feature which differentiates itself from Fallout, Stalker and Metro with their sometimes overgrown but mostly bleak wastelands. The creatures and especially the legendary ones look cool and fit the vibrant apocalyptic landscape everything has turned into. 
 
Changing out money for scraps and parts which are used for guns and vehicles is a good idea to make it more different from FC5 but can get annoying when trying to get rank 4 guns. The addition of Ethanol is ok and was at first annoying/hard to get but just scavenging an outpost over and over again leads to finding ethanol becoming unnecessary, i had my base at level 2 and 4 thousand ethanol which made all other outposts useless except for killing enemies. 

 Summary. 
RPG mechanics were cool and interesting but pretty poorly implemented and kinda ruined stealth/made perfect stealth runs much harder, Guns look cool but are kinda ruined by the RPG mechanic and are generally lacking in amount, landscape is cool and distinctive from other post-apocalyptic games, scraps and parts instead of money is a good idea but can get annoying and outposts are pretty useless if you have enough ethanol. 


So in Summary it's a 6/10 even if i list more negatives than positives, if you want a Far Cry game then buy FC3-6 and see this game as a short add-on to FC5 instead of a full Far Cry Game.

Following one of endings in FC5 gave us a cool experience. The changes are substantial and divisive enough to mean that it'll be hard to say for sure if you enjoy this. This review will spoil FC5 if you haven't played it.

+ Core game play. The game is built directly out of FC5. The following points detail the changes. 
+ Less substantial game play changes. The overall movement and interaction system has been subtly improved even more. Everything is beautifully smooth. A different set of more violent lethal take downs are back. Since people were unhappy with the blunt take downs. All weapons are no longer customizable as they are mostly makeshift versions made with unique models and specific capabilities. There are resources to collect and spend now instead of just money. This was implemented very simply. Locations have single pickup resources. Other objectives offer resources as rewards. Certain objectives have certain types.  
+ Outposts. After capturing them the first time. You actually have the option to face harder versions of them finally. You have the option to abandon them and this will cause the more difficult force to take control. Sadly, there is no dynamic attacks for the enemies to take them this time.
+ Extraction. Off map missions become available. During these missions you go to other locations to retrieve something of interest. These are basically very large outposts with way more enemies. You choose how to play it out. After retrieving the object of interest, you must stand your ground until you get picked up. This is a simple, but fun addition using the games regular mechanics.
+ Hunting. Playing into the mutated environments animals are different from what they were. As a result, playing into the RPG combat more threatening classes of animals exist. Killing them is more of a battle as they often have strong defense. The higher tier skins can be traded for higher value materials.
+ Exploration. Seeing the transformation of Hope County is nice for those who enjoy world design and exploration. Yes, this world is designed under the colorful world scheme that was a fad at the time. This one is quite simply the best. Forcing it to constrain to a realistic natural environment worked great. If you remember the background details of FC5 you will have a good time getting some follow up on what happened to all the people and places. That's it for gameplay.
+ Soundtrack. The soundtrack is awesome if you don't mind the genre. The idea of designing the theme off of ""electronically distorting"" the FC5 country version was really cool. All the songs follow that resulting style. The baddies love playing their trash ""rave"" music really loudly so you get to enjoy terminating their asses and put to a stop. As territory is taken the radio station goes back to playing classic varieties of music. Which is a good bonus to immersion.
+ Story. I actually really liked it. Certain parts were very campy. Others were fun. While others were very cool and unique as far as game stories go. Following through on the apocalypse ending in this style was very interesting. Playing the FC6 Joseph dlc makes it even cooler. Most complaints seem to be they just disagree with the decision. There is nothing definitively wrong with what happened.
+ UI. There is a bunch of new UI stuff to do with the RPG combat. Individual segments of it can be shut down in the options. Most other things can be shut down piece by piece too.

+/- Combat. Has taken an RPG turn. Enemies have different amounts of health and armor based on progress/difficulty. Weapons now have tiers. This is something that‚Äôs always been a thing, but the differences were tiny and obscured. In this game its very pronounced. Weapons traditionally were good because they were inherently better than others. Not this time using low tier weapons will have a significantly harder time against higher tiers. This change comes with the benefit of a larger difficulty curve, but a loss of realism. Normally a head shot would be very lethal against any enemy (with specific exceptions). This doesn't apply this time. Reactions to this is mixed. I have mixed feelings about it as well, but was fine with it in the end. If you‚Äôre unsure you will probably be fine with it. It does take a moment to get used to in game as it needs to be taken into account. 
+/- Coop. It‚Äôs a thing again, but still super janky as the engine has no ability to properly instance for more than one client. So, the second player is still tethered to the host.
+/- World Scenario. Despite how some find the circumstances of the story absurd. It‚Äôs really not when you actually think about the way things are laid out. It was a nuclear strike so death would be largely random. The trash of modern society will still be here and create opportunity for them to become leaders in the new world. That's what happens to Hope County. A cringe morale relativistic millennial society fills in what was Hope County. The scenario plays out differently elsewhere as indicated. Other places are more stable and better off. This is why your character comes to Hope County. Your here to try to restore order. That results in you getting pulled into the Hope County story scenario. It‚Äôs hard to say what they were playing at, but certain factors make it seem that restoring Hope County to what it was before the cult is the good (non-left-wing culture) making the stuff you‚Äôre fighting the bad. 
+/- Silent Character. Your silent like you were in FC5. I'm torn on this. Certain elements of the story make me say it‚Äôs probably a good thing, but in others it‚Äôs kind of awkward. Some parts feel like moments that are better without you talking because a massive variety of vastly different responses would be valid and it allows you to react as yourself. When it comes to others it seems wrong that you‚Äôre not speaking to them because what you would be saying is much narrower. 

- Smaller and shorter. Of the short dev cycle games (FCBD and FCP) this one is the smallest in overall length and map size. It does however have to most changes to the systems.
- Simulation range. This is an understated problem effecting all FC. The range for game play entities is too short. Things can spawn within line of sight. Things disappear quickly. These too combine for random encounters repeating rapidly in your vicinity. This affects all the relevant mechanics in a negative way. Causing immersion and realism breaks.

I almost didn't play this because of the FC trash talk. I'm glad I eventually did because it was a great experience overall. FC takes a lot of heat for being the same thing each time even though that‚Äôs better than changing and destroying everything. Each game has its own subtle nuances with this one being more pronounced. This one has the largest game play changes and as a result took a lot of backlash. It‚Äôs worth trying to see a different iteration. Clearly a lot was learned from this based on FC6.",1657132747,1657133642,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

I'm like 4th or 5th or something. Definently top 10. Like Cool, at least I'm not number one but what the Fuck Man, why does someone have almost 8K hours on this game? I spend my time running around in a god damn circle just doing the same shit and someone has about 7 times what I have? good god man..

Anyway I've doubled my hours from the first review so I wanna give it a refresh. However, not much has changed in my opinion. The game is still a Far Cry 5 DLC. Much of the game is a reskin, there's hella bugs and problems.. but here I am still playing it. Mainly cause of the Highwaymen. They look cool and I just love a Apoloalytic free roam first person shooter. But by this point, I can act out the scenes better than these NPC's do in cutscenes and while talking to them. I've probably spent more time Playing this game than they spent making it. 

The game's likely dead and the fandom behind it is gone, but here I am still playing. 

Anyway there is something new I would like to point out. While the microtransactions are shitty and do very little, I found one positive to them. Namely the perk points and crafting materials. While it doesn't feel good to spend 10 bucks on a few perk points and crafting stuff when you can grind them for free, I learned that those things that are bought in the store can be new game transferable (like the oufits and weapons bought). Whatever you buy transfers to every new game so technically you can just keep restarting and have a bunch of crafting stuff and perk points at the start. Now i wouldn't recommend doing that on a game that's dead, but I burned 10 bucks to learn about this so.. do with it what you will.

Its a nice looking game, but it's still not worth full price. Wasn't during my first review but whatever. Those still playing it are those late to the game and are trying every Far Cry Game, or their the few crazy's like me still enjoy it.",1612221089,1656661503,False,4,0,0.565911352634429932,0,True,False,False

Stupid, enjoyable guilty pleasure with very little gameplay alterations, and only worth getting on discount. Not much to say here really, It's just FC5 with some reskins and minor gameplay tweaks.

The Good Stuff:
+ It's basically FC5 but pinkier and with no annoying recurring gameplay interruptions necessitated by the need to show too many antagonists. You can treat this as an expansion to FC5 with all the pros and cons of that approach.
+ While weapon customization is gone, the weapons you build have clearly defined roles which lets them be a little more unique than in FC5.

The Bad Stuff:
- If you expected the post-apocalyptic setting to force some kind of major gameplay changes, think again. This is Far Cry, there's no risks taken here. 99% of the time you won't remember the game is supposed to take place after an apocalyptic event.

Dont even try to play this it sucks. They changed far cry to an rpg rather than an fps with rpg elements its shit , a headshot should be an headshot and not a fcuking health bar above their ass.

If u wanna play a good far cry game play blood dragon and 3 they were amazing 4 is basically 3 but expanded and with worse story than 3 and far cry 5 is bad its good in coop you will have fun with your buddy but when i played it solo it was monotone to go through at the end. If you want a challenge and actually play a hard far cry game then fc2 is for you it is realistic as it can get.

For a completionest like me it was not very hard at all and all the extra resources made getting the better guns and equipment not feel like a grind since I was already going out of my way to get them.  Main story with the highwaymen is very weak and unintresting however all the stuff that connects it to FC5 I find tons more compelling.  The boss fights in hard mode felt a bit damage spongy but with the OP LMG's they can be killed pretty quick with some luck.  Fairly buggy and decent open world, wish they changed more from 5 besides just landscapes, destruction, and colors.  Also really hated replaying the same explorations and outpost 3 times with different level enemies.  I don't really wanna play FC 6 except for the Villian DLC's but for me this is a decent ending to the far cry 5 story.

Pros:
- Main Story is a classic post apocalyptic scenario where there are evil people abusing their power ETC ETC. Nothing special but cant go wrong with it. I found the twins interesting until the ending where they lost my respect.
- Combat , weapons as always are good and a lot of fun.
- Some missions were interesting and unique.

Cons:
- Story sometimes is annoying, FC loves to do it where the main char is under the mercy of the villain but either the villain has mercy or want to teach us lesson, this approach is embarrassing already.
- Unfortunately the enemy field of awareness system is the same from FC 5. It makes no sense when a moving car can figure me out in 0.5 seconds while both of us moving to different directions, especially if you are from a helicopter. This makes traveling very annoying sometimes and pushes you to useless combats out there. I guess they made it for some action time but really put some sense into it...

The DLC isn't amazing but I would recommend it as it is a step up compared to FC 5 original.",1656072988,1656072988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, if you liked FC5, you'll probably like this as well. It's a relatively short campaign , set in many of the same locales as before, and with many of the same faces as before. Unexpectedly, especially if - like me - you come from many hours in Fallout's Wasteland, its world is one in which nature bounced back beautifully from nuclear apocalypse. FCND kind-of ties up some elements of FC5's storyline, although its story is much less developed, but then it is a much shorter game than FC5. Otherwise, it has many of the same strengths, and most of the same weaknesses, but it does have a nice new ""Expeditions"" mode that takes you to exotic mini-maps to collect extra resources. However, one thing that it's sadly missing from FC5 is an excellent soundtrack. 

In summary, if you want just a little bit more FC5, and a peek at a post-apocalyptic wasteland that's actually quite beautiful, then this is worth checking out. But perhaps wait for it to be on special offer on Steam (or your preferred vendor).",1656057880,1656057945,True,11,0,0.66236644983291626,0,True,False,False

- ""same"" map, but really feels like it's a new one due to drastical changes in the environment. Some sections are cut off, so the map size is maybe two thirds of that in FC5
- fewer people, more (mutated) animals
- fishing is still in
- drugs are out
- can have only one companion instead of two
- no boats and planes roaming around, so you can finally hike/fish in peace
- two crazy black women instead of two crazy white dudes as antagonists
- you are not the ""hero"" this time, rather his independent agent
- there is a very simplistic RPG system here with 4 tiers (normal, rare, epic, legendary) for weapons and NPCs. Although it's arguably unnecessary, it leaves the ""one shot, one kill"" gameplay of the Far Cry series intact, while giving the player a little more sense of direction and progression. It mostly forces you to gather some materials and then commit to an upgrade choice, unless you want to grind more materials and craft other high tier weapons as well.
- all points of interest can be completed by gathering all the materials on their site. While this is a nice functional addition to POIs / map progression, it can be very frustrating when you are a completionist and bad at searching props
- some gameplay aspects are now embodied in your upgradeable base. Gather materials to upgrade facilities, which then improve your stats (like health) or unlock quick travel via helicopter, craft vehicles in the garage, add map markers at the cartographer
- of COURSE this game has outposts to conquer. Difference here is, after conquering you can either keep it as a respawn/crafting station, or abandon it; this will then repopulate it with enemies of the next higher tier
- expeditions: you can travel to some completely new locations and usually steal something from the bad guys. Maps I've seen so far were an abandoned aircraft carrier, giving me huge FC1 vibes, and a spooky post-apocalyptic amusement park. Each expedition also comes in multiple tiers, if you're up for some grind.
- skinning: While in Far Cry 3, skins were used to craft items directly, in Far Cry 5, they were just converted into money. New Dawn is a middle ground, where you convert skins into materials and then use those for crafting. It works well as long as you can ignore the idiotic idea that Elk Hide produces Duct Tape and Wolfskin produces Copper
- experts: much like in FC Primal, you have to find experts before you can upgrade facilities to certain tiers. The associated quests are pretty fun

All in all, New Dawn is a fully fledged game and a worthy entry to the series. It looks like it acts as somewhat of a guinea pig for trying out (or leaving out) game mechanics as little mutations (hehe) to the FC game formula. FC5 is still the greater title and should ideally be played first, as  New Dawn is the direct successor and many of the characters make reappearances.",1655874299,1655875973,True,63,2,0.818130970001220703,0,True,False,False

Far cry 5 was pretty decent, I thought. This is sort of a lazy, woke, piece of childish butt discharge.

The weapons are pretty silly and not very fun to use. Plenty of cut-scenes that are so cringe. I usually skip. I don't find the antagonists all that believable. 16 year old girls aren't very freightening. Forced humor without much cleverness or wit. Just an all around disappointer.

This a pretty decent game, This game is a fun fps classic farcry formula game, nothing more and nothing less. The graphics are very nice and performance was good, Story was fine, it was a bit basic and boring but I think it was still fun. The villian's don't really live up to many other farcry villian's but they weren't too bad and still had a presence. However the Boss fight was so badly designed, bullet sponged bosses, one with a infinite flame thrower that can reach incredible distances and the other having 100% accuracy with a sniper. This boss fight is unforgiving in a bad, it has no reason to be like this, the flame thrower makes everything burn so your constantly taking damage and the smoke from the fire makes you unable to see anything.

You can't beat the bosses without Elite / Legendary guns, my regular saw launcher did nothing on them. But if you have that super powered legendary saw launcher it does 9000 damage on them then you can beat.

Dawn is in my opinion a Falloutesque, post apocalyptic first person shooter. The game is still set in ""Hope County"" however now, the law of the land is non existent, areas are overgrown and colourful with poisonous beauty. Animals run rampant and so does the breakdown of human civilization. The map is open world and very visually appealing much like its predecessor.

We have the survivors, the highway men and the remnants of the Edens gate Zealots which comprise of the land. The existing game play from Far Cry 5  is still entwined with a few differences.  Weapons that require crafting as well as boats and aircraft. Compounds can still be taken, but you will acquire a valuable resource called Ethanol and it is required to upgrade your community to further enhance your gameplay (health, gun upgrades ect). Perks are attained as per usual, this includes hunting for animals and doing various challenges and grinding. You can also roster a friend to fight with you as per previous series. Enemies are highlighted by their level which indicates their difficulty and this is the same for missions. The mechanics also differ in areas such as takedowns.

As for the story itself, it is a closure to the Far Cry 5 series. There are new overlords called the ""Twins"" who take the charge of the Villains in New Dawn. But the story runs deeper and crosses elements with the ghosts of the past.

I didn't really come across any troubles with this game. It does require the Ubisoft interface and unfortunately the game does have several elements of micro transactions.

If you do wish to explore life after the events of Far Cry 5 and seek closure on the particular series, then New Dawn will offer this without hugely extensive depth but to the point.

Edit: After playing more and getting much further into the story, this is not a bad game in the slightest. The story is actually really interesting once you [spoiler] meet Joseph Seed.

The enemy tiers are pretty annoying for us and it made the it less like a original Far Cry game (With no health bars and tiers) and it even stops you from having binoculars from the get-go! (You have to unlock them as a perk) and the game also doesn't let you customise weapons you've obtained like in Far Cry 5 which makes the advancements feel a little less rewarding. The story in this is good in some places but it just doesn't feel fulfilling enough to play through to the end when you get to about 15/16 story missions in which is why we just gave up with it. 

Far Cry New Dawn is definitely not exactly made for Co-op either, for example, most story missions required you to drive and it will only be between you and the npc of that mission and your co-op buddy would need to either steal a nearby vehicle or literally sit on the vehicle your driving, this wasn't too bad but overtime it did get pretty annoying. In most cases with story missions, my best friend would randomly get booted off my game and one time it even stopped a mission from continuing so I had to do a entire mission from scratch again on my own. In Far Cry 5 the co-op gameplay with story missions was really well implemented but with Far Cry New Dawn it just feels likes it's just been put on at the end of development as an extra bit to the game.

This game definitely should've just been a big DLC for Far Cry 5 rather than being sold as a standalone game for such a high price for the little amount of content that you get out of this in fact you are better off buying the DLC for Far cry 5 and playing that instead.

If you want an extra story-line to Far Cry 5, get it on a sale, but DO NOT buy this game at full price and find a game that is much more worth your money and time.",1654488394,1654488598,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

to start with one of it‚Äòs negatives, the story in far cry new dawn is very weak and lacks weight and focus. not that previous far cry games had stronger ones, but those had at least one or two excellently written and interesting characters like Vaas or Pagan Min to compensate for the weak plot. In New Dawn, not one single interesting or fleshed out character is found. Some characters from Far Cry 5 make a return, but they weren‚Äôt particularly interesting back then and they haven‚Äôt changed for sure. Joseph Seed makes a return as well, but while he had this creepy and mysterious aura and was charismatic af in fc 5, in new dawn he only plays a rather minor role and just seems to be a shadow of himself. the two new antagonists, evil twins Mickey and Lou who lead a group of bandits are downright tame and boring compared to preceeding antagonists, too. The only characters who come close to beeing memorable are Hank Drubman (another returning character from fc 5 who is clearly inspired by some of the goofy roles played by Vince Vaughn) and a somewhat crazy young pharmacist you meet early in the game, but they both only get one mission after which you barely interact with them again.  

what really shines on the other hand is the game world. instead of following the typical post-nuclear cliche of a total devastion, the game shows a regenerating nature, that comes back to life stronger than ever without the harmful influence of mankind. Far Cry New Dawn is probably the most colourful and beautiful fps i ever played and i couldn‚Äôt get enough of the absolutely stunning sights in the game, full of vibrant strong colors and lush vegetation. The game world is what kept me coming back and it‚Äôs one of new dawn‚Äòs biggest strengths. i didn‚Äòt even mind the collectibles this time around. Even though i usually hate collectibles in open world games, here i almost even welcomed them, because they gave me a reason to explore as much of the fantastic map as possible. they even made sense from a story-viewpoint: you‚Äòre in this big, hostile post-apocalyptic world, just trying to survive and rebuild a community, so that‚Äôs what you would actually do in that situation. scavenge the environment and collect ressources. apart from a few outlandish and supernatural elements during the last third of the story, i found the whole premise of new dawn actually much more believable than that of far cry 5. further considering the looks of the game, it is a small wonder how stable, smooth and bug-free the whole game runs, even on the highest setting. Apart from falling through the world one time, i experienced no crashes, no glitches and no significant stuttering.

the smaller scope and linearity really work wonders for the game. sure, the weapon roster and number of vehicles are very stripped back compared to fc 5, but again, it‚Äôs post-apocalypse, so no airplanes, helicopters or tons of exotic high-tech guns.

fc 5 was a great game, and new dawn builds on that foundation, enriching it with some neat twists. it‚Äôs not free of the common problems of the open world genre, but the only really bad thing about new dawn is it‚Äôs awful mumble rap soundtrack. this makes it the second-best game in the series, only surpassed by far cry 3, proving the unwritten law of the far cry series once more: the odd numbers and the spin-offs are the better ones, the even numbers are somewhat weaker.

Pure garbage from that perspective. Good in almost every way that really matters.
Devs can blame whomever they want. They did this though.

If I had known it was so monetized in such a garbage way I'd have probably went through the trouble of not paying for it at all even if it was a bundle.
I won't even dock points for it feeling like a FC5 DLC. I liked FC5 enough I'd have been down.

I found later on that even with elite weapons, the enemy variety and difficulties forced me to actually make plans when taking outposts, and to be careful. The story was passable, with by far the most interesting part seeing how Joseph's story continues after the massive cliff hanger of Farcry 5. I played Farcry 5 many times, and seeing how the story continues and how Hope County changed was especially interesting. I wish the map was more the size of the previous game, with a lot of key locations still being around to see, because other than a few a lot of locations weren't even there, or the landscape changed in ways the bombs in 5 would not have changed. Bombs don't build mountains, guys.

I like the unusually optimistic and colorful portrayal of the aftermath of Nuclear Armageddon. The Highwaymen are among my favorite enemies out of all the games I've played. I find their style highly appealing and more than once I found myself wishing I was given the option to join them. They seem to have fully embraced the new rules of the reborn world, unlike our allies who seem a bit... stuck in the old ways? Honestly I found them bland. Not sure if there was intentional social commentary behind making the enemies violent young rebels and the good guys resolute middle-aged traditionalists, considering it's not something I've seen discussed, but I couldn't help feeling that way. As for the Twins, they were okay villains. They worked fine for the story. 

The gameplay itself is simple and fun. It feels significantly less cluttered than other open-world / Far Cry games. Increasing weapon/enemy tiers kept combat challenging until the end, though I would have loved being able to customize weapons with items found in the environment instead of the weapons coming with scopes and screwdrivers attached. Taking over outposts stealthily is lots of fun and I like that we can replay them at higher difficulties for increased rewards. Adds a lot of content without bloating the map. 

For me the game really only has one significant drawback and that is the forever boat ride through the fog. It is extremely tedious after the first time and I wish there was a way to skip it.",1573585184,1652384694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
939960,115332752,76561198052378468,0,4,1510,0,1510,1652331008,"The short version:
The gameplay was fun and the ending wasn't horrible. The companion AI is pretty bad. Not horrible, but there were times where the companion would follow a bad path to attack the enemies, or just stand over me doing nothing while I was dying. The game was pretty short. Worth it on sale, but not worth $40.



The longer version:
The gameplay is as fun as the others. You take down outposts, but they added the ability to give up the outpost and re-take them. Though when you do, the enemies get harder and more plentiful. You also gain extra resources by giving up and retaking the outposts. You can re-take them as many times as you want, but they stop leveling up on the third cycle. Also, you gain less fuel (a resource to increase your town) by not sneaking, but not by a ton, and since you can re-take the outposts, it isn't a big deal overall.

The storyline wasn't bad, but wan't great either. Honestly, it was as memorable as any of the others. The only difference between this game and 3, 4, and 5 is that in 5 years when I think back to this game, I'm going to remember that they didn't decide to go with either a bad ending, or a slightly better, but still bad ending.

You craft weapon and vehicles, and the materials are found either through scavenging camps (marked on your map when you pass them), by killing the wildlife and turning in their skins, or by doing expeditions. The top-most tier of weapons can be leveled up via crafting, but doing so only increases the weapons damage by 5%. I assume that you can level them up as many times as you want, but didn't test it myself.

Expeditions are mini-missions that are also repeatable, and just like the outposts, they level up, getting harder but giving more rewards. Your goal is to grab a package and once you do, the enemies track you down while you have to wait for a helicopter. The amount of resources gained does not change whether you use stealth or not.

The level system is that you gain perk points by either doing missions, doing events as you wander around, doing outposts/expeditions, or completing challenges. For some of the perks, you can buy multiple ranks, such as being able to carry more medkits, or holding more ammo, but they aren't too big of a deal.
At a certain point in the game something happens which unlocks 5 more perks, with a total cost of about 40 points. So if you get to the point where you have an abundance of points, but haven't unlocked those skills, it may be worth it to hold onto the points.

As you progress, some of the enemies will get harder, and the topmost difficulty are elite enemies. These enemies can not be tracked through walls like the rest of the enemies, which was a cool feature, but I felt this feature was under-utilized.

The biggest issue I had with the game was the companions.

Companions, for the most part, are weak and die easily. There was one that I got early on and was my favorite, as they used silenced weapons, which is always useful, and another that was amazing, but not silenced. Overall 2 of the eight were good, the rest were meh. Some of the characters know each other, though, and having the right party member in the group for the mission gives an extra line of dialog. Oh, and when enemies spot your companion, they do not spot you, so your undetected bonus isn't removed.

That being said, the AI isn't great. There were times where I'd tell them to attack, so they run all the way down and around to the other side of the map just to get the shot. Whereas had they taken two steps to the left, they would have had a clear shot. They also ran THROUGH the area, which made every enemy target them, which led them to dying. On the upside, getting them back is easy, as you just spend three readily available crafting mats. There's not even a cooldown. Though there was a time where it bugged out and wouldn't let me summon any companions.

Companions are horrible at following you and take forever to catch up at times. So if you go down, it takes them a while to get to you. If they don't die first. Or, you know, just stand over your body looking around at the nearby enemies, not even attacking.

There was also many times where I would tell the companion to attack, and the game would think that I was pointing behind the enemy, telling them to move there. I found that aiming at the enemies knees/feet had the most consistent positive results.

There are micro-transactions in the game, but they don't matter at all. As far as I'm aware, everything you can get via micro-transactions can be gotten through some relatively easy grinding.

The game was pretty short. I did more grinding than necessary to complete the game, but less than what would be needed to get ""everything"".

My rule of thumb for short-medium length games like this (as well as movies) is $1 per hour spent enjoying the content. So it's not bad to get when on sale, but not worth full price.",1652337977,1652337977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Were should I start...?  [/h1]

The game itself isnt bad, its actually pretty damn good, but some things make me want to deinstall and spit on this game.

+ Pros
1. Farcry gameplay (Liberationg outposts bla, bla)
2. You can Play every Outpost again and again but its getting more difficult
3. Highwayman (the People youre fighting against)
4. Explorations (One of the best Features of the game)
If you do an exploration, you will fly to a random place in the world, for example a base in the grand canyon.
Your mission is about stealling a Bag with a GPS thing in it, youll have to run to your helicopter to fly away with the ""Materials"".

5. Story (its a 50/50 thing you know) ( [spoiler] Joseph is a stupid grandpa his son comes in and ruins the whole story I DONT CARE ABOUT HIS 3 LINES SON  [/spoiler] )

6. Setting (apocalyptic Farcry 5 (USA))
7. Takedowns ( nice animations! )

 [u]  Ok Maybe you'll think that Farcry New Dawn is a good game but look at these points:              :(     [/u]

- Cons
1.STUPID BULLSHIT RPG ELEMENTS (YOU ARE FORCED TO C R A F T YOUR WEAPONS SOOO STUPID [u] EVERYTHING  [/u]  HAS A LEVEL?!?! WTF UBI    )

2. Earning ""Materials"" for crafting is that boring that you have to buy them because of:

3. [b] M I C R O T R A N S A C T I O N S!!!!!  [/b]   (Do you want to have a good weapon? Oh sorry you need 56 more tape. WaNnA bUy TheM? NO I DONT WANT LET ME  B U Y  MY WEAPONS WITH MY OWN EARNED FARCRY MONEY you dumb2ss ubisoft manager!

4. Level system (there is Grey,Blue,purple and Gold, Gold is the most difficult/best one)
If you have Blue Weapons but theres an average stupid guy whos at the golden level you will need to shoot him 5000 times to kill him, while he needs only 2 shots to kill you. Thats so stupid to put this in a Farcry Shooter game...

5. Sidequests (I've completed Farcry 3 100% and I would do it again but, Farcry New Dawns Sidequest were so boring! I do not recomend you to do them!!!)

6 Game length (I finished the game after 17h then I played it with a friend through and we finished the game easily after 8.2h Thats not enogh ubi!
7. Characters (Boring and stupid)
8. Weapons (every level recycles the weapons and gives them more damage and a new skin WOw UBi ThaTS SOooOO NIcE !!!!)
9. Vehicles (Bad)
10. Companions (to OP)
11. Price (50$ for a stupid 10h Story game NO!)
12. Villains (two stupid sibling with weapons)

I do not recommend you to buy this game for 50$ buy a key on Eneba for less than 10$, but only if you played Farcry 5
This game slips my opinions I like and maybe love this game but I hate it because of theese cons...

Any sort of headgear prevents enemies from taking headshots, even just a ski mask. Seriously? Like you shoot their bullet proof vests and they take at least half the usual damage. But a ski mask completely negates a sniper rifle. As if it's not enough that many enemies are pure bullet sponges already.

The menu is somewhat buggy and badly designed. You click on save and nothing happens. You have to manually get back to the game to see in the top right of the screen whether it actually saved or not. Also more often than not you can't even follow new missions because for that you have to hold tab for a moment.

Today we‚Äôll be reviewing ‚ÄúFarCry New Dawn‚Äù a FPS with heavy RPG mechanics and from a series known for the crazy stories.  I was a huge fan of the previous game, loving the story and overall game play so I‚Äôve been very excited to dive into the sequel.  Question remains, is this worth your time?  Let‚Äôs discuss!

Press B to Drop Your Weapons:  At the core I consider this a FPS with strong RPG elements; you level up, explore and play a silent protagonist in an open world with heavily scripted missions.  You have a great degree of freedom when it comes how you approach the open world content and many of the missions but there is also a fair bit of scripted scenes that you have little to no control over and any options you do have (usually letting someone live or killing them) have no real effect on the game.  The graphics hold up very well and the audio (both music & effects) is top notch.  The game is very colorful with a great variety of things to see and at no point did I feel the game detracted graphically from my enjoyment.  I will note that the villains did not keep my attention as much as the prior game but they did a serviceable job.  There is also a ton of content; I broke 60 hours having completed most of the content the game had to offer on ‚Äòtough‚Äô (normal) difficulty.  Many of the missions have a layer of humor that the world takes seriously and I found myself at least raising an eyebrow to some of the story.  I don‚Äôt mean this in a negative way as the game never felt like it took itself too seriously while it avoided treading into a full comedy.

I‚Äôve Been Here Before:  In many ways this game can feel like an expansion pack from the previous title, but that is only surface deep as this game is its own game with new mechanics, new characters and a new story all written in the same world after the ending of the previous title.  You will go to areas that you remember from the previous game and it is done well without overly focusing on the fact that it is a sequel.  You could easily jump into this game without even playing the prior.  It is great seeing the world evolved after the apocalypse and seeing old areas completely redesigned through time, radiation and a new generation of inhabitants.  The game has some very colorful set pieces but none of it really felt out of place within the story.

It‚Äôs a Far Cry:  I love this game, well worth the time but it does have some glaring issues.  The biggest issue I had was a well known controller bug where the reverse (and descend) buttons wouldn‚Äôt bind.  There have been some work-arounds found but none of them worked for me.  So when I needed to descend or reverse I had to just use the keyboard.  This wasn‚Äôt a huge issue but it was prevalent throughout the game and did effect my play experience.  The game could be argued as repetitive in some areas but I used these as an excuse to listen to podcasts and play ‚Äòcasual‚Äô during these segments.  Some might find these areas of concern but they did not affect my play experience.  The game also uses the Ubisoft Launcher which can be a deal breaker for some.  I also found that the health bar of vehicles could sometime be a bit misleading; I had vehicles explode on me while at 90% health.

This game easily has 60 hours of content and even more so if you explore and ‚Äòmake your own fun‚Äô.  I could also see a lot of enjoyment from co-op though I never was able to try that out (none of my friends have this game).  Even with some of the minor issues I had I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys FPS games out there that deviate from the corridor shooter or multiplayer deathmatches.  Enjoy!

The plot was also a lot cleaner and things worked well together and made more sense that 5.  I also thought the enemy scaling in difficulty was a great improvement.

One thing I wish is that they had done the bit about getting the extra powers (they come as new perks) earlier in the storyline. They come so late in the game that you barely get to use them--especially if you're the type that does a lot of side stuff before advancing.

Built with what seems like extra/re-used assets from Far Cry 5 the game looks beautiful with surprisingly good facial animations and visuals. The mechanics in turn also have the same fluidity and responsiveness as its predecessor. That being said, the narrative is all over the place. The story is a pseudo continuation of Far Cry 5, so if you enjoyed that story then there are some interesting tid bits to be had here and there. However, The antagonist(s) are rather dull and unconvincing, I had to grit my teeth more than a few times over how cringe they felt. Aside from the main story there's not much side content to really sink your teeth into (of course you still have the ubisoft staple outposts to capture). With collecting ""Ethanol"" being your main gatekeeper for unlocking new tiers of weapons and vehicles. There are companions as well you can recruit and level up, though their system is pretty bare bones. The music and sound design served well enough, setting the tone and mood relatively well. While being vastly shorter than Far Cry 5, I still logged about 18 hours on a pretty casual play through. If anything I'd wait to grab it if you see it on sale. This game isn't a life changing experience but if you got some time on the weekend and are looking for something to play with your buddy then i'd say go for it.

It turned out to be worth every penny. Yes, a bit short for a full blown game at ¬£39, but i would pay up to ¬£30.
The FC franchise has a way of changing each FC just enough to make it interesting, from FC3 to FC4 to FC5, FCPrimal, all a bit different, but keeping the same Outpost format, and plant usability for various medicines.
FC New Dawn is no exception; i particularly liked the Outpost Master with  a purpose, i.e. Scavenging an Outpost, whcih earned more Ethanol etc. Ethanol is the main currency in FCND.
And the graphics are stunning.
The weapons are pretty much standard FC; sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifles etc with a few more thrown in.
Fast travel is restricted until you undertake some Expeditions, another nice novel touch.
Also an upgradable base made a nice change.
Another welcome new feature was the upgradable weapons - again the upgrades had to be earned.

However, as you play the game, you will see that the scope of the game goes beyond your typical DLC content. I am not sure if it's worth the base price, so you may want to wait for a sale.

Now, what I find about this game to warrant a thumbs up and a recommendation are......

1.) Direct sequel to Farcry 5, kinda sorta gives closure to FC5 ending.
I cannot give more details without providing spoilers.
2.) The new Expedition mission maps are fun and are essential in grinding resources quickly.
3.) A light spoiler to FC5 so stop reading.......

The world is the perfect size for the story and you don't usually find yourself feeling like the game is out of order. The villains are a little generic, but the music is a big plus. The rap really fits this punk-style post-apocalypse. Even better, it ties up loose ends after 5's ending and the story has characters with depth. It was awesome to the see the development of the Rye family. The ability to replay outposts is also super fun. Expeditions are even better, and after playing 6, I can see where the inspiration for it's missions comes from.

This game is worth the money - It is a good game, good selection of guns, a decent selection of vehicles, a decent story with a decent ending.  A very good perks selection, a decent amount of missions, was maybe a tiny bit sparse with the story missions, but overall quite decent.  Great graphics and sound and the vehicles handled quite well, although the way the helicopters handle in this game and many other games is absolutely terrible.  The best helicopter handling in a game was the original Grand Theft Auto Vice City, all other games I have played with helicopters the handling is absolutely fucked including GTA San Andreas, GTA4 and GTA5, it just seems to get worse and worse and more uncontrollable and generally speaking if a pc or console game has helicopters, just don't bother using them at all for any reason because the handling sucks so badly they are completely and utterly uncontrollable.
Lastly, this game is worth the asking price.
The only thing that annoyed me about this game was there was arguably quite a bit of pink, pink flowers, pink graffiti and pink used on weapons and other scenery in the game and I only mention it because personally I don't like pink very much.

I mean... it is more Far Cry, and a follow up to the fifth game.
Should it be a standalone release?  Absolutely not.
Game could have been a large DLC for FC5 and ALL of its flaws would be understandable.
The actual price of FORTY DOLLARS is insane.
I got this on sale for about ten dollars and it is tolerable.  
Don't go in expecting a full Far Cry experience, this is fluff content at best.
I bought it because I wanted the follow up to FC5, and I just like running around finding hidden stuff. 

Pros:
Good Graphics
More Far Cry stuff to do
Follow up to the fifth game

Cons:
Buggy
Definitely feels like DLC
Story is rushed and not very engaging
Very small for what you are paying at full price

The game play is the same as FC5 with difference in weapons crafting (There's weapon tiers), enemies also has tiers (tho you can kill them with weaker weapons) but its just plain better to just craft the next tier weapon, Outpost clears is similar to FC5 with the added benefit of retrying liberated outpost to get extra loot as soon as you clear them (enemies gets stronger too), also the later half of the game you get unique perks that gives you abilities like super strength or stealth cloak,  those are fun when clearing outpost.Overall the game play is good but the story tho... honestly the only bright side is meeting people from FC5 and see how are they doing in the post apocalyptic setting, the main antagonist The Twins, for me is not likable they character seems bland and they dont seem to have this evil goal or any goal for that matter that their are working towards, theyre just there to makes peoples lives worst, and theyre not even good at it.

Looks like the devs forgot what this game was about and instead it's just more of the 'unlock zone after zone'. Playing slowly is NOT rewarded, exploring is NOT rewarded - you end up being carrying thousands of pieces of useless gear because all the enemies are tiered - there's no completionist rewards outside of ""shooting x enemies with a y"". And, crime of all crime, there are in game purchases. You read that right - IN GAME (IAP-like) PURCHASES in a full price title. These mostly unlock cosmetics and weapon packs which - since you never see your hero - is a total waste. I really don't get this game - it's not TERRIBLE - there's some fun action and decent gunplay for say 30 hours - but don't go slow like I did - just quickly upgrade everything (I'm 7h on normal difficulty and never died once).

It has dazzling visuals and powerful story, more powerful than Far Cry 5. The characters themselves make more sense, not some ""flat-void"" like which we can sense and feel from the 5.
It even has a more advancing gameplay style than the 5. You basically have to upgrade some stuffs at homebase to achieve true ""bang-bang"" experience, which makes the sense of true progression.
It even has a better sense of challenge then the 5, since the 5 is so easy (except the final dungeons of the 3 bosses which has more challenge). You can't summon more than one roster to accompany you which is a better move than the 5 since it give you more challange.

I had a mission where I was going to a ""fight pit"" in the enemy base, and they are supposed to not attack me, and let me through.

Well, for some reason, the NPC who is supposed to let me into the arena, a red scarf wearing enemy, immediately decided to start shooting at me, while uttering the dialogue of the quest, which told me I was welcome to come fight in the arena without problem, while shooting me over and over with a shotgun. 

All my weapons were stored in a backpack before going into the arena. I couldn't even punch in this section.

Just stand there, getting shot, while being told I can pass through a door that never opens because the NPC is shooting at me instead of opening the door.

Good job ubisoft. Good job.

And by that I mean terrible job. 

Stop releasing unfinished, unpolished and bug riddled games.  

This game isnt new. You couldve updated it.

Far Cry New Dawn

First of I just want to say that if you havnt played either Far Cry New Dawn or Far Cry 5, I would say that you should buy Far Cry 5 first just because its so connected with the locations from 5 and modded after the nuclearwar and some of the characters are there.

Story: If we are going to talk about the story its a bit diffrent from the one in Far Cry 5  because it isnt like regions and bosses like in 5. Its just the twins and their outposts that you can do a new thing called scavange when you liberate the outpost again but you get more loot and the guards are more armoured. By the way, the money in the game isnt realy money or so. You have to craft weapons which is a fun consept and to complete the story I think you need to upgrade your base to max so to do that you need to go to all the 3 people on the map at the outposts like in Far Cry 5. 

If you wonder how long the story is, its about 25-27 hours if you liberate all outposts  and do all sidemissions and so. It is pretty good still but if you think its short can you buy it on sale and it is on all the big ales I think. I bought it on the ""Chinese new-year sale"".

Gameplay: The gameplay is amazing like in Far Cry 5 but a littlie bit better for example when you takedown a person its a better animation and to take down all level 3 and 2 armourd people you need to get 3 perks but I would say its so worth it. Nothing to complain about.

Cons: 
-The con is the same problem thaat I had in Far Cry 5 but now its not as much and that is that the partyleader or the one 
 who have the game have acces to more but its as I said much lower than in 5.

-another thing that isnt that big of a deal is that you cant have a roster or hire people if you play co-op, just fix it Ubisoft.

[b]Longer Review[/b]

I have basically the same pros and cons list as my FC5 review. Except there's no forced plot progression in New Dawn. Which is a plus.

The biggest thing for me, and I'm mostly mixed about it, is the new ""RPG"" elements... Enemies have health bars and ""ranks"" now. (Apparently they do in 6, too. So I guess Ubisoft is officially moving in this direction). Far Cry 5 was already a far cry (hahahahahahahaha) from how FC1-4 played. New Dawn furthered that even more from the ""Far Cry norm"". It adds a certain challenge to the game but it just doesn't feel like a Far Cry game. I miss the gameplay from 3 and 4. The manual healing, the crafting, the actual usefullness of hunting... I played the entirety of this franchise (excluding 6) within a couple months and I'm already nostalgic for Far Cry 3 and 4!

Besides that, it's a fun game. The story is pretty good. Although, it is EXTREMELY dull in the beginning, it gets good around the end of Act 2. (MAKE SURE TO PLAY FAR CRY 5 FIRST. This is a direct sequel to that game). 

I love the Mad Max-ish type post-apocalyptic world. I love how everyone dresses and the vehicles are kinda like Mad Max too. I mean, bikes with a mounted gun on the back is great.

Companions are... ok. You can only have one of them this time, and the AI for them is dumb as rocks. Also, they literally get stuck on rocks sometimes. It's frustrating. Nana, Horatio and Gina are the best ones to get as soon as you can. They help the most. 

The voice acting is also top-notch. The villains are pretty cool and ruthless. Classic Far Cry nutcases. The other returning characters are fun to see again.

Usually my reviews are pretty lengthy, but there's not much to say about this game besides ""It's cool."" Play it to have a nice conclusion to the Far Cry 5 timeline.",1646098458,1646098595,True,2,0,0.516891896724700928,1,True,False,False

If you liked Far Cry 3 a lot - but thought that Far Cry 4 did things a bit better (the guns, the setting, the QoL improvements) then you'll understand exactly what I mean when I say: Far Cry New Dawn is just plain better than FC5


Everything that annoyed me in 5 is basically gone, the atmosphere is infinitely cooler 

maybe it's just me cause I actually live in a cabin in the wilderness - but Montana got dull after a while and radiation/mutations fix that right up 

I found the quasi-familiarity of a nuked-Montana (rather than being repetitive) fascinating and eager to see the same places post-boom boom

Remember when FC5 gave us the Kriss Vector (and then took it away cause they're jerks) but only like 200 rounds of SMG ammo (which the full-auto vector spits out in seconds)? New Dawn lets you upgrade your ammo carry in PERPETUITY 

Legendary animals are decent mini-bosses and legendary weapons feel POWERFUL like (they did in FC4) once again 

Companions are better, story is a cool follow-up to FC5, and the saw-blade launcher is almost worth installing this game alone

Again, FC5 was fine...I liked it...I just liked this more",1645586824,1645586824,True,1,0,0.480519473552703857,0,True,False,False

However..if you do everything the game has to offer then you'll really enjoy it and stretch the game for as long as you deem enough for you.
Anyway, what  I really liked about the game is the whole crafting system and supply gathering, aswell as how abilities and such are handled. Quick travel is so much better (after you upgrade it to the 2nd level tho..) and let you travel to any place you visited. i absoltly loved Timber, the most useful helper character in the game. That dog is the best...which makes everyone else kinda useless, when it comes to exploring and enemy location inforation. Speaking of helper characters....there are a lot less then in FC5 and you can only have one follow you...which is the reason why Timber was by my sides basicilly all the time throughout the game.
But nonetheless, i had a lot of fun, even if the main story itself definitly could've been better. Love the improved machanics tho",1645581068,1645581068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a longtime fan of fallout and it was nice seeing a new take on post-nuclear war life. I found this to be a bit more realistic. It's a not a full game so don't expect that. It's so fulfilling seeing where all of the characters from 5 ended up and seeing the old locations. So many easter eggs. I found the plot really interesting, particularly the parts that involved Joseph. I've played 52 hrs and have completed all of the main, side, and treasure missions, and I'm still not bored yet. My favorite part right now is the expedition feature. You get to complete missions outside of Montana for rewards. So far it's taken me to Florida, New Orleans, Alcatraz, and Iowa. The maps for these places are super detailed/accurate and quite large too. There are bits of lore everywhere and It's super interesting to be able to see other parts of the world in this universe.

Farcry New Dawn seems to play a little better Than Farcry 5.  Its just really fun to play.  Dont get me wrong I liked all the Farcry games except Blood Dragon. That drove me crazy.  I Think I have played Farcry 3 the most times.  Primal was really different I have played that 4 or 5 times.  Each time you repeat any of the games you think up a better way to win and achieve stuff.  Enjoy them all.   Have a great Day.,1645427066,1645427066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have completely nerfed the weapons system and damage. The most annoying example is If I take the time to aim for a headshot not sure how they continue to run at me and not die. OK I get it if its a boss but just the regular mobs without head armor refuse to die after a headshot because they are a higher level than me?

Save your money folks. New Dawn sucks with its bullet sponge enemies. 

I get why Ubisoft doesn't have FC6 on steam. Its because you can return games on steam and FC6 is just as bad as New Dawn and it would be a complete flop too. Its been so bad they had to bring Joseph Seed in a DLC

I was hoping far cry 5s silent protagonist was experimental and they stop by this one but they'd rather have male-female,  IN A 1ST PERSON GAME, option and remove all main character dialogue. 

After playing for a few hours i realized two more incredibly foolish design flaws, 1 limiting fast travel...... i mean why? you had 3 and 4 fast travel only to outposts, which is FINE at most but could be improved, like you did in 5, 5 you could fast travel damn near anywhere as you discover them AND you could wingsuit from any location during fast travel! THAT WAS AWESOME!
But you had to make fast travel unlockable? why? really? i know you did it for the sake of story, i guess, but you should NEVER comprimise ease of gameplay for shitty story continuity. IT WAS NOT WORTH IT

Second you removed yet, YET, another critical point of the far cry games, weapon customization. why did you remove that? i cant figure it out, it was in the engine already, it cost more time and money to remove that feature than to just leave it in

Im playing this game with my friend but boy will we not recommend it anytime soon.

The storyline starts with you on a train that crashes in a post-apocalyptic world, and the action starts right away.  You are saved by a group of folks who live out in a safe area called Prosperity, and the highwaymen led by the Twins are after you.  For some reason that storyline really sucks, but once you get further into the story it has its own story within the story that really works well as a sequel to Far Cry 5.

If this is what an apocalyptic world looks like, then let's drop the bombs.  The world is beautiful.  The sky has colors like northern lights.  The flora of the area is bright and vivid.  Animals look rugged and sometimes brighter than they should be.  It's a beautiful world to explore and this is where Far Cry has always shined as a game, the exploration is a blast.  The world doesn't look all that much different than the previous game, but following creeks, running through the forest, or eventually squirrel diving through the air to cover more ground is stunning no matter where you are.  The scenery does not change all that much, though certain sections are definitely more swampy than foresty.

The action is good, not great, but good.  You get to craft weapons as you collect resources by killing people and taking over bases.  There are a wide variety of melee weapons and a variety of guns including objects you can lob too.  The action started out easy and worked well by progressing towards a much more difficult enemy.  The enemies themselves did not vary too often.  While there are animals to fend off as well as highwaymen, the majority of the time you will be killing highwaymen and they kind of all look the same.  As the storyline progresses enemies are harder to kill unless you have the upgraded weapons, and it makes for much more intense battles as you try to conquer another outpost.

You have the option to purchase perks like access to upgraded weapons, being able to move around silently, silent kills, and more.  Eventually, you get access to weird out of this world, a la Far Cry: Blood Dragon, type of perks like double jump and other additional perks.  The game is the same as all other Far Cry games, you can play the missions only, or you can venture and hit up all of the areas on the map and collect all of the resources you can, discover all of the prepper shelters for added collectibles.  The one new resource that I don't think existed in the previous game is that now ethanol is a key component to upgrades to your base, crafting certain weapons, and more.  You can find random plane drops for ethanol, that you typically will have to fight for when you find them.  You can find some by highjacking an ethanol truck and bringing it back to an outpost without blowing up.  Even highjacking them without blowing it up before trying to make it back to an outpost before being shot and have the enemies blow it up was difficult at first.  Or, you can take over outposts.

Outposts are areas with a large contingent of highwaymen.  You shoot your way in, or silently take them out one by one until you take it over.  If they see you and they sound the alarm, reinforcements will arrive and just make it frustratingly more difficult than it should have been.  Once you take over an outpost, you can get some extra ethanol by giving it back to the highwaymen.  Taking it over a second or even a third time keep increasing the difficulty of taking over the outpost.  But each time, you will get more ethanol.  Increasing the difficulty once you have the appropriate weapons to even try it was quite fun and really amped up the ante on the intense stealth or intense shoot outs.

Eventually, you do need to collect a lot of resources in order to upgrade your base, which then allows you to upgrade you skills like crafting better weapons.  You cannot win this game without upgrading, which means it requires a bit of grinding.  While it took me quite some time to beat, I was collecting quite a lot more than I would have needed, and I think that easily you could finish the game in less than 20 hours, or take as long as me and almost 100% the entire game.

If you like the Far Cry series, then this will feel just right.  If you liked Far Cry 5, then I would suggest that this is a must as it really is a good sequel storywise.  There's not much that's new to the series, but hey if it's fun, why not give it a shot.  I definitely recommend it.  Now to wait for Far Cry 6 on Steam.",1645072945,1645232027,True,35,0,0.708456695079803467,0,True,False,False

Everything. I don't mind that there's some experimentation with the formula (though I wish it had been as the beginning of a new ""Cry"" spinoff, which would've been more appropriate), but someone at Ubi should've taken an editor's knife to this mess. The gameplay is stiff and requires hard-won perks to restore basic character performance. Enemies are bullet sponges unless you drop the difficulty all the way down, and even at this level the wildlife is more invincible than ever. The visuals are noisy and look unnatural in a way that doesn't manage to be satisfying or creative for the post-apocalyptic setting. Above all, crafting is now an intrusively major thing, and not in a way that feels appropriate or earned, just a cheap excuse to make you grind to find the fun and, insultingly, create a pathway for Ubi to squeeze microtransactions from you. Moreover, the bland, overgeneralized, cookiecutter materials for it oversaturate the environment and turn a Far Cry adventure into a Fallout scavenger hunt, except with a fraction of the variety and even less of the reward. And nailing the coffin is that the story and characters, at least so far, are too generic and underdeveloped to even give us a compelling reason to put up with all this.

Other than the map being smaller and there being PINK everywhere.

The only true difference is the whole gameplay mechanics.

Instead of your usual shoot enemy with any gun and they die. The enemy has different levels of difficulty. Now this is a cool feature and all, however it's been made very poorly.

Does it work? Sortof. However the weapons is where the issue lays. After playing for awhile you will get to a point in the game where you mostly fight high difficulty enemies. Problem here is the weapons ALSO have a SET difficulty lvl. So if you wanna use a lower level silenced weapon on a high level enemy. You can't (or well you can, but good luck)

Theres no way for you to customize the attachments either which is quite a shame. As some guns would be fun to use, but without a silencer they become harder to use making the very few top tier guns the only ones you will use.

This makes the game extremely repetitive as well you will feel limited to just a few guns that are actually usable against high lvl enemies.

For the story.. Oh lord.. Oh god. I wont spoil anything, but if you came here because you loved Joseph Seed in Far cry 5.. You will be extremely dissapointed.

Even if that is not the reason the story in this game is just not interesting.
Offcourse some people will enjoy the story, but generally it's very all over the place.

The expeditions were really cool. Other than that I honestly would say this is the worst far cry game. Try it if you want, but I do not recommend it.",1614354469,1644570902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't hate this game, in fact there is a fair amount I somewhat enjoyed while playing this but the cons overwhelmingly outweigh the pros. I'm not usually the type to actually write out a pros and cons list but I'm making an exception because this is such a mixed bag but it doesn't really deserve a f@cking essay. Spoilers ahead.

  Pros
- The art team behind the weapons in this game did a pretty excellent job, I loved the up-cycled junk weapons look
- The newly brainwashed Deputy returning as a gun for hire was pretty neat but I'd have liked if the character was explored more and had a more conclusive redemption arc instead of being stuck in side character hell.

 Neutral
- The superpowers you gain late in the game are cool but very out of place for a Far Cry game (Far Cry Instincts sucks)

 Cons
- Another lame unvoiced protagonist. One of the weakest points of Far Cry 5 was the lack of a voiced protagonist, without any back and forth between the main character and their antagonists you lose out on the tangible personal vendettas of characters from previous entries in the franchise and instead are left with playing as a boring self insert.
- So many ideas, characters and concepts feel very half baked, the team was given one of the more interesting settings of a post apocalyptic world, where you can create any number of diverse and interesting groups to fill this new world but instead we get a Gen Z biker gang and the almost not boring tribal Eden's Gate.
- No weapon customisation, feels like a huge wasted opportunity and a pointless step backwards.
- Tiered enemies and weapons feel like artificial difficulty, I get why it was done as without it there wouldn't be this harder second area like with Far Cry 2, 3 and 4 but its was poorly executed and lame.
- Mickey and Lou are terrible antagonists with zero of the redeeming or interesting qualities previous antagonists feature.
- Joseph along with the entirety of Eden's Gate feels like a massive letdown comparative to the buildup they had in 5, and the new Seed child, Josephs adoptive son Ethan Seed is particularly a boring, whiney manchild.
- micro transactions in a single player game, including purchasable high tier weapons and perks.... what the hell Ubisoft.

I didn't enjoy Far Cry 5 much, so at first I wasn't curious about this game. Then after 1 month of releasing, it was on 50% discount. My friend bought it and so did I in order to play coop. Here's some pros and cons -

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]In my opinion, the graphics is better than Far Cry 5.
[*]How the hell does the environment become PINKY by radiation?? I don't know. It looks childish, but it's fun (at least for me, xD)
[*]COOP mode. I enjoyed it
[*]Plenty of Side mission and activities.
[*]Expeditions aka unique side mission. It's more enjoyable in coop mode.
[*]Many Collectibles. I enjoyed collecting those
[*]Guns for hire. These AIs are not intelligent, but yeah kinda functional.
[*]Enemies Health Indicator. Yeah, this is a great implementation.
[*]Photo mode
[*]Different kinds of weapon
[*]No bugs, glitches were experienced
[*]The Father..He is literally the father figure in this game..
[*]Foliage effects and physics is great compared to the Far Cry 5 (at least in my playthrough in April '18). At that time, Far cry 5 physics was trash, Foliage never shook even when the chopper had passed by. Maybe they fixed it, I don't know.
[/list]
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Story is not enjoyable.
[*]Crap villain.
[*]Sprinting animation is trash. Press W and Shift and it feels like the protagonist is floating. This floating was in Far Cry 5 too
[*]No loot, skin animation...Crap
[*]Short story
[*]Fu**ing Superpowers

That's all I can remember...

This could be an awesome standalone expansion, but it somewhat fails. That doesn't mean it is unpleasant. This isn't bad either. I had pretty much enjoyed with my friend before my college started.

This game is a sequel to Far Cry 5 which I don't think Ubisoft has done before in the Far Cry series. I was hyped that a new Far Cry game came out. The story is quite boring I would say for myself usually games have a strong start but this game didn't have one the ending was more strong than the start even tho the ending was 2 EZ killed the final boss in a minute. Aiming with the pistols is weird feels like your arms are 2 meters long. You can't use the animal skins for upgrading anything except a few guns but you can only sell them for money of course.

Otherwise, the game is basically a reskin of farcry 5, They do a good job of connecting the farcry 5 world to farcry new dawn but I wish the map had been bigger.

The new weapons are OK at best, they don't really matter because you'll be using the same weapons from farcry 5 with a more rusty look 99% of the time anyways.

The new characters aren't that great either. Kim Rye and Carmina Rye are poor attempts at making a supporting character and all guns for hire excluding animals are one of those things you unlock and never use again.

The Villains of this game are decent. Nothing special, They don't have the same feeling to Joseph Seed, Or any of the other Seed members.  In farcry 5 they made you wanna punch your screen at sight of the antagonist but in farcry new dawn it just felt like a boss fight.

Easily the biggest improvement from 5 to this game is the incredible atmosphere, which is just dripping with equally beautiful and haunting environments brought to life by eye-catching colorful environments and evocative imagery, artistically speaking this is the best game in the series since Far Cry: 2. Another thing I just loved was the weapon models, there were basically just reskins from past games but they didn't feel like it with excellent post-Apocalyptic touches on them like exposed batteries powering red dot sights or screwdrivers taped onto assault rifles for bayonets. Unfortunately, the other big addition which is the RPG mechanics isn‚Äôt the best. While some of the changed progression from past games feels good, a lot of it feels out of place like the health bars and the lack of customizing weapons which detracts a lot from the combat sandbox. The storytelling is just as if not weaker than Far Cry: 5 with a large lack of big moments and the blandest characters in the whole series with the twins easily being the worst and least intimidating villains in the series. I think this is only one or two steps below Primal in quality if not just for the fact that this game just tries a lot less than Primal.

New Dawn fixes so much of what was wrong with 5.

Principally connecting the mechanics together. Now you have to do side missions and level up both your self and your weapons in order to beat the outposts and main missions.

There is a tighter story here while still giving the player room to breathe. No meters to fill and be pulled out of the immersion. The characters while not as charming as the original cast (mostly due to how short it is compared to five), still come off as worth doing their quests.

The soundtrack is killer and the atmosphere oozes post-apocalypse.

And the ending is makes the experience worth it.

I do wish it was longer, but at this point, the far cry formula has really worn out its welcome, so I am glad it was a short, but sweet journey.

Everything from a gameplay aspect just makes sense, and is very enjoyable.  My only grip in this area of the game is that there was no harder difficulty.  Made for console peasants clearly...

Even if the game ends up decent after that (despite a few major bugs in the first hour), there's no way I can recommend that.


Edit after playing ~10h:

Game is okay-ish. It's one of those open world but ridiculously ""handholdy"" games, every mission is 100% on rails and if you don't exactly follow the script, either everything pauses until you're back on track, or worse, you fail. For example: run a few meters ahead of the person you're supposed to follow? They just stop, you're in front of them, wrong, you're supposed to follow. Or worse, you're supposed to follow someone (as in, someone talking to you, not ""stealth follow"" or anything), but see something to loot like 10 meters back and decide to go get it? Mission failed. Reload last checkpoint.

The main story should just be removed, it's that bad. Almost every main character is just ridiculously clich√©, and not in a good way. Many cutscenes can be skipped, but sadly, not all.

Game is very short, about 10h long, and boss fights are awful if you haven't upgraded weapons to max before.",1643358945,1643689956,False,3,0,0.558461844921112061,0,True,False,False

This is an open world game, exclusively. Any attempt to break up the monotonous drivel of clearing out every marker on a map is poorly executed to such a degree that I didn't even bother finishing this one. It's a problem that also exists in every Far Cry game before and after this one, so skip those in the future too. The shit attempt to incorporate RPG mechanics by having higher level enemies be essentially unkillable unless you have the pre-requisite level weapon is done so sloppily and black-and-white that you essentially are playing the game to exclusively upgrade your weapon level, not for perk points or map completion or the ""fun"" of the game, those don't exist unless you can get to the next level and actually do damage to the bullet sponges they start to throw at you.

One thing to focus on with this game, and 5 and 6 especially, is just how shitty every single mission in the entire game is. There was not a single mission in FC5 that I remember fondly, yet I do remember consistently hating nearly every mission in the game. This game is no different. You are either protecting some NPC spewing out some of the poorest written, lowest quality dialogue you can hear in a video game (honestly quite an accomplishment considering the Borderlands series exists), or driving the slowest car imaginable in a gauntlet that is either nearly impossible or laughably easy (and always boring as shit and impossible to control), or walking. Just walking. You do a lot of that in this game, and the airdrop-fast-travel is unlocked late enough in the game that you are forced to traverse quite a bit of the completely empty land between landmarks. A generous 1% of the game's map area is filled with anything, or ever has a mission take place on it. The other 99%+ is completely empty land, nothing to do, nothing to look at, and often absolutely zero enemies to fight, human or otherwise. This leaves the 1% to do some really heavy lifting, and it unfortunately falls so short I was a little surprised. Every single mission is just so, so bad. The map is lifeless and boring, the enemies are walking bricks with little dialogue and no idle behavior, the weapons are boring blocks just there to separate them from you, the skills and abilities are nearly pointless, with the powerful ones introduced far too late in the game and the skill tree being roughly 50% worthless, nothing in the entire game compels you to continue playing one second longer.

While a lot of people, (including myself) would've just wanted this to be DLC for FC5, they figured that it deserved a standalone spot. Honestly, it makes no sense, since it's literally reused assets and textures from 5. I stand with a lot of people who would've wanted to see that horrible film director DLC replaced with this, making 5 have 3/3 outstanding DLC's. One thing that steered me away from the game for a while was all of the damage numbers, and random bs that they had in the gameplay videos. What no one told me is that you can turn all of that off, and make it look like an original Far Cry game. The positive points I will say about the game, is that it's cool they made an ending for 5, after it left you off on a cliff hanger. A lot of people wanted to see Hope County through, and some felt that it was a pretty anti-climatic ending. They brought back SOME of the people, and most of them you can't even use as a companion. Also, all of them are decrepit and pretty useless now, leaving your character as their figurative grandson who's getting called to get some kids off their lawn. Mentioning the enemies, the twins are some of the most unlikeable, boring bosses in Far Cry. Seriously, I can't think of another Far Cry where the final boss was not only boring story wise, but also terrible combat wise. Seriously, the last mission fighting them is just you running around in smoke screens for 30 minutes, spraying into their heads over and over, while helicopters are shooting you, dogs are biting you and bringing you into animations, people with LMG's, shields, they throw every character at you in an endless wave until you kill these JUGGERNAUTS of bosses. Not to mention they will literally hide from you to summon more enemies to slow you down. I was spraying them consistently, and used more than 200 mags between the both of them, on an ELITE gun. Bringing up the ranking system, they now have it to where the enemies, and animals, can be between 1-4 levels. Each one gives them an additional health bar, and an elite pretty much has more health than an armored tank. There is no money in the game, and you literally have to craft EVERY. SINGLE. THING. Vehicles? Gotta craft them. Weapons? Gotta craft them. Literally anything? Gotta craft it. These weapons that you craft, you can't change any of the attachments! What are we doing with these pre-made classes? Also, you wanna fast travel? That's a camp upgrade for some reason. The takedowns are locked behind a perk wall, making it to where you have to spend around 30 perk points, just to do a takedown on an elite. I'm not gonna lie, after clearing all the forts and beating the game, I think I barely got 30 perk points, since they want you to buy them with real money. (Yes, you can buy perk points with REAL MONEY) The crafting is ridiculous, seeing as I couldn't even make 2 guns after everything in the game I did, and looting like I'm in Tarkov, taking anything that I can carry. It's so obvious this was just a cash grab, and it's blatant within the first hour. Even the first mission for the story, has you just looting materials to upgrade the base. THE FIRST MAIN STORY QUEST. There have been multiple missions where you have to play the game a completely stupid and useless way, because you're locked behind a perk wall. Don't believe me? Try playing this game stealthily at all like the old ones. Unless you got those 30 perk points, you're just gonna be throwing knives, and hoping they insta kill. Also, get used to using semi automatic guns, or burst fire, since that's gonna be the only weapons besides the m4 that drops on the ground from them. It seemed like every single weapon was either burst, or single fire. Also, no one cares about those saw blade weapons, this isn't Rage. All in all, if you can find the game for under 10$, I guess it's worth it. But for the 30$ that they charged people for this when it came out? I feel bad. There's only 10 outposts, and 22 main missions. I think it took me 8 or so hours to do it all, compared to the 28 I just spent beating 6 and all of it's content. The only people playing this are super-fans of 5, and even for them, this game is just a disappointment. If this was DLC, it would've been perceived so much better. But, we are grading this as a standalone Far Cry game. And by far, this is the worst Far Cry game ever made.",1643583862,1643598222,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i give this awful game : 4/10 ! 
===
ok first of all after i played far cry 5 @ 100% and i reviewed it i gave it 5/10 ! 
it was not a bad game but it was FAR FAR FAR BELOW my expectations and it was just abysmal !
===
but compared to this piece of sheet, you are better off playing far cry 5 as far cry new dawn is more like a mini game !
when i started playing far cry new dawn my first impression of the game was very well. i loved the high graphics,
i loved the pink shiny full of light world and environments.
but after 2 hours the game will start to show it's flaws and undeveloped aspects.
1 - first of all the Ai is ABYSMAL ! the ai cant even navigate and get around simple objects, they get stuck behind barrels and walls, you will have to hunt down the last remaining enemy in every outpost mission.
2 - the backstories that was introduced to the game does not sit well with the story at all and feel forced.
3 - introducing new characters was a mistake instead the game could have had more backstory from characters in the original game.
4 - the twins are not believable as bad ass characters and feel more like when my girlfriend brings one of her friends to the bed.
5 - joseph seed does not reveal any information what ever as what happened to the deputy that you were in far cry 5 nor explains what happened or how they survived. the only time joseph says anything about the deputy is after the first mission you see him ENDS and you must go to him and talk to him which is optional and most people will miss it not that it reveals anything special which it does not, it simply just state that there were a deputy with him.
6 - one the more important things here is that this is really not a standalone game it feels like a DLC, you get 22 main story missions, and since the game is SO SHORT ! they make you play every expedition and outpost mission 3 times so that game has some play hours to offer which is just repeat, repeat, repeat !
the only good aspect of the game is if you play it with a friend on CO-OP !
and you cant join a random player's game nor any player can join your game !
you must actually invite a friend to play with you, which i did not experience !
HEY UBISUCK, RESIDENT EVIL 5 STILL HAS RUNNING SERVERS THAT ANYONE CAN JOIN ! GO F YOUR SELF !
on the plus side THE HDR FULL OF COLORS PINK ENVIRONMENT WAS FUN AND A BLAST but it gets old fast !
and HDR is like a syrup on an ice cream, if the ice cream taste bad, who cares about the syrup >???!
only buy this game if you have a friend to play with or you want an HDR experience.
the game itself sucks ! only play this game if you have played every other game in the world and you have nothing to play !
buy this game ONLY ON SALE which is 9.99$ , it is not worth more than that.
ubisoft did not put a lot of effort in this game and you should not spend a lot of money on it too.

While this is definitely the sequel to Far Cry 5, they did things to the gameplay that I both approve and disapprove of. I like the more in-depth gun game, the enemy scaling, and the outpost scaling system. I liked the new expeditions mode. I wasn't a fan of the map getting smaller, as they ended up cutting and redrawing Hope County so much I found myself in an uncanny valley of sorts. Maybe ""confusingly alien but familiar"" was intentional. I also wasn't a fan of the story, I found the antagonists to be a step-down from the prior game's bad guys. The psychadelic graffiti-aesthetic they had was cool at first but got kinda boring and repetitive.

Compared to other Far Cry games.

Cons: (Mild)
- You better play Far Cry 5 Before playing this.
- Not a Big fan of the weapons upgrading system as you need to upgrade other buildings and sections before you unlock new tier weapons
- Weapons don't have upgrades, you get the gun/weapon as it is either with or without attachments.
- To upgrade any aspect of your weapons or character health or crafts ...... you must upgrade other buildings and sections with it that you may not be interested in.
- No options in the story, it is linear, only some tiny difference in the ending.

Pros: (Great)
- Has one of the if not the best endings in the far cry series, let me be clear, not an EPIC ending on the scale of all games history, just for the Far cry series.
- AMAZING music
- very very nice atmosphere and environment.

It was a nice experience and a good wrap for Far Cry 5",1643389136,1643389136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately it cannot compare itself to it, the story is promising but lacks connection to the characters to make it quite as good as it could be, really the only characters i cared about were the ones connected to the previous game and i think it may have to do with the fact that the intro wasn't as good as in FC5.

 It's the same when it comes to gameplay, it's not bad but i think it could have seen improvements, the grinding system just wasn't for me, especially since it means you have to do the same objectives multiple times at different difficulties in order to get better weapons, vehicles etc which are absolutely necessary to play the game and not be stomped by some random npc wandering by the road. The basics however are good, that is to mean handling, controls and such.

Something i was annoyed with as well is the fact that the map was so small compared to FC5, it's the same map but ca 30% of the map have been cut out. This doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing but after paying for the game it felt as if i got a dlc for the price of a full game, overall i think this might have done better when presented as a huge dlc for FC5. There is also less content in this game than it's predecessor, probably because it's more grind focused which i personally don't prefer, although some do.

Visually the game looks great, a lot of vibrant colors and nice scenery, the design is obviously similar to the previous game in the series but it didn't feel repetitive since all locations had been changed in some way and i enjoyed seeing how the old world and also characters had changed over time.

An addition i really liked were the raids where you are flown out to a location filled with enemies to infiltrate it and steal supplies. You can choose to be stealthy or go in guns blazing and it's really fun, there is probably a good 10+ additional hours of fun if you want to do them all since they are all in different and varied locations.

Overall think it's a fun game that will last most up to maybe 40 hours, 
It's especially worth playing if you liked FC5 and i did have a lot of fun playing the game but i would pay the full 45 dollars for it, i got it for ca 20 dollars on sale and i think price was reasonable so i would say it's worth up to 30 euro/dollars.
I give it a 7/10

Original:
I love Far Cry.  I've played Far Cry, FC Instincts, FCI Predator, FC2, FC3, FC3 Blood Dragon, FC4, FC Primal, and FC5.  Somehow, in 9 games from the same series, including 6 that follow the same basic formula, I don't remember being bored or frustrated or having to ""power through just to finish"" - until New Dawn.  And honestly, this game does have stuff going for it.  It keeps to the working formula overall, revisits Hope County from FC5, has characters that fit a Far Cry storyline, and an interesting world that feels pretty packed with stuff to do.  But the one, blaring thing that they changed pretty much kills all the rest of it:  RPG elements.

The Far Cry games, starting with FC2, have been all about approaching most objectives however you want.  If you want to infiltrate the biggest base with a pistol and a throwing knife, go for it.  Storm the gates with a car covered in C4 and a machine gun in your pocket as backup?  Why not.  Want to hunt bear with a bow and arrow and rabbits with a rocket launcher?  Get on out there, champ.  Weapons have strengths and weaknesses as they would in real life, but all of them are useful and will get the job done if you do it right.  The weapons are tools, and it's up to you to make them work well.

But here we are, in the new age of skill trees and stats and ""gear scores"", and now your M60 machine gun won't kill that grizzly bear inside of 150 rounds because the bear is a Tier 3 enemy while your gun is only a Tier 1 gun.  Need to storm that outpost to get resources?  Aw, sorry - there's an Elite enemy in there that will take more ammo to kill than you can carry, guess you'll have to come back later.  Get attacked by a random mountain lion while going to your object?  Dang, that's a Tier 3 mountain lion!  Drop your assault rifle and run away!  All of a sudden, your gun determines whether or not you can advance.  The answer?  Ignore all the Tier 1 garbage, rush to get to Tier 2 so you can get that Tier 2 SMG they give you now from the Ubi club thing, then do your best to rush to Tier 3.  When you get to Tier 3 weapons, make sure you don't scavenge one of your outposts a third time, or else it'll be covered in Elite enemies that you can't really kill yet.  The problems go on...

Also introduced in this game was, of course, a crafting system - the other bane of gaming's existence for the last decade.  For a long time you could craft things like medkits and the like, but now your crafting system gets you weapons and vehicles and - because it's now a post apocalyptic scenario and of course we have to rebuild a civilization rather than doing literally anything else that's actually fun - upgrades for this home base of yours.  It's a very simple system with a few different resources to gather, so it doesn't bog it down too much.  But that need to search for resources just distracts from that Far Cry magic of ""go fight your war, call us if you need something"".

I'm only about 5 hours into New Dawn and honestly... I'm powering through just to finish.  And that pains me, as I played Far Cry 4, Primal, and 5 back to back after getting them on sale recently and each one just made me more excited for the next game.  If you don't mind the RPG tier system garbage, then honestly there is a lot to like here so far, which is why I'm still willing to continue on to finish the game.  But if you're a long time Far Cry fan and just want more Far Cry... maybe go back and play one of the others - or go into this one ready to stomach it.

I really hope New Dawn will also be the final sunset on this RPG system, and they bury this idea in one of those old Seed brother bunkers never to been seen again...",1642021295,1642112815,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a game that I honestly did not want to finish. Fast forward, I finished 5 and was iffy about New Dawn. I read reviews on here stating that it should have been DLC and had quite a few bugs. I eventually started while on my comedown from the Far Cry 5 energy and when I started, I was quite disappointed. The story did not make sense with the timeline (such as survival of x characters), I was quite confused how survivors were able to live live out of their bunkers within x time (for some reason I thought it was 6 years) and how x,y and z are a thing. The more I played this game, the more it grew on me however I have a few points

1) expect bugs. I know it's Ubisoft however the number of times I would get into a vehicle after it spawned from a garage and it exploded or how I would phase into the environment (such as rocks) was ridiculous.
2) The antagonists are fun and all however they are not the bad guys from the previous games. Their characters are mediocre and not as fun which is a shame as if Ubisoft had them appear more or even just cause more destruction than what occurred in the game, they would be sitting up with Vaas or Seed.
3) The soundtrack. The soundtrack is great and all however needs more songs. The number of times I would raid an outpost and ""Fatty Boom Boom"" or ""S**t just got Real"" by Die Antwoord or hop into a car and ""Tequila"" by Bill Black's Combo or ""Daydream Believer"" by The Monkeys would just repeat was stupidly irritating. Come on Ubisoft, you should have had more songs in this game.

With these things put aside, the game is like Mad Max meets Rage which was quite cool. The series did not really need this game and I agree that it could have been DLC as it is pretty much just a reskin of models and such with only 1 new weapon and some other things (spoilers) added. The game relies more on a crafting element and base building compared to others in the series which is cool. I'm happy to see more of Seed and get a conclusion to him however this game did not need to be (but it still happened). It is a nice filler in between 5 and 6. If you are looking at purchasing this game, pay $40-$50 max but not the full retail price. I completed the game over a week and a half (100%) with only up to 4 hours a night (if lucky) of game time (my hours in this game are due to the game not shutting down properly and still running in the background while I slept and worked a 10-hour shift). 

To conclude, I have to give this game a 6.5-7/10. :)

Long story short, the magic of FC5 didn't carry over to FarCry New Dawn. 

But instead, it was a new dawn for the game design philosophy, one which embarrassed grinding, RPG elements, and leveling up stuff you use, and it didn't work out.

The real mystery to me whether this new dawn of designing the game was the pitfall of it, its story, and its fading magic, or the story was bad from the start and the game didn't have any magic, to begin with.

The premise of the game was promising, to continue the events of the previous game and the idea of meeting the Father once again and it starts good, it starts pink and vibrant, but, as you will end up discovering, its all colors and aesthetics and no substance.

Even playing the game in co-op didn't help its case (I don't like open-world games but co-op makes them fun, especially FarCry games). 
For example, you can't initiate missions, interact with some characters, do some stuff unless you are the party leader so the other person in the party just has to stand there and wait for the party leader to do everything. You can't contribute to leveling up, with resources and stuff unless you are the party leader, quite a real cooperative experience...

It just felt like a drag, could it be because things are familiar from the last game and as such boring? you would think it would feel just like being at home,  I don't know but I can't help but blame the levels system and RPG mechanics, weak unmemorable characters and grind and grind and more grind, it just saturates the entire freaking game and ruins it, and makes it no longer a FarCry.

Let me first say that I am a bit biased, Far Cry is one of my favorite game franchises out there and honestly I couldn't tell you why.  That being said I went into Far Cry: New Dawn with low expectations as I had heard a lot of mixed things about it, but hot damn if I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  To make this coherent and relevant I should first address the issues that people have with the game.

1. To much grind
This one has some ground to stand on in a sense, but honestly for me it was never a problem.  Getting the materials you need is as easy as taking a camp and spamming E for a minute then done.  And then you can get a ton of resources by doing the expedition missions.  I was never lacking any resources, in fact I just started making garbage because I had to much.  And it should be noted I did all the level one expedition missions.

2. The villains are very good
To be honest I kind of liked them, especially their ending, all around I liked their dynamic, granted they were not as good as Pagan or even Joseph but I still think they were solid villains all together.  Though sometimes they just did some weird stuff that made no sense.  Like when they force you to confront them and they make you free some people and that somehow makes you have ""less power"", just weird.

3. The story isn't very good
Well, Far Cry isn't exactly known for it's writing is it?  No, the problem here are the characters.  Throughout the whole game I really felt like this was written by two completely different people.  Most the game is spent in Providence or whatever (I don't even remember) and most of the characters are forgettable, their story is generic at best and I had no real feeling for them.  They had some good characters like Roger was fun, same with Irwin, and Hurk still gets a chuckle out of me.  Anyway these characters aren't just sad or weird as their traits they are actually fun.

What had me hooked was Joseph's story and New Eden, honestly the story should have revolved more around them.  Their story and it's relation to real biblical tales is always making you question whether this is truly from God or just some mad man's illusions.  Joseph comes out more human, a man who had lost everything, the writing isn't always great but this game has some moments that really got me to think.

5/10 - The game itself is fun, I can't say much for the combat or gameplay, it's Far Cry 5 if you like that you'll like this.",1582320991,1641588313,True,11,3,0.607820987701416016,0,True,False,False

Edit: I also forgot to mention the story, it felt like a lazy glued together blob, not worth your time. There's also a bit less stuff to do. It feels like they were missing a lot of stuff that Farcry 5 got right. I just hope the 6th installment does not disappoint unlike this one. This is probably the worse one.

Same setting (similar map, and still called Hope County), same Joseph Seed, same cult; you're just doing slightly different stuff with them. Going from 5 to New Dawn feels like going from Star Wars episode 6-Rogue One. Same series and overarching villain, but a different story with different characters and slightly later on chronologically. 

Onto the game in its own right...

It's good, but the main antagonists are WAYY more annoying than intimidating. They never interact with you unless you can't fight back and then all they do is talk shit and beat you. 

Ignoring those two fuckwits, I had fun. If you've played a far cry game you've played em all, this one's just a bit shorter. 100% completion would probably be like 22 hours imo, which is incredibly short compared to any other AAA singleplayer games being released. Honestly could be as short as 10-12 hours if you only go for the main missions. An average first playthrough probably takes around 18 hours (15 if you don't stray from the story a ton, and around 21 if you're going for every mission + collectibles).

I really like the tiers of enemies and how every outpost starts at tier 1 then you beat it, ""scavenge,"" it now has tier 2 enemies, and so on up to 3. It allows you to choose how much you want to be challenged in the early game, and allows significant, yet still fun, engaging, and very rewarding replayability in the SAME save file. It's also an incredibly easy and fair way to gate late game quests, as you need to be geared and have health upgrades before you can take them on. It was also really fun being late game and having one or two outposts left and just plowing through all 3 tiers. The contrast between the enemy difficulty is really cool to see back to back. 

However, I would NOT pay full price for this. It's good, but it's so short that I'd say $20 max is the fairest price. At $20 it's worth it, at $10 or lower it's a steal and you should definitely check it out.",1641348921,1641348921,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

All previous FC (Blood Dragon don't count) atleast tried to be kinda realistic but NW is like ""shut up and give me your money"".

Action take place around 20 years after FC5 , so Hope Country should be a nuclear wasteland but  instead we got Barbie world all colorful, deep  blue sky and flowers everywhere only what is missing are unicorms.

You play as another voiceless, faceless, nameless someone who came to Hope Country on train full of ppl to help defeat some bandits that get resupply by Jambo Jets but instade your train got wrecked so everyone but you dies. Perfect savior. 
Later you met all old friends from FC5 and you help em fight evil twins (srsly the worst antagonist in series even worst that true enemy in FC3) by going to New Eden ans asking Joseph for help.... Even better idea.

So you think okey story is stupid but maybe shooting is fun? Wrong!!!
ND got new tier system. So if you wanna hurt someone your weapon tier must be equal or higher of enemy/animals or else you gonna feel like shooting with BB gun.

So how to get better weapon? The answer is grind. A lot of grind. First you must get fuel to upgrade all facilities ,then do 5 side missions to get back 5 ppl.
And now real grind begins. Cause to make weapon you need some gears some parts, tons of titanium (300 titanium to make a AK-47 and where you find titanium ?ofc in safes thats in every location or hunt grizzly) and electronic parts (you get em only from legendary Bizons so you need legendary weapon to kill em).

But hey there are good news if you don't wanna grind and just focus on shooting you can alwayse spend another 50$ to buy ubi points to unlock 4 weapons and spend another 50$ for more toys.

939960,107032635,76561198843217487,0,4,968,0,828,1641023271,"Far Cry New Dawn is a interesting game that basically plays into the senses of an rpg fps, you play as the Captain who has to save Hope County from the Far Cry version of the Borderlands  Pandora Psychos. The game is a contiutation of the Far Cry 5 Joseph Seed saga, so if you didn't play FC5, don't touch this. It's a mess without it. 

To put it simply, you got one job. Kill the Highway-man and make sure that your home base is still standing, when I first play this game. I was overwhelmed to be quite honest with you, as a fan of the FC series from starting the renown FC 3 to the illustrious FC 5. I can simply say one thing: 

Far Cry New Dawn is definitely not the freaking same as any of the Far Cry games. It is something completely different on so many levels here, Ubisoft thought it would be fantastic to make all of the enemies into 4 levels. 

1 - is your starting level, which would have starting weapons such as a rusty gun, rusty rifle, a rusty launcher, and so on. 

2 - would be more of the makeshift weaponry but they also don't have that much damage

3 - would be more of the makeshift weaponry but it's becoming more modernized to actually cause real life damage but still it can be rather laughable to a level 4 enforcer. To the point where you kinda just wanna throw the controller down and go search for more materials. 

Oh I forgot, you have to search for more materials which isn't actually that hard if you have wallet money. Yep. That's right. Microtransactions as if it was a Sim City's app on an Iphone as far as you can see. The materials however can be worked with if you kill enough animals to get the said materials but those are also level based as well. 

Now with all of these levels, they're not really a big huge gripe to be honest. It felt natural and more realistic to actually attack someone but the problem is that this game is really glitchy. From takedowns being one of the MOST RELEVANT moves of all times get blocked by not being at the right distance of the said target, to actual markings of certain enemies to simply disapper to keybinding moves not being able to do the action for any reason. I can count so many times when I got shot or killed or even fall because the game didn't want to work. It felt like I was fighting AGAINST the game instead of working with the game to get to my goal. 

And with all of these levels, you would think that upgrading the said levels would actually cause a form of buff or even damage reducing to lower level of weaponry that the enemy might hold? NOPE!!! NO SUCH THING!!

You can literally get killed quicker with a rusty pistol and honestly that is just messed up for the fact that Ubisoft didn't even put the handiwork to actually give the player the meta. It does make it challenging I will admit and it does feel good when an outpost is finished and you are completely standing on a pile of bodies. Yep. You can drink that victory cold champagne because it does feel good to be the best when the world hates you the most. But I'm going to be honest, I'm rather tired of Ubisoft keep doing these things to this series. 

Finally my main issue with the game: I don't like all of the dream, acid dream sequences. I think they're a waste of time, none of the said dream sequences made me want to question my motives and question so much if anything. They were a waste of just programming, yes they were interesting via creativity but I don't feel anything after I went through the standard Far Cry acid trip hallucination dream. 

The big bad two villians are not that interesting and they actually are not that entertaining. They feel like they're just kids who are playing raider of the thunderdome, when in reality villains proved that your situation is grim and that it's impossible to actually win and when you look into their back story. You can see some of the problems of both sides but with the big bad two villians that we have, I don't really feel anything when I look at their backstories. 

Throughout the game however, you have gun for hires, which are partners to help you through your journey whether it's a mute who likes to shoot arrows or a grandmother with a sniper rifle. I honestly can say that they didn't help nor they did assisted my journel, I felt I was always getting caught because of something the AI did rather than what the actual mission was at hand. 

Your perks and new upgrades are rather dull and boring, nothing of interesting whenever you need it to be and nothing of interesting whenever you want it to be. What does that mean? It means you have to get a perk point to get scopes so you can identify the enemy, something you thought it was going to have automatically but it didn't. Also you need to get perk points so you can takedown more enemies over time but that's kind of a whole issue becuase it's very rare if you're ever gonna get a chance to take them down. The enemies are more receptive depending on the level and those wonderful guns that they have doesn't actually slow you down. It's like you're a level 1 and they are level 3's the whole time and that's just the starting levels. 

It would be understandable and a little sloggish of Ubisoft to include crafting materials for armor and ballistics like they clearly did for the Highway man but honestly that's clearly asking too much. 

Sad to see Hope County go away but honestly Ubisoft messed this game up so much, I'm glad I can finally finish it. 

Far Cry New Dawn gets a 6/10.

[h1] Story / Gameplay [/h1]

Far Cry New Dawn is set in the same Hope County area as Far Cry 5, but is scaled down to the north and east and the action takes place 17 years later. When the members of Prosperity dare to leave their bunkers, the Highwaymen - led by sisters Mickey and Lou - already hold control of large parts of Hope County. Only the border to the apparently deserted northern part of the map is controlled by New Eden, who patrol the highwaymen outside their area at night and see themselves as the successors of the Peggies (Project at Eden‚Äôs Gate, the Christian fanatical antagonist organization from Far Cry 5).

The game begins with the player character, who can be either male or female, and other fighters take the train to Hope County to support Prosperity. The Highwaymen derail the train and kill all survivors of the train accident except the player and Thomas Rush, who are separated. The player is found by Carmina, daughter of the leader of Prosperity, and won over for the resistance against the Highwaymen. As with the previous games in the Far Cry series, Far Cry¬Æ New Dawn is an open world game in which the player can explore and interact with the entire world. The player saves Thomas Rush (who will soon be kidnapped and killed again) and wins other characters, some of which are already known from Far Cry 5, for Prosperity. It turns out, however, that Prosperity cannot win against the Highwaymen on its own and needs the help of New Eden. Its leader Ethan is the son of Joseph Seed, the main antagonist of Far Cry 5.

[h1] Geschichte / Gameplay [/h1]

Far Cry New Dawn spielt im selben Gebiet Hope County, wie Far Cry 5, ist allerdings im Norden und Osten verkleinert und die Handlung spielt sich 17 Jahre sp√§ter ab. Als sich die Mitglieder von Prosperity aus ihren Bunkern trauen, halten bereits die Highwaymen ‚Äì angef√ºhrt von den Schwestern Mickey und Lou ‚Äì die Kontrolle √ºber gro√üe Teile von Hope County. Lediglich die Grenze zum scheinbar menschenleeren Nordteil der Karte wird durch New Eden kontrolliert, die nachts au√üerhalb ihres Gebiets gegen die Highwaymen patrouillieren und sich als Nachfolger der Peggies (Project at Eden‚Äôs Gate, die christlich-fanatische Antagonistenorganisation aus Far Cry 5) verstehen.

Das Spiel beginnt damit, dass der Spielercharakter, der wahlweise m√§nnlich oder weiblich sein kann, und weitere K√§mpfer mit dem Zug nach Hope County fahren, um Prosperity zu unterst√ºtzen. Die Highwaymen lassen den Zug entgleisen und t√∂ten alle √úberlebenden des Zugungl√ºcks au√üer den Spieler und Thomas Rush, die aber getrennt werden. Der Spieler wird von Carmina, Tochter der Anf√ºhrerin von Prosperity, gefunden und f√ºr den Widerstand gegen die Highwaymen gewonnen. Wie auch bei den vorigen Spielen der Far-Cry-Spielereihe handelt es sich auch bei Far Cry¬Æ New Dawn um ein Open-World-Spiel, bei dem der Spieler die gesamte Welt erkunden und mit ihr interagieren kann. Der Spieler rettet im Verlauf der Handlung Thomas Rush (der bald allerdings wieder entf√ºhrt und get√∂tet wird) und gewinnt weitere Charaktere, die teils schon aus Far Cry 5 bekannt sind, f√ºr Prosperity. Es stellt sich jedoch heraus, dass Prosperity alleine nicht gegen die Highwaymen gewinnen kann und die Hilfe von New Eden ben√∂tigt. Deren Anf√ºhrer Ethan ist der Sohn von Joseph Seed, dem Haupt-Antagonisten von Far Cry 5.

I am a fan of Far Cry 5, while it was way more streamlined and casual compared to the past few titles, which were Streamlined and Casual versions of their older games, this one hit a certain nerve of going too far. We have barely any weapons, 5 had like 20 pistols, this one around 4, the other game had tons of rifles, this one has around 5. We have 3 boats you can buy, a handful of verhicles, 3 Helicopters and Planes? They're just outright gone.

The map at least seems smaller, the story was also kinda disapointing, as the premise was cool, with a landscape full of nature turning to chaos thanks to a few Mad-Max-like villains, but it all felt shallow and underdeveloped. I mainly bought this tho to finish off Joseph and find the Dep, the Dep ended up as a Hunter with no voicelines and Joseph threw away everything when his Kid died.

Honestly this ruins Joseph as a whole, his whole thing was ""lets sacrifice everything for a new world"" and you know, it was *kinda* goin well, you had a small clan of peaceful lads, a son, a nice village, but the MOMENT youe asshole son dies, you throw EVERYTHING away. All the lost lives, destroyed land, fired bullets and crucified Farmers for nothing. As ""you are the true chosen one"" or whatever bullshit he says. Like yeah, cool, you killed Ethan and ate an apple, sweet, cool, but does this mean the Cap was the one preparing everyone for the Fallout? No, that was Joseph, hell, he probably didnt even lose a single family member or anything, Joseph fought against all odds, let his family be un-avenged, lost tons of members in his clan, and ended up giving all of that up to the MC, who, as far as we know, didnt do shit and now just sits around drinking til old age gets him. So Far Cry 5's story, all your work, all your fighting against the Cult, and all the work getting closer to Joseph in this game all ended with you killing him (or letting him chant to himself where uUuUuUUuUU iS hE sTiLl aLiVe oR iS tHe oThEr oPtIoN cAnOn??) and letting the little village burn to ash. What a depressing ending to such an interesting story.

I loved Far Cry 5's ending, and honestly the ending was either actually god (as like how the fuck do you explain shit like the apple) or it was a nuke sent by north korea (as i dont think he actually found a nuke lying around) and as noone outside hope county started rebuidling it before or after the years underground, i think the whole planet was destroyed/purged, so it had to be some Power from big daddy G in the clouds. And now everyone died and we end this whole story with some nobody being seen as the ""chosen one"" and doing fuckall with that? No DLC where we see what he does, not even Far Cry 6 tells us anything, as its a new universe. Such a cool and unique ending like Far Cry 5's was just outright wasted on making you, the cool and new MC feel special.

That stuff aside, I like that you can spare the twins, and that Mickey even leaves a little Letter if you do. But that aside, this game feels empty, less alive than 5 (yeah its a wasteland so it shouldnt be alive bla bla, you get what i mean), has less content than 5, less unique Companions than 5, a worse soundtrack than 5, a worse story than 5, and most importantly, it was outright less fun. I am really sad this saga ends like this, give us a dlc or something to have a nice ending, or at least explain what the Cap did after the ending.

But for now, Gameplay, Story, Content and Enjoyment-wise, this is just Far Cry 5, but worse.",1640551334,1640733023,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But thank god I was wrong, yes it has some elements of those but not that much and it's still an enjoyable FC game even though I would still say it is overall one of the weaker FC games out there but still worth it if you like the series.

What are those RPG/loot shooter elements? Well weapons and enemies have a level now, but only between 1 and 4 and every weapon is still unique, you won't find the same weapon like 30 times just with different stats like in Borderlands. At least you don't level up your character. And then enemies also have hp bars and you see damage numbers. That already sounds bad and I usually hate that, but you can turn those off in the menu if you want, but I actually get used to those.
There is also some kind of loot but that's pretty much just ressources to craft weapons and such. I did not found that too annoying, actually exploring is fun in this FC as well. Sadly you only find minor amount of ressources and also only the less valuable ones. I explored a lot and pretty much always was low on ressources and could just buy few weapons per level.
You can also buy ressources with real money, but there is no need for that as you are actually supposed to do some repeatable missions: the Expeditions. Those gives a lot of ressources and also the more valuable ones. 
In other FC games I was that high on money later on that I could simply buy every weapon I want, in this one you have to grind more for that. What also sucks in this FC is that you cant modify weapons: every weapons comes with a fixes set of attachments.

The game is kinda grindy tho. You are supposed to not only free the outposts once, but 3 times, on every level from 1 to 3, same with the expeditions. And even with that all grind I did everything in the game, bought after weapon, vehicle, boat and heli, got all achievements and still just needed 35 hours for that.

The twins as antagonists were pretty boring and generic, same with the whole story. In fact there aren't a lot of story missions in it and a lot of those are very similar and feel more like sidemissions, like find a specialist for your base.
Still I liked that some characters of FC5 return in this one. 

Overall I'd say this is probably like a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. It's solid. I guess I only like Primal less.",1640619491,1640619595,True,8,2,0.577249526977539063,0,True,False,False

I read the other reviews and the negative comments that it feels like a Far Cry 5 DLC with a smaller map. When it finally was on sufficient sale during the Autumn Sale, I purchased it. 

The map is basically the same. Everything is pretty much the same with the obvious changes that would be noted in the ending of Far Cry 5. I think the environment is very thematic and can be beautiful in its own way. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of what I do like.

The AI is still incredibly accurate as well as incredibly dumb, Enemies will hit you from across the screen but still run to the same cover in the same pattern as the other games. Enemies line up to be shot at, and the only reason that they are difficult is the weakness of the guns and the massive Hp that the game gives them. Wild animals are almost always a waste of health and ammo for me at this early part of the game, Killing a wolf with a SAW or shotgun shouldn't require an entire clip and then some. Meat sponges rarely make games fun.

Leveling gear requires finding ethanol to upgrade the home base, ethanol to upgrade the particular location in the home base (armory, infirmary, garage, etc), and then the gear for the item itself. Its not difficult to find supplies, but tedious and grinding. Allowing the Highwaymen to retake outposts to gain Ethanol just seems lazy and lacking creativity from the developers.

Its true to the Far Cry formula, but its probably the most slow paced, boring version of the series that I have played. I plan to continue to play the game and hope that leveling my character and gear as well as exploring the land and story make the game more enjoyable. At the current moment, I can only recommend it if heavily on sale and already a fan of the series.

Update 12/17/21: I've leveled up some of my weapons and gained some more ""Guns for Hire"". Like Far Cry 5, Sharky and Hurk are pretty funny. The remaining characters are pretty bland. Kills still require a full clip on certain enemies, but are getting more realistic. I'm willing to continue to progress and try more of the story and base advancements.

Update 12/21/21: So I've beaten the game already. Incredibly short and the story is very predictable. Last few missions require stealth and driving (two things I hate to do in Far Cry games). Last bosses are huge meat sponges with select weak spots. I leveled up my guns, and it got easier but not more enjoyable.

I really like the Far Cry series, and after beating this game I truly suggest only buying it if you want to know what happens after the end of FC5. The only thing that really matters is the end, and it's not really worth all the 10~ hours you put into it. Too much grinding, and a bad story. They took what I loved about Joseph and Eden and crushed it. In FC5 it was just some mad man that thought he was a messiah, and that was amazing. It had a fantastic story and was fun to watch play out. FCND took that and stepped on it. It made a main premise of the plot magic powers you got from Joseph's tree that was 'sent from god' Taking that mad man messiah look and makes him right. Why would they do that?? They had a solid plot and Joseph could have not had some magic tree and the plot would have made more sense, and looked better. The Twins were alright villains I guess, but forgettable. They have little to no depth, and only want power. For almost all the villains in FC5 I felt bad for them in some way or another. They had depth and they cared about something. The Twins only made me care for them in Mickey's dying breath where she gives you some sad story. We get no time to really see who they are before they die and the plot forces you to the next mission. Don't even get me started on Ethan. They just reskinned the Yeti and made that the final boss? Really? Ubisoft has gotten lazy, and it shows. Overall I'd give the gameplay 5/10, story 6/10 and villain(s) 5/10.",1595723760,1639982279,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No crashes so far which is good but the launcher is annoying. 
The mission cutscenes are also dumb and annoying.
Another annoying thing is that as soon as you're knocked down by an enemy, you have little to no chance to escape and they just beat you till you're dead. 
The NPC's are dumb as shit too. You can literally run right into an Outpost, disable the alarms then start a fight.

And after all that, the ending and BOSS fights are utterly effing dog shit, absolutely infuriating, (each hit with the most powerful weapons barely touches them, so it take 100 tries and too much time) and theyre not worth completing.

Farcry: New Dawn starts with some fun gameplay, sure. Maybe you'll even find it more fun with the new features of New Dawn, like the double jump. Or maybe the special skill, Wrath? Maybe you'll like the saw shooting crossbows. Maybe you'll enjoy the- 
Wait, no. That's it. Every new feature in New Dawn over Farcry 5. I didn't even once use Wrath. I wonder what it does. 

The writing and execution of the story is some of the most stupid trash Ubisoft has ever come up with, and I've played A LOT of Ubisoft titles. I sat through the slog of every cringe cutscene, only to find that the story just gets worse. The story tries its hardest (and I mean HARDEST) to tie up the events of Farcry 5 to a nice resolution, but fails catastrophically. At first, I liked that they recycled characters from Farcry 5, until I noticed that every asset New Dawn offers is just a lazy reskin. 

The game area is also two thirds smaller than Farcry 5, but you could easily see than an entire quarter of New Dawn's map is barren and only exists to serve a single mission which ends when you've punched a grizzly bear enough times. I'm not joking. Punching a bear is coincidentally also the best that the story has to offer, and most of the games production value was clearly focused on the bear punching mission. 

I really wish I didn't know what happened to the end of the stellar Farcry 5 timeline. I wish I could unsee the superpower cutscenes. I wish I could unhear the obnoxious twins. I wish I could unfeel when the uPlay launcher decided to ignore my commands to save and revert to a frustratingly old save (I've literally lost 8 hours of my current 24 hour playthrough to the void of the uPlay cloud, and there's still no fix). I don't even want to know what Wrath does. 

Skip Farcry: New Dawn and save up for Farcry 6.

There was a lot that could be done with a home base. Sadly, it was all wasted by eventually tying the plot to the terrible story of the main game. The home base turned out to be a big nothing-burger too. A few upgrades to unlock useful things, but generally just something you grind parts for to unlock story progression.

A key departure from the main game are the RPG elements that give enemies hit points. Weapons get stats and you can upgrade to higher tiers. Obviously, some upgrade parts are extremely scarce and wouldn't you know it, you could spend some real money to get them instead. After clearing every object on the map, I still couldn't unlock top tier stuff. I think I could try to farm the rare material by grinding the legendary animals that are a pain in the ass to track and take down. After killing a few, the game didn't even reward me with the right parts, so it feels like it's very conveniently buggy.

RPG system works for enemies first, until you start running into things than need fifty sniper headshots to take down. The final boss fight took me half an hour of running around in smoke, looking for ammo refills so I could keep shooting the ridiculous bullet sponges running after me.

So I beat the game took me 16 hours total but if i were going to only do the main quest i would of taken me just probably under 12 which just does not seems like a game worth my time, most games when you reach that 12 hour mark you get that halfway mark or such, hell a game such as Red Dead 2 12 hours you probably just finished the first major heist in the game. I think when they were developing the game they thought that a way to restrict the player and add more runtime to the game was adding the need to retake outpost to upgrade the base so you unlock health weapons and such, and to be honest it is really only worth getting the tier 3 purple weapons since you dont see the elite enemys much only when you retake the outpost to tier 3. I will say adding resource missions to the game where you get materials to craft said weapons is a great idea so you are not scrounging around to find shit to make a better shotgun or such.

Pros:
- The gunplay is actually decent compared to other farcry games
- For the same map with new paint they change alot and actually make new places interesting
- Some really fun and enjoyable missions
- Some companions are nice and actually cool ( Cheese boy gang)

Cons:
- The game map is small so you end up having a sweat but very short game
- I might have missed it but you can only have one companion at a time which kinda sucks
- The companion ability unlocks are really sloppy  with each needing 40 kill to fully unlock all of it, some easier then others and dependable on playstyle
- You can buy the locations to all of the music, stashs, and photos in the game and even after you get them all which i did you get nothing for doing it
- Near the end the missions turn into a slow burn and just drag on

(SPOILERS)
You end up fighting the twins in a very anticlimactic fight where they are just elites one with a flamethrower and one with a sniper, both pretty easy to kill then they give a speak of how blah blah it could of ended different and blah blah"" one of the speeches to make you feel bad but in the end it just falls short due to the fact that they are just poorly written and just such the fun out of the game and they are not even the end game boss the end game boss is this stupid ""shoot the giant glowing orange shit on this dude to kill him"" fight and honeslty i have never been more bored in a boss fight then the last two in the game 

All in all I would give this game a solid 6.5/10 its a fun game but the end game just ruins it and i know this was basically a enhanced dlc for farcry 5 but it just falls short of being fun at the end

Enemies look like they're sick fighting because you can come up to their face before they notice you and even when all of them are alerted they don't do much and sometimes forget they're in fight. There is one mission where you have to escape with motorcycle and shot enemies, for 80% of mission they're just crashing in random objects and other 20% you can knock them down with one hit.

          -Gun-play is smooth and the takedowns are brutal 
          -Expeditions are great and makes a bit for the much smaller main map size
          -Same map as Farcry 5 but is edited enough to be acceptable as a new games map
Cons: -Art style causes near sensory overload and need a bit of suspension of disbelief considering how 
           fucked everything got not to long ago in the story
          -The entire game is downsized from the previous one in most every reguard, there are no planes, less 
           vehicle variety, smaller map, shorter story, bland undeveloped antagonists, pond deep allies
          -Upgrading the main base ""Prosperity"" has almost no significant visual changes while upgrading it,
            which is a large focus of the game, the only things I could notice was a tarp being replaced with 
            trees and some facilities getting slightly more stuff, and there are areas in the base that are blocked 
            off despite being made in farcry 5, it would be nice to upgrade it from a small squatter camp to an 
           impregnable fortress, leaving no space wasted,
          -Every roster ally other than the dog Timber sucks ass, Timber seems to be the only one who fights 
            anything alongside their useful abilities.
          -The current existence of the Judge just shits all over Farcry 5s protagonist and turns them into a 
           useless bumbling ally that has a character shift so unbelievable that its best to forget theyre the same

-Good graphics
-Fun guns
-Challenging (from time to time)
-Low disk space

Cons:
-Not mutch diversity in gameplay (stealth is impossible)  
-Story felt really repetitive
-Boring characters (except for one)
-Really boring if you play it the way its supposed to be played
-Too mutch grinding compared to the length of the story 
-The co-op is shit 
-Many bugs
-Driving was terrible  
-The skill tree was really bad compared to the older games
 
Final thoughts:
Whille i had a fun time playing this game with my friend, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you arent planing on taking the game and its story seriously. It feels rushed and not deserving of its price tag. It would have been mutch better if it was just a dlc for farcry5.

Once again the locals are being terrorized by armed gangs speeding around in infinite trucks while furious bears and homicidal turkeys leap from the bushes to claw at anything that moves. New Dawn adds a couple new twists to the series' formula‚Äîat times you can leave Montana to visit other states‚Äîbut nothing to make it feel like a wholly different game. This is Far Cry 5 again, just on a smaller scale and with more pink flowers.

It's years after the nukes fell at the end of Far Cry 5, and your nameless character has been traveling the country by rail, helping survivors rebuild the post-apocalyptic United States. A group of highwaymen (not that cleverly called the 'Highwaymen') derail your train and leave you stranded. After making your way to a small community called Prosperity, you venture out into the overgrown remains of Hope County, fighting the Highwaymen, conquering outposts, gathering resources for crafting, and enlisting a small cadre of colorful companions like an elderly sniper and an enormous, rampaging boar. This goes without saying, but never bring the sniper with you. Always bring the boar.

As you help out the locals you gain perk points that can be used to unlock skills in any order you wish, a nice and loose ability system that lets you focus on whatever is most important to your playstyle, be it melee damage, stealth kills, or traversal tools like the wingsuit (fun for sightseeing and bailing out of burning choppers) and grappling hook (mostly just for treasure-hunting in bunkers and caves) . A few perks, like how much ammo you can carry and how hard you punch, can be upgraded endlessly, giving you even more flexibility in your build. A set of five new skills introduced near the end of the game indulge a bit more ridiculousness, giving you fun powers like a double jump and limited-time berserker strength.

Now when I swing my spiked baseball bat at a rampaging bear it sails comically through the air. The Far Cry games have always cast you as an army of one, but New Dawn turns you into a legit superhero. These powers are novel for a bit, but feel a little unnecessary when I'm already able to insta-kill with stealth takedowns and spawn an endless supply of helicopters.

Combat is the same frantic and fun gunplay as in the past few Far Cry games. Vehicles and barrels explode, fire spreads across grass and trees, enemies recklessly charge and scream and bombard you with mortars or light you up with flamethrowers, with the occasional wild animal or friendly citizen getting caught up in the chaos. Speaking of wild animals, my loyal boar Horatio compliments my ranged attacks as a tank, scattering screaming Highwaymen like bowling pins so I can more easily pick them off with my sniper rifle before running in to clean up with my shotgun or knife.

The longer a companion is with you, the more skills they develop, and midway through New Dawn my big pig (really the only companion I used) was even able to self-revive himself, meaning I could turn him loose without having to keep an eye him. Plus, Horatio has lots of personality, paddling around in the water while I'm fishing and sometimes falling asleep and snoring softly while I'm hanging out in Prosperity. You can co-op New Dawn with a friend, but seeing an enraged boar headbutt a truck onto its side is pretty priceless.

There are plenty of familiar landmarks on this smaller version of the map (radiation has closed off a portion of it) and several familiar (yet older) characters from the last game are still around. I think we're meant to feel a bit wistful about Hope County‚Äîa quest has you collecting old photographs to help you remember what the landscape looked like before the bombs‚Äîbut it's hard to feel like there's much difference between the world's chaotic past and present, and Far Cry 5 was only just last year so it's not exactly a nostalgia trip. You can make a few expeditions out of Montana, raiding larger and more imaginative enemy outposts off the main map, like an aircraft carrier on the coast, a ruined amusement park in Louisiana, and even Alcatraz. 

These expeditions are much more challenging than outposts in that they spawn unlimited enemies until you escape via a timed chopper rescue, so they can't be taken down by stealth alone‚Äîthe bad guys will find you. Plus, you can't just glide to safety in your wingsuit when things don't go your way: these are self-contained excursions that you either pass or fail. You can escape with loot or die and do the whole thing over, which gives expeditions a bit of tension.

The big bads of New Dawn, twin sisters Mickey and Lou, are so inconsequential I almost forgot to mention them. Unlike the Seed family in Far Cry 5, they aren't constantly subjecting you to long, drawn out speeches (thank you). The twins only appear a few times, and mostly just issue brief threats over the radio to remind you they exist. It's considerate of them to basically leave you alone while you completely dismantle their entire army, but it makes your final showdown with them just another bullet-sponge bossfight.

I completed the main story quest of Far Cry New Dawn in about a dozen hours, and spent a few more mopping up side-quests and exploring. It's brief compared to Far Cry 5, and completable without fully upgrading Prosperity to access the highest levels of gear and vehicles (though you'll definitely want to unlock the best weapons). While it's good fun at times, New Dawn is really just a quick trip back to Far Cry 5's Montana that hasn't changed much beyond a post-apocalyptic paint job.",1637074239,1637074239,True,18,3,0.648626089096069336,6,True,False,False

Also the main antagonists are not interesting at all.

The new mechanics in this game are alright but ranked weapons/enemies don't feel well placed or adjusted in this game. I do like the addition of a damage indicator and health bar to the game but that's about it. The perks are similar to Far Cry 5 besides the fact that on some you can infinitely upgrade which can make some attacks  broken and [spoiler] The New Eden Perks are just very OP which make doing stashes/expeditions/traveling a whole lot quicker and easier [/spoiler].

Other then that I only recommend playing this game if you like Far Cry 5 or if you have time to kill.

[b][u]Conclusion :[/u][/b]

FarCry New Dawn est tr√®s bon jeu coop dans l‚Äôensemble, c‚Äôest un bon shooter, un open world vaste avec plusieurs activit√©s, une dur√©e de jeu convenable et un combo graphisme / optimisation excellent. Mais apr√®s avoir fini le jeu je suis rest√© sur une sensation de ¬´ c‚Äô√©tait bien mais cela aurait pu √™tre mieux ¬ª, je m‚Äôexplique.
FarCry ND fait suite √† FarCry 5 mais de mani√®re tr√®s maladroite. Tout d‚Äôabord l‚Äôunivers qui est beaucoup plus fantaisiste que post-apo. Ensuite le syst√®me de niveau des ennemis et des animaux qui cr√©e un gouffre de niveau entre le joueur et les mobs. Notre personnage de FarCry 5 qui n‚Äôest pas exploit√© et enfin une histoire totalement oubliable d√ª principalement au fait que les deux grandes ennemies n‚Äôont aucun charisme et n‚Äôont aucune profondeur dans leur personnage.
Certaines personnes, √† raison, me feront remarquer que New Dawn est un hors-s√©rie comme Blood Dragon et qu‚Äôils sont libre de faire ce qu‚Äôils veulent avec l‚Äôunivers. Je r√©pondrais que oui ils sont libres mais Blood Dragon n‚Äôa pas de lien ou a un lien lointain avec la s√©rie principale contrairement √† New Dawn qui fait directement suite √† FarCry 5.

 Je conseille √©videmment le jeu aux joueurs qui cherche une coop mais je le conseille beaucoup moins aux joueurs solos car si je n‚Äôaurais pas jug√© le jeu en tant que coop la note serait n√©gative.

The Highwaymen are criminally underdeveloped, as well as their leaders Mickey and Lou, who have less screen time than Pagan Min, and whenever you kill them, Ubisoft tries to garner the smallest amount of respect for them (or specifically Mickey). Good villains who are well developed make you feel for them, the twins backstory can be seen in a single cutscene. That's it! And I can guarantee that most people who bought this game were interested in the end to the storyline that Far Cry 5 started, and holy shit it was bad. Joseph is barely even seen, and if I remember correctly, he's only in 3 or 4 missions. He also has a random ass son who's just shoehorned in, and his character design and to a degree ""arc"" is bad. Whiny, bratty, hates his dad, and spoilers, once you beat him, he instantly feels bad and apologizes, then he dies, Joseph is sad. Then now is where Joseph realizes the error of his ways and he asks you to ultimately kill him. And it doesn't really matter if you do or don't, he never appears again, then the game ends.

I have not disliked a single Farcry yet, every one has been an amazing adventure and incredible graphics to go with it.
My fav is probably Farcry 4, it was so well structured, you just knew what and where you were logically all of the time and teh story was so logically chronological.
Farcry 5 was good too, but not as well organised or structured, but New Dawn improves on that to a huge degree, its a very bright game, lots of pink etc, the graphics are second to none in gaming, the physic's improves with every farcry but Farcry doesnt have a huge amount of real physic play in it yet still, but the game itself is awesome, its just FUN, which is what games are supposed to be, fun.
I played as a girl !
Just to be different, my partner thinks its pretty funny Im now a short blonde chicky running around with an M60 like cannon !!!
She kinda has a point but its FUN !!!!!

It seems like someone was mad that Joseph wasn't put through enough, so they made this game where he spontaneously has a son, and that son is a monster for no real reason or purpose, and burns down what little Joseph had left. Then the writers tossed in a couple black female villains, as an afterthought, and had them be mildly annoying with a halfassed ""tragic"" backstory. Music was also phoned in, nothing original and memorable, just a bunch of trendy licensed material. It is nice that they included a ""streamer mode"" so you can turn pretty much the entire soundtrack off, and listen to your own music or a podcast instead.

I'd say this is maybe worth 10, 15 dollars. And only then if you're truly desperate for more hope country content. Otherwise best to just pretend this entire game never happened, which is what I plan to do starting now.",1635753279,1635753279,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry New Dawn is the successor of Far Cry 5, and it carries along the backstory plus follows the same game mechanics from the previous title. It feels like a deluxe DLC of a game, but it‚Äôs decently impactful as a standalone game to enjoy and adore. There can be multiple natural improvements, but the published version is still fun to grind some hours on. Far Cry franchise always loves to experiment with uncanny twists in every title, whether it be crafting system, story twists or whole UI and environment.

[h1][b]Story without spoilers:[/b][/h1]
[b]Continuity from previous title-[/b] After the nuke from Far Cry 5, People are living in bunkers under the devastated Hope County. After six years of retaining underground life, everyone is shocked to see nature self-healed. All the communities started the lifelong nourishing of humankind. The impact of Father (villainous priest) has decreased as he went missing for merely 17 years.

[b]Progressive plot-[/b] Even with all the peace and prosperity, there will always be a villainous group taking birth. Not much long after the beginning of prosperity, two twins, Lou and Mickey, violently attack Hope valley with their brutal groups. This peace turned into a warzone will present a variety of missions and twists all along with the story.

[h1][b]üéÆGameplay:[/b][/h1]
Unlike traditional post-apocalypse slum sceneries, it presents you with an exceptionally vibrant open-world environment that includes multiple activities to conquer. It‚Äôs not just a survival game. It‚Äôs about survival, ambition, hunt and regaining multiple chores. You start in train wreckage while getting attacked by a violent mob known as Highwaymen. After escaping them, your journey of retaliation starts. You will craft some low to high tier weapons along with ambushing and winning over the outposts with your roster (co-op AI). Looting and Leveling up becomes easier as you progress through the gameplay.

Even though the primary missions contribute solely to your game progress, the side quests and hunting aren‚Äôt left alone. They are quite in-depth and immersive on their own. Attacking an armoured gang isn‚Äôt a straightforward task. That‚Äôs why you need an alias that you can trust. Doing side missions rewards you various items from rosters, materials, money and sometimes powerful gear. As every territory-based journey starts from a base camp, Prosperity acts as a home base for the peaceful community lead by Rush. You can upgrade various segments of the home base like cartography, garage, expedition and much more. They all require some hefty build materials, but in the end, they ease your gameplay in multiple ways.

You are never action deficient throughout the game. Even travelling through point A to point B will cause a random ambush ready to surprise you. The map is not very huge, but having an auto-drive feature can always act handy. Everything feels amusing and smooth. It‚Äôs a genuine blend of story and side quests grilled with an overdose of action. Hunting is not really in depth, but there‚Äôs a sufficient variety of animals to hunt and trade their skin for some extra bucks. Remember, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you are on land or water. There will always be a ferocious animal ready to take you on. Not only that, there are some hybrid animals too that might stomp on your corpse pretty quick. Difficulty options were well-segmented to establish a do-able and challenge ratio.

[h1][b]üì∑Graphics:[/b][/h1]
Easy 10/10. I don‚Äôt think there can be anyone disliking this piece of art. Not only the colours are vibrant, but the development is also top-notch. Enriched detailing and interaction with the environment always bind you to a strong thread of excitement. The blend of flower valley and devastating action somehow turned out pretty well. And the addition of Photo Mode just boosts your quench of capturing beautiful moments. You can also download extra texture packs to transform this heavenly environment into beyond imagination artwork.

[h1][b]üìùMain Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Pleasant environment.
    [*]Concludes Far Cry 5
    [*]A useful dog companion who can sit with you in car. 
    [*]Smooth gameplay.
    [*]Good arsenal of weapon and armed vehicles.
    [*]Hunting and fishing.
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Dumb Roster AI.
    [*]Short story.
    [*]Silent Protagonist.
    [*]Not being able to modify/kit out you weapons.
    [*]Somehow bows impact more than a MLG.
[/list]

[h1][b]üè∑Ô∏èTips to new players:[/b][/h1]
As you don‚Äôt need separate equipment to tag your enemies, wander around the targeted place and scope of your gun to easily tag them. Roster AI is pretty dumb, so I suggest you either use Timber or Horatio. Initial missions want you to engage with outposts and ethanol convoys, so lockpick and vehicle repair perks will be most handy in the beginning.

[h1][b]‚úâÔ∏èMiscellaneous Information:[/b][/h1]
[b]Expedition-[/b]
Expedition probably acts as the difficulty factor of the game. Dropping you on the waypoint through a helicopter and makes you execute a solo raid against multiple enemies. Tag the package and escape the premises. Executing a successful expedition unlocks a higher tier mission next time. You can access them from the Prosperity home base.

[b]Similarities and Dissimilarities from Far Cry 5-[/b]
[list]
       [*][b]Similarities-[/b] Same silent protagonist who is experiencing the events instead of making a personality. Same location but with additional after nuke changes. The cult theme in addition to wildlife crafting. Roster features ascend again.
       [*][b]Dissimilarities-[/b]Far Cry New Dawn isn‚Äôt that free in the open-world aspect. You are just collecting resources for the home base. The story is not even half the size of Far Cry 5. 
[/list]

[b]Info about DLCs-[/b]
There are multiple DLCs available, ranging from high tier weapons, vehicles to fancy skins. Hurk legacy is probably the most useful one, as it provides you with a good calibre weapon and an effective gun mounted car. Rest DLCs are fine and not harmful to acquire. Texture DLC is free, so make sure to download it if your PC can fulfil the requirements.

[h1][b]üòáHonest Rating:[/b][/h1]
Being a fan of the Far Cry franchise, playing each new title is a fun experience. But calling Far Cry New Dawn a standalone game is hard to digest. It showcases more like a duplicate Far Cry 5 with map enhancements but half the content. The best part is probably the conclusion for Far Cry 5 ending, that you can experience in New Dawn. The asking price is too high, so please wait for a huge sale. If you never tried a Far Cry game and like this style of gameplay, then start with Far Cry 5. Otherwise, all the OG players should play this one too.

Rating: 8/10

So I got this at its lowest price yet along with Far Cry 5 when Far Cry 6 was announced. I'll be honest, I've only played 3(and bits of 2) and never even finished it. Every subsequent game though was like Ubisoft giving me better and better settings with New Dawn definitely being the peak. A colorful, vibrant, post-apocalyptic world was like ticking every box for me. Having also an FPS itch for quite some time, I finally sat down and finished a Far Cry game. My impressions? Mixed but edging on the positive and I'll explain why.

Far Cry: New Dawn uses Hope County from Far Cry 5 with a new skin as its setting, kinda like how Primal used the map from 4. The intro sets up the story from the nuclear explosion at the end of 5 up to the new society emerging. It focuses on a particular settlement of survivors and their rivalry with two sisters who lead a pack of vicious highwaymen. You play as an outsider, man or woman, who has been called to help rebuild but ends up going in an all out war against them, uniting with various misfits and the cult of New Eden from 5 along the way. It's a pretty basic premise which checks the Far Cry boxes. 

There isn't really much character development for the empty vessel that is the silent protagonist, everything unfolds as expected and I can't even say in good faith that the Sisters had anything of value narrative-wise. You encounter them in various points of the plot as is expected from Far Cry villains but their characters and dialogue are pretty basic and they end up being very forgettable. Probably my major gripe with the game, how cookie-cutter every aspect of the narrative is. The lore bits and piece, on documents and such, didn't help either and some pop-culture references were simply arbitrary and didn't add anything other than being there for the sake of them.

Let's see where the true focus of the game lies though and this is in the crafting mechanics, clearing the map and the solid gun-play. The latter is where the game truly shines. Every gun is responsive and feels great to use. The difference between the starting ones and the elite ones which will accompany you near the end, is a million miles away. It is truly an empowering feeling, grinding your progression, unlocking perks and the best guns. You will become an unstoppable killing machine with quite some options on your hands considering the various gun categories. It's where you'll find the most fun, customizing loadouts and trying different tactics according to such loadouts on the level scaling enemies. The level scaling itself, is quite more fair than in other games and didn't hinder my power trip, just added the right amount of challenge as the tiers elevated.

For said tiers to elevate, you need to upgrade your base which is tied to progressing the story and for that you'll need ethanol. Ethanol is the main crafting resource, gas in a Mad Max logic, and you'll get the biggest amounts of it by liberating enemy camps and claiming them for yourself. Everything has four tiers in the game(gray, blue, purple, gold) and so do the camps. You have the option to let the camp go back to the enemy in exchange for more ethanol. Consequently you'll be facing enemies of the following tier the next time you liberate it but you'll also get more ethanol. It's a nice cycle but in the end it was boring to me. I was grinding constantly through random events such as liberating prisoners, stealing ethanol trucks, hunting, getting supply boxes from the enemy and completing treasure hunts so I was drowning in most common resources and sure, camps provided some rare resources needed to craft better weapons but I just reached the second tier of camps and then stopped. 

The main problem of the game other than the narrative is repetition. If you do every camp on every tier you'll get 40 liberations but I don't think anyone would go through all that hassle and continuously be having fun. The only incentive would be to get all the weapons and vehicles but even in the 24 hours of my playtime, I had more than enough stuff for variety, to match my preferred game style and complete the main story pretty easily. This could have been rectified if there were 40 camps but this would also mean a complete new game and not the quicker made Far Cry 5 spin-off that Ubisoft intended. 

The base upgrades make your life easier. Stuff like higher tier companions will help you greatly and stuff such as maps marking resources I found completely useless. Essential upgrades include the ability to craft better weapons and vehicles but if you want these you should probably upgrade Expeditions. Expeditions are missions outside the main map which also have tiers, so of course you get to play the same missions 4 times. It's the easiest way to get rare crafting materials for the best weapons but again there wasn't much need for me to pursue them with all the general grinding. I just did a bunch to get some elites weapons during the end of my playtime. This could vary though as you may want more weapons faster. 

What I found most worthwhile in all of the game was probably the companion system. They can be of great assistance once they've racked up 40 kills with all their abilities unlocked and make your life a hell lot of easier in every step of the way. Every companion comes with their own unique mission in order to unlock them and these were some of the best missions in the entire game. Other than that they have great personalities and I liked pretty much all of their quips as we navigated the world together(and of course, you can pet the dog and the hog). They also vary vastly in terms of abilities to suit every possible game style. Again though, there is simply no need to spend a whole bunch of time and upgrade all of them. As with weapons and vehicles you'll have your favorites with whom you'll finish the game.

My final remarks on gameplay would be this overall feeling of how many things were not needed. I didn't use many of the utility items such as throwing knives, bait, grenades etc. I was mostly crafting med packs and enjoying the solid gun-play. There was no need to try things like the fishing mechanic, no incentive, it was just there. The game is so small in scope, story-wise and in terms of the map, that most of these options in every aspect will be left untouched. 

The presentation of everything is stellar though, I would have really liked for this to have a good story with such beautiful art direction and music. The graphics were pretty nice also and considering I don't have the newest of rigs, I didn't get many frame drops with every option on ultimate and some on high. That being said I had quite some crashes, I had bugs such as the mouse not clicking while I was in the map which made hit ctrl-alt-delete to continue playing and the game taking forever to load on some instances. Problems which would completely go away once I cleaned up broken registry items and tuned up my pc which leads me to believe that there's something truly effed up going on with the DRM and Ubisoft Connect.

To be honest, I'm recommending this game because it was fun. If you've played many Far Cry games you could probably skip it(except if you really want to know the end of the Far Cry 5 story) but in any case there is worth in solid gun-play in a generally beautiful setting. Get this cheap as I did and just waste 20 or so hours. I should leave you with the fact that I personally hit a boredom stagnation around the 15 hour mark which led me to play other games for some days before getting back to it. In any case, your mileage may vary, if any of all these sounded appealing to you there are certainly many worse open world time wasters. This one doesn't overstay its welcome and it's the main reason that barely keeps it worthwhile.",1634304576,1634831172,True,8,0,0.65289604663848877,3,True,False,False

Good missions, challenging, great story line. A surprisingly large world, considering. 

The crossbow that shoots saw blades?

That sort of twisted imagination needs to stay in gaming and never let loose in any sort of real warfare applications.

[b]Far Cry New Dawn[/b] (FCND) is a first-person open-world shooter set in a post-apocalyptic version of Montana (USA). Players impersonate a random survivor, that reached Hope County via train, only to barely escape a dangerous accident. After finding the makeshift base made by locals in the area, the protagonist agrees to help them against the Highwaymen, a gang that threatens everyone with submission or destruction.

[h1]In-Depth Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Pros[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
Exploring the post-apocalyptic Montana really feels like a lively, dynamic experience thanks to the numerous random events that can happen regularly. Resource convoys, enemy patrols, gunfights between various factions and brutal animal packs, are all factors that can influence a mission or side activity at any time. Generally the encountered NPCs react realistically to such events, as well.

[b]2.[/b]
Weapon feeling, sounds and impacts feel satisfying and realistic against the enemy: grenade launchers have foes fly away, same goes for point-blank shotguns, while more exotic weapons have custom effects like setting things on fire or ricochet ammo, lock-on missiles. The arms variety is good, with options for also stealth if needed. Enemies have average AI and will use cover, grenades often. 

[b]3.[/b]
Just a few shots from an average bandit are all it takes to down a player on the toughest setting. When it comes down to Elite enemies or animals, they may very well one-shot the protagonist(s) there and then, depending on the situation. Using ramshackle weapons against higher-level foes incurs in heavy damage penalties, further adding to the difficulty especially early on.

[b]4.[/b]
Side and main-missions that involve specific characters or treasure hunts all feel unique, and have their own little ""mini-stories"" to discover, for those that want to take time reading lore documents. Not only that, but often these operations feature unique puzzles, gameplay elements or situations that force to change approach radically.

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
Except for the last story chapter, the rest of FCND's adventure proves utterly mediocre and unremarkable as far as good stories are concerned. The stereotyped ""chaotic evil"" villains don't have an ounce of charisma, same goes for the various NPCs that mostly try to be amusing / stand out, only to end up being cringe at best.

[b]2.[/b]
Exception made for Treasure Hunts, all other side-activities, in particular ""loot zones"" and outposts, become a real chore in the long run. Each enemy outpost can be captured then abandoned again to face a harder version of it - that doesn't change much though, apart from rewards and enemy scaling. This has to be done many times to get all the upgrades.

[b]3.[/b]
Once top-tier weapons and a good amount of perks are acquired, the difficulty drastically lowers, simply because most enemies will be obliterated instantly by such mighty weapons or armed vehicles. In particular armed helicopters are a huge abuse, since they can clear entire outposts without enemies even being able to shoot back. 

[b]4.[/b]
Only the lobby host will be able to upgrade the base facilities, get certain story-related perks or initiate fast-travel and other interactions. Progress in the story is not saved for the eventual co-op partner, only resources are. This becomes frustrating because the second player will basically have no place to invest their share of the earnings, and be locked out of some progression skills as well.

[h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]

[b]Exploration[/b]
Is performed on foot or with the use of ground, sea and air vehicles such as cars, jeeps, boats and helicopters. Progressively better and faster vehicles can be unlocked at the garage after the proper upgrades have been performed to the home base. The world is rather large and dotted with points of interest, secondary quests and secret areas - most of them can be found manually or located by buying the relative map from traders, for a price in Ethanol, one of the main currencies. Mostly, exploration involves travelling from point A to point B in order to clear the next point of interest.

[b]Combat[/b]
Plays out in an FPS fashion, with players eventually be able to carry one sidearm, two main weapons and a heavy one, plus a variety of throwables like grenades, molotovs, C4 charges and knives. Melee weapons are also an option, although not recommended in most cases, ranged ones are just better. Enemies come in different archetypes like snipers, assault troops, melee specialists and so on, differing in level as the game progresses. Animals use the same system, there are some rare ones whose pelts can be traded for great amounts of resources. Armed vehicles are a thing later on, they are overpowered mostly and make fights very easy.

[b]Side Activities[/b]
Comprise quests, treasure hunts and some collectible hunting as well. The locations are sparse and often difficult to find, however the trader maps completely remove this hardship. The puzzles required to complete hunts and collectible finds are enjoyable and in the first case, unique for each instance. The rewards are really good too, so totally worth doing.

[b]Character Progression[/b]
Mainly comes from perk and weapon unlocking. Passive skills are unlocked with points granted by completing challenges, this encourages taking part into varied activities and using different weapon types or other means to kill enemies. Weapons are unlocked at specific benches at one's home base, each ""bench level"" upgrade enables crafting a new roster of weapons using the crafting materials acquired during missions. The same system is used for vehicles, consumables and ammunition types.

[b]Expeditions[/b]
Are external missions, oriented towards stealth, that see players engage into ""heists"" of sorts against fortified Highwaymen outposts. As soon as they are discovered, and endless stream of enemies will converge on players, which happens anyway once the package is acquired. The ultimate goal is to escape to the extraction helicopter with the loot, within the allotted time.

[h1]The Judgment: Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989090445]Complete Ratings List here[/url]
[i]It took me, along with a friend, around 23 hours to complete FCND on the hardest difficulty setting, while also clearing all the secondary quests and activities. The overall quality is good, replay value is very low, and ultimately I wouldn't suggest purchasing for the full 45‚Ç¨ price - I recommend waiting for a sale instead.[/i]

Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Nice gameplay (shooting feels great, vehicles are good)
- Convenient fast travel, but not as much as in FC5 (cf cons below)
- I really liked the story better than FC5's. We get to understand Joseph's motivations and he seems a lot more human and friendly.

Cons:
- The companion system isn't as good as FC5 because 1) you can't have 2 companions at the same time and 2) it seems that when a companion dies, you have no choice but to pay resources to resurrect them (in FC5, you just have to wait for a while)
- Unlocking air drops can only be done pretty late in the game. Fast travel can also only be unlocked after a while (but sooner)
- The tier/level system is pretty meh. In particular, it's too harsh: enemies with a higher level are so incredibly hard to damage. They shouldn't have made such big differences between levels I think. Particularly since on the other hand, weapons don't seem a lot different between tiers (yet despite looking similar, again trying to damage an enemy of higher level than your weapon will be really tough.

NB: For those of you who care about not wasting SSD writes & space, I'd recommend making sure you disable the HD texture pack.

Not allowed to have 2 guns for hire/ fangs for hire at the same time anymore is kind of a weird change they added into the game for some reason?

Also considering they just copy and pasted far cry 5's map to this game, removed a bunch of features, and added some grass and a shit ton of pink objects and called it a day, I wouldn't say this game is worth the 40$ they charge it for.

In my opinion, this is really just a huge downgrade from the last game of the series, taking features out of the game for no reason when they could of probably just copy and pasted them from FC5.",1634326543,1634326543,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dear Ubisoft;
Why do you still insist that useless Ubisoft connect instead of integrated your games to Steam?
Why don't you get rid of it that buggy, glitchy Ubisoft connect to help players to avoid seeing the annoying error messages (like failed to synchronize achievements, failed to synchronize cloud saves?)
Why don't you release games on the beneficial user-friendly platform steam no more? Just why?
Why don't you bring anything new to the FarCry series? In each FarCry game, players are getting tired of the shallow story and repetitive mechanics.
Why aren't you able to create phenomenon villains anymore? Kinda bored to see the same copy/clone bad guys (I want to see a lunatic like   Vaas)
Why are you so greedy and selfish about marketing strategy?

I guess coming from the nihilistic ending of Far Cry 5 which led into this I was already a little pissed off since the previous antagonist not only survives but takes a mentor role this time around and not just that but the two new big bads Mickey and Lou are absolutely insufferable. I understand that you want to motivate your players with a villain you want to kill but why are these two the least likeable turds I have ever had the displeasure of facing. And no this isn't coming from the fact that they are women, Far Cry 4 and 5 had great secondary antagonists that were women but the thing is they were well written characters with either tragic pasts or they were blindly following a leader due to power. These two are just selfish assholes that just annoy me. I will sing some praise for the world design even though it's just a condensed Hope County but the addition of vibrant pinks and blues is really eye catching and marvelous. Funny enough it really reminds me of something Die Antward would have created hell even the highwaymen remind of Die Antward. But outside of that the game just doesn't do anything for me. It's quite literally Far Cry with RPG elements and now as a way to try and add a sense of scaling or progression you level up and unlike higher level weapons with pre-selected mods on them which for some reason makes me irrationally angry for some reason I guess because I can no longer customize my weapons to fit my play style even though these kinds of weapons have existed since FC3 but making it the whole arsenal just feel cheap. Also for a game that is a direct sequel to the previous game it REALLY feels like an expensive DLC and the fact that they added micro-transactions to help progress in the story also kind of annoys me even though its not the first time Ubisoft did something like this. All in all I just can't recommend this game it just feels cheap and often lazy and coming from a F tier ending this feels like it should be a ""what if"" sort of deal not a full fledged sequel.",1634282242,1634282242,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

That is not to say it is bad-- quite the opposite, in fact-- but rather that it is unlike anything ever seen before in the Far Cry universe. While I did not agree with some of the character continuations from Far Cry 5, seeing returning characters in an almost completely new game was quite a joy. Experiencing Far Cry New Dawn with playing Far Cry 5 borderline religiously (pun intended,) brings me near to tears looking at the destruction of the locations I knew near and dear to my heart in the old Montana. Far Cry New Dawn brings a new take to the genre, having much more RPG elements within it, while still keeping it's core shoot-em-up, action-packed FPS feel of the previous games. Truly, I believe this is one of the greatest stories and games of the Far Cry universe.

That is not to say this game is without fault, however. In fact, these faults can be quite plentiful. The story at its core, without spoiling anything, makes one cringe. Not in the way that many stories can, tearing at the heart-strings and manipulating your feelings in every way possible, but in a way that almost feels like you've abandoned the 5th game of the series. [spoiler] One quite noticeable part of this was the joining up with Joseph Seed, and seeing the result of the ""Judge."" I can not physically believe that the Judge was the same character which I terminated all of the rest of the Seeds and survived a literal apocalypse with. [/spoiler] However, I do believe the story is a quite faithful continuation of the characters, at least those that we see, and it's always nice riding and raising hell with the ""old friends.""

The gameplay aspect, however, in comparison to Far Cry 5, leaves something to be desired. I personally dislike RPG games, yet thought this was an amazing action game nonetheless. However, the map size was *drastically* reduced from Far Cry 5, and being unable to visit the extent of the mere medium sized map of Far Cry 5 makes this game almost feel like a DLC, as opposed to the entirely new game it was supposed to be. Additionally, the campaign felt almost repetitive at times, yet that is to be expected with yet another Far Cry game.

This is all to say that overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game. Despite the criticisms I have of it, I do believe it to be a game 100% worth playing, AS LONG AS you have played Far Cry 5. To someone who is new to the series, I would recommend one of the earlier games, as this is primarily driven by previous knowledge of Far Cry 5's universe.",1633756762,1633756762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

played game through on hard. 

graphics: very nice
performance: really good but i found sometimes i got hiccups that a restart was needed
sound audio: it's farcry, but the soundtrack was cool if u r okay with obscure hip-hop
story: spoiler alert. 
farcry new dawn was not what you asked for. not what you wanted. 

but.

it's a good game. it's not an over priced dlc. it's a full fleshed out, original look at what farcry gameplay can achieve. not for everyone? okay agreed, neither is any farcry game. but in terms of story, you can find out what happens to all the beloveds from FC5, and even join forces with some of them once again. 

And once again spoiler alert: SPOILER ALERT: don't read below if you haven't played fc5 or you have and you don't wanna know what happens to joseph seed.
















you will get your chance. just not as ""rook"". and you find out what happens to rook. and rook is alive.",1632939137,1633660176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just finished Far Cry New Dawn
Took me...just shy of 24 hours of gameplay
It did something i thought was impossible.
It redeemed Far Cry 5.
The game was good the whole way through.
The story was a little stupid at times, but it was definitely good enough.
The ending was suprisingly satisfying.
The tiered weapon system was... meh, but no game is perfect. 
And now that I'm here at the end, I'm glad I played them in order. 
It made me appreciate Far Cry New Dawn that much more.

Follows the story line of Far Cry 5 but seems a lot less developed. A bit of a half game DLC as another reviewer has mentioned with half the number of missions and area to explore. 
The world just doesn't seem as big as Far Cry 5 even though its based around the same world. And the apocalyptic quality just doesn't make sense. How did everything become and so green after only 17 years. There should be massive patches of blight which are only seen on the world boundaries for some reason.
The story is not really as gripping as that of far cry 5. The missions seem limited and there aern't many main story missions.
There really aren't many side quests except the initial quests when you find the guns for hire or specialists. For some reason they reduced the guns for hire to only one and you can have only the specialist guns for hire (and not the random freedom fighter you find). Though the leveling up for the guns for hire is interesting. 
The outpost quests become repeatable which is interesting but in line with the story don't really make much sense. It seems like you could take over every outpost without it affecting the story at all which makes it really weird and detached from the game. They just become resource points and mines. 
The Weapons have become a lot more varied and interesting compared to far cry 5 with weapons which look interesting and made out of scrap. You can no longer loot and store weapons which doesn't make sense but atleast there is more choice.
And the damage and enemies is..... well..... worse. much worse.... They've introduced a weird leveling up of weapons and damage and its just lost its realism in comparison to far cry 5. In far Cry 5 sometimes the damage is a bit weird but New Dawn goes to another level with this. A high powered shot no longer kills and enemy with one shot.... what the hell is that. 
And being gunned down with a machine gun should kill you quite quickly.... Not hit you a bit and allow you to walk away..... or in very weird cases (with mounted machine guns) knock you down with no real damage..... WTF i'm not shooting them with rubber bullets. Why did a developer think that made sense.

Despite these issues its not a bad game and I did enjoy it overall.... just its not as fun as developed as Far cry 5 though the weapon selection is far better.",1633483247,1633512701,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like ordering a pie and finding out it has no filling. It's a grotesque example of how large corporate developers maliciously corrupt and ruin. It feels like they've actively tried to dissatisfy the player. They've managed to sap all sense of reward from this franchise for me. It's either boring or frustrating with a side order of cringe and eye-roll. I genuinely detest this game so much I felt compelled to write a review.

It's been a *long* while since the days of Far Cry 2 & 3 whereby the franchise was ""re-founded"" and it shows in all the worst ways, yet it has made no progress in game-mechanics. There is *so* little evocation in the writing of this game, I swear it was written on toilet roll over the space of 15 minutes. I can't care about the recruits and I care even less about the antagonists, it all literally means nothing. It's like they took Borderlands 1 as some kind of narrative role model. *SMH*

I don't feel encouraged or even capable of using my brain to solve the problems in the game any more, as it has taken such a happy-go-lucky stance.

The RPG-light levelling system that they introduced to pad out their copy-paste game play and encourage you to spend money on their micro-transactions means you no longer have any idea where you stand with the weapon you're holding. It could be a minigun but that won't matter if it's level 1 and chunks of potato are flying out the end.

I shot a guy in the face with a .50 cal rifle at 4 yards, he looked *mortified* that I'd broken his ski-mask, subsequently spotting me using the eyes that *should've* flown out the back of his head at almost 1000 meters per second.

The ""elites"" they've introduced cannot be spotted/marked. They *love* to fire RPGs at you every 5 seconds 
knocking you on your ar*e with impunity and it's not even an anti personnel weapon, it's a shape charged rocket propelled grenade meant for light vehicles.

I could go on with all the flaws but honestly it's depressing and I'd want a paycheck from UBIsoft to bother.",1632530238,1632530238,False,50,3,0.751786887645721436,0,True,False,False

Although New Dawn may not be ""the best"" example of a Far Cry game, it stands on it's own as a really great product. 

First I will address the negative aspects of the game, many of which have already been voiced by the community in comparison to its predecessor, Far Cry 5:

1) New Dawn is a ""looter-shooter."" You are going to have to scavenge enemies and raid stash houses to maintain supplies, and obtain access to new equipment.

2) The ""game world is small"" and undeveloped. This is in comparison to FC5, which is true, and there are significant visible portions of the map that are inaccessible due to an arbitrary line being drawn around them. 

3) ""Bullet sponges."" As you progress in the game, much of the ""challenge"" in fighting opponents will come from their use of overpowered armor and weapons. 

Now let me offer some counter points on why these supposed negative aspects may or may not matter to you as a player, and what makes the game good:

1) The ""looter-shooter"" aspect is not as present as you may think. I've never found myself being short on ammo or supplies. There are a few resources that are more scarce than others and can be tricky to find without deliberately hunting down hidden stashes, and you need these to unlock or upgrade certain weapons and vehicles, etc. However - this is an aspect I really enjoyed as a player; exploring old ruins and sniffing out treasures across the map is in itself a rewarding gameplay aspect, and there are many ways to ""farm"" certain supplies quickly if you just want to get it out of the way. 

2) The ""game world is small"" compared to other Far Cry games, but one doesn't really feel this. Even for a player coming straight from FC5, the map has a diverse range of different terrains and regions, and the ""character"" of certain areas has been amped-up in New Dawn. It is a completely different world, and while there are some areas that are recognizable or recycled from FC5, New Dawn adds a lot of original new structures and little ""twists"" to the map in different ways that you will just have to discover for yourself. Not to mention, there is the option of embarking on ""Expeditions"" to 7 brand-new, detail rich maps to explore. 

3) The problem of having ""bullet sponges"" as enemies in late-game is valid, as it can make you feel as if you need to grind more to upgrade your gear, or lead to simple frustration when you are getting creamed by a boss who has just absorbed multiple explosive rounds to the cranium at point-blank range without flinching. This makes the game feel a little ""cheap"" in its design. 

However, have you considered tackling these objectives with a friend in CO-OP mode? This changes everything. Even a low-level noob with dirt equipment is ten times more deadly than the AI allies, and you'll soon find yourself in absolute hysterics at the creative ways two players can dominate in boss fights, outpost takeovers, and just random tomfoolery. The CO-OP mechanic is something that this game absolutely nails, and is one of the main reasons for buying this game.

In addition, this is still Far Cry, and there are many ways (including exploits) to take out every enemy. Geared-up players will eventually want to finally have something that they can unload their heavy artillery on, while other players may find more satisfaction in stealth tactics and diversion. There are definitely some ""cheap enemies"" along the story path of this game, but persistence and experimentation will allow any challenge to be overcome. 

In conclusion, I would treat this game as an ""expansion"" to Far Cry 5 - all the basic game-play mechanics are still rock-solid, and it delivers on the Far Cry promise of making the player feel like a real survivalist - with a little neon spray paint thrown in.",1632433912,1632433912,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the takedowns are pretty satisfying too.

thats about it though. it's really a ""you good guy, kill bad guy"" game. far cry 5 had a damn good introduction to eden's gate, drawing you in to who ""the father"" really was. you saw him as not just an enemy, but a force that controlled these ""peggies"". in new dawn however, its just a couple women controlling a cliche, overglorified biker gang.

not to mention the amount of bugs. cougars that appeared ""friendly"" that stood still, unmoving. despawning entities (even animals!) from a long enough distance. leaving an ethanol truck to quickly take over an outpost, then coming back to find out the truck despawned and isn't there anymore. i need my fucking ETHANOL, ubisoft!

i'd get this on a heavy discount, more than half off. looting and hunting is some mindless fun, but don't expect anything super solid.

Even though it's replete with needless DLC and microtransactions, if you are retarded and fall prey to its MX schemes, it nevertheless a budget title by Ubisoft standards.  I'm not surprised that it's short, dull, and repetitive.  I got it for $20.  However, while it could have been a short, six hour romp a la Blood Dragon, it is a treadmill.  There are plenty of issues, from the tonal retardation of the plot, to the demonstrably awful gameplay loop.  Yet, most of its flaws stem from the damn treadmill.  Take Mickey and Lou.  These villains are seemingly able to maintain power through the sheer stupidity of everyone who comes in contact with them.  They are entertaining enough as someone you'd like to put a bullet in and, as such, I would have been fine with them going out like punks in the end.  That would be deaths they deserve.

Instead the final battle with them turns them both into bullet sponges, soaking up hundreds of rounds while you try to avoid sniper fire and fire fire.  I guess someone thought the only thing better than a single bullet each would be several hundred.  Isn't that just the theme of game: why do anything if you can do it a dozen more times?  New Dawn is not trying to please the player, this padding isn't about content, it is about convincing you that spending more money on this crap would improve it.  It won't.  Blame what you will.  The game had seemingly six months development time.  Even so, that doesn't mean the game has to be painfully dull or unnecessarily padded.  There's POTENTIAL fun to be had, it's a Far Cry FPS, but the game doesn't capitalize on its good ideas and instead emphasizes the bad.

The guns handle nicely, and the enemies are responsive.  There's some fun in assaulting the bases, and some of the writing around New Eden is even interesting.  The crime here is tortuously prolonging the plot and boss fights, selling microtransactions to speed it up, and confusing padding with progress.  Throughout the story, you are forced to act like an absolute cretin.  While I thought it was to to pretend Mickey and Lou present a credible threat and make them seem like villains, by the end I realized it's because you are for expecting any level of intelligence or creativity out of this game.  If you have any motivation to buy, and I can't believe they have the balls to call it this the ""Complete Edition"" with microtransactions, this purchase is a cry for help.

I suspect it was a money grab at throwing some version out there using the previous engine. I'd more likely consider this to be a DLC for FC5.

This seems like a partially stripped down version of FC5 and limited things to do compared to previous versions. Luckily I got this on the cheap via a sale, so I'm getting my hours worth out of it. The story is a bit of a drag, there's not a lot of replay value and they've got the city building/perks so skewed that you'll finish the game before you max anything out just trying to max things out to finish the game. 

While Fallout didn't do bad on portraying a post-apocalyptic world, this game feels like they just used it to set a small border around the playable area. Most of the weapons look sad as they've attempted to make them look like they were laying out during a bomb to rust and then someone pieced them together. Graphics are good overall as usual with the series, although I couldn't really get into the vibe as much with this one.

Performance and stability were excellent as has been my experience throughout the series. I'm running a 1080ti and maxed everything. No lag, no crashes, no gameplay issues.

I went multiplayer through the story and it worked mostly well the entire time. They obviously forget during design that two people might be in there, so missions where you drive a car with a NPC don't allow the other person any transit. Quest tracking, perk points and about anything specific to the host have all the same flaws as FC5 had (only the host is really getting most of anything).

You can't have multiple saves, so if you want to do different things in SP *or* MP, well, you can't. You can only have a single character at any given time, so if you're hosting a MP game, you can't do anything on your own game without the other player missing out. MP was obviously an afterthought, just like's it's been since FC4 (which didn't even work).

So, I'm disappointed considering each FC game has mostly been a step up on the previous version. I enjoy the series though and even if this is just a sliver of what FC5 was (I really enjoyed most all aspects of it), it's something. If I'd paid full price for it, I'd have felt robbed.

It really is a DLC-caliber sequel story set in Far Cry 5's Hope County, as written by the cast of Borderlands.  If it were sold as such, I'd recommend it whole-heartedly, but Ubisoft wanted a full release price tag on a half-finished product.

That being said, the art direction is fantastic.  If you're looking for an FPS to show off your graphics card and deliver a vibrant, almost psychedelic look at the post apocalypse, then this is your game.

Just wait for a sale, half off or better.

Because everything else about this game is half off:  The map is half as big, the cast is half as big, there are half as many missions, the story's half written; and worst of all, there are two chief protagonists, whose characters added together do not equal the development of even half a Vaas.  Cut scenes hint just slightly at back stories that could be fleshed out so well by a talented writer, but Mickey and Lou get almost no time to shine.

The game uses the same mechanics as Far Cry 5, so you'll find yourself right at home if you played that game. It is equally as astonishing beautiful as the previous Far Cry games, although I don't find the pinkish color palette especially appealing.

If you enjoyed the gunplay, treasure hunting and explosive action from FC5, you‚Äôll likely enjoy this too, even with the small RPG additions. There are even missions in this game that are better than most of what was in FC5. 

Hyperbolic hate aside, Far Cry: New Dawn is fun and the vitriolic non-players of this game have exaggerated the flaws. Most of the gripes I have with this game are holdovers from Far Cry 5, such as the A.I. on both sides being dumb and inconsistent, the boss fights being nothing but bullet sponges that have the potential to one shot you, and the writing being pretty terrible. 

FC5‚Äôs narrative already felt like someone trying to write about rural folk and religious fervor, when they themselves were probably some hipster prick from Massachusetts who spends more time in a coffee shop than on the job board...but New Dawn‚Äôs narrative kind of feels like someone saw Mad Max: Fury Road and tried to write a comedy around that. Any opportunity there is to make a scene grim or dark, they just pull away and try to steer clear of implications. The villains are the worst in the series so far, suffering from the same problem as the last three games by not being around, but also just being annoying teenagers that have little depth to them. They cry and bitch about how you‚Äôre such a pain in their butt and that‚Äôs it. No enforcer is sent to try and take you out, they just wait until you literally come to them and finish the job. (No disrespect to the voice actors, they did great with the meh material they were given.)
At least in FC5, the Seed siblings would kidnap you at a certain point (un-creatively as time went on, but still.) Even when I did kill them, I got no sense of relief because they were simply nothing as characters. I‚Äôd honestly rather murder the DJ that made that low-effort ""We think this is what Millennials and Zoomers like"" trash they kept blaring on the radios. At least it was funny to defeat them high on Bliss with a shovel. 

Now the combat...honestly hasn‚Äôt changed that much since 5. If you play like I do, explore the open world a lot, clearing outposts and hunting animals before even touching the main story, this honestly won‚Äôt feel all that different from other Far Cry games. The numbers are there and it might be annoying when you come up against enforcers (legendary-esque enemies with armor), but I never felt like I had to grind to have a leg up, especially when explosives and the overpowered Saw Launcher still got the job done. 

The only real complaint I have is with the lack of customization. New Dawn has a lot of crafting mechanics in it but it's shallow. This isn‚Äôt like Fallout 4 or Metro : Exodus where you get to build your guns and swap out parts. Works more like a store with incredibly specific currency; you‚Äôre just unlocking prefabbed weapons and can‚Äôt change anything about them. 

Halfway through the campaign, you get an rechargeable ability that simulates the syringes from prior games. While going berserk with a shovel through an enemy outpost is hilariously gratifying, it doesn‚Äôt feel like the game was built around this or the double jump mechanic at all. The only time the latter became useful was during the final boss fight. 

Final note is that optimization is good and the game looks gorgeous at times. Traversal is the same as before though, with less helicopters, so get used to hoofing it a fair amount of the time. Petty note is that whoever is doing the subtitles needs a pay drop cause I counted at least a dozen errors in some cutscenes and they don‚Äôt even line up with pacing of the scene itself 90% of the time.
Overall, get it on sale price cause the campaign is short and my 17 hours was only achieved through my adventures in dicking around and wanting to make my character look and feel like a badass. You know, one of those things this series is really good at.

If you don't have a friend to play, you can recruit AI friends to play with you, but you can't do both at the same time.

You get to explode stuff and shoot a lot of bullets, all while driving around an otherworldly beautiful landscape (depicted well on the product page). The story is good, and you don't spend too much time in cutscenes. You don't need to have played Far Cry V to play this, and you could play this before Far Cry V, even though this is a sequel.

It still feels like a waste of time and money.

It was neat to see what happens after the bomb with Joseph Seed and the other characters, but overall the writing was so bad that the whole thing fell apart.

The thing is, from a gameplay perspective, it does all the things you'd want a Far Cry game to do, it has all the boxes ticked all in accordance to market research and the experience for gameplay is pretty hollow, meaning Far Cry games need compelling characters and villains, and this has neither, making it a total bland sauce.

The villains are also the absolute worst, and I don't mean great villains I mean, they are the ""look at how evil I am!"" villains, completely 1 dimensional and boring as crap.

I hated the slog through the game even though the gameplay was fine and found myself groaning through all the protracted, boring, badly written dialog.

I honestly don't blame the voice talent either, the acting was fine, it's just that literally every line in this game is a cliche, unfunny, boring and tedious.

Don't buy this game, and unless you're really invested in finding out what happens with Hurk and such in this iteration, don't play it even if it's free, you're completely safe to take a pass on this, just watch the cut scenes for five minutes on youtube and you'll realize exactly what I'm talking about, shut it off and never think of it again.",1630704258,1630704258,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The weapons are scrap piles and can't be customised (like you could in EVERY other recent Far Cry) so you can't put different scopes or barrel attachments on/off guns as you want. Also for some reason enemies now have RPG healthbars ranging from level 1, which are standard grunts who die in a couple of shots, to level 5 elites, who require massive amounts of firepower to take out and have health bars the size of a planet. 

Also why is the recurve bow now a tier 5 weapon? The whole weapon tier system is irritating as heck... they now have RPG style damage values and levels from 1-5 too. Someone in the dev team REALLY wanted to shoehorn RPG elements into the combat and i don't understand why. The fancy recurve bow does 1200 damage but a 50 cal sniper does 1000? What?? 

Ultimately you're way better off just replaying 3, 4 and 5 which were really great (4 probably my favourite, i loved the arena challenges) and not bothering with this.

Biggest mistake. 

This is basically FC5, but far better. The only thing really fleshed out with FC5 was its story, otherwise, New Dawn is an improvement in almost every conceivable way.

The top review says it deserved to be DLC instead.  Wrong. 
There's a whole new weapon system, UI upgrade, Outpost and Perk system, all new roster of GFH, aesthetic overhaul of the map, colour pallete, and more

That isn't a DLC. It's a sequel to FC5. Honestly, I prefer it over FC5 almost completely. The only thing I missed from FC5 was its music, map size and story.  If New Dawn had that, it would be absolutely spot on. I suppose the Devs kept that in mind when finalising the price.

Gameplay wise the game does not improve much however the game adds in RPG elements that I have really enjoyed for example enemies have health bars and you can actually see how much damage your weapon is chipping of which I found very satisfying.

Overall I found the enemies more fun to fight, armor actually maters as helmets for once can actually stop bullets and are not just for show which I found refreshing, the Guns for hire system was simplified in a good way as well, making it clear what your allies do and only being able to recruit one at a time no further complications added. Special mention to the fact that once they die you actually have to use resources to revive them, it made me pay more attention to them and I really enjoyed that feature.

The changes to Hope county were awesome to discover, especially after just finishing Far Cry 5. I enjoyed the vibrant colors of the world and revisiting past locations after the Collapse.

New characters are however quite weak, the twin villains were not as memorable as anyone of the seed family encountered in the previous installment of the series. They were not bad by all means but rather lacking, the new allies are also not among the best. I mostly enjoyed returning characters, to see what they have become.

Joseph Seed still remains the best character in my opinion, I was thrilled by him once more and loved how the story wrapped up. He really stole the showcase that the twins were supposed to have but truth be told if New Dawn was not a sequel to Far cry 5 I don't think I would have enjoyed it that much.

I was not the biggest fan of Far Cry 5 but knowing it's story, the world and characters it has introduced, seemed to be absolutely mandatory to get the fullest out of New Dawn. Every bland new character came under my radar because I kept getting blown away by the discovery of what had become of this world. I (for once in a game) was eager to find notes often recalling the past in which I lived my previous adventure.

This journey is far smaller and more approachable than the one you set on in Far cry 5. That game sometimes lost me because it threw too much at me but New Dawn was perfect and the fairly linear RPG progression was more up my alley. 

I would definitely recommend this game if you loved Far Cry 5's ending and want more however if you never played that game this one might be a tough sell despite technically being able to be enjoyed as a standalone experience.

Whatever the case may be, I would not recommend the experience at full price but on a sale why not, especially if you can snag this game bundled up with Far Cry 5 ‚ô•

This is unlike Far Cry 5, which pretty much lets you get the guns you want in the game from the get-go. The story also is pretty good, but some of the missions felt a little bit disjointed at times, and it felt like I was doing random missions that do not really advance the story. A few of the story missions involve saving various characters which really have no effect on the game's story or the gameplay whatsoever. There are emotional moments in the game where characters die that you literally couldn't care less about because you only really even see them for about 15 minutes. The villains also fall flat. Without spoiling too much, just like in the other Far Cry games they leave you to die instead of actually killing you, which inevitably will make you feel like they must be genuinely stupid. This time, unlike in Far Cry 5, hunting animals will help you to craft some items, for example some weapons. In fact, you have to craft pretty much every weapon by grinding outposts and looting the environment, and this can get quite grindy if you are trying to level up or get better weapons. Admittedly, the game is not very long so you won't be grinding for too long. To pad out game time, you can complete each outpost multiple times (3 times) and you get rewards each time (Ethanol) which is necessary for upgrading your settlement. Taking outposts is relatively easy anyway, but it did not feel very satisfying as I would have preferred to use the weapons I want from the get-go such as silenced snipers to take down the outposts, and instead for the first third of the game I was stuck with terrible and weak weapons. Furthermore, enemies in this game are also bullet-spondges unless you use high level weapons. What is this, The Division 2? This whole system feels unnecessary and added in to increase the game's length, because if you avoid doing the outposts and crafting and what-not this game may take you even less time to complete. It took me about 10 hours to beat the story, do 4 expeditions, finish all outposts (except 2 of them) twice and two three times, and loot areas to find more resources. A part of the game you should not miss out on is Expeditions. They take you to new areas outside of the map where you go and find a package in the environment, and you are extracted out of the area by helicopter upon completion. The missions are extremely short, probably 10 minutes each and there's 7 expeditions you can do 3 times at higher levels, but they are fun and definitely worth playing. Expeditions are one of the best part about this game because they take you to areas which look unique and different from the largely samey open world that you might've already traversed in Far Cry 5. This game only has 1/3 of the map of FC5, so it does feel a lot smaller. Overall, though, the game was definitely worth playing and I would recommend you get it if you are a fan of the Far Cry series. Although the story has great moments, it isn't consistent in quality, but all moments which feature Joseph Seed and forms of spiritual/mystical experiences were fun to go through and felt good. This game is not as good as Far Cry 5, but it is still a great open world game with a very fun combat system and absolutely beautiful visuals. If I would give it a score, this would be about an 8/10.",1618134701,1629647598,True,1,0,0.518716573715209961,0,True,False,False

But I would not recommend this game to my friends over other Far Cry titles. Far Cry New Dawn delivers more of the chaotic open world FPS shenanigans that I have come to know and love, but lacks the style, substance, and quality mechanics of previous entries.

Far Cry New Dawn takes place in a ‚Äúpost-apocalyptic‚Äù Hope County, the setting of the previous installment, Far Cry 5. However, the map is significantly smaller than FC5‚Äôs map and has about half the outposts. The setting is New Dawn‚Äôs strongest card, but only if you take it with a grain of salt. The land is lush and fertile, which would make for a compelling story line about different factions completing for resources in this untouched paradise, but no, the story is much more of a goofy romp. Also, at the end of FC5, a nuke literally lands on the county, and its VERY hard to believe the land would look so lush only like 17 years after such an event. But, like I said, if you take it with a grain of salt, the setting is wonderful. Everything is overgrown and filled with flowers, mutated animals, and buried treasures. Far Cry has its own take on all the post-apocalyptic tropes and does them decently. 

The characters from the previous game show up, Hurk is there, and that‚Äôs the most interesting NPC you have. Your faction lacks the style of FC4‚Äôs Kyrati ‚ÄúGolden Path‚Äù or FC Primal‚Äôs Wenja tribespeople. Your faction‚Äôs NPC are just normal people. They lack style and their assets are recycled ad-nauseum. The same 4 or 5 people are in one million places. The enemies are also uninspired. They are... Rap listening-graffiti spraying-motocross bikers? They seem like the developers wanted a mad-max meets urban youth, and to me, the concept flops. 

Sound design is a mixed bag, the weapons and FX sound great. But the choice to make rap music the main track-list is certainly a questionable decision. Not gonna lie, I was jamming out to Hopsin, Die antwoord, Run The Jewels, etc. but it made the game feel gimmicky. Why do the bad guys listen to hip-hop and the good guys listen to oldies? 

The core gameplay that I know and love is back in New Dawn. Enemies chase you down on the roads, stealth is fun and engaging. The open world is chaotic and full of life. 

The gameplay mechanics took a step backwards. Everything rests on your ability to collect ethanol to upgrade the facilities of your main camp. To get the ethanol, you basically have to grind for it. In New Dawn, you can ‚Äúrecapture‚Äù an outpost, basically resetting it back to enemy hands, and beat it again with harder enemies, more alarms etc, which is kind of neat, but not an excuse to cut the number of outposts in half, basically making you recapture the same outposts over and over to get ethanol. Also animal skins do nothing and it removes the fun of hunting in the past games. 

The ethonol system is a drag, to be honest. Making an annoying grind out of unlocking all the content. I hope they don't carry that mechanic over to the next game. 

The one improvement to the gameplay were the ‚Äúexcursions‚Äù which took you to various places in order to raid them for supplies and were a welcome addition to the game in my opinion. 

Lack of multiplayer is a big negative. Far Cry 5 had great multi. The Far Cry brand of map creation is absent. 
Lack of achievements is lame. 

All in all, I enjoyed my time in New Dawn because I am a Far Cry fan boy.  I‚Äôve been playing since Instincts/Predator. But I would not recommend this game to my friends over higher quality Far Cry titles like 3,4, and perhaps even Primal.

So I can't recommend this game cause if you don't find a man sized pig that crushes anyone foolish enough to stand against you as enjoyable as me I don't think there is much else going for it. The story, game play and even the followers felt worse than the 5th's in my opinion (with the exception of Horatio who filled the Cheeseburger shaped hole in my follower slot for the duration of my playthrough) and there is also a few things through the game I noticed that made it seem lazily put together. The main example being the fact that every single and I do mean EVERY side quest that you can get from talking to a member of your faction comes from 1 of 2 people either a white chick or a black hipster dude. So I would say it could be worth it if you can get it for under 15-20$ but defiantly not 40$ I would rather buy silicon tits for my anime body pillow with that money than use it to purchase this game at full price.

- Dated graphics (engine)
- Women antagonists? You must be joking :-) They were kinda difficult to kill in the end though

The game starts and introduces you to the main antagonists. And yeah, they're not great. The main villains are immediately comically evil a la Negan from The Walking Dead - evil for evil's sake. After a bit of an intro that shows you the world it opens up and you have to build up your base. Base-building can be fun if it's a main part of the game. For Far Cry New Dawn, however, that is not the case. All you do to build your base is collect resources... Which would be fine except...

Micro-transactions are abundant, with credits being pushed on every menu in the game. The game devolved into a collect-a-thon within the first 1.5 hours of play, with every item being crafted from random, arbitrary supplies that you have to meticulously collect. There's also a magical currency in the game - ethanol - that you have to collect from bad guy bases to build the base as mentioned above. The game play loop is lazy and uninspired but what else can you expect from an Ubisoft game?

Multiplayer takes a front seat in this game, and on more than one occasion I found myself getting into a vehicle with 2+ seats and accidentally getting into the passenger seat and wondering why the vehicle won't chase after the enemy I'm fighting. Menus pop up and tell you all about the multi player and won't leave you alone. The addition of dedicated companions seemed like a fun concept, but when my team mate went down and fell through the terrain they were on I was unable to revive and had to spend a lot of the resources I had gathered on getting them back up. The ""downed"" feature was also an interesting addition to the game, clearly due to the focus on multiplayer, and ultimately adds the tiniest bit more depth to the game. Unfortunately, it becomes a bore-fest with you having to worry about a dumb AI that runs directly at a bear.

The game looks superb, runs well, and the production value is clearly AAA. However, that doesn't negate the fact that the game is a cash-grab re-skin. If you like Far Cry 5 and never played FC3 or 4 you may enjoy this game. If you're looking for more of a FC3 and FC4 single player experience you may be better off replaying one of the aforementioned two games.",1628897200,1628897200,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Far Cry 5 has Joseph Seed, this has Mickey and Lou, character whose names literally took effort to remember while writing this. They are one note, simplified ""bad for the sake of being bad"" bandits. The game throws a few cursory background details about them to claim they came from a bad home,  but its just one of several lines tossed out without impact during scenes where the attention is elsewhere. When they die there's an entire monologue death scene that has more lines in one spot than either villain got in the game up to that point. It feels annoying and dragged out, as though we should ""feel bad"" this bandit with a custom NPC skin is dying. 
The game is filled with lots of fun ""put all your nice gear in this bag"" moments, or ""tie yourself up or we'll kill your friend"", all of which are immediately followed by the game killing an NPC or doing something nasty and laughing at you for being dumb enough to follow the un-avoidable button prompt. Really dumb writing.
A big character dies, but we barely know anything about them, so again... little impact.
And the final boss isn't even the villains on the cover, spoilers but seriously save your money.
The map is just the same map as farcry 5, but with less to do. The base upgrading system is very cool! But with so little time in the game, its over with pretty quick and all the upgrades are done.
The expeditions are great! But there's not many of them, and at t a certain point its just to get parts for more weapons.
But yeah, anything this game does Farcry 5 did better and more enjoyably. If its heavily discounted it'll get you a bit more fun out of Hope County, but wait for FarCry 6 or replay Farcry 5 otherwise.

[h1] BLOOD DRAGON IS DISAPPOINTED [/h1] 


[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]


[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]

After the explosive ending of Far Cry 5 (spoilers lol) where the apocalypse happens, exactly like Joseph Seed had predicted, you are taken by him to a shelter and the game ends on a cliff hanger.

This was one of the best but also the most infuriating endings ever. It really leaves you hanging without any answers...

[u]So naturally, Ubisoft pumping and milking out a sequel was as predictable as taxes at the end of the month.[/u]


[h1]PLOT:[/h1]

[b]Seventeen years after the nuclear explosions that devastated Hope County, life has returned to Hope County, Montana. 

Endless black rain and wind have given way to blue skies and blooming flora. Humans that survived the bombs now work to rebuild, forming communities across the county. One group of survivors formed in California is led by Thomas Rush. Rush's group dedicate themselves to engineering and bio-farming in order to assist communities across the country. 

Players assume the role of The Security Captain for Rush's group, and upon arriving in Hope County, they are swept up in a conflict between the Scavengers, the Highwaymen, ran by Mickey and Lou, the game's antagonists, and New Eden. [/b]

This story was empty. No emotions, no heart, no effort. Nothing. I felt nothing while playing this. No, wait, that‚Äôs a lie. I cringed a lot at the story and performances.

The game makes no real attempt to have an entertaining and engaging story. It‚Äôs just good old cliches and bad writing. Things we have all seen before, where two factions fight in the aftermath of the apocalypse and the bad guys are so bad that they kidnap and torture people for fun, while listening to bad guys music (in this game it‚Äôs rap and edgy music, just because it‚Äôs cool). It does nothing to distinguish itself from other games and to be honest, it really doesn‚Äôt want to.

The problem here is that we get a really unsatisfying conclusion to the, may I say, bold ending that we had in Far Cry 5. It just goes nowhere‚Ä¶ And shock, Joseph Seed is here, but he looks like he is already dead, if not, on Xanax overdoses.

The performances are also terrible. The evil twins are laughably bad with their line deliveries but they couldn't do much with a script like this. Same goes for the other characters, where they try to make them all ""cool"" but it just looks like a 70 yr old trying to write 15yr olds' messages on Instagram. It's that bad... No one is saved here.

[b]To summarize, this story is pointless, goes nowhere with it, it‚Äôs clich√© as hell. If you were going to play this for the story, you are better off just reading it on the wiki and saving your money. [/b]

[u]Terrible[/u]


[h1]GAMEPLAY AND LEVEL DESIGN:[/h1]

[u]It‚Äôs probably the only good part of the game, although it‚Äôs Ubisoft‚Äôs ‚Äúrecipe for success‚Äù copy and pasted all over it.[/u]

Far Cry New Dawn shares the same map with its antecessor, Far Cry 5 (much like Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon), with a few cuts and texture changes. 

The world feels like Poison Ivy invaded Hope County and made Nature Great Again. It‚Äôs all pink and green and the colors are over exposed (almost had seizures with the game jk), but it‚Äôs very beautiful, non the less.

The gameplay is similar to Far Cry 5, being an FPS with skills to unlock and all kinds of weapons in your roaster, and it‚Äôs quite perfected here, having learned with the previous games. It feels very smooth and responsive and it‚Äôs very fun too, so if you played any of the other games, you know what to expect.

Like in other FC games, we have enemy outposts to take on, either stealthily or guns blazing, and after beating them, you can do it again, with harder enemies, to earn more supplies for your Base. Ah yes, I forgot to mention, now there is Home Base (Prosperity), where you can upgrade different things like crafting, fast travel, etc‚Ä¶

But not everything is pleasant. They decided to introduce an RPG like level system (tier-based combat), where you and your enemies have levels, and it‚Äôs increasingly hard to take on enemies with higher levels (Ubi‚Äôs Recipe for Success). And personally, I find it very annoying having all the enemy health bars and damage points system, it just visual noise and makes enemies even more bullet sponges.

Ubisoft made supplies harder to find and thus, unlocking new weapons is also harder and requires a lot of grinding. I didn't bother much with it, o, but this limits the gameplay variety and the fun you might have playing with different weapons. But wait, they said, [u]NOW YOU CAN BUY THE MATERIALS YOU NEED, CAUSE MICROTRANSACTIONS[/u]. [h1]Shame on you Ubisoft.[/h1]

Also, mid-campaign, you get these ridiculous super powers called Eden‚Äôs Gift, which just break the game and make you a literal super hero. They were fun to use, but at what expense‚Ä¶

[b]To conclude, the gameplay is fun just like the other ones, but I feel that FC5 is better and not ruined with this ridiculous level system and the superpowers. And don't even get me started with the microtransaction...[/b]


[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]

I can‚Äôt remember the music that well. I guess standard Hollywood music for the cutscenes. And for the cars you have two radio stations: Rap and Edgy songs and a 50‚Äôs radio station, because why not. I particularly did not enjoy the first one, it was really bad, so every time I drove a car, I picked the retro radio station which was quite pleasant.

[b]Meh just meh.[/b]


[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]

Like I said previously, the graphics are pretty and world design is good.
I played using Nvidia GeForce Now (streaming service) and got a lot of performance issues, with terrible FPS, but that was not on my end so I can't really say much.

[b]Overall it's good, but not groudbreaking.[/b]


[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]

[b]Far Cry 5 - Part 2[/b]

[u]If there was a mixed button for Steam, I would pick that. But as there isn't, I'm forced to make a choice.

And my answer is a No. I just can't recommend this game, even on sale.
It does nothing excellent to distract you from the god awful story and performances, it's a basic copy and paste from other Ubisoft titles, and the new additions to gameplay only seem to do more harm than good.[/u]

[h1]If you were pretending to see the conclusion to the cliff hanger of FC5, you are better off just watching it or reading the summary.[/h1]

Now, I finished ND today and I forgot how many problems this has and I'm going to go through some of them that really bugged me. Starting off with bugged missions (that I encountered) from not being able to speak to anyone because I wasn't able to interact with anyone, as in the E prompt was grayed out and non-pressable. Some missions that are just pointless which there's a lot of them. The Guns For Hire barely do anything. Like, an enemy'll be near them and they'll just stare at them like they're invisible. Though, saying that I used Carmina Rye for the entire game (because, ya'know Nick Rye is the best and we're the godfather [we're not the Deputy from the first game but ignore that] and she managed to get like 30-40 odd kills though I stopped checking it) and she wasn't too bad. I think I got all the GFH except Jerome (God bless) but. I think I'm done with the game because I was getting annoyed towards the end, just pointless missions, pointless... everything

Game's great though regardless of all I just said, when everything works it's working so. I still recommend this game because it is fun. The missions with Roger (I cannot remember the actual title of the missions, expeditions I think?) are REALLY fun and I mean that, challenging a little bit but that's probably just me because i'm bad at games but I really enjoyed doing them. Nothing really more to say about this because my memory has just gone blank already and I finished the game like an hour or so ago, maybe more...

My score and recommendation still applies. Highly Recommend, 7.5/10, deducting points for bullshit missions and inputs not working when they should. Maybe 5.75/10.

So, I'm replaying Far Cry 5 and having an absolute blast like I did when it first came out, the best pre-order I made that year and the best game of that year and still going strong now. But, that reminded me of this game, New Dawn. Which 95% of people still shit on because, well I don't know (nor remember, it's been a while and reviews have probably changed since but hey ho). I actually really like this game and the one thing they did that 5 didn't was that your Guns for Hire AND Fangs for Hire can enter the vehicle with you which is amazing. Plan on replaying it after I've finished 5 but. I'll update my review again when I've remembered more about New Dawn lol.

Highly recommend, 7.5/10

Original review, 2.6 hours played at review time: Timber is my favourite part of this game, hands down. You can't change my mind. I miss Boomer and Cheeseburger tho </3 but Timber is amazing.",1555356580,1628269582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now its not terrible, the fun factor can often outweigh a lot of the negatives. But I don't think that's the case here. First of all, it's way too similar to Far Cry 5. Reuses the map, assets, characters and story, etc. The recycling along with the much lower amount of content makes Far Cry New Dawn feel like it should just be a $15 DLC. Next problem, a lot of the new content and game design choices are utterly moronic. The RPG-style of the combat completely take away all the fun and freedom from doing missions, and this in combination with the plot and setting even makes the game feel as though it is apeing off of other series like Fallout and Borderlands. Also, and I believe this may be a problem with modern Ubisoft games, the game requires you to do side content in order to progress. That isn't how an open world game should work. You should be able to do side content only if you want to, and then continue with the main story missions at your own pace. Not to mention the microtransactions, annoying side characters, and embarrassing villains. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, this game isn't very good. It is almost saved by the fun factor, as well as certain aspects of gameplay such as the gunplay and world exploration, but those are pretty much a given in a Far Cry game, and this game isn't special when it comes to those features. If you really want to play it that badly, I'd get it at least 80% off. Otherwise, I'd steer clear. Just go play one of the other Far Cries... Like 3, or 4, or 2, or 5, or Blood Dragon, or...

It should have been an Expansion (DLC). It is the perfect size for one.

As a stand alone game it is lacking in variety and depth. 

I will note it is very well optimized graphically. I can run it on max settings and get a reliable 60 FPS at 1440 with it hovering around the mid 70s when not in combat. In contrast, far cry 5 and 4 are much more taxing and don't look as good on my machine.

The two enemy protagonist kind of miss the mark. Their power is derived from simply having tough people around them. If they are placed 1 on 1 with the main character they suddenly become a lot less intimidating. That being said I found the ending underwhelming.

The rest, however, is 50/50 and if I could I‚Äôd give the game a neutral rating but since I can‚Äôt I‚Äôll give it a VERY cautious thumbs up.
                                                                        ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
The story is lackluster, shallow and plays out like a DLC rather than a standalone sequel. I found myself caring less about most if not all of the good guys. Many tend to go on long unfunny tangents, and you‚Äôre going to get the joke, but the joke just isn‚Äôt funny. Unfortunately, the writers thought they were hilarious, and you‚Äôll have to endure this with many of the side quests. Mickey and Lou, however, were entertaining, and their cutscenes were the only real saving grace to the story. Hell, I was rooting for them and if given the option would‚Äôve immediately sided with the bad guys. It‚Äôs a shame, because I believe if they had put the effort into doing a fully fleshed out story revolving around the twins it would‚Äôve been great. Instead, what we‚Äôre left with is two random villains who have no relation to the FC5 events, and anything relating to FC5 could‚Äôve been squeeze in or popped into a small DLC.

The selling point is online co-op, however, even that feels half-assed. There are multiple missions where you will need to escort an NPC in a vehicle, however, these vehicles are only designed for two people, which leaves your co-op buddy scrambling to find a ride to try and keep up because otherwise, the mission will fail for them ‚Äúabandoning the objective.‚Äù Another thing is progress, it only counts for the host which also means no Uplay achievements that are story related for your pal. Now we didn‚Äôt care about the achievements but progress being tied to the host only is pretty stupid. Also, this is just a nitpick, but photo mode should work in co-op as well, just sayin‚Äô!
                                                                        ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
I thought the outposts and grinding for all the outfits weas the best part of the game. It‚Äôs very rewarding, and it was nice to be able to approach it in whatever way we wanted. Expeditions weren‚Äôt half bad either, though that got stale a lot quicker than the outposts did. The gameplay itself is solid enough, bugs aside. When you‚Äôre going in loud it feels like old COD when you‚Äôre opting for stealth it works out smoothly and it can feel rewarding the first few times you do it successfully. I was pleasantly surprised taking out alarms with a silencer didn‚Äôt alert everyone in the area.

The setting itself and the world is another plus, I honestly love it. The idea of the world being destroyed then coming back so vibrant and beautiful is a refreshing take on the post-apocalyptic concept, I adore it. Coming from a Fallout fan, I almost wish more games took that route. Even the monstrous animals were amazing in my eyes. I just wish the story had been up to par.

A Screenshot of Far Cry New Dawn
By: Miraakles

Finally, be warned. Like most Ubisoft games, it‚Äôs buggy. Now, most bugs I can pass on, like the enemy AI reinforcements at outposts just standing still in the desert leaving their friends to die as they suddenly have a midlife crisis. But bugs that get me killed repeatedly or require me to restart the whole game? It‚Äôs just annoying. Twice after a loading screen, I got stuck in place and couldn‚Äôt move. The first time there was nothing around, I was just standing in place, trapped by open-air around me. The second time I spawned in a small ass tree, that a car can destroy but a gun can‚Äôt. Sometimes your character won‚Äôt vault through windows, other times they won‚Äôt climb up or down the ladder. Had to reload one part at least 4 times because of an infinite loading screen, and then once again getting stuck in place. NPCS love running directly in front of your car btw, thus forcing you to hit them and aggro-ing everyone in the area. Also, why the hell can we heal at full health? The amount of medkits I‚Äôve wasted by accidentally hitting the button and my character deciding to pop some pills is ridiculous.
                                                                        ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
I don‚Äôt believe the game was god awful, but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs amazing either. I enjoyed it because of my coop partner and the story missions involving the twins, but otherwise, I would‚Äôve refunded a long time ago. So, take that as you will. New Dawn is pretty as hell, but lackluster, shallow, and pretty pitiful for a sequel. My advice? Grab a friend you trust and who‚Äôs funny, don‚Äôt take it seriously, buy it 50% or lower, and enjoy the ride.",1627174968,1627174968,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The only thing I enjoyed with them was the cut scene where the MC gave them a whooping, that was cool and unexpected. I wish I could have seen more unexpected things happen. Joseph missions were extremely boring and the level designs were definitely the most annoying. Ethans boss fight was disappointing, it looked like there was no effort put into it. I wish we could have had more animals to fight with, like a cheetah or something else.

[spoiler]Thomas Rush was an absolute wasted character, his death meant nothing as we spent all of 3min in-game with him, the antagonists read like the writers once heard about interesting and sympathetic motivations in the late 70s, but kinda forgot about it and only remember vague concepts, but nothing of consequence. 
some of the side NPCs are really enjoyable, like Hurk and his family, though I think it's wasted potential that we never get to see his baby. Nana would be really fun, a snipering grandma with traumatic partial amnesia could've been a real opportunity here.[/spoiler]",1626952308,1626952308,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, most of the gameplay in Far Cry 5 was excellent.  But FC5's story stinks on ice!   New Dawn, on the other hand, isn't perfect but was still much more enjoyable than FC5.
Anyhow, here are some thoughts on the game:

PROS:
-- The story here is relatively simple.  It's a 'The Postman' or 'Mad Max' sort of affair...ya know, what you expect in almost every post-apocalyptic sci-fi genre piece?  That still makes it an exponentially better story than the FC5, which squandered so much potential with its hokey, railroaded plot mechanics and laughably absurd villains.
-- No lame bliss kidnapping mechanic like in FC5.
-- And speaking of villains...yes, sometimes FC villains can be cheesy and over-the-top.  FC5 took the high-octane cheddar to a whole new level.  The villains in New Dawn aren't particularly deep characters, but their whole 'ruthless wasteland bandit' shtick fits in just fine with this post-apocalyptic setting and plot.
-- The ability to helicopter into different settings in various locations around the USA makes for some fun side missions and a nice, and varied, change of scenery from Montana.
-- Good guns...eventually (I'll explain what I mean in the 'Cons' below).  There is the ability to further upgrade guns.
-- A base village to upgrade.
-- Plenty of playtime bang for your buck, especially if you get it on sale and especially if you are a completionist like me who likes to do every mission and explore every nook and cranny.
-- Can re-play outposts at higher difficulty in exchange for more resource in the short term.
-- Far fewer bugs and glitches than FC5.
-- The ending was good.  FC3 and FC4 were a blast to play, but their endings were lacking.  FC3's endings were both rather feeble.  FC4 basically gave the player endings that were[spoiler] ""Yup, you did all that work and all that fighting...and this place still sucks nuts.  Better luck next time, sucker!  Haha!""[/spoiler]  By contrast, my favorite FC installment, Primal, had a good ending, I thought.  In Primal, [spoiler] the player feels like they actually accomplished something.  New Dawn has an ending like that, so I found it satisfying. [/spoiler]
-- And the icing on the cake?  [spoiler] You finally get to plug that self-important moron, Joseph Seed!  Yay![/spoiler] 

CONS:
-- The guns are ridiculously nerfed at the very beginning; They are essentially BB guns and can't hit the broad side of a barn.  Just stick to melee takedowns and/or RPG the heck out of everything that moves until you unlock the first level of better guns, which doesn't take too long.  Once you progress and the better guns start to unlock, the weaponry turns out to be just fine.
-- Like in FC5, the enemy AI is still wonky at times.
-- Why the hell is everything painted hot pink?!?  It's like, ""Hey, everyone, it's a post-apocalyptic wasteland where resources of all kinds are in short supply...except pink paint.  We're totally good on pink paint!""  Yeah, yeah, there are pink mutant flowers everywhere, and they could have made the dye from the flowers, right?  But in a world where you're struggling on a daily basis to find enough guns, fuel, and bullets just to stay alive, let alone run a multi-state bandit gang, who's got 40 hours of free time a week to run a massive pink paint factory and then go gallivanting around the countryside painting murals everywhere?  Minor rant, I know...but it bugged me.
-- The DLC appears worthless; It's just a bunch of cosmetic stuff.",1585618646,1626669954,True,3,1,0.534036874771118164,0,True,False,False
939960,95998300,76561198029878092,0,36,740,0,740,1626663955,"really bad. i would not be surprised if this was some new ubisoft studio's first project.

this game is awful. this is a step back from Far Cry 5 in almost all aspects and frankly that is an achievement.

Features in Far Cry 5 that New Dawn does not have:
-weapon customization
-anywhere near as many weapons, opting instead for the same weapons split into 4 tiers with different paintjobs and attachments
-planes
-helicopters

The usual Ubisoft Story caveats apply. It's really bad this time but most cutscenes and dialog are skippable. Not that I skipped them. I need to stop doing this to myself.

There is one set of three missions that made me Alt-F4 after about 30 minutes of fruitless attempts at ""puzzle"" solving (it turns out i needed to hit an input that the game does not have listed in its binds and that apparently displays once and never again, as I had to be informed of its existence by my coop partner. We also had to restart the mission because the input would randomly not work in certain mission areas).

You get Super Jesus Superpowers at some point (double jump, a berserk powerup, some other shit I don't care about, probably stealth or hunting buffs) and those are pretty cool. I wish they'd backport those into FC5. 

Expeditions are great. Frankly, I wish every mission was an Expedition style combat scenario rather than what they are. I only played the first one (unfortunately FCND is just that intolerable for me) but it was the exact sort of content I wanted to see in FC5. 

The usual perk point bullshit from FC5 still applies. This game is not an RPG. This game is a looter shooter, except you craft all the loot yourself (once, and then it's free). Enemies are Borderlands-tier of bulletspongey once you start getting to the higher levels and god help you if you don't have a purple gun for a purple enemy or a gold gun for a gold enemy.

It turns out that even if you only make one game, you can still fuck it up royally. Thanks, Ubisoft.",1626667764,1626667764,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In previous games the more difficult enemies were just more armored. In this game a man with a motorcycle helmet can shrug off three .50bmg rounds, uh, alright then. 

Final straw was finding out I could not complete a mission due to the developer locking away a skill behind the perk tree I didn't know I needed for the mission. 

TL;DR: plays well but needlessly tanky enemies, awful writing and story like. Forgettable characters and just enough jank to piss you off.

UBISOFT...!!! 

Are you telling me you actually -> Stepped off the tried ( 3 games now ) and true -< FC3 game style and tried something.... UNIQUE!!

Im not even annoyed about the way you just re-used FC5 assets and re-skinned the game. To put it bluntly, Far Cry New Dawn is -> what <- FC5 SHOULD have been!

No more drug fueled mystic nonsense time shifting dreams ( that you cant skip ), No more EXACT same guns required for the entire game, No more -> beat this boss to unlock this area <- Garbage..!!

You actually went and made an OPEN world game that is actually OPEN for the player to decide what they do next.

You even re-imagined ( although, the exact same fucking gun assets since FC3 are still being used, if not re-skinned ) the gun and fighting system to FORCE the player to save up for different guns as the levelling system now means tougher enemies just dont DIE unless you have same tiered guns!

Great!

its like someone at Ubisoft ACTUALLY had half an imagination.

With friends it is a game that you will not enjoy from gameplay but more for the company of others. Compared to other Far Cry's this one is a huge disappointment, unlike Far Cry 2 having a dry story, this one did not only have plot holes but it sure did not feel like Far Cry and was more of a big time downgrade compared to Far Cry 5. This game was more of a money grab then anything else because it was a true shame seeing micro transactions being more heavily pushed for a story mode game. Lastly. for the game that was supposed to be a DLC to Far Cry 5, they sure failed to make it great and fit in well, as for there could of been better executions with map designs as for some areas were off compared to Far Cry 5 where it is supposed to be the same map as New Dawn. The map was also cut down big time, for the space New Dawn takes up, you would think they would have a lot of content instead it lacks content. It would have been a better execution if they pulled off something like Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. 

Gameplay:

- Meh (Decent).
- Very Buggy at unique points, such as character getting stuck in the ground, AI freaking out, and the game as a whole just not functioning right when the characters are stopped in place and they bug out.

Description for Gameplay:

- Compared to all the other Far Cry's the weapons were unique in design due to apocalyptic theme, but besides that it lacks a lot of other features. 1. Lack of music in cars and in game when facing scenarios. 2. Lack of types of guns 3. Lack of customization of cars, characters, and weapons, they could of made more apocalyptic customization. (Compared to Far Cry 5 where they gave you more options). 4. Buggy/Crashing

Guns:

- Unique

Description for guns:

- They gave an apocalyptic vibe but they sure lack in the amount of weapons. You would expect to find more weapons or unique variants of the weapons from Far Cry 5 in New Dawn because it is supposed to be the same place as 5, but instead it is just not there. The recoil on weapons is just not there, which is a true shame because that adds more better feelings of actually controlling the weapons. Furthermore the weapons extremely had few customization. 

The Antagonist/Villains: (Spoiler under Joseph Seed if anyone has not viewed some details of this game) 

- Joseph Seed (Somewhat Villain but not really in this game more of a good guy) (Great but way more awesome in Far Cry 5 as the antagonist)
- The Sisters - Complete Jokes
- Multiple Villains is a great idea but poorly executed in here.

Description for Antagonist/Villains: 

-  The sisters put on a great boss battle on the hardest difficulty the game offered but besides that, they were complete awful when it came to dialogue, their reasoning for being villains, and their lack luster threats. The sisters provided many threats (like a villain does) but they sure did not stick to them (I would go into detail here but it would be more spoilers). The villains do not make that much appearances in missions or the whole game in general for ""being villains"" they are just more there in the first mission, disappear until one mission in the mid game, then you basically never see them again until the last two missions. A goal of the villain is to make the viewer/gamer fear them and find them menacing, instead they talk crap and do nothing basically while making horrible jokes. Continuing, the villains backstory for becoming evil is very weak as for they could of done better at building their character for creating a new game that is supposed to be a DLC where the villains could have been more evil and mentally sick, but instead it seemed like they were trying to be evil and mentally ill but instead they made themselves look more like jokes. The dialogue and interactions between the antagonist could of been more engaging as for it does not meet up to greatly and does not present the villains and sick in the head like Far Cry series is supposed to present for their villains. Every other Far Cry presented their evil and sickness in them to the audience (player) but instead this did not stick up to it, they were more like weak terrorist then anything. 

Graphics:

- You expect a game to get better in graphics because it is newer and using the same engine as Far Cry 5, instead it was rather a noticeable and big downgrade compared to Far Cry 5 even with HDR on. I do not mind graphics so much because games are not claimed as good for graphics they are claimed great for gameplay, build, and story. 

Characters:

- Descent

Description for characters:

- The characters stated above discuss some about them but as for the rest, they were typical Far Cry characters and it seemed normal. They could of built more story between them and 5 and how the event from 5 to New Dawn impacted them as a whole.

Customization for your character:

- Huge downgrade from Far Cry 5, other Far Cry's sure they do not have customization and that is fine, and character customization is nothing big to worry about at all, but it sure did not have much to choose from compared to 5. I like the idea of unlocking some new outfits after some missions being completed but it could have the potential to present more.

Ending:

- Anti climatic for the most part, but not so expecting.

Pricing:

- Maximum: $8.99 USD
- Minimum: Freemium or $5.00 USD

Overall:

- No matter what developer anyone is for a game, I give them a great job for building a game because that is something I know I cannot do. As a customer of their product, I expected better and it could of have more detailed but I give the team a great job for building a game and making a product in which I cannot make. The viewpoint as a customer, playing their game, it could of presented better and gets a negative review by me as for I see it as lazy and unfinished worked compared to their other products in the Far Cry Series. A developer should do more to listen to what the community wants and spend time to craft a masterpiece rather then having greed for money and pumping out constant garbage. It is amazing what time can do to a game and this is one of the game that could of used more time to work on.

FC P being one of the most shit on games in the franchise still feels better than than this by a consumer stand point. Far Cry Primal was not a standard Far cry game and is more like a FC game mashed up with a low key survival vibe - in prehistoric times. It wouldn't have worked as a DLC because of how different it feels and how far it strays from FC3 or even Blood Dragon at the time.

New Dawn however feels like it could have easily been a 20-40$ DLC expansion rather than an 80$ stand alone game. It is very much a reskin with minor changes made, but its still Far Cry 5 at its core. Primal feels like a new game, New Dawn feels like a fan made mod like you would get for Skyrim. If anything consumers get screwed since FC5 was and still does feel like its missing content. Content that is in New dawn. Outposts have more use, more open map events and and upgradeable base. These should be a plus for New Dawn, but it just feels like they intentionally cut features from FC5 in order to crap out a ""new"" game a year later.

Its good enough to grab on sale, but if you buy it full price you will regret it. This is not a full game, its a large expansion. Far Cry 5 had me hooked and I sunk hours into it, continuously. 4 hours in to New Dawn and I want to go back to Primal or take a look at Rage 2.",1626475749,1626475749,False,1,0,0.472536176443099976,0,True,False,False

I saw great potential in what was brought to the table, but am a bit disappointed in how it played out. This is one of those times when streamlining game mechanics too much hurt the overall package more than it helped. I give it a 7.5 / 10. 

( + Positive ) Far Cry New Dawn focuses more on game play than story with lots of collection and tasks you can do to check mark off a list. Between short story missions, hunting for pelts, upgrading a home base, and capturing temporary mini bases scattered across the open world. The game doesn't distinctively force you into doing any certain task which is nice, as you have the freedom to pursue what you'd like to do and at your own pace to keep it from becoming too repetitive. There is also coop and various followers you can team up with while sporting their own weapons, abilities, and play styles to supplement your own.

( + Positive ) The story isn't that deep, and that's fine to me after my great experience with games like Kane and Lynch 2 which only have minimal amounts of it to drive the game play forward. The story is mostly about rebuilding the base called Prosperity, which in turn incorporates itself into the game play by offering you better weapons, more health, more explosives, more vehicles and expeditions that award the materials to do these upgrades.

( + Positive ) For people who really enjoy collecting resources, you'll feel right at home. There are lots of materials to farm, perk point granting pick ups hidden off in hard to reach places that make you think to obtain them, costumes and character customization.

( - Negative ) While interesting at first, It didn't take me long to realize that the rpg mechanics feel rather slapped on than fully flushed out. Unlike Far Cry 5, weapon customization does not exist. There are a lot of weapons to choose from, but they are locked behind different tiers. Trying to use a lower tier weapon against a higher tier enemy will result in very un fun bullet sponges. Lack of customization really hurts as you'll be forced to use sights you don't want or stare at tape and a scissors bayonet. 

( - Negative ) Perks also seemed interesting at first, but majority of them turned out to just be simple stat boosters like carry more ammo instead of the insanely small amounts you start with. To a grappling hook which feels like it should of been something you find or are given early in the story. Instead it's just a perk. End game offers some interesting magic like abilities. While neat, I don't think magical really fits the game's aesthetic. 

( - Negative ) The game is a grind fest that actively encourages you to buy packs of resources or costumes so you don't have to farm them. You won't have to buy anything, but be prepared to farm like an MMORPG to get upgrades. With only a handful of base upgrades, it doesn't feel like you've accomplished much even after the boat loads of hours you've sunk to farm oil and parts. Expeditions helped break up the usual routine, but ultimately are all the same get in and grab something, get out. I wish more time was spent playing into the survival inspired aspects. It's almost like an extremely gutted Fallout.",1626388863,1626388863,True,6,0,0.557176291942596436,0,True,False,False

These are the only games in the series worth playing in my opinion. The third was OK but still...play the original two games to realise why people like us get so angry and became so found of the franchise.

I honestly could not get past playing for longer than an hour. UBISOFT once again prove that they have absolutely no idea how to make an interesting video game. With buckets of talent they still push out the same game over and over and over again. Unable to come up with anything original so they just take what they know (which is very little) and add mechanics until the game is riddled with the same upgrade, hub, build up setup you've seen in EVERY ONE OF THEIR LAST GAMES OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS!!!!

And to top it off they throw in politically motivated content just to TRY and be relevant. In the process they only show how unable they are to be individual as NO ONE needed a game with pink flowers and female enemies to understand equality. No one wanted two girls who cuss constantly and listen to shit music but hey UBISOFT did it because...girls and equality!!

If you're looking for a vanilla, default...predictable, stereo typical gaming experience then you've found your game!! 

Pathetic, immature bullshit. And Far Cry 6 doesn't look like they've learnt anything as their customer base is now the mainstream crowd of dummies who'll buy anything they are told to.

Yes, as long as you're aware of what it is. I got this on sale, and I recommend you do.($25-$30 is a more reasonable price)
This is somewhere between an expansion pack and a full game.

Pros: 
Actually tried to add new features, and distinguish this from Far Cry 5
-Crafting
-New Guns for Hire companions are awesome!(I love Horatio, the boar, and Timber, a cool dog)
-New events, like Expeditions, are attempts at new ideas which should be commended
-Fast travel must be upgraded to be fully used across the map(I arguably think this is good)
-More focus on collection resources, however, this isn't too repetitive
-Scavenging, which levels up outposts to reconquer them, is cool
-Interesting character development with John Seed(not a villain anymore)
-New random events like supplies being airdropped

Cons:
-Didn't care for main bad guys(they were more annoying than anything)
-Early level takedowns can be silly(sorry, you can't takedown a level 2 bad guy)
-Overpriced at full price
-You might dislike that most weapons are basically reskins from Far Cry 5
-Literally uses the same map as FC5
-Enemies can seem excessively tough, especially level 4 guys(Enforcers)(hint: use armor piercing bullets)",1625973918,1625973918,True,1,0,0.506633520126342773,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the way you can interact with it is worse than farcry 5.  The weapons can >not< be customized or properly upgraded. ""Upgraded"" just adds a 5% damage bonus.  This is unfortunate, as it limits you to the top tier of weapons.  The ""story"" fails on every level. The characters are caricatures. I can't  bring myself to care about the heroes or the villains.  It fails to bring its shallow story to a satisfying conclusion. 

I sincerely hope farcry 6 will implement some of the things we see here. I enjoy the damage numbers. I LOVE the ammo types combined with enemy types.  I love being able to ""surrender"" settlements for more loots. 

I hope they stay AWAY from 4 classes of weapons.  Make all weapons more or less equal, and have them be upgrade-able to about the same potential.  This current system is too limiting.

Story. Its mediocre at best. Very generic, not intriguing enough and dialogues & characters are bland. The Twins are okay villains but forgettable. As for the Joseph Seed from the Far Cry 5. I won't spoil anything, but you do get to finally resolve his story. Main story as I said is mediocre at best, however the side characters i.e. missions are all very enjoyable.

Game size. The whole game is about 2/3 the size of the original, both in map size, missions and outposts. However, you can do the same outpost three times with different difficulty. Also, the game size I described does not include the size of the expedition maps, which are larger than I was expecting and they add such a fresh air of game-play.

Performance. It runs brilliantly for me. I also didn't experience any significant bugs.

Game-play. In New Dawn there is a tiered enemy and weapon system (e.g. Silver, Blue, Purple and Yellow), but it does serve both to encourage new weapon usage, as well as slow the player improvement down a bit. It add a meaning to the grind. In FC5 you would do outposts just for the sake of it. In New Dawn, you must do Outpost in order to unlock better weapons, gadgets, vehicles and etc. Making the animals tiered also made them a much bigger threat than in FC5; I actually decided to carry a shotgun just because it worked so well on the animals. What I ended up liking the most though were some the smaller game-play additions. Like, there are now more randomized events in the world, like supply drops and looters, that make things feel more dynamic and make the open world more alive. Also, all enemies on the road now travel in packs of 2-3 vehicles, so no more picking off a lone supply truck. Plus, enemies have helmets that literally shatter when shot, meaning you have to headshot them twice to finish them off, unless you use AP rounds of course. Lastly, the game is also far more repayable, with all the outposts and expeditions being infinitely repayable and the world remaining populated with enemies after you beat the main story.

World design. Even though the map is essentially the same as FC5, it doesn't look even remotely similar. The world looks phenomenal. The overgrowth of vegetation really changes the look and feel of everything, especially in the regions that are now densely forested. But, it goes beyond that. The world is just incredibly pleasing to the eye, with its millions of flowers, aurora borealis both night and day, and turquoise water. It also has a ton of fine details integrated in, stuff like hummingbirds around collectible plants, dust clouds being kicked up by the wind, and multiple variations of the same animals. I think this sort of stuff really adds a lot of life to the world and, to be honest, I find the world of New Dawn to be one of the most pleasing just to be in of any game that I've played.

Final thoughts. I haven't talked about cooperation mode. I haven't yet played it, but if single-player is good as it is, the cooperation must be brilliantly fun. As for the downsides, you need 3rd party launcher (Ubisoft Connect), there are microtransactions, there are silly stupid costumes that don't belong in the game (IMHO) and I have found that wildlife is too much OP.

TL;DR. Don't use microtransactions to short the game-play, the whole fun in the game is the new improved progression system. Don't use companions, more of a challenge and fun while soloing. Don't buy it because of the story, its forgettable. Try not to use fast travels as often, the open-world is very much alive. Lastly, go into options menu and disable attention indicators, glowing indicators, damage indicators, tagging indicators, game icons and support icons and etc. plus play on hard difficulty - all of these will improve your experience guaranteed. You will have so much more fun.",1625324816,1625828602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i really liked how you could choose to let the enemies retake an outpost, for more oil, it allows you to challenge yourself further while getting the reward of more materials to advance your weaponry and state unlocks for your health and camp utilities.

while not being a stealth game, i generally favor Far Cry stealth systems no matter what, it's of my favorite stealth systems, though not perfect. the AI is still kind of not great though, especially friendly AI. i often find the Guns-For-Hire a liability at times, and sometimes they will get stuck or confused when i need to be revived.

hunting was pretty decent, i liked the monstrous animals, otherwise nothing too fresh here. the fishing wasn't frustrating, but maybe too simplified compared to FC5. while ambivalent about FC5's fishing system, i liked the increase of dynamics and challenge that wasn't here in New Dawn.

i honestly wasn't feeling the character writing, the dialog was so-so, the Twins felt sloppily written, Ethan was fine but the setup wasn't strong enough i don't think, and well, i can't talk about a certain other person without spoiling a twist.

the game felt a bit too short, considering how much this game probably costed back in the day, but if you even find it bundled in or on sale, you should go for it. i personally had a lot of fun, and the gameplay was addicting enough that i got nearly everything unlocked except for the co-op challenges.",1625628547,1625628547,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

The game has a few issues that stem out of the fact that things are very inconsistent, for example: your enemies either are the weakest thing and can be killed in one shot with the weakest gun in the game or a bullet sponge that you need to spray with an LMG to even chip.

The companions have two sides: Useless and Animal companions, Horatio and Timber (the pig and dog) actually help you in a fight properly and have useful functions while the human ones die before even shooting one shot cause they are useless in melee range (while your enemy is arguably at their strongest)

I am not even going to start about the vehicles and how shitty they are.
In the end 100% finished this game within 9 hours on the highest difficulty, died only once due to a bug of being hurt during a cutscene and i feel like it wasn't worth it, i just didn't want to feel like the few bucks i spend during the sale went to waste.

To summarize: The game lacks character, depth and most of all, fun!
You feel out of place for most of the game and feel like you are just shoehorned into the story.

Just a shame theres zero weapon customization, scopes, magazines and camo have been removed, instead sorting weapons into tiers with prebuilt ones.

The world is fairly small, in about 20 - 25 hours you can clear the entire map, so far im at 60% with 15 hour playtime. Make sure to keep your dog around, it helps in looting places faster. Unlock fast travel asap is recommended.

Overall great game, its probably one of my favorites among the Far Cry series, played all games from 1 - 5.

The gun play is fun and the styles for the guns great, but the combat is total trash. The tiers make enemies bullet sponges if they are a tier above your weapons. In theory that tier system would have provided a very satisfying feel when you get a higher tier weapon, but it doesn't feel right to implement the feature in the game.

The companion system is another great feature and I love the different character you can call to ally the player. Using Timber to find crafting materials and Nana to silently snipe enemies are some of my favorite options, and there are options to command them to shoot specific enemies. Unfortunately, there are some real jokes, and the only one I really had trouble with was the Judge since his fire rate and perhaps range was disgustingly awful.

Customization for the character is laughable and limited and there was no voice actor. A suggestion was to use a system similar to Saints Row 2 whereby you could choose a selection from voices or simply add one in.

The plot was pretty great and the characters were likable. I couldn't ask for a more deep and well written story but I could ask for a longer story as twenty-two missions felt a little short to me. The symbolism caught me off guard as well, and you'll see this in the cutscene just before the final boss. It was subtle, but exceeded my expectations from an American publisher.

The home base will be my final topic and I will be focusing mainly on expeditions. Most upgrades are somewhat respectable and not worth mentioning. Expeditions, are however a disgusting blight to the game. The concept behind them is fun, despite the GPS oversight. Seriously, what stops me from removing the GPS tracker from the package and taking the package. Expeditions fall under the tier system replayability like outposts and you have to play them about 3-4 times to fully complete them, thus artificially expanding playtime the most lazy way possible.

The rating of this game gets a total of 87,5% with points deducted from the tier system. The game play is solid and the story is great if you intend to play the game exactly how it's meant to be under the tier system limits but I recommend buying the Far Cry 5 bundle with this game and watch the other reviews.",1625474116,1625474116,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

939960,94909498,76561197995200857,0,121,461,0,461,1625256041,"This game is an odd post-apocalyptics spin-off/continuation of the mainline Far Cry 5, which is cool. It contains the same map but with a different veneer placed on top of it and the locations remixed somewhat. Also, the gameplay differs in some ways and the story is a little more fantastical.
Gameplay wise this game brings in some more RPG and stat based progression. There are now clear cut tiers of enemies with different health bars and abilities, and the protagonist can also upgrade themselves and their equipment and companions in similar ways. Although I like this aspect of the game in some ways, and I suspect it's something Ubisoft is developing for use in Far Cry 6, the way that it's implemented in this game is admittedly pretty grindy. You have to grind through certain missions to acquire resources and use that to progress your character in order to handle the upgraded enemies at certain points in the game. I found the grindiness of the system annoying since I really felt like it could have been streamlined, and might have been to encourage micro-transactions, but ultimately I think the system could work if tweaked. I actually really like stuff like this, where you have a home base you can return to and manage aspects of your character as well as upgrade various game mechanics as you progress. I just wish it didn't feel like it was there as padding to make the relatively short story longer.
The game does handle enemy spawns more reasonably than Far Cry 5 but animals are still ridiculously powerful for some reason.
Because the game is a spin off there's not as much side content as Far Cry 5 but I'm ok with that since it felt overdone and pointless sometime in Far Cry 5. The Expeditions in particular are a cool idea. They're side missions that take place away from the game map so it's a special map specifically created for that mission which you don't see often in these games. However, after I did a couple of them I didn't see a reason to continue doing the Expeditions because it didn't gift me the one resource you actually need to upgrade things in the game.
Finally, the story. I actually kinda liked this more fantastical take on the game series. Some people hate it, but I liked the really colorful bright visuals of the post-apocalyptic Hope County. The game takes place 17 years after the events of the main game, which ended in a nuclear apocalypse and the game centers around you defending/building-up, a community in Hope County Montana that is under siege by this group of wasteland bandits called the Highwaymen, led by two women called ""The Twins"". The Twins don't have the same charisma as some other villains in the series and they don't really have any motivation other than just stealing your stuff. It's hard to take them serioiusly. However, the main antagonist from the previous game, Joseph Seed, also plays a pretty interesting role in this game, and I think it contrasts pretty well. It had a feeling sort of like some of the more mysterious/mystical elements that occasionally crop up in Fallout.
Overall, I did enjoy my time with the game, but if it wasn't for the grinding progression system it could have been a much tighter, yet shorter, experience.",1625257993,1625257993,True,1,0,0.507698535919189453,0,True,False,False

THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN A DLC, THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN A DLC, THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN A DLC...

You can feel that everything's same. The animals are same with different skins, the buildings are same - just buried under some dirt. The guns are cheap reskins, already modified when you buy em. Just copy/paste from FC5 - add some screws and knives at the barrel to make em look post apocalyptic. Put some characters from the other game, reskin them as well. . Slap some ridiculous leveling system on them and voila, you got yourself a new AAA title. Oh - don't forget to paint every plant, wall and weapon pink.

I'd like to point out that I've enjoyed and finished every Far Cry game multiple times - up until now. With the exception of Primal - guess what, it was a reskinned FC4. FC5 was one of my fav games as well.

I really enjoy new games folks. New scenarios, new graphics, new gameplay. Small details, good acting, collectibles. I like 'em all. With the technology upgrading itself over time, we see more realistic, better looking and feeling, cinematic masterpieces more and more. Who knows what'll happen in 10 years. But this? This ain't it chief.

The feeling that makes you think: ""Damn, they really reskinned a game, put a loose-a$$ scenario on it, slapped some new textures, brought in a 'couple' of new mechanics, and you paid a lot of money for it"". This thinking never, NEVER went away during my entire playthrough! Every enemy I killed, every cutscene I watched, every new weapon I crafted, this thought NEVER, not FOR A SECOND left me. 

Companies are getting lazier and lazier. We, the consumers are getting more microtransactions (which exists in this game in a pretty annoying way as well - A SINGLE PLAYER game), more ridiculous skins that break the game's feeling / lore, more pay to win $hit, more useless, overpriced DLC's, exc... Meanwhile we get less and less good scenarios where you lose yourself, less interesting gameplays, less freshness. Generally less content for more money, if you catch my drift.

They don't give a $hit, because the community eats it up. Just like CoD and FIFA. Hell, I eat it up. Sure as $hit I'll buy FC6. Ubi, EA, Activision - it doesn't matter. They think and act like their customer base are complete fu*king idiots and are 10 yo kids. And they're right. If gaming community still supports these kinds of decisions, in some years we'll get less and less content, while they get more and more money for their sub-par products.

The exception would be its RPG/level based system which can be polarizing. I don't hate it but keep in mind that you can spend a ton of time farming resources for a weapon and upgrading it only to try another weapon and realize it has to be upgraded too for it to be viable as the enemies have scaled past it. It basically guarantees you'll only want to spend time on a few weapons and upgrades so make sure you figure out what you like the most, and quickly. I usually go with silenced weapons early since you wont be strong enough early game to take most outposts if they call in reinforcements.
The story was meh at best. The antagonists were super cringe but I actually liked the Joseph Seed angle and figuring out what happened to Hope County after the events of FC5. I definitely didnt see a few things coming that happened and it was very well done IMO. Most of your NPC guns for hire are useful when their AI isn't making them act like they just woke up from a coma at times. Sound effects are perfect; weapons feel meaty and have weight and the music is great too. The UI is terrible but that is just how Far Cry games have always been, at least from my experience. 

Overall this gets a solid 7.5/10

+ Beautiful pink color theme in game.
+ Beautiful Graphic , Environment.
+ Prosperity upgrade to unlock upgrade for your weapon's rank , Health Point , Vehicle's Rank and others.
+ Liberate Outpost , To upgrade your Prosperity you need ethanol where you get from liberated an Outpost.
+ (Animals , Weapons, and Enemies) Rank / Tier , in Far Cry 5 i could use one weapon from early game till End game but in this game you must upgrade your weapon's rank to kill higher enemies rank. And also in far cry 5 you could easily kill a bear or a byson with 3 - 4 shots shotgun in early game but again in this game , bear or byson are tier 3 animals so its pain in the ass to kill them with your Tier 1 or 2 weapons. Upgrade.
+ Only 1 Companion , i agree why ubisoft decrease the slot cause bringing two companies will make the battle too easy and will ruin your sneaking.
+ Story line , The story in far cry new dawn more light and easy to understand.
+ Final Fight , i love the final fight in this game start from you fight the twin sisters Michelle and Lou and the final you will fight the transformed Ethan. The fight is challenging and hard compare to Far Cry 5 but Thanks to Fruit's Gift power make me defeat them.
+ Perks , You could learn all perk by completing challenges like in Far Cry 5 but in this game you could upgrade some perk unlimited.
+ Weapon Upgrade , I just realize you could upgrade your Tier 4 or Master Weapon.

The game is just Far cry 5 again set in the same location with basically the same weapons, vehicles, enemies and main characters. The only differences are cosmetic in that after the apocalypse stuff got brighter so weapon skins are more colourful as is the landscape and enemies. That's it the rest. The rest is Far cry 5 featuring the adventures of Joseph Manbun dullard and two vapid antagonists who are so bland and generic they make Mr Manbun himself look interesting.

The core gameplay is fine, exploring, shooting and taking outposts are the hightlights but everything story related just sucks. Don't even bother with the final six story missions because pretty much every single one of them begin with your moronic character giving up all their weapons just so the devs can shoe horn in some stupid melee combat or dull AF stealth sections.

If it's on sale (sub $15) then maybe give it a go if you like Far cry. Because that's all it is, Far cry 5 with a paintjob and an even dumber plot.",1624879132,1624879132,False,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

the world is empty, there is almost nothing to do, and you cant even fly a plane anymore just few helicopters, enemies are bullet spunges now on higher difficulty and can kill you quite easily.

but man the worst thing has to be the 2 ""villains"" that you need to beat, and man if it wasn't because of cutscene powers, they would have been killed off multiple times during the game but nope, your character just sits there and does nothing even when you have your weapons and you could just kill them all.

New Dawn, is sadly what I figured it would be, I regret buying it in a bundle a long time ago with 5 because I never would have got it. First off, they turned it into some point system dog turd stuff, then they sell a game that is crimialy short for its price. AGAIN! If you want to think of this as a sequel to 5 then forget it exsists. If you some how enjoyed Blood Dragon (which is kinda acceptable) or far cry primal maybe you will enjoy something of the nature but it just seems insanely CLEAR to me, that these secondary games are ALWAYS just money grabs, as they just recycle map, reskin things, and throw in a diffferent setting EVERY TIME. Its disgusting. You can already have your bet that you can probably buy Far Cry 6 and it will be a good game when it comes out, what you can also BET on is its secondary game will be shit. These games if ANYTHING are worth 20 dollars. It feels like a slightly big DLC. Yet is sold as a full game. Its the same thing over and over again you know how it goes. STAY. AWAY. FROM. THESE. SECONDARY. FAR CRY. GAMES.

6/10 - No, but some elements of it were a pretty interesting fun play on what Far Cry 5 was, beyond that. SCREW THIS.

In the cutscenes even if your character it's armed with just a pistol doesn't make sense to let the (super annoying) twins keep talking sh*t and bowing to their demands... a good character even dies because this and doesn't have a impact, because it's just dumb... some characters from Far Cry 5 show up but no real impact...

Now, way worse it's the mechanics the game changes from Far Cry 5, grind and more grind to upgrade anything, and repetitive grind too, it's not the type ""look at all the things the game wants me to do"" it's just ""look the ammount of times the game wants me to the same thing over and over and over again""... and if you don't upgrade your weapons (for some reason a motocycle helmet can stop a .50 bullet and some badly equiped thugs can survive a whole magazine of 5.56 to the chest), base (to enable even more grind) and perks it's almost impossible to progress the (weak) history...
But of course you can throw real money to speed up the process of almost all of those, in the bigger picture this it's the definition of crash grab, create a problem and sell the solution... definitely not looking forward to Far Cry 6 since they said it will have some elements of this game...

So would I recommend it? That depends. If you Absolutely loved Far Cry 5, then yes. If you weren't a big fan, but still want to try it, wait and buy it when it is heavily discounted.

Honestly fk all the reviews saying the story is trash. Just skip the story and play it as an FPS. A-lot of content and super beautiful game in general.

Enemies that are ""yellow quality"" cannot be beaten by ""purple quality"" items or lower (iirc, couldn't care less about the colors). But wait! You can buy better items with real money! Some of the funniest shit ever.

Most of the blame for that is the RPG-ification of the gameplay, with enemies being turned into damage sponges if you aren't investing in higher levels of guns. It adds absolutely nothing good to the combat and is just a failed experiment to make the game more like a Borderlands type experience.

Also it's a continuation of the story of Far Cry 5, a rare example of a direct sequel in this series, but it's not really an interesting story at all. Unless you desperately want to know how a handful of the characters from FC5 are dealing with the aftermath of that games ending, this game being a follow-up is not at all a selling point.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] So, it's FarCry 5, but in the post-apocalypse. If you liked the way FarCry 5 played, then you're going to get more of the same... mostly, and it's that ""mostly"" that I start having some issues with. I really don't understand the decision to give this game a Borderlands-esque tiered weapons and enemies system. It makes no sense in a FarCry game, and on top of that it makes the entire first 3 hours or so a nightmarish slog of gathering oodles of (s)crap and ethanol to upgrade your base enough, to unlock the ability to upgrade your equipment enough, to unlock the ability to actually kill enemies. Player skill is still important, don't get me wrong, but not near as important as it was in base FC5, and that can get... problematic. That being said, everything works and after you get used to the fairly drastic change in how the game works it's not bad. I will say that a hard negative for me is the removal of weapon customization, leaving you with weapons that either have the attachment you want or they don't, and if they don't then too bad for you. I'm seriously not a fan of that decision.

[b]Aesthetic:[/b] New Dawn is a VERY colorful game, and if you're referring to a Highwaymen encampment, you can change that to [i]obscenely[/i] colorful. The overgrown areas are very vibrant, everything really looks and feels like it's gone completely back to nature, albeit an altered nature. My only real complaints are with the weapons. I'm probably in a minority on that, but to me the weapon designs are so over-the-top goofy trying to look cobbled together (in the most cartoonish sense) that if you really don't enjoy them, it can get real obnoxious, real fast. There's a lot of things like that, though, by which I mean everything from world design to soundtrack choices is a collection of things that you're either going to love or hate, with not a lot of in-between. The things I didn't like didn't keep me from playing, so obviously it's not that big an issue, although I can see where it would be for some people.

[b]Story:[/b] I doubt anybody cares, but even so I can't talk about this without spoilers, mostly because I have a short rant about the Twins that requires talking about part of their story, so I'm going to put this section under the spoiler tag. For those that don't want to know, the short and spoiler-free version is that it's pretty typical FarCry, so don't expect anything beyond that.
[spoiler]Okay, so as I said above the story is pretty typical FarCry. You are Good Guy, the Twins are Bad Guys, you go stop Bad Guys. They try to do a couple little twists here and there, but none of it really works (like finding out Nick Rye is still alive despite Carmina and Kim Rye thinking he's dead... by seeing his icon on the freaking map. *slow clap* Good job, developers) and none of it is going to shock anyone. Rush getting (repeatedly) kidnapped, having to do a bunch of circuitous nonsense, pretty par for the course. Honestly the character with the most depth and the one that's by far the most sympathetic is, ironically enough, Joseph Seed. Now for the Twins. The Twins are the primary antagonists of New Dawn: Ruthless, murderous, remorseless raiders who, unlike Joseph Seed in FC5, are never given any sort of redeeming qualities. Yet, at the end, once you've finally given them what they richly deserve, it goes into this bulls**t Intermission cutscene showing how their father was a jerk and their mother wanted better and blablabla. It's a very hamfisted attempt to humanize two characters that, up to this point, have been treated as if they were irredeemable monsters. Now, I can think of reasons why they wouldn't want the Twins to just be villains with no asterisk, no excuses, but I'd rather leave politics out of it and just blame lazy writing for having spent hours making them out to be one thing and then really poorly attempting to reverse course at the literal last minute.[/spoiler]

Great Gun For Hire system (a choice of a single NPC sidekick from a pool of about 10 that you can unlock via gameplay). The sidekicks are upgradeable via number of kills they make. Just watch the AI though, occasionally they make dumb decisions. For example, the first sidekick to join you gains the ability to throw sticks of dynamite after she's killed so many bad guys. Problem is, she'll throw dynamte at an enemy you're meleeing, and can easily kill you by accident. After I died a few times, i stopped using her.

There is a huge range of vehicles and weapons, a decent selection of sidekicks (can only use 1 at a time) and your base is upgradeable. As you upgrade the base, you can upgrade the various services in it. ie: upgrade your helipad and you can summon more powerful helicopters. upgrade your training facility and your sidekicks are more powerful and skilled when summoned to help you. upgrade your medical facilities and your medkits will apply an increasingly longer heal-over-time on you in addition to the instant heal.

The graphics are beautiful and you can take time out to sight-see, go fishing or hunting (and trade the meat and skins for materials to upgrade your base or craft ammunition), go on treasure hunts, etc. Lots of stuff to do to take a break from the occsional story mode segment.

One caveat about the game!

I picked it up on that super sale at 9 bucks and thats still pushing it. If you're going to get new dawn, wait until sale and go into this game with the attitude that its a spinoff title like blood dragon and primal so it shoudnt be held to the same standards as 3 4 and 5 

The game is basically farcry 5 with borderland type mechanics. It takes place in the exact same map after the events of 5 but a majority of the map is blocked off (I believe the game takes place in john's corner). The map is pretty, game looks stunning on super low graphics no HD textures and the performance is more stable than 5

Gameplay wise, a lot of people take the piss out of the crafting but its whatever. If you constantly loot bodies like i do in every farcry game you will barley notice the difference and new dawn actually uses this new mechanic to encourage you to seize outposts. The gunplay in new dawn is probably the best in the series too and the game encourages different playstyles and got rid of the buzzer cheesing 

But thats where the positives end in new dawn gameplay wise. The final boss fight is basically ""hope you survive bullet sponges with super powerful weapons."" I had to quit the mission for the first time in any farcry game just so I could grind for a super busted weapon to quickly take them down...I HAD TO LOOK UP A TUTORIAL WHEN I WAS PLAYING ON EASY. Thats most of the game too, at a lesser extent of course. They reworked the weapon system and gave bad guys ""tiers"" so a lot of weapons dont work on the stronger units. They also reworked the perk system so its simple and smaller, personally I saw this as a positive thing because I only play farcry games for the story and gunplay but some people didnt like this fact.

The story is pretty bad. The only thing that saves it are the parts with New Eden returning (yes you probably should play 5 before this). The idea of mad max type enemy faction was actually pretty cool but their dialog is a little cringey. They (and all the characters tbh) talk like they are out of a borderlands game or some other game that tries too hard to be edgy and funny. Maybe thats your thing but everytime an enemy called me ""chudwaffle"" or similar names I rolled my eyes a little further back into my skull (dont even get me started on the more outragious character dialog). The worst characters were the main bad guys called ""the twins."" I cant really describe to you how annoying they are but what makes it worse is there's pretty much no story elaboration to them other than ""we're assholes because our dad was an asshole."" Its also kind of hard to feel anything for the good guys too because the game doesnt really elaborate on anything. 

Another small thing that really pisses me off is the lack of an interesting protagonist. I really hope in farcry 6 we get a real talking protagonist again. Just like in 5, you create this generic NPC looking character and do whatever others tell you to do. The only difference is I actually felt something for the other characters in 5. In new dawn, since the story doesnt have any interesting motives behind anyone you dont really feel immersed, which is a damn shame.

However, Its still a fun little game to play through if you treat it as a standalone DLC or a spinoff rather than a full farcry game. The gameplay mechanics feel much more improved over 5 and the missions, even though there are less than 5, are all super unique and mostly fun and its neat seeing New Eden at a different angle

If you enjoyed 5 youll probably enjoy new dawn. Just dont keep your standards too high and youll have fun, but do youself a favor and dont settle for getting it above 10 bucks.

Far Cry: New Dawn is a game that excels in some areas and utterly fails in others. It addresses some of Far Cry 5's issues but creates new ones as well. It's very grindy and intent on making you use microtransactions to gain an edge against your enemies (I would strongly recommend not buying into them, though). At the core of this bizarre mashup of Borderlands, Fallout, and Far Cry is an entertaining open world FPS buried by questionable development choices.

Taking place 17 years after the...""conversation-starting"" Resist Ending of Far Cry 5, Hope County has been reduced to a nuclear wasteland. You play as the security captain of a nationwide militia arriving to help with the rebuilding effort. However, your train is ambushed by the Highwaymen, an anarchist group dedicated to looting settlements for their own gain. Cut off from your team, your character allies with the citizens of Sanctuary and New Eden to drive out the Highwaymen once and for all.

The greatest strengths of Far Cry games are their charismatic villains and their engrossing environments. New Dawn lacks both of these. The main villains of ND have no defining philosophy beyond ""we get to take your stuff,"" and the map is just recycled from Far Cry 5. Some characters from FC5 return, but they're either reduced to minor roles (Grace, Father Jerome, The Deputy) or limited to references in journal entries (Tracy, Nadine). Fan favorites like Jess Black aren't even referenced at any point. Even Joseph Seed is made underwhelming in this game! It's disappointing how Far Cry 5's compelling cast of varied characters got shafted in favor of an unimpressive new cast. As for the environments, expedition missions to cool areas like a beached frigate and an airplane crash in the woods add some variety, but they're fairly limited overall.

Combat in New Dawn takes on an RPG-like approach, where enemies have different levels and health values. Weapons have ranks that determine their damage and, more importantly, how resistant enemies are to them. Lower-level guns are made useless against high-level enemies, forcing you to grind for better equipment. You can't customize guns here, but New Dawn does a good job of making FC5's collection of weapons feel unique. New attachments like bayonets are equipped to some weapons. Existing attachments get a more improvised appearance, like oil cans taking the place of silencers. The weapons also look heavily maintained and feel fitting for a post-apocalyptic environment. 

There are also some fun and ridiculous abilities you get over the course of the game, like double-jumping and going into a berserker mode to deal more damage. Knife takedowns also make a grisly return, though they are much slower than they were in previous games. It's tough to chain takedowns when your character takes so much time performing a single knife execution. On the bright side, bayonet takedowns exist and go quicker than normal ones.

Getting new guns/vehicles and upgrading the installations at Sanctuary require you to find and scavenge resources. You can do this by hunting, raiding Highwayman supply drops, and replaying outpost missions with stronger opponents. This can require a LOT of grinding to get through. Naturally, Ubisoft hands you a small amount of microtransaction coins here and there to tempt you into buying your way to victory. The microtranscations here are more prevalent than they were in Far Cry 5 (which mostly purchased outfits and weapon reskins), and the way they're promoted feels sleazy.

Far Cry 5 had a fantastic soundtrack. so topping it would be a near-impossible task. New Dawn has some good tracks (like its main theme and the map menu music), but its soundtrack is mostly forgettable. It's nice that the Highwaymen have their own songs to set them apart from FC5's cult, at least.

Would I recommend Far Cry: New Dawn by itself? No. However, there are mods that remove the damage resistances and other grind-encouraging mechanics to make the game more enjoyable. I would personally recommend the Scavenger Mod and the Improved Weapons mod (bundled with the Unreleased Variety mod) to make lower-level guns viable and unlock content that wasn't made available. These mods bring it close to the fun, frantic action of Far Cry 5, and turn its RPG elements into less of a chore and more of an enhancement to the overall experience.

Overall, Far Cry: New Dawn feels like a wasted opportunity. We could have had a full-blown Vietnam War DLC instead of this half-baked continuation of Far Cry 5's story. Weak villains and greedy design choices bog down the fun gameplay of the franchise in this spin-off. If you still want to play it, I would wait until it is at least 50% off on sale, and I would install the previously mentioned mods to get around its less-than-fun enemy damage resistances.",1621544065,1622502239,False,60,1,0.809092938899993896,7,True,False,False

The weapons are garbage, animals take too many hits.  Everything has health bars and levels so if you happen across a higher level enemy than your guns you'll have a bad time. On screen damage numbers popping up.

Base building and resource farming is neccesary. Starting guns all trash, stay trash. You don‚Äôt stick new parts on them, you get a level 2 gun that‚Äôs better and so on.

The boar, Horatio, is so hilarious, charging and throwing enemies a few meters away.
Timber suprised me one time, I sent him to kill and enemy and he decided to troll the target and steal his weapon and bring it back to me. Good puppy.
Can't understand why some players hyped up The Judge. It's quite the journey to add him to your roster and imma be honest, he ain't that great. 
The story itself is decent, there's some Bliss sections included but I honestly didn't find myself hating it.
The twins are quite the annoying villains, exactly because they have no philosophy and they just gun and steal everyone and everything, because they want to and they can. It's just a cold hard reality inspired situation, people don't need some deep ""glorious"" (for lack of a better word) reason to do bad things.

[b]Gameplay 7/10[/b] - 
So there is this new system which weapons and enemies have ranks, if you use a low tier weapon you can unload a LMG on a guy with a motorcycle gear, and he won't die, but if you use a higher tier weapon on a lower tier opponent it will deal extra damage.

[b]Story 4/10[/b] ‚Äî Now the story has a lot of potential, but isn't well explored in the game, the main characters are forgivable, and you hardly can feel something for then.

Not Pro or Con
* Story

Cons
- Bad optimization
- Stuttering.
- It takes long to kill or is impossible to kill enemies/animals if you have too low level weapons unlike in Far Cry 5.
- Shooting to body does more damage than to head on many enemies.
- Sometimes you have to do same outpost 5 times if you want complete outfit set.

First things first I always like when video games are connected to one another and Far Cry New Dawn is a sequel to Far Cry 5 witch I like a lot. So the game the game is set in a apocalypse world but not the usual destroyed and abandoned looking like in most of the post apocalyptic movies but this one is very bright colored and fun looking and it gives of a very strong Mad Max vibe. As in FC 5 the protagonist doesn't talk at all witch again for me is a massive con. Other than that the game is identical to FC 5 apart from the world and story witch is decent but nothing special. It took me only 15 hours to complete witch is a very short amount of time even though I'm a very slow gamer and I tend to do things slowly. After completing the story Far Cry New Dawn still had some content to offer but honestly I didn't enjoy the game that much. It's a cool game but a one that I'm going to play again after a year or two.
So this is how I'm going to rate the game.

They decided to go with more of an RPG system with this game, in that you encounter different levels of enemies.  This requires you to get better and better equipment in order to do significant damage to them.  You also get to build up your home base to improve your character, equipment and companions.  Unfortunately, this means Ubisoft decided to become more heavyhanded with the pay-to-win currency, though I never needed to use any of it to get what I wanted.  I didn't have to grind everything too much either, so you can easily ignore this feature.  

In addition to the RPG mechanics, they have some new side tasks such as Expeditions.  These involve finding a package and carrying it to the extraction point, and they take place in various cool settings that aren't related to the main map.  I liked these quests quite a bit, and they were a great way to complete weapon and companion perk challenges. 

As for companions, they are mostly good.  Both of the animal companions are better compared to Far Cry 5, because Horatio the Boar is a lot sturdier than Cheeseburger and can wreak some serious havoc.  Timber has similar abilities to Boomer, though he can also get rid of guard dogs for you and he doesn't seem to die as easily.  Most of the human companions work well, especially Nana the sniper and Gina who kills everyone once she levels up a bit, though you also have duds like the Pastor who sets EVERYTHING on fire *ugh*.  

Like Blood Dragon, New Dawn is a ""spinoff"" from the main games so it gives you a smaller map and there aren't as many quests.  However, enemies still spawn after the game ends (unlike Far Cry 5) and you can retake Outposts which become more difficult each time you do so for more of a challenge.  In fact, it's essential that you do this at least a few times if you want to fully upgrade your home base.  

While I had a great time playing this game, the weakest part was its story.  The main villains weren't very threatening and are probably the least interesting that I've encountered in a Far Cry game. They get some back story at the last minute to affect what you decide to do at the end, but too little too late.  The final fights weren't that fun, either, since the bosses were bullet sponges even if you used elite weapons.  I did enjoy some parts, such my encounters with various people from 5, and it was nice to have some closure after what happened in that game.

Overall, I'd say this is worth playing if you've already finished 5 and want to see what happens next.  I wouldn't bother with it otherwise.",1621726032,1621726032,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Far Cry New Dawn is a direct sequel to Far Cry 5, so make sure you check that game out first! Its the first game in the series to be a sequel to a previous instalment, adding a very special feeling to re-discovering areas of the map. The Story is actually pretty good, Graphics are great and Gameplay has received much love from the Devs at Ubisoft.
The Story starts you off as 'The Captain', again like in Far Cry 5 its an unnamed character who has no personality. Please don't make this a thing Ubisoft! Characters are given feelings and opinions when they have a voice and makes playing them a lot more interesting. Anyway, the antagonists are really good, almost as enjoyable as Vaas, as they are well built and their motives are clearly laid out in front of them. Throughout the story you meet characters met in Far Cry 5, who will help you on your quests. Very Enjoyable, probably the best since Far Cry 3.
Graphics are great, very similar to Far Cry 5 with addition to some minor upgrades that make the world feel brighter and alive.
This game has received a lot of Quality of Life changes I hope future games add as well. Health bars for enemies, enemy tiers, re-taking outposts for higher rewards, base upgrades, weapon upgrades, weapon tiers, improved buddy system, utilities crafting, medkit crafting and much, much more. All of which make the game a lot more enjoyable, and make you think how did you survive without this in previous games?
Overall, Far Cry New Dawn is a very enjoyable, well written and fun game to play. All the new features and improvements make it feel like the most comfortable game to play, with all the improvements hopefully carrying on to future games.
Far Cry New Dawn gets an 8/10.

There are no apocalyptic wastelands here, the world is actually prettier than ever and the gameplay barely acknowledges the post-apocalyptic themes. Yes, you no longer have money and instead, you need to gather resources to craft things, and on paper that sounds good, but those resources become extremely abundant once you have good enough weapons and perks for easily clearing out outposts and completing expeditions. You don‚Äôt even need to hunt animals for upgrades like you had to in Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4. My point is that this game is pretty much Far Cry 5 again, but with a new coat of paint, pink paint specifically. (Some aspects are actually worse than in that game, like how this time special takedowns are needlessly hard to execute because of their new and lengthier animations. (Well, at least they look pretty good)) Don‚Äôt get me wrong, that‚Äôs not inherently a bad thing, if you enjoyed Far Cry 5, you‚Äôll definitely enjoy this game too, but don‚Äôt expect much new from it. Even the level system that was added to this game because apparently, that‚Äôs something Ubisoft thinks every game absolutely must have now doesn‚Äôt change much. It just means some enemies will be bullet spongy until you unlock weapons that match their level, then they pretty much become average Far Cry enemies again. You might have noticed I haven‚Äôt mentioned anything about the story yet, that‚Äôs because there is not much to say about it. Most of it just feels like an excuse for you to shoot bad guys. Almost nothing about it is memorable, not even the main villains, which are usually the highlight of any Far Cry game.
Again, if you enjoy the gameplay loop of a post-FC3 Far Cry game, you‚Äôll probably enjoy this game too. Just don‚Äôt ever buy this game at full price. It is just not worth that given it feels more like a Far Cry 5 DLC than a proper new Far Cry game.",1621373668,1621373778,True,8,0,0.586171448230743408,0,True,False,False

but i really hate the silver credits its just wrong and yet when you need perks complete challenges and when you completed 1 your buying crafting stuff to fill your amo again -_- fuck that i use my cheats. 
- dialog sucks
- the way they say it its just not good enough for me a fuck to give
- NPC suuuucks when playing on the hardest of all you die faster because you try to save them and if you dont your a rat in a trap being overwelmed good job ubishit
- the option to disable random talk from npc isnt a option (got to count my lucky stars) I PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE THEN YOU SHE BIRDS FOR A CHANGE!
- and all the characters are just so f u c k i n g boring to look at in EVERY ubisoft game except animals 
- when i had a ubisoft server issue i could not play offline instead write my info and says connecting...MOTHER FUCKER I SAID GO OFFLINE! and fails to play offline Thanks for your potato servers
- a specific shotgun required a skin thats only possible to get when entering 90% of the game finished because its only possible to get at a locked area So ubisoft do you really think in 5 and this game i would spend a little bit of money for that item i want? fuck no i cheat to get it i aint going to let this game force me to do it .I. .I. you!
+ they say female dont sale to good well i still havnt forgotten these words But they did give a option to chose from However if ubisoft made them on both genders appealing enough instead those wtf lame etc looking you didnt had to add those fucking silver currency unless your too obsessed with money you let us pay for the cosmetics or looking.... im going too far in this but still it took me a while to decide what to write and the more i know the less i like on this game buy at your own opinion but its just common drama and its not making you feel motivated to follow up with it all its the same thing and it sucks ass",1621170864,1621170864,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The map is very small, there are only a handful of outposts. You can't even customize your weapons! There are also too many interlinked prerequisites for upgrading anything. Which means you are forced to upgrade one thing before you can upgrade what you actually wanted to upgrade. All this really limits your free choice.

I completed the game in 23 hours, but often the gameplay was very frustrating. Enemies knocking you to the ground when you try to hit them, 'Epic' creatures roaming around in nature which are almost impossible to kill UNLESS you have superb gear. And once you kill it, it just respawns as if nothing happened. And don't even get me started on the ridiculously frustrating and unrealistic 'boss' fights...

I really prefer the more 'realistic' gameplay of Far Cry 3 and 4, without the damn health bars and hitpoints that fly around as you hit things. I understand it's a game but now it looks like you're playing one of those MMORPGs. It just takes out the immersiveness.

I have to admit, had this game not correlated with Far Cry 5; I surely would not have appreciated it as much. The plot was intriguing but the character development was lacking. 
Then there was the end of the story... I had such high hopes for the conclusion, but feel I was wishing for more. I finished the final mission only to find there was little conclusion at all.

Don't waste your money even on special. This game is boring AF!!!! And FarCry Montreal les tabernaks are up to the same crap with their AI, even on the easiest mode. YES, you will be detected through rocks and trees from a million miles away. YES, enemies will dodge bullets when you snipe them and they have no clue. It's like the AI know as soon as you shoot, to have the enemies duck out of the way, and do all kinds of shit.

Also, the story line is just not doing it for me.... Clueless to where you have to go. You try to track your mission only for the mission points not even showing up on your map. Hmmm let's track this mission/go to map/ nothing.... 

Just another useless DLC that does not give the prequel any justice, it's actually a slap to the face. 

Do yourself a favour and just play FarCry 5 and leave it at that.

I would not say this game is worth $40, I got it on sale, and I have about 2 hours of game play per dollar I spent. I have 100% completed this game, challenges and all. Has some major flaws, but it's not a full game. Short review: 6.5/10, But not damnable. I recommend it b/c it is fun, It just missed the mark in a few areas. And, tbh, I would play through this game again with a friend or even for fun. It's simple FarCry fun. With that being said, If you like FarCry, buy this on sale, you won't regret it. Also, SPOILERS.

Things I liked:
-Has a ""better"" ending than FarCry 5. (Albeit debatable.)
-Concludes FarCry 5's story line. 
-Visually appealing 
-Tried something new. (Although most of these changes I would be happy if they NEVER came to light again.
-TIMBER. (And car rides with him.)

Things I had mixed feelings about:
-Antagonists: Mickie and Lou are very, very bland for FarCry villains. Honestly, they get a 6/10. 
-Joseph helps you, and doesn't act like he did in FarCry 5. Both in a good way and in a bad way.
-Leveling: Leveling is SUPER easy. Playing as I did will result in max stats and gear halfway through.
-Looting: There are two situations you run into regarding loot. A.) Ah shit... I have no materials. Or B.) Having 
  so much loot, you don't know what to do with it.
-Sheer grind for 100%: There are several things a ""completion-ist"" would want to do to feel like he/she 
  100%'ed the game. It's almost agonizing. 
-Hope county?: I understand that several nuclear bombs went off, but other than a few locations, it didn't 
  feel like Hope County. Might be just me.
- FUCKING PINK!: I'm sorry, but when does radiation = pink? I get it, its different and all that, but it feels off.
- Those who had a serious role in FarCry 5 are tossed aside, while side characters in FarCry 5 become main 
   characters in this game. (Not going to go into detail because spoilers... if you care.)
-Absent Characters. (Jess Black, Cheeseburger, Peaches, Adeline Drubman, etc.) Some characters are 
  revealed to be dead, but some are unexplained or flat-out missing in this game. 

Things I didn't like/hated:
-Guns: Crafting weapons is way, way, way to costly. 123 titanium for a pistol? That doesn't even 
  make any sense. Also, some weapons are vastly superior to others. Bows are better than .50 sniper riflers in 
  this game, due to the armor mechanics. 
-Armor: Your enemies have armor now. So, some can take a bullet/arrow to the face and still keep fighting. 
 Some helmets may save your life depending on the distance, caliber, etc; but a normal helmet shouldn't save 
  your life from a .50 Caliber BMG to the face from like 100yds away. Sorry... YOUR DEAD. Also, Bows are 
 somehow able to go through chest-plates with ease, but helmets only shatter from arrows. What gives?
-Enemy ranks/gear ranks: So, you have four ranks. Common, Uncommon, Legendary, and Elite. Self 
  Explanatory. But, elite enemies and to a certain degree, Legendary enemies, are perhaps a little too strong 
  in my opinion. Not saying they're too hard to kill, but an average person in motocross gear should normally 
  die from a few rounds from an MG42 at close range... Especially if some of those rounds fired are 
  headshots...  
-Guns/Fangs/Bows for Hire: My god. They FUCKED Guns for hire in this game... All of these characters have 
  three tiers, they all need 40 kills to reach the third tier. Also, sometimes they just stop moving or have fits 
  of confusion for no reason. My guess, their path-finding ability is all fucked up... Only three are worth using. 
  
  -Pastor Jerome has a shotgun, and throws Molotovs. In concept, this sounds good, but he shoots his 
    shotgun from too far away to do any real damage, and I've seen him kill himself with his own molotovs. 
    1/10. 
   -Carmina Rye has an Ar, and throws dynamite. She can't aim worth shit. She gets to throw three sticks of 
     dynamite at her third tier.  2/10. Only because I haven't seen her killing herself with her own dynamite.
     Wouldn't be surprised though... 
   -Gina is fucking awesome. She swings her MG42 like a baseball bat in stealth mode, and is accurate with 
     her LMG when detected. Also, she gets infinite ammo, and explosive ammo when she reaches third tier 
     Seriously, my third favorite Gun for Hire in this game. 9/10
   -Nana is the best human Gun for Hire in this game. She's quiet, and she's lethal. 2nd tier grants her the 
    ability to see through smoke. And her 3rd tier allows her shots to NEGATE COVER. THIS GRANNY GETS 
    WALL-HACKS BRO. 10/10
   -The Judge, is disappointing. He/She gets a bow. He/She has difficulty when detected or dealing with high
    ranking enemies. He/She gives immunity to wildlife in the 2nd tier. And Tri-shot in the 3rd tier. He/She is 
    limited in range, and sometimes only destroys armor, setting off alarms. EXTREMELY ANNOYING TO WORK 
    WITH AT TIMES. However, his/her tri-shot does allow him/her to kill higher ranking enemies. He/She is still 
    fucked if they're detected. 5/10.
   -Hurk: OH HURK... You actually made me laugh in this game, yet you're so shit... Hurk gets a MAC-10 and a 
    rocket Launcher. He can't aim worth shit, and he takes forever killing individual targets. He has no stealth 
    mode, just balls-to-the-wall loud. He gets faster reloads on his 2nd tier, and vehicle tracking on his 3rd tier. 
    Just as fucking useless and is as bad as Pastor Jerome. But, his only saving grace is vehicular 
    destruction. 4/10.
   -Timber is the best Guns/Fangs for Hire in this game. Not very good at killing, but TIMBER SEES
    EVERYTHING. Enemies, friendlies, loot, guns, materials, the list goes on. Also, he will take the 
    attention of animals when you're fighting them in the third tier. Super useful Albeit not very lethal. Timber 
    is a truly good boy. 10/10. Also he can sit in the car with you. THX UBISOFT. 
   -Lastly, Horatio. Horatio is the CHEAPEST Fangs for Hire/Guns for Hire character EVER CREATED. Horatio 
    can SELF REVIVE at his 2nd tier. Literally, just send him in a compound, and just wait, he'll get it done. And 
    his 3rd tier allows him to destroy anything in his way. Literally the god of destruction. However, Timber is 
    still better because Timber isn't an OP piece of shit unlike Horatio. 7/10, only for being so damn OP. 

-Silent Protagonist. 
-Forgettable Characters. 
-Short story. There are 22 missions total in this game. If I wanted to beat the game as fast as possible, I'd 
  imagine it'd take no more than 10 hours; 15 hours tops. 
-Expeditions: They only exist to pad the lack of content, get more resources, and make it ever so slightly 
  harder to 100% this game. I get the appeal, but I don't like it. 
-Upgradable perks: Some perks are able to be upgraded, stacking the effectiveness of the perk. But, this 
  could allow someone to max out a perk like ammo holding, which allows them to carry upwards of 
  thousands of rounds of ammo at once. 
-""God perks"": Once you reach a certain point in the game, you get special powers such as a double jump, a 
  sneak ability, a rage ability, and a take-down that replenishes energy for the other abilities and replenishes 
  health. Making the game even MORE easier. 
-Not being able to modify/kit out you weapons: You can't choose attachments in this game, you're stuck 
  with what the game gives you. It's not bad, but its not great either. I enjoyed the freedom of customization. 
  (although some customizations in FarCry 5 were absurd. I.E. Suppressors on belt-fed machine guns.)



That's it, that's my in-depth analysis review of this game. I would say if you enjoy FarCry games, or you want to know how this story ends, get the game and play it. At least you'll get to see how it ends. Otherwise, I feel like this game was decent for its price. But nothing more than decent.

This review is written by someone who has owned and played every single Farcry game.

Usually, when I play a Farcry game, I enjoy the fact that my actions (the rare times where you can decide the fate of the game, usually by killing/sparing an enemy) actually mean something. 

I've played 3, 4, 5, then New Dawn in that order on Steam since I played 1, 2, and Primal on console. 

This was the first time that I've felt like my decisions were completely meaningless. For example, [spoiler]When you get to decide whether or not Mickey dies, it literally does not matter a single micron whether you kill her or not. She never comes back to either haunt/amend her ways. She doesn't sick her Highwaymen at you. Nothing. Only positive to killing her is you get to loot her body. WTF?[/spoiler]

In all the other games, ESPECIALLY 4, I loved how my decisions actually effected the world, and I believe this is one of the key ingredients in what makes Farcry, Farcry. I don't know about others, but this game truly did not feel like a Farcry game. 

If you love Farcry for solely the gameplay, wait for a sale. The weapon system is super fun imo, and unlike 5, hunting actually has somewhat of a significance again! Wait for a sale and then pick it up; TRUST ME. 

If you love Farcry for the story, I'd suggest just watching TheRadBrad or some other Youtuber on their channels. Even on sale, if you just want it for the story, I really don't think the game is worth it.

I was fortunate enough to get the $130 bundle of both 5 and New Dawn's deluxe editions for $20, and I think Farcry sales are quite common.",1619637667,1619637667,False,21,0,0.657411932945251465,0,True,False,False

It didn't take me long to realize this game is bad. There are a multitude of problems with the game that I will list; The characters aren't interesting, the antagonists and story line are both very stereotypical, all the car music sounds bad, the cult outposts don't have scenes when they are liberated, the amount of detail given is sometimes too much or too little in quests, the amount of guns and vehicles is depressingly low, the map size is tiny in comparison to Far Cry 5, you aren't allowed to do whatever you want (punching NPCs), the 'action' scenes are mediocre at best, the game doesn't work well with Co-Op, some missions are too direct and don't give player freedom, the characters are badly written and are hard to remember, there is a currency system that allows you to bypass playing the game to progress (like VBucks and the Battle Pass in Fortnite), there's a ranking system for items to stop people from progressing instead of adding natural progression, and the controls are sloppy.

Here are some good things: the graphics are nice, some of the guns and vehicles look cool, the environment feels great, the damage numbers and health bars are a good quality of life, and the crafting system is cool.
This game is the tiny corner of the shadow that Far Cry 5 makes. This game feels like a nostalgic money grab to me. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. I don't know if they're still updating this game, but, Ubisoft, this game is bad. Oh yeah, also the DLCs are bad.

AI is no longer dumb as a rock, companions are no longer completely useless, they can drive well, they can actually aim now and fight and save you from crappy situations, enemies finally seem to have brains and predators attack on sight, don't just pass by ignoring you. Graphically, it's beautiful and I haven't encountered bugs and glitches. I like the weapon crafting system and the guns. Main storyline finally blends in with the rest of the game, it's not only a bunch of cinematics and forced missions that felt completely out of place and cut from a different game like in FC5. Exploration is good, puzzles are fun, more RPG-like and I like how they made the perk and base building systems, although it's not really base building, it's more like a parallel perk system.

Raw Ubisoft right there 11/10

But seriously, this game is far worse than Far Cry 5. It feels like they took far cry 5 and tacked on one of those early access zombie survival games, remove all that was good about far cry 5 (like gun customizations) and then added more micro transactions and tried to make them more present than in FC5. This feels more like a crappy mobile knock off than an actual far cry game.
I will say that the sounds of gun fire and the planes sound really good but that‚Äôs really all I can think of right now.
If you‚Äôre thinking about whether to get this or far cry 5, get FC5 instead.
As for the bundle, that‚Äôs what I did and I do have regrets. Maybe you won‚Äôt, I for one have never been a huge fan of far cry but 5 was the first one I genuinely enjoyed. This one on the other hand, not so much. Oh, and on top of that, FC5 not only looks much better but also runs smoother. Make of that what you will.

Gameplay wise, I haven't had too much of an experience but what I have had I haven't had the best time with. Guns seem too weak, there is no option that I have found to customize weapons like 5, and the landscape just seems like an infinite forest with almost no buildings, while in 5, in the same county, albeit with a nuke or two to the face, had buildings everywhere, and nowhere just felt like an overly forested forest. Also, four hours in, I met a bug that erased my save and sent me back to the train. Then it happened again while I was getting ready to restart my progress. 
Now for performance. I have played through 5 with very few issues for a relatively poor quality computer, but with New Dawn the issues I had were multiplied tenfold. At random moments in the game, I received frame drops to sub-20 from around 50-60 fps. This is probably due to my computer being bad, but it ran 5 just fine with a couple drops for a minute or two.

Don't buy this short, disappointing FC5 DLC cash grab at full price. It's so difficult to find what's good about the game, other than the fact that you get a half-a$$ed story continuation of FC5. Everything else is just an ugly trimmed reskin of FC5 with a wide variety of idiotic design decisions. The worst bit is the cringeworthy antagonists. Instead of having charisma and persuasion, the villains here are simple dumb insecure bandits who will start a brawl for no reason. If you compare them to their predecessors, these guys used to have some class, they used to interact with the player: Vaas in FC3 was all like ""Jason, do you know the definition of insanity?"", Pagan in FC4 - ""Sorry Ajay, gotta pick up this call, we'll grant your mother's last wish afterwards"", Joseph in FC5 - ""You're my family now, we'll step into new Eden together"". How do the girls in New Dawn behave? Along the lines of ""Ya a problem-maker ya punk muvufuka ya're ma b1tch nao! Imma kill ya right here ya sucka! Howya like ma gun in ya face b1atch? We gon' destroy you, ya family and ya home fool"". And all the while some experimental gangsta hip-hop is blasting through their trucks' speakers. Like what the hell is all this ghetto $#!t? They seriously want me to believe that these two little badmouthed children got the respect and utmost devotion of grown-a$$ people around Hope County by talking smack and are now leading a bandit gang? Get the f*ck outta here. If I wanted to deal with ghetto gangsters I'd play GTA, and they'd at least look a lot cooler and make more sense than the Highwaymen gang. Maybe it's time Ubisoft rethought their villain formula cause New Dawn feels like beating a dead horse.

The antagonist disaster aside, I really couldn't stand the pink/purple color scheme. The nature has taken back the land and flowers are growing everywhere, but it's completely unnatural and looks more like somebody's dream. You've probably seen some derelict places in your life overgrown with vegetation, so you know there might be a flower here and there, but not everywhere. Here though every inch of Hope County seems to have been covered by artificial-looking purple plants which don't lose their color even when you torch the whole flower field. Ugh.

Having been let down by the aforementioned design decisions I thought about what fun could be had here, and I always used to find outposts fun. Not anymore: enemies are segregated into toughness levels, as are cars, weapons, animals, etc. If you have a gun that's a level lower than the enemy you're facing, no dice - your gun is a total nerf gun and you're gonna get trampled. I needed FIFTEEN C4 explosives to take down a level 3 cougar. Fifteen. When the enemy is human, you could do a takedown but that again requires a different expensive perk to be unlocked for each toughness level, otherwise you'll creep up behind somebody only to be shown a prompt you can't perform a takedown on this enemy yet. So the stealth part is barely functional until you level up yourself and your gear. How do you level up your gear? By guzzling ethanol, lots and lots of it. Apparently ethanol is a great source for weapon, vehicle, gardening, settlement upgrades - an all-around miracle substance. I don't even... When you finally upgrade and get to craft new stuff, you'll find out that you can't customize anything. That means no extended mags, no silencer attachments, no car accessories, no nothing. You can only use presets which don't let you make the cool gear combinations you used to create in FC5.

I could go on and on about the drawbacks but what's the point.... I think the only fun thing to do might be exploration, because if you've played FC5 it could be pretty fun to see a place and realize you've been here, only 17 years ago, and look at how it's changed. But this again feels like a cheap cash grab which would have been better off as a DLC for FC5 than a new standalone game, and while a tiny bit of fun can be had, the majority of the game is a chore.

I've played Far Cry 3, 4, and 5 (All of which I really enjoyed). But this is hands down the worst Far Cry game in the series. This is nothing more than a half baked Far Cry 5 DLC that barely delivers on the Far Cry experience. The story sucks, the characters are bland and forgettable, and the game just straight up doesn't feel finished at all.
You see constantly recycled assets within 2 hours of play, It runs like shit (I have decent hardware but FPS fluctuates anywhere from 30-80fps, it's wildly inconsistent), and the game at times just feels completely unfair due to the new enemy level system that is just total garbage, legendary animals are effectively omnipotent and take literal tonnes of explosives or thousands of bullets to kill, and level 3 or higher enemies are just bullet sponges.
Having any companion besides the dog will make the game unstealthable due to bad pathing. 
But the icing on the cake is that the game requires you to be online to play it and they've introduced ""Far Cry Coins"" (You can probably guess what this means...), the coins are attainable in-game, but there is definitely a push for you to pay IRL money for more Far Cry Coins.
I've never raged at a game so much before, and it bothers me more for the fact that they had the perfect recipe with Far Cry, it may feel rinse repeat at times but it was still a fun experience, but they've ruined it with New Dawn, and if Far Cry 6 is anything like this, then I will absolutely not be playing it.",1618186220,1618186528,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In this your go to a camp and clear it out after which they radio you to go to them since they are inside the house. They ask you to leave your weapons, which the MC does as the dumbass he is even though the outcome can be seen from a mile away. After that you go to them, of course get pinned down and watch your friend die...  then they kick you out. [/spoiler]

The bit above is a bit of a rant, however in comparison to prior games in which I liked the villian this is just something I am quite dissapointed by in this game.

The other part I do not want to see explorer in future instalments is the RPG mechcanics they included. While it might be new and refreshing in the beginning it will get old quite fast when you run into enemies for which you need to shoot a gun store worth of bullets to kill. Perhaps fine for the odd side game, but I can do without it in the mainline games.

In this game you also have a base improving mechanic. For this you would need resources which you can get in the open world. No all that exiting honestly, but it's fun to see your base grow so it's quite inoffensive.

As mentioned in the beginning I like how this game takes place in the prior Far Cry 5. There are even some spots in the game where you can see a more clear comparison between the two through old photo's. The current state of the world does give a mixed feel though, while it's still nice to look at it feels smaller then the prior installment which is a shame.

The gunplay feels solid like usual and it sports a nice selection of odd weapons which can spice up the gameplay. That being said, as mentioned with the RPG mechanics it suffers a bit because of the amount of shooting you need to do for some enemies just to down them which is a shame in my opinion.

To summarize, while the game does have it's good points I do not recommend it. Primarly because it's not the direction I want this franchise to go to. While it might work for some other games I do think this franchise has it's own strengths it should rather focus on.",1618041781,1618041781,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is pretty bad but at least it gives you a satisfying ending to FC5 when FC5 really only had bad endings. In terms of gameplay, they add a lot to the base FC5 gameplay with expeditions and tier-ed outposts which are welcome additions. The only gameplay hiccup would be some bullet sponge enemies and the removal of weapon customization, which even though was really just to add silencers to guns, seems like it would fit in this game much better than any other Far Cry game because of the theme. Speaking of the theme, the post-apocalypticness of the game is at a bare minimum and seems to just be there to sell scrap as micro-transactions. Just like with FC Primal and the ice age setting, the idea of a post apocalyptic theme isn't expanded upon and is just a cosmetic thing. I guess they do have you ""building"" weapons out of scrap you find in the world, but I never had to look for specific materials because I had plenty from just looting things as I went.

The additions of this game really add to the Far Cry formula and would love to see them expanded upon in FC6, like the base upgrading and expeditions, but the crappy story and lack of ambition keeps the game at an 8/10, which is what I gave FC5.",1617665128,1617665128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]{Story and overview} [/h1]

[b] Far Cry New Dawn takes place 17-years after the events of Far Cry 5. (If you haven‚Äôt played Far Cry 5 please don‚Äôt reveal the next sentence, I don‚Äôt wanna spoil and ruin it for ya)  [spoiler] That means that this world has been through a global nuclear apocalypse. [/spoiler] Far Cry New Dawn picks up in a now post-apocalyptic version of Hope County, once controlled by the Seed family, led by ‚ÄúThe Father‚Äù, Joseph Seed. You have a choice at the start of the game, which is a personal choice and doesn‚Äôt effect the story, to be either a man or a woman, regardless of the character that you pick at the start of the game, you‚Äôll be fighting for the survivors of Prosperity.  Prosperity is the name of the encampment where the survivors have set-up their home base. However Joseph Seed is not the antagonist in the game, New Dawn‚Äôs villains are a pair of teens who run a gang called the Highwaymen, the twins Mickey and Lou, which are the main villians and just feel like nothing more than arrogant, foul-mouthed thugs who‚Äôve managed to murder their way up to the top of the food chain.
A lot of the new features of Far Cry 5 carry over into New Dawn, but there are also some new ones as well. With some returning faces from the previous game and some entirely new ones.  The Outpost system of clearing out enemy encampments as a major part of the game is still present but the way that these encounters function has been tweaked for the better.  There‚Äôs still a robust system of perks to unlock, items to craft, animals to hunt, and all the great progression and reasons that push you to explore the open world of Hope County that Far Cry 5 had. The new stuff you can expect in New Dawn are almost all changes for the better or additions to the formula. Crafting is expanded upon with rare materials that can only be found on Expeditions.  Outposts can now be recycled and escalated to tougher versions.  Each time you beat an outpost it will be outfitted with more powerful enemies, more alarms, and you‚Äôll get better rewards for completing it. While we are talking about outfitted, every time you beat a outpost you‚Äôll be rewarded with part of an outfit which can also be acquired with far cry credits(the premium in-game currency, which can be purchased[with real cash] or found in the world of Hope County) While enjoyable at first, most of these expeditions are nothing more than sneak into a location, steal package and escape which grew tiresome quickly. Expeditions can be played alone or in co-op, and I‚Äôd highly recommend the latter as it‚Äôs a far more enjoyable and rewarding experience. If there‚Äôs one downside to Far Cry New Dawn, it‚Äôs that it does feel a little on the short side when it comes to main campaign.  There are only around 20 main story missions and if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre coming to the game for explicitly, the party could be over pretty quickly.  However, there really is a ton of other stuff to do in the game. There are 30 different outposts, 8 official side missions, 5 specialists to uncover, 10 treasure hunts to go on, and over a hundred challenges and collectibles to uncover. 
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people saying it should‚Äôve been a dlc, but i don‚Äôt see it like that , being a direct sequel to Far Cry 5, New Dawn ties up the loose ends of the story from the previous game and gives you a look at what happened to the world after the events of the last game.  It‚Äôs way too big to be considered an expansion and it‚Äôs too small to warrant a full-priced release. I recommend playing Far Cry 5, you obviously won‚Äôt know returning characters and there‚Äôs a major plot line that depends on you knowing what happened in Far Cry 5.  [/b]

[b] Far Cry New Dawn will take between 15 and 30 hours to finish.The amount of time it'll take you to beat it depends on your playstyle and what you intend to do in the game. [/b]

[h1] {Age rating} [/h1]
[b] 14+
Quite violent and with some pretty bad language, but no where near as gory and dark as Far Cry 5.Its actually a pretty good looking game with vibrant colors. For the violence all blood can be turned off in settings, and for the bad language, most of it is on the radio, in songs, so as long as that is off its all good. [/b]

[h1] {My personal opinion} [/h1]
[b] Overall it‚Äôs a good game and I enjoyed playing it. I got the game for 11,24 euro, just to try it. I personally think it‚Äôs NOT worth the 45 dollars and you should buy at a sale. Playing it with a friend is really fun and I highly recommend it :) [/b]",1617037691,1617038820,True,17,0,0.663987338542938232,0,True,False,False
