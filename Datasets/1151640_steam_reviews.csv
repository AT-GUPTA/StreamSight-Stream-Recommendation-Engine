The story is incredibly deep and more realistic than I was expecting. Much like The Witcher, this game captures everything I love about an open world RPG despite having a fixed protagonist identity. The game-play expertly weaves in a healthy amount of elemental complexity and stealth tactics with next-level weak-spot targeting. I've never been happier fighting primarily with a bow! Even the need to manually save at campfires, which initially made me nervous, was manageable and mitigated by the auto-saves generated by both quest progression and datapoint scans. Overall, I strongly recommend Horizon Zero Dawn and the Frozen Wilds DLC to anyone who loves open world RPGs! You'll especially love it if the idea of hunting dinosaur-esque mechs excites you, or if you like post-apocalypse settings.

P.S. My only complaint mechanically was the potions and utility menu. I did not like how I had to scroll (left/right on the d-pad of an Xbox controller) to get to each item during combat, with no ability to use items directly from the inventory screen. Alternatively, in addition to the fixed medicine pouch direction, I would have preferred to set potions, traps, and utilities to the other three directions.

When it originally launched, it was very well received, which, at first, I was a bit skeptical about. The reason being that the concept is a bit generic. It’s an open-world game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the remains of humanity once again live in tribes, and machines have taken over. Maybe it’s just me, but I thought it was a bit uninspiring.
Until I started playing and realized I was wrong because what really matters isn’t the concept but the execution. And the execution is great. The open-world structure and objectives are nothing we haven’t seen before, but it’s one of those rare games where it’s fun to explore and do everything on the map. It rarely felt like a chore to me, and I 100% completed it. Especially considering that Sony at the time usually published more linear single-player titles.
The story is enjoyable. You’ll learn about this world and its tribes, as well as figure out why the world is in its current state. All while dealing with a threat that threatens all humanity once again. There’s also a nice variety of likable characters, and Aloy, the main character, is very charismatic. At times you can make some choices, but they don’t affect the story in a meaningful way.
Gameplay is mostly a third-person RPG. You’ll be fighting different machines, all inspired by animals, mostly with bows at range but also with a spear at melee. They have different patterns and weaknesses, since the game features basic elemental effects as well. By defeating enemies, you’ll get parts that you can use to buy stronger weapons. But progression isn’t like your typical RPG.
For starters, leveling up increases your health but doesn’t make you do more damage. The same applies to the weapons since they don’t have levels. What stronger weapons have is different ammo types, expanding your options, and also more modification slots, which are key. Throughout the game, you’ll get different modifications that are basically adding stats like damage, handling, and elemental power. Figuring out the best combinations and using them effectively is how you get stronger, and I like this simpler approach to progression.
In the beginning, combat is alright, but mostly because your options are more limited. Once you get access to better weapons and have more skills, unlocked by completing quests and leveling up, combat opens up and becomes much more enjoyable. It’s very satisfying and epic when you’re fighting the stronger machines the first time.
Also, a part of the reason I find the combat enjoyable is the sound design. Hitting machines sounds great, and the machines themselves also mix sound effects from the animals they’re inspired by. I didn’t find the soundtrack to be memorable, but it’s immersive. The graphics are also great, with a lot of particle effects. The world is also diverse, with forests, jungles, deserts, mountains, and snow.
And everything I mentioned comes together to make a great game. It feels polished, although I found some visual bugs here and there and crashed a few times. There are some things I didn’t enjoy though. The big one for me is that your inventory is limited. You can upgrade your storage space, but I reached a point where I was doing inventory management more often than I would like and trying to figure out what I could discard/sell. Other RPGs often limit what you can carry with you but have a banking system where you can deposit and save everything. But not here, everything you own is always with you.
Another thing I didn’t enjoy was the save system. At first, I thought that the game saved often, and it does if you’re advancing quests. It also saves every time you grab a collectible. However, outside of quests, the only way you can save is manually at campfires or by fast traveling. The game doesn’t save when you quit the game, so I lost progress after fighting machines because I assumed the game autosaved often, and it does but not in that case. That also meant I lost progress when I crashed, sometimes 15-20 minutes because I was fighting and exploring far from a campfire. It feels inconsistent.
That aside, it’s a high-quality Sony-published game and an easy recommendation. It also includes all DLC and has no microtransaction crap. And like most titles published by Sony, it includes a complete dub in European Portuguese, which is rare outside of this publisher. Won’t affect most of you, but it’s another touch I appreciate.",1708893466,1708893466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played for about 66 hours and finished the main story and a great number of side quests. I've collected all Banuk statuettes, the metal flowers and ancient vessels. All corrupted zones cleared, all cauldrons cores overridden. I've still got the Frozen Wilds DLC area to explore and have some side quests left. 

The skill tree has useful items, especially when you're still weak. But even at higher level you will still find useful skills to unlock. Make choices according to your way of playing but definitely take Silent Strike and Concentration in the early game.
There's a wealth of weapons to choose from. Check regulary if you can improve them with better mods.
In upgrading weapons and outfits I skipped most of the blue items and went straight from green to purple (shadow) items.
The map can be overwhelming sometimes but it's possible to filter what items are shown.
Increase your item storage as quickly as possible because while wandering around you’ll find a lot of usefull stuff and it would be a shame to leave things behind.
Override cauldron cores to be able to override increasingly powerful machines and let them do the fighting for you.

If I have to add a negative point, it would be Aloy’s movement, which can be awkward in close contact battles and when you're close to the scenery such as rocks.",1708244830,1708889340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anywhere in the story can adjust difficulty and that feature is great.  I don't like playing boss fights over and over again for nothing but improving my reflex.  Story is tops, graphics the best I've ever seen, no bad language, no woke or other agenda.

 - literally no camera controls, not to mention the camera just repositions itself randomly. the camera also ignores foliage so good luck fighting anything if there are trees anywhere nearby
 - speaking of foliage - one specific type of grass hides you like you just put on the One Ring, but all of the other much larger, much more dense bushes and grasses are just completely see through to the enemies
 - monsters have about a 10 foot leash radius. want to lay a trap and lure a machine into it? too bad, they literally will not move more than 10 feet away from their predetermined area, even if they see you and are aggro. you can literally just stand there and the monsters will run back and forth while you plink them with arrows (learning this was what made me quit the game)
 - no separate keybinds for crouch, slide, bow, walk/run
 - the movement is extremely janky. sometimes your character just wont sprint no matter what. you get caught on little tiny rocks and other geometry, you get forced into a vaulting animation if you try to walk up a hill thats more than like a 25 degree incline - there are roads on these hills too
 - if you capture a mount and then fast travel, the mount disappears - yeah it makes sense logically but its really stupid for gameplay
 - the difficulty settings aren't actually balanced around anything at all. there are certain missions and trials that have time limits, and you aren't actually capable of completing the objective because environmental objects have hit points. for example, the trial to shoot log traps onto machines: on ultra hard, the traps take THREE ARROWS to trigger, because you only hit for ~20 dmg instead of ~120

Can't wrap my head around why this game is at 92% positive reviews when it is the literal definition of mid.

[h1]Update:[/h1]

I'm replaying this game again nearly two years later with an open mind, and... the game is so much worse than I ever remembered.

The story is boring and forgettable and the characters are devoid of personality. There isn't a single thing drawing me into this game beyond its superficial charm and captivating setting. I find myself only able to somewhat enjoy this game by pretending this is the first game I've ever played in my life, and aimlessly traversing the wilderness and collecting resources, solely to admire its graphics.

If the story and characters failed to draw me in, the combat further sours the experience. Combat in this game is very lackluster and extremely unsatisfying. Enemies just SOAK up any damage you throw at them, and this is AFTER significant leveling and gear improvements, stripping enemies armor, aiming for critical spots, and hitting them with the elemental ammo type they are weak to.

Mission design exacerbates the tedium, often devolving into mindless fetch quests that require traversing across the map multiple times. The lack of enemy variety makes this even more apparent, paired with the unsatisfying combat and lackluster stealth.

Speaking of stealth, it's disappointingly surface-level. Stealth feels more like an afterthought, and its implementation falls extremely short, even compared to something like Insomniac's series of Spider-Man games, which while lackluster, I felt could at least be enjoyable. It's such a shame, because I would have loved to use more stealth as an alternative to the terrible combat in Horizon.

The dialogue is impressively bad and often makes me want to fall asleep. The stiff and awkward delivery of voice lines, paired with the very rigid facial animations makes even the main characters more forgettable and lifeless than they already are. I also can't forget how compressed the dialogue is for some reason, making it sound similar to the sound quality from a Nintendo DS game.

Horizon Zero Dawn's praise and acclaim seems very misplaced, considering its myriad of flaws. It's visuals and initial charm may catch your eye, however, the game fails to deliver any sort of compelling experience, and just served to frustrate and embarrass the player. If you disagree with me, please, share your thoughts and leave a comment, I would love to hear differing opinions.",1663333084,1708542756,False,6,4,0.384101808071136475,0,True,False,False

Amazing. The game is so good they should make a movie.
Barring some performance slow downs during the heated battles, game is almost perfect.
Whoever came up with the idea of creating machine animals with dismatleable weak-points all over their bodies...give them a big raise! Brilliant concept. Combat is so satisfying.

Initially I feared if it was a blatant rip-off of Far Cry formula - Far Cry Primal with Machines - I mean tallneck towers?? map markers?? Animal skins for upgrades??
Thankfully I moves away from it soon and craves itself a glorious niche for itself.

I am sure you can complete this in much fewer hours than I did (80h) but I loved doing errands and side quest, especially since that, now, that i am older, i am not always in the mood for opening my game and facing a challenge every time. 

There were parts that i did not enjoy as much though. For example the riding felt underwhelming. Most of the times your mount was stuck or moved weirdly in a way that eventually made me do most things on foot or by fast-travel. Also why can you ride only few specific machines? It would be so cool to be able to ride every one, or maybe since you can override them, why not be able to control them? Like order them to attack etc?

HZD is a scifi game done right in my opinion and is at the very least well written in most parts. With believable and human characters and what turns out to be a quite interesting story. 

It does waver a bit in terms of writing, starting out strong, getting a bit wishy washy and ending fairly well but not as strong as the beginning. But I enjoyed it. 

Usual issues of open world story lead games is the pacing of the narrative is thrown well off when you go side-questing for days. But thanks to NG+ you dont have to worry too much about that as you can come back to it. 

The enemies are interesting even if the melee combat does kinda suck; Aloy cannot block, at all. And every enemy attack will interrupt your animations. The heavy attack which is the only attack worth a damn has a ridiculous wind-up and as such you'll get that animation broken by incoming attacks a LOT until you get used to it. BUT...

The game kinda makes up for it with the ranged and trap combat which is honestly OP AF once you get some points invested and upgrades plugged in. You have so many options to even avoid engaging in direct combat entirely and have the machines themselves fight each other for you. 

However the inventory system particularly for potions (health and buffs) and traps is all done on the D pad on controller, and you scroll through EVERYTHING every time you want something. Making it clumsy in combat. 

On that controller note, don't even bother playing with KB&M it sucks. The game was not at all designed with it in mind and it just does not work well. I tried for probably about and hour or more but eventually gave up and plugged in my controller and then all was well. 

Pricing of the game however is kinda extortionate tbh, I picked it up in a sale and would recommend the same, then its very good value for money.

But when she was given as a free 5* character 2 years ago, I played her, and became very interested in her games... especially due to her backstory as portrayed, accurately and without spoilers, in Genshin.
Finally, in November 2022, I got the funds to buy Horizon: Zero Dawn Complete on Steam. And I was not ready for the amazing experience I was in for. 

I wanted to do a Pro/Con Review, but honestly, I'd rather speak from the heart.

As someone who has beaten Breath of the Wild; the quest system and how side quests affect the main quest and even the DLC is exactly how Nintendo should have done Breath of the Wild, and from what I've heard, Tears of the Kingdom.

Horizon: Zero Dawn is the best open-world game I've ever played. About 90% of what you do as Aloy will affect the main story quest and the finale of the game. Who did you spare? Who did you befriend? What (as I will call them to avoid spoilers) side-dungeons did you do? Depending on the answers to these questions, Aloy to mention everything you--the player as Aloy--has done in the Main Story Quest or even in OTHER quests. Skipped a side-dungeon which allows you to control more machines? Aloy will act in the Main Story as if she never did it. Because she didn't. But, what if you did? Aloy will mention it. And yes, [i]ALL THESE LINES ARE VOICED![/i]

And it's not just ""mentions"", she talks about them as if they were critical to the story. The Frozen Wilds DLC will have a lot of different Dialogue choices depending on far you are in the main story, what dungeons you've done, etc. These types of changing dialogue and changes the things you do have on the main story can create for countless replays.

Speaking of Replays, do you know about the New Game+ feature? Once you beat the game, you can make a NG+ based off any save you have. You're locked into the difficulty you select, you get upgraded versions of armor (which in Ultra-Hard Mode cost more) from merchants. And it starts you at the beginning of ""Point of the Spear"" as Adult Aloy instead of Child Aloy's ""Gift from the past."" So, you skip the entire intro. But that's not all, you can use NG+ on saves of new games in which Aloy has a low level, or you speedran the quest to get one of the best armors in the game without leveling much, etc. [b]The options are limitless![/b]

The voice-acting is superb, and the story is incredible. You might have ideas and theories when you start the game, and some of them may be right, but the story will take you for an unforgettable ride which will be a gaming treasure. The story will sometimes make you really wonder ""what happened?"" and some quests will leave you with more answers than questions. For me, beating Frozen Wilds and then the final main quest was an experience that will stay with me forever--in a very positive way.

Aloy has a max, in this version of 50 levels. She starts out (after the introduction as a child) at level 3. Every level you get a skill point and increase of health by 10. However, you also get skill points from main story quests, side quests, if I remember correctly, dungeons.

As for gameplay, I used the controller and hardly had any problems. Though, you either have to adapt to the default controls on the controller or remap your own. The game can be played with Keyboard and Mouse and I've heard that's better for aiming. Personally, by the time I had found that out, I was probably a 1/4th of the way through the game using the controller. Regardless, the gameplay is a little clunky, but once you get used to it, the cool thing about the controls, is a lot of the things you see Aloy do in trailers [b]are completely possible to do in-game[/b], it just requires a lot of practice and patience.

Bugs, as for bugs, I'm glad I had to wait (due to finances) to get the Complete Edition here on Steam as by the time I did, 90% (maybe 95%) of the port's bugs had been fixed. So, I was in for a smooth experience.

I'm actually redoing my playthrough now because a) my final save with 100% got deleted somehow and b) I have a much more powerful computer.

I beat the game on February 22nd, 2023 - with an in-game time of 142 hours, 10 minutes, and ~30 seconds.  Aloy's adventure has me excited for the upcoming Forbidden West sequel on Steam, though, I may wait some time before actually buying it. ;)

I cannot recommend this game enough and again, if it weren't the Genshin X Horizon collab, as poorly done as it was, I would have never experienced Horizon: Zero Dawn.",1708294037,1708294037,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It felt like a low-quality Assassin's Creed (but even better than the last ones kekw). They implemented all the systems a modern AC game has but simplified them, and I don't see it as a bad point but the game itself lacks something that makes it unique. And after 52 hours and completing 100% of the game, I still feel that way.

BUT, on the other hand, I can point out three aspects that are pretty good about this game and make it worth your time:

[b]First:[/b] The main story has wonderful storytelling, a good plot, and a nice open ending for a sequel (coming to PC in March of this year).
[b]Second:[/b] A beautiful and immersive open world with different biomes. I really enjoyed traveling in this game on my own and almost didn't use fast travel.
[b]Third:[/b] The combat system. It's cool, dynamic, complex, and unless you grind like a psycho, you can enjoy it 100% without feeling it's boring or overwhelming. Each enemy has its own way to be brought down and the attack patterns change according to the parts you destroyed, making fights with the same monster different from one to another.

Overall, the game is good enough to give you a few hours of entertainment. The only thing that can be annoying is Aloy making random comments all the time. The first few hours are cool, but the longer you play, the more annoying she becomes (you still love her, she is kinda cute).",1708213189,1708213218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A skill tree allows for significant customization, and enemy kills provide raw materials for crafting upgrades - a mechanic that's also very common to FC/Ubi games. Aloy's character design is a refreshing example of a strong female lead in a post-Collapse hunter society.

The game is actually easier than many open-roam games, when it comes to infiltrating human-run bases. The camera is permanently in third-person view (since melee combat constitutes a huge part of the game, and third-person view gives much better situational awareness) and the game is generous when it comes to takedowns and silent kills. I found Aloy's overrun of a populated human base to be much easier and rewarding than in many equivalent Far Cry games - especially Far Cry Primal, which is also a bow-and-spear epic.

The game's main enemies are machines, rendered in animalistic builds a la Matrix design, and they are much tougher than the human foes you occasionally encounter. Once you get into the main portion of the game, beyond the first two machine types, the predator style machines become more and more challenging. Often, if the machine is able to close with Aloy in melee combat, you're looking at a game over and a checkpoint restart, since her spear just won't provide any meaningful combat parity.

This becomes more problematic in the game's dungeon sequences (called Cauldrons). It's unclear whether these dungeons are optional, but they're definitely signposted as places of importance, and they supposedly unlock the ability to tame a broader array of monsters. The first and only Cauldron I attempted was near the beginning, Cauldron Sigma, and it slowed my PC to a crawl. The gorgeous lush overworld of HZD didn't cause any problems - it's the vaultlike underground platforms and conveyors that my graphics card didn't like.

Play slowed down significantly, and with a much more linear level design, combat became much more obligatory. I found one area where I was constantly forced to die and retry, until I was able to lure the enemies onto a ledge and nickle and dime them to death with arrows from afar.

And after this achievement, I then fell prey to another typical porting problem from console to PC: janky save points. I made a wrong turn at the T junction and went right instead of left, where the game offered me the view of a sheer cliff. In trying to turn around, the third-person camera view of Aloy made her walk a few steps in the wrong direction, and she was instakilled because the game thought it was reasonable to walk her off a cliff.

The quicksave point was before the most recent frustrating dog-slow combat, meaning I'd have to go through it all over again. At this point I lost interest.

Will Aloy ever figure out why she was outcast as a baby, why her foster father refused to tell her anything about her past, and why the planet is in such a post-Collapse shambles? In a word: no.

There are other open roam games out there, and a few are the equal to HZD in worldbuilding and presentation (Far Cry 3, 4, 5, and New Dawn were especially well done). None, in my opinion, are as good as HZD's stealth mechanics game design - as she can hide in longgrass and even maintain Sneak Attack bonus out in the open, as long as she is unseen.

HZD's weakest link in its triple-A production values, however, is its scripting and narrative. While the game mechanics feel very well balanced and the leveling feels fair and non-oppressive, the origin story and background for Aloy just feel very limiting. The early outcast ""everybody hates you"" narrative wears out its welcome very quickly, and there's a YA Hunger-Games-style contrived competition that she just coincidentally can take part in (despite people not being allowed to talk to her as a religious taboo) to win back her citizenship in the tribe. The social elements of the worldbuilding feel flat and superficial, like they're just there to get you to the next chapter before all is forgotten and it no longer matters.

To her credit, Aloy remains a sort of ""post-Collapse stone age"" character throughout the time I played this game. While it's true that Aloy's not the first strong female lead of a video game ever, it is also fair to say that unlike Samus Aran of Metroid, she hasn't yet had a career period where she's slinking around in a curvy leotard wearing high heels either.",1708074366,1708074366,False,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False
1151640,157311314,76561198060673235,321,44,1744,0,1744,1706774621,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a mediocre open-world game. If I could summarize it in a quick sentence, I’d say it’s like a Far Cry game with a far more interesting world but much worse combat. From here, I will dive deeper into why I feel this way.

The best things Horizon has going for it are the aesthetic and narrative. Aloy is a compelling character, and her journey of self-discovery is quite intriguing. I loved learning more about the world as I progressed through the game, and I enjoyed hunting down collectibles that provided more information. I found these elements compelling enough to finish the game (although I never completed the DLC), although not everyone will.

While I did enjoy the overall narrative, the game starts slowly. The first few hours are essentially all tutorials where you play through some of Aloy’s childhood and a bit of her adult life before the game opens up. I’d like to say more positive things about the game, as I did finish it, but I have trouble coming up with many. 

One of my main issues with Horizon is the combat. Combat is underwhelming in many different ways. Melee combat is undoubtedly the worst part. You can do a heavy or light attack; that’s it. These attacks don’t lock onto enemies, so you’re essentially swinging and hoping you don’t get hit and have your animation canceled before your attack lands. While putting less focus on melee combat helps play into the fantasy and lack of power that comes with fighting massive machines, you often fight human enemies and have to deal with the same issues. Countless machine types also explode or have elemental effects when you defeat them; this dynamic makes melee combat even worse, as even if you win an encounter with it, you’re losing a considerable amount of HP or maybe even dying after a successful kill. Doing something akin to the Mad Max game, where you rip off the Batman Arkham combat and include some counterattack, would’ve made this much better. The ranged combat is stronger; you can scan enemies and see their weak points and elemental weaknesses. From there, you can use various arrow types, traps, and different weapons to inflict status effects, remove machine parts, or brute force arrow damage until enemies are destroyed. While this loop is fine, it’s not a strong point of the game, and the developers don’t seem to realize that, as the game's final section is a grueling combat encounter where you take on many challenging machines at once. To make matters worse, enemies tank many hits, so you’ll frequently need to craft new ammunition during combat encounters, interrupting the flow. The only defensive maneuver you possess is a dodge roll with some immunity frames. The dodge is nice, but enemy attacks often have such large hit areas that you’ll take damage regardless; on the flip side, on countless occasions, I watched my arrows fly through enemy heads or hit machines square on with no hit registration. In combat vs. enemy humans and neutral machines, I often found that the neutral machines would ignore all other humans and target me, which was annoying and broke my immersion. 

The weapon system also wasn’t my favorite. You can buy different weapons from merchants scattered across the map, although they mostly sell the same weapons, and the best weapons become available once you reach the main city. Weapons can’t be upgraded in the traditional sense; instead, they have a few modification slots where you can add modifications that you buy loot during your travels or buy from merchants. These modifications do things like an 11% damage increase, and each weapon typically has 0-3 slots. Armor is essentially the same system but with defensive buffs like ranged damage taken reduced by 12%. 

Returning now to the story. Yes, I found the overall narrative compelling, but interactions with NPCs are not interesting. The voice acting is solid in the main story, but side mission characters aren’t compelling. Sometimes, side characters are well-acted, but their writing is so awful. It’s commonplace for NPCs to repeat themselves and talk robotically like chatGPT wrote their dialogue, stating something like “Aloy, my brother is missing. I haven’t seen him in days, and I need to find him,” then literally saying, “Aloy, my brother is missing, I haven’t seen him in days, can you help me find him?”. It’s repetitive and boring, and I found myself ignoring all side quests once I had enough EXP to progress without doing them. 

On the bright side, I did find the open world compelling. There are bandit outposts, machine dens, hunting trials, corrupted machine zones, tallnecks (essentially synchronization points), and four different types of collectibles scattered across the world. While I enjoyed some more than others, I had a good time clearing the map, and some of these optional objectives unlock useful upgrades. Although traversal, specifically climbing, is the boring industry standard stuff you have seen in countless games. Swimming is particularly terrible, as you get locked into animations when you enter water, but typically you're only crossing small streams or rivers and end up swimming into invisible walls for a few seconds while you try to leave the water.

The world of Horizon is interesting, and Aloy is a compelling character, but the combat and side quests are widely uninteresting and flawed. While I finished the game, I can’t recommend Horizon Zero Dawn. That’s not to say that Horizon Zero Dawn is a bad game; I don’t think it is. Ultimately, the issue is that Horizon Zero Dawn fails to establish a combat/weapon system, gameplay loops, and side objectives worth experiencing in the vast landscape of open-world adventure games. 

I’ve heard the sequel is much better and improves on many of my complaints, so I’m excited to try that if the PC port isn’t terrible.

A post apocalyptic game similar to the game ""Elex"" with  a low tech primitive society going against a higher tech enemy with larger modern weapons.

In this case, besides the bad guys, the local robotic creatures that act like animals. (I mean, you have giant robotic cattle that look like their actually eating the grass!) Not to mention the cool ear piece that lets our heroine ""Eloy"" see things others cant.

Basic skill sets, Not much of a visual inventory, mostly your weapons, amour (which for me, I only used 2 in the whole game) The resources and your ammo is where  a person will spend most of their time crafting or selling.

Most of the battles will be with giant robotic animals killing, sneaking around, ambushing attacks and luring these monstrosities to their demises only to pick off their valuable resources. Along with running around and collecting plants for potions and ammo resources. 

Its a good game, all in all. it took me bout 2 weeks with about 3 hours a day.

Now to the game, open world, gorgeous feel and flow, I feel it is a MHW-BotW hybrid. You can progress how you like and you kill giant ancient death machines with primitive weapons and armor. The story is phenomenal. Compelling and original, I truly felt compelled to do everything to help everyone to max out my gear. It was a blast. The engagement options are endless, full stealth, full aggression, diversionary, traps, status effects, and even making the machines fight for you.  You'll fall in love with Aloy with her snarky ""don't mess with me attitude"", that's well justified, and her intelligence and compassion as you go through this story with her. HZD has a fan for life now with me.

It's an action based RPG whose story and characters makes you really grounded and connects you with this world they are living in! The way characters move and talk bring them to life, though their unblinking eyes can be a little unnerving at first. The lead, Aloy, is a believable protagonist against waves of beautifully rendered machines! The best part is you get to pull the machines apart piece by piece using a variety of weapons! This feature of the game is so rewarding as you slowly reveal weak points to different machines, or figure out which arrows function best for taking out a specific unit!

The character seems dynamic and it doesn't feel like they react sluggishly to your controls. In fact the reaction timing of moves from attacking with spear or arrows is super intuitive, and has to be, as the harder difficulty levels are unforgiving. If a challenge is not what you want then try the Story mode that is good for new gamers and those who just want to enjoy the environments without too much looking over your shoulder for machines. Speaking of environments, they are richly crafted and the character even reacts and talks about the environment they are in, giving that extra bit of realism.

The acting is top notch and you really feel the emotions all the characters are experiencing. It even features the talents of Lance Reddick(RIP). from the series Fringe!

The open world is rich with memorable locations and plenty of different collectibles that you can trade for unique items or that help flesh out the story and timeline of events. These little tidbits help tie the main story together, but if you don't want to read 100s of entrys you can grasp the main story without them. The tale is excellently crafted with enough of a twist that you should be wary of spoilers, but not so much as to ruin the experience of the game altogether. 

After finishing the game I started another playthrough on it's game+ feature!

Had some crashes here and there (one led me to not being able to manually save, but thankfully the community had a solution and I fixed it), but nothing game-breaking.  Graphics run smooth on my 3070 TI and boosted everything to ultra.  I use an Xbox One controller and had no issues with it, though I think moving Aloy via controller makes her movement feel slippery.  Don't know if KB&M users have the same issue.  Other than that, game played real well.

UPDATE: Got a PS5 controller and works MUCH better!  Still slightly slippery movements, but a much better improvement.

Looking forward to Forbidden West in March, but I fear that launch may suffer the same fate as Zero Dawn; full of bugs and crashes.  But hey.  Who knows.  Maybe Guerrilla learned their lesson.... Maybe....

- Would wish for visible armor upgrades with all that technical stuff around rather than just mods. Changing the headress for some armor would be nice.
- No dedicated buttons for traps, pots, etc. Until I switched from traps to pots I am dead with huge fast mobs.
- Conversation sequences with a weirdly bright right window edge. (21:9 monitor while the conversations are in 16:9)
- Tutorial quests did not finish when they were not activated even if the weapon was used as the quest says.
- New mods are not marked in the inventory thus I never know which one is new.

- No savegame naming.
- Trading rare figurines or metal flowers can give just boxes who contain lame green boxes. It feels like a mockery considering how limited those figurines/flowers are.
- Can get pushed into rocks and get stuck.
- Gear can drop below the ground surface to be unreachable.
- Beautiful landscapes invite exploration but are often empty with nothing to find which makes exploring boring.
- Threat to load savegames when getting to the edge of the map.",1707858923,1707858923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also, this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. I'm not usually someone who gets wowwed by graphics but this one struck me from the first moments. Hard to believe it came out almost ten years ago (on Playstation). Goes to show the value of artistry and attention to detail versus just adding more triangles.

There are some annoyances. Game saves don't actually save a real game state, so when you load them back you often find yourself standing in a place you never actually stood, which is a bit confusing. The way the game deals with map boundaries is also super annoying. These are really just nitpicks, though.

Monster Hunter with machines? not really. I played this game after I play Monster Hunter World, and honestly this game was one of the reason I abandoned that game, sure it's not even fair to compare both games since they are completely different games after all, If you played both you'll know.

Thing I like about this game the most is the world building, I bought the game without knowing anything and I thought that this was a medieval set game that happens to have robots time-traveled to the past or something (Spoiler alert, I was wrong), as the story goes it will get more sense and more believable and really got me engaged with the game a lot.

Gameplay wise, similar to other monster hunting games out there but with much less playstyle choice, variety of ranged weapon are cool and Blast Sling is my favorite, control is pretty easy to learn but as a controller user, the mapping really tortures my controller's stick (I personally hate RS/R3 to sprint type of games) since the combat is fast-paced, you will get to press sprint button at least 100x per boss fight, I know I could remap it but I'm criticizing here.

Getting back to the game after I left it for like a year made me re-experienced the good moments I forgot this game has, and I felt the same joy as I was while playing it for the first time, NG+ Ultra-Hard playtrough was not as hard as I expected at first, but again as a full-time controller user, it got rough sometimes because the gameplay design is practically forces you to be a ranged fighter (or archer to be exact), and aim assist is disabled in this difficulty level, so I missed 90/100 ammos I shot XD especially against human enemies and those godd*mn glinthawks or any kind of flying enemy really annoys me more than any bosses in the game. It was a fun playthrough though.

NEW REVIEW

Clunky controls but great story that's really well told and satisfying.  Gets a bit dragged down at the end though but thats where most of the exposition is so it makes sense.  Great game though over all, controls we're pretty struggling at times though, only big complaint.  That and it would barely run on my system until I got my 4070
It took me around 40 hours to finish and I could have spent much longer on it but kind of rushed the ending
The story is really well done however and has a lot of twists and turns, it was very rewarding to figure out the mystery as you play as you and Aloy learn it at the same time,. Really good writing and story 9/10 story 8/10 game  6/10 controls 

OLD REVIEW 


A truly amazing game gets a brand ruining half-ass'ed port.  It's clear they don't give a shit about their game or the PC market.  Outsourcing the port to a company that doesn't even work in the PC market?  Death Stranding is the SAME ENGINE and I can hit 60 fps consistently on Ultra, 1440p, easily, amazingly optimised game, and HZD barely chugs along @ 25fps. There is something seriously wrong with this port.  

I'm forcing myself to look passed the texture issues, the glitches, the crashes, the pop ins, texture flashes, to try my best to enjoy this game as it's seriously beautiful.  How someone can take a beautiful game, shit all over it,  then release it to the PC market is beyond me.   It shows a lack of care, attention, and respect for their customers, community, and their product. 

 There's no way I can reasonably tell people to buy this game on PC.

I'm not even upset, I'm just... sad.",1596891954,1707768112,True,0,0,0.557573020458221436,2,True,False,False

It also had a few messages behind it... about the consequences that can occur when people take things too far, ethics, the risk to life on earth that humans pose, the hunt for truth, sacrifice, and doing what is right.

I haven't felt true emotion towards a video game in a long time. I honestly cared about the characters, their lives, and felt deep pity and hatred for the antagonists. This is what it means to be whisked away in a story.

I wish I could play this game all over again, with no memory of playing it before. I'm riding this high until March 21st, when the sequel drops on Steam.

Some sort of disaster has happened and the humans are organized in tribes and rely mainly on scavenging technological part from constructs of the past. In addition, mechanical beasts roam the countriside, which always pose a challenge to fight. You can easily immerse yourself and discover this amazing world.

The quests feel always new and I didn't have the feeling of being repetitive as in other video games. However, I think that the role-playing part is a bit weak, in the sense that there isn't significant interaction with other characters that could shape the development of the game. At least I didn't perceive it like this. The development of the equipment is also quite slow meaning potential upgrades come late in the game. Vendors providing equipment seem insignificant after a certain point and the same seems feeling comes also from the quest rewards. In addition, the inventory management seems to suffer from ""child sicknesses"" of ealier RPGs, where the inventory is quickly bloated and getting full without knowing what could be useful and should be kept.

To the positive side, the storytelling is captivating and you are always eager to discover more. Being an action RPG, the action elements are quite strong with every battle posing a new challenge. There is a wide array of weapons that if used successfuly can turn a lost battle to a triumph. The learning curve is facilitated by the fact of quest-tutorials in the use of new weapons, while hunting lodges provide trials to improve personal combat tactics. Once again, the atmosphere is amazing and you can really get chills when something big and mechanical is scanning for you, while you're hiding in the bushes...

To start with, a future of hunter-gatherers in a world filled with robot monsters is a fun idea, which the art department handled beautifully. Zero Dawn has an absolutely stunning world to explore, spanning a variety of different biomes, with a large number of colossal enemies suiting each area. The character models feel a little bit dated (especially child Aloy), but by and large the game still looks great.

The gameplay is very typically Playstation, with a climbing mechanic revolving around highlighted climb points, the ability to scan environments. The combat uses a combination of light/heavy attacks and dodges, as well as incredibly satisfying bow mechanics.

Does a 5 hour DLC make up for a 30 hour, regular paced main game? No. Especially if it is not on sale. This game is not worth anything more than 20$ due to its disappointing features: an insulting amount of visual and audio glitches, boring collectables that don't do anything, boring side missions. They tried so hard to connect nature and robot dinosaurs and it ended up with a story line that doesn't make sense. I could honestly deal with all of that, all of it, if everyone's face in the game weren't so dang stupid. Sooo stupid. They're just...blank...emotionless.

[i] Original Review [/i]

Gorgeous game, beautiful story line and plenty of content! This has turned into one of my favourite game so quickly that im already wanting more... and im not even done the game yet.

[b] What is Horizon Zero Dawn? [/b]

This game is a beautiful single player open world story game. The main character is absolutely amazing to play and you can travel the world to figure out her origins, make friends (and enemy's) as well as upgrade various tools, ability's and skills to defeat things in the game. There are not to many real animals, and seem to be a lot of robots which are a mystery of how they came to the world, but some of the people are definitely evil too.

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

-""I am absolutely addicted to this damn game... I can't put it down.""
-""I wonder when the second one is going to come out. I hope soon, I am going to need some time off work to play it.""
-""This story is so rich already and I have just started the game... amazing.""

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

I would say this game should be pretty beginner player friendly, though I am not sure of how well the controls would be to figure out for someone. But, they are pretty straight forward for mouse and keyboard, and without any people being rude to you due to it being a single player game, it should be a nice game to play for someone starting out.

[b] Game Play: [/b]

The game play is absolutely rich and beautiful, I couldn't even believe how addicted I was for multiple days and hours throughout the week (obviously work got into the way of me completing it all in one day.) I never had the time to finish the DLC and I am still upset about it. It is kind of like black dessert, and many other games,  in the sense that it will show you exactly where to go when you are lost. There is the main story line as well as multiple side quests you can do. Though the main story is very amazing, I am so sad that the next game is a PS5 exclusive at the moment. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]

I am not sure how the did the graphics exactly, but they are breath taking in the sense that they are very realistic while still maintaining a certain style to the game. The character is beautifully designed and fits their role perfectly for the person they are trying to portray. Though, if I remember correctly this is a style of game that used an actual person to act as the people in the game. It worked out well. 

[b] Community: [/b]

I do not know to much about the community but with how nice they seem on steam, I don't think they are all that bad. 

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

This game kept me busy for hours, and considering I have quite a bit of game play left and also a whole DLC I could play, I would say it takes a decent amount of time to play. So if you are ready for a longer session this game may be for you.

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

In my opinion, I think this game is worth it, and if you enjoy extra content you should definitely get the DLC that goes with it as it adds more content to the game. The story is beautiful and mysterious. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time you play and it is so worth it by the end of the game. There is a second game out as I said earlier, although, its a PS5 exclusive, which means it is not yet ready for PC, or may never come to PC, so if you have a PS5 and prefer controller you could always get Zero Dawn on your Playstation as well, as it is a SONY game and would be available there. Then you could play the second one right after you play the first.

[b]Overall Score:[/b]
(3.5/5)
The game is the near-peak of what I imagine western open-world action adventure games can be. Unfortunately, that means that the game is marked with a redundancy that comes from the need to fill a map with tons of points of interests (POIs), and the combat is only [i]just[/i] entertaining enough keep you from getting too bored too quickly. That being said, what the game gets right is a gorgeous world that also feels well sized and populated; the distance between different POIs is never too long, so at least the act of traversal doesn't feel like a chore even if ""cleaning up"" the map and of its POIs does.

The crown jewel of the game is its overarching premise, which feeds you enough mystery to keep you hooked for what the next story reveal could be. The troubles of the main and supporting cast didn't interest me all too much, but I found myself invested in learning everything I could about the events and actions that led up to the game. If you only focus on the main quests, the story will reward you without dragging on too long.

This game is certainly not a masterpiece as that term is thrown around way too much however it is definitely a game that is worth your time simply so you can experience the sequel ""Forbidden West"" which I already played on the PS5. However Wait for a sale since the game is usually only 15 dollars.

[h3] Disclaimer: [/h3]
I went into this game having already watched all of the cut scenes.

[h2] Story [/h2]

I will not be talking about what the story is about but rather what I think about how it was written and then how it was presented. This games story is interesting, well written and hooks you in early. However, I do not believe it retains a consistent level of interest that warrants a play through for the story alone. What I mean by that is the main story beats are too far apart but once you have completed it and know everything its great. Another issue I have is in the way the story was presented. There are few cut scenes in the game and most of them aren't that impactful despite their very clear ability to do so shown in the final cutscene. To elaborate on this a little further, some scenes that are meant to be sad are only just visibly meant to be sad as in, you know they are meant to be sad but you don't care that much. Another unfortunate thing is that the side quests minus a few are pretty boring and are all just go to x location track footsteps... find person dead or alive and kill machines in the area. All of that said the story/setting as a whole minus the way it was spread throughout the game is very interesting.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

The combat in this game is simply the best thing about it. It is in no way difficult even on the hardest difficulty unless you start the game on it which I assume is basically unintended which is probably why it was removed from non new game+ in the 2nd game. That disappointed me a little but I guess not every game needs to be challenging. The visual and auditory feedback when hitting shots feels great and is definitely a big reason as to why the combat feels so good. Constantly knocking parts off of the machines your fighting is my favorite part. Some of the fights in the game feel cinematic the way the enemies are animated and the way everything comes together. The games mechanics are all very simple and you wont feel overwhelmed when you first look at your inventory and skill tree like most games. I do think the game could have had better tutorials for some mechanics however. The combat also isnt flawless obviously. Most times it is a dodge sim but imo it is still insanely fun.

[h2] Graphics/Other [/h2]

Some people may disagree with me on this but while the game is beautiful so are plenty of other games from the same year or before. So what I mean is yes its stunning but doesn't rise above the rest. I wanna talk about the facial animations and the non combat related ones as well. The facial animations especially in the non DLC areas are not good unfortunately. I think it is one of the games weakest points and the non combat related ones aren't too amazing either most people look really stiff with the occasional hand motion thrown in. The performance for the game is good most of the time however there are select areas where no matter the specs you may have low fps but luckily they are not points of interest. This game also happens to have amazing music and sound design overall. There are very few games where I can remember specific sound effects from the game but this is one of them. 

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Overall HZD is definitely worth it when its on sale just so you can experience FW. Forbidden West fixes every one of my issues and improves upon everything except the story is a little wild. I would say the combat alone in HZD is worth experiencing rather than skipping it and going straight to FW.",1707235120,1707235147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit - Finally picked this back up and finished the game. my god was this an intense ending. the story line is super original compared to most apocalyptic type games with an awesome plot, character development, and intense fighting situations. i cannot recommend this game enough, and i cannot wait for the port of forbidden west! 10/10 will play again.",1610882820,1707194964,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fights are epic only for the first 5-10 times you kill a certain machine, then you just either grind it for quests or avoid fights altogether because there's nothing to be gained from them.
For an RPG you reach the progression ceiling pretty quickly too so the challenge simply disappears.

Fighting and movement feel clunky, especially mount riding. Dialogues and missions are meh at best so I couldn't even bring myself to finish the story.

And my opinion is that this is one of the best games of its generation, and one of my personal favorites of all time. Aloy is such a charming character and I loved hearing her reactions to what's happening in the story, but also her cheeky comments on the world around her. ""Don't look down... don't look down... dammit"". The characters in this game are all so wonderful and compelling, and it was so much fun to ask them questions and learn more about them. Finding all the little lore bits (there's a lot!) was tedious at times, but worth it for how much extra content is in the game. If you spend time listening to the audio files and reading item descriptions, you'll gain a whole new insight into how deep the story goes. I truly cried at several points in the story because I was so moved. While RPG isn't a huge component of this game, the few choices you do get are so fun to test every option. I love being able to choose emotional reactions and responses that actually receive different replies. There's also some dialogue that you only get when you react certain ways, and it's not always an immediate response.
The combat variety in this game is debatable, but fun enough where I truly didn't mind that it mostly consisted of ""load, slow time, aim at weak spot, fire, repeat"" for every machine. On the plus side, I enjoyed the variety in how the machine enemies would come at you. Their patterns and styles are different, so It's fun learning to time dodges and when to unleash a flurry of attacks. My biggest complaint is that the controls are incredible janky at times. Aiming is so frustrating, especially on agile and flying enemies. What's worse, however, is the platforming. I swear 80% of my deaths were Aloy just running off/leaping off ledges instead of grabbing onto a ledge or rope. For most of the game world there's some forgiveness to the controls, but running courses or climbing up cliff faces while in a time crunch made me rage quit a few times.
The graphic are absolutely stunning. The snow and water affects are gorgeous. The character models are detailed... if sometimes a bit disturbing when their lipsyncing isn't perfect. Generally, however, the game is just incredibly pretty to immerse yourself in. And the lighting! Oh the lighting is just so amazing on the snowy mountains. I also love how the art style blends natural and manmade/metal elements in a pleasing and seamless way.
Despite its few issues, the good qualities of this game more than make up for it! I always looked forward to learning more of the story and world lore while also happily spending time just appreciating the landscape.

As I am nearing the games end I believe I have a pretty good grasp of it to give it an honest review.

I had a hard time getting into this game at first it just didn't hook me, after picking it up for a third time I finally just stuck with it. What I didn't like first: To many branches of quest chains imo, the games story felt a little confusing jumping between all the different quests. Eventually I just stuck to the main story and I love it!

The gameplay is great fighting robots is always fun destroying different parts of their body weakening them is super fun. However on humanoid enemies that's the complete opposite quite dull and boring just always headshot done.

Now my biggest gripe is that there is not a lot of variety? You don't really unlock anything special throughout the game that would change the gameplay or how you travel, fight its a little repetitive and not diverse enough for my liking.

Sound and visuals nothing to complain it's very good!

Hoping Forbidden West picked up on the weakpoints of the game and improved them.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a masterpiece. Not only is the gameplay amazing, well balanced and challenging, but it is joined by an epic story and an amazing soundtrack. The game has an initial difficulty issue if you play on anything other than easy, but the game quickly becomes easier the more levels you gain throughout the story. If you struggle, just keep on playing. I promise it gets easier.
The Story is a classic 'you are the chosen one', but this game spices it up a bit by concealing why you are the chosen one until pretty much the last 20% of the story, which is great as it allows for a great reveal at the end. You play as the Nora Huntress Aloy, who you watch grow as a character as she unravels the mysteries of the past and finds a way to save the future. The Story can be a bit confusing at first, but makes sense at the end once all is revealed. Multiple playthroughs (using the amazing New Story+ feature) is highly recommended, as this allows you to experience the story with all your earnt skills from a previous playthough.
The Gameplay is remarkably well designed, and still very simple. Combat can be broken down into Melee, Ranged and Traps. Traps are fun to use and do deal high damage when used correctly, but ultimately the worst of the three. Melee and Ranged are much better as the modifications for them are far more useful, and they can be used in almost all situations. Killing Machines by targeting their hard spots is recommended as not only does it detach some parts you can pick up without even killing it, it also deals critical damage, making the kill easier. A much needed skill is the 'Focus' skill which lets you slow down time while aiming and makes hardpoint targeting much easier.
The Soundtrack is amazing, having a fitting track for every revelation in the game. Combat music is also great, with passive/exploring music being enjoyable as well.
Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn is a lot of fun, and should be a must play for everyone. However, the initial difficulty for a new player can be hard, with combat only starting to become relatively easy around level 25. Various gameplay elements are also not shown very well and can be completely missed in a first time playthrough, making the game even more difficult. Even with these flaws though, once they are overcome the game is a lot of fun and well worth the mystery of the story!
Horizon Zero Dawn gets an 8/10.

This world is vast... you can see beautiful landscapes, multiple environments, travel as you like. Just amazing.
The theme is creative with this kind of apocalypse, interesting combination of nature, machines and humans.

There is some problem with the balance in this world. I think the density of the machines is too high. How can people even live there near these huge machines? They can't even walk 500 m without bumping into a hostile machine. I think the humans are overpowered over machines and our Aloy is way overpowered over anything. Yeah, I can get over it, but sometimes it's strange.

Fighting system is well developed, although I've found myself spend the 2/3rd of the fighting time in the menu, which is awkward. Maybe the opponents should be weaker, and in the meantime we should be forbidden to access the ingame menu. Dressing over mid-fight is strange...

The music/soundtrack is terrible. You have a good main menu music, and that's all. Actually it does not have a soundtrack, not even at the cutscenes which is unacceptable. Take a look at God of War: When something is happening, the music is following the events, and enhances the story, and when is not needed, silence takes over. Or Ori where the orchestra did a great work, and really takes part in storytelling. In the Doom series during ingame-menu, they just lower the volume of the blood pumping metal, not breaking the rhythm of your game.

The biggest disadvantage from perspective of a PC player is that the game was made for consoles, which is unfortunately very visible.

I'm not a fan of PlayStation / Sony, they are pretty much a cancer.
I wasn't expecting much from this game but i can say that it is actually enjoyable.
It has its flaws and its problems but overall it is a great game.
Fortunately it doesn't seems to have quick time events like most Sony video games.
It uses some mechanics from Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla and some other games.
Feels like a mix between Generation Zero and Far Cry 3.

I'll be waiting for Horizon Forbidden West on PC / Steam as i sure won't ever purchase a PlayStation, i wouldn't even want one for free (except if i can sell it then it'd be all right).

8/10 - Actually a very great game considering it is made by Sony. It is not ""the masterpiece of masterpieces"" but it is a great game nonetheless.


Edit : invasive data collection is a no though, it seems Sony does it with all of their games on the PC, i could change this review from positive to negative just because of it but i'll let it be, probably better not spending money for any Sony games...

Edit 2024 : As i said in the previous edit, invasive data collection makes it deserve a negative directly and i found out that lot of characters seems to be gay / LGBT cancer.

STOP SPREADING CANCER FROM A BAD BUNCH OF DELUSIONAL THAT SHOVES  THEIR FILTHY DIABOLICAL AGENDA EVERYWHERE!!
Yes, freedom of speech still exists, if it exists to them, it exists for us too, and the Truth always win, no matter what.

Spread the word of God, not some sins from some random toxic abusive group.
This is getting out of hands...
I'm not tryin' to hate on anyone, but LGBT is cancer just as any groups as they're all extremists nowadays.
If you're gay, trans, whatever.
I'll tell you that IT IS wrong, but that you do NOT need to feel bad, as Jesus died for our sins already, we all are sinners one way or another,  i'll do what God asked us to do, plus some scientific facts that being gay isn't healthy, that only two genders exist, etc...
If you understand and start following Jesus, asking for forgiveness and letting Him changes you, thank God.
If otherwise you refuse, you insults me, or anything else than a positive, i'll simply move on, can't say i didn't try to save you.
But now, these people are trying to make the World like them, it's abusive, it does in fact deserves jail just like they do in Africa. Killing like they do in North Africa that's a no, but these people needs help, they think they're right and everybody else is wrong but that sure ain't a fact.
Anyway, i could go all day long on the subject but i'll stop it here, i find it sad that we have to endure such things just to please a few ones that aren't even good people...

It certainly doesn't not makes me want to pay for Horizon Forbidden West, nor the Spider-Man games, or anything that supports such agenda for that matter.
It is just the same as what Hitler did...

Played on normal difficulty without too many issues until the last boss and decided to just play the DLC on story mode difficulty because I just wanted to know the whole story. A few things:

- The story is interesting. Maybe not completely original but definitely has a few unique elements and I think the first game has that ""if it goes well there's plenty of world building left by going other places"" feel, but can also be interpreted as, if it was the only game, a story that is sufficient enough to give you what you're asking for. That said I think Guerrilla had plans for sequels to this game.
- Very cool gameplay mechanics, especially fighting machines is fun because there's several ways to go about it. Obviously it borrows elements from other games with it's talent tree but it also leaves open what weapons you should use. There's really no one correct way to do it but the game has an encyclopedia on machines with parts and what the weaknesses are and you can go from there to make things easier. 
- For a 2017 title the game is gorgeous. I've always been a huge fan of dystopian worlds and the 'nature has taken back the world' sort of setting and this game gives you that in droves. Beautiful game.
- The characters could've been more fleshed out aside from Aloy and possibly Sylens, but I understand the plot needs to keep moving and you need to meet many people to really understand the world.

For the negatives I encountered a few bugs still. You can easily get pushed out of bounds by machines in certain areas and as a result you need to reload save. I also think the machines have weird hitboxes sometimes and hit you when they aren't supposed to. I also think the game expects you to dodge as late as possible not to get hit because the machines somehow predict where you are going, like it homes in on where you are in the middle of their attack.

TLDR: Very good game gameplay-wise and super pretty for a 2017 game. Story is interesting but maybe not revolutionary.",1706780862,1706780862,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What can I say? I love the graphics. The game has an amazing art style accompanied by a soundtrack totally up to par.

There have been some specific moments in which I noticed that the pacing of the story was weak or some animations were a little shabby. Howerever, the satisfying gameplay covers all the flaws of the game, in my opinion.

I find the game's story easy to follow as well as interesting. I don't think it stands out a lot, but I feel it doesn't need to. In addition, I liked pretty much the English dubbing.

I played the game on normal difficulty. If you're looking for a minimal challenge, I would recommend you to pick a higher difficulty. The game is completely enjoyable on normal if what you want is just to play chill and focus mainly on lore, though.

i originally didn't want to recommend HZD after about 20 hours, because the game seemed generic and wearisome. however, i'm happy i then started to focus more on the main quest, which reinvigorated my interest. the setting and the story are clearly the forte of the game. the graphics also hold up really well, it still looks stunning. however, the side quests are, in my opinion, quite boring. i didn't vibe with the main character during those quests at all, aloy seemed a bit like the classic boring hero heroing things. that all changed when i started only playing main storyline quests, which is what i would recommend everyone to do. while the world is beautiful, nature diverse and the different tribes quite distinct, there is actually little to explore as no place has an actual backstory or meaningful quests attached to it. barely any npcs one can really talk to are around, and the towns and settlements seem repetitive.
the main story however is dope, the mechanics feel very good and the machine fights feel epic af.

This game is good. It's not great and I don't see a lot a of replay value but it is good enough that I will probably play the sequel. It doesn't play like a 7 year old game.

There is not a great deal of innovation here if you have played 3rd person action RPGs before with a stealth archer build you will find all of this very familiar. The mechanics are solid and the world is very pretty. Aloy is a great character to play and her story, as long as you can suspend the disbelief of humans surviving a roboapocolypse for more than a few dozens of hours, is a nice one to follow.

The history of the world is there to find and really you can skip most of the world building and not lose a lot. The problem with this, as with most post apocalypse stories, is that I just don't see how humanity survived it is just not believable. 

The other problem here is that Aloy and Sylens aside the ensemble cast is very one dimensional.
If you add to that the fact that the music (imo one of the most important parts of a game) is forgettable at best there are many reason whilst this is a good game, which I recommend you play, it will never get near any GOAT lists.

Pros
Stealth Archer Fun
Pretty world
great protagonist
Doesn't mention 25 dev studios in an absurdly long splash screen
Can skip all the dialogue and cut scenes
despite there being no save anywhere option I didn't have any rage moments with autosaves
pretty solid PC port not crashes

Cons
No save anywhere option. Uses fireplaces and autosaves.
No exit to desktop in the pause menu
The character hair and eyes are a bit off
Music = forgettable at best
ensemble cast of characters are very one dimensional. Some of the voice acting is poor.
limited role playing options cuts down on replayability

Conclusion Play it, it is fun just don't expect it change your life.

Story is absolutely fantastic. Graphics and atmosphere too.

Combat is ZERO experience, in general. Machines combat are somehow ok, but human combat is the worst I ever had in my life. There is no combat, no creativity, no options, especially on Ultra Hard. You just find one option that gets you through and push it till the end. Drag. Very very bad and boring combat experience.

[*]Most of the characters, including MC, literally acted like they were bots throughout the game. Can't recommend the writing.
[*]Music wasn't there most of the time, which is a shame.
[*]Literally the worst PC launch I have ever seen. Had to update my Win vers to boot the game. Apparently this is a norm for all Sony ports. They can't be bothered with older vers of the OS'.

Combat is just not fun and more of a chore. I played it with a controller and also with M&KB and none of the ways felt intuitive. Alloy's positioning is all over the place and inconsistent, the enemies reach works on their favor everytime depending on your distance like they can somehow always reach your position. I could excuse this if firing the different weapons was any fun but instead it feels like wasting a barrage of ammo for no result even when hitting weakspots. The weapons that one could consider fun to use are best holstered since everytime they're fired there's a high probability they end up wasting more resources than you get from the outcome. the game is effectively trying to stop you from using what could be it's best feature. With so many enemy encounters in such a massive map, combat needed to be quicker to feel engaging but instead every encounter drags for so long it ends up feeling tedious.
The world is the typical ""wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle"". The map is massive as is the amount of useless crap scattered through it. If you played any of the ubisoft open world's, at least those usually have some kind of decent traversal while here is just mindless circling around rocks to collect a 1000 year old mug. The game only lets you climb specific areas and you can do nothing about the waist high wall blocking your path.
Missions are all the same with minimal variation: ""activate sensor, follow clue, reach destination, kill enemy, get back"".
What about the story? oh boy...! this is soap opera levels of predictable cringe! Alloy is a non-stop exposition dumpster! (Schwarzenegger shut up meme) There's not a single character that's not a complete plank of wood! not even mo-cap could help these characters feel a bit more alive. I'm not even going to comment too much about the fact that in a world where mankind allmost got wiped everyone acts as peacefull tribal comunities, Where are the cannibals? raiders? rapists? junkies? fanatic religious cults? people dying of starvation? there's so little of a sense of ""decay"" on the human side of things it ends up making the world feel unnatural.
If you want a good story, you won't find it here. Want a good post apocaliptic world? go play Mad Max. Want good combat fighting against big enemies? monster hunter is your friend.
This is nothing but AAA massive budget marketing to build hype.

I've spent my last weeks completing (probably) all the games missions and enjoying the atmosphere. Now I'm going to elaborate further on the good and the bad of this game. 

Starting things off, I'll start with the bad stuff, which there is not a lot of. 
[list]
    [*]Jumping and Rolling physics: This is one that drove me up a wall quiet a few times, even though it's not as big of an issue. You can only climb at marked spots (except for some ledges in the DLC area, where you also can climb), if you are jumping up the hills, there's basically a 50% chance of falling down again or getting up. As there are no slide physics when you fall down a hill, you just fall down and get a lot of fall damage or just die. It also happens that you get stuck in dead machines mid fight, which make it difficult to dodge attacks sometimes (that is probably what most of the time happened to me). 
This annoyed me the most, but it is forgiveable, it does make some fights or platforming a bit frustrating, but in the end it doesn't really affect the gameplay too much, as this mostly only happens once when it's happening, which is not a lot. 
    [*]Conversations with NPCs on the main map: As much as the cutscenes and lore behind the game are really wonderful, something that pulled me out of the immersion quiet a few times were the conversations with sidequest NPCs. They feel weird to talk to, their animations don't really make sense. This is a weird thing, but also only a minor issue, I mean this game is also 7 years old already, so it is forgiveable again. This Bulletpoint also doesn't count for the DLC, in the DLC area they nailed the sidequests and it's conversations, so thumbs up to that. 
[/list]

That's about it with the negatives. Now to the good stuff. 

Graphically, this game looks gorgeous and all the areas are very fun to explore. After Guerrilla made some updated, this game handles wonderfully and very linear everywhere in the game, although I've had some performance dips in the DLC area compared to the rest of the world. Runs well on both on Windows and Linux (with proton obviously). 
The story is very catching and I enjoyed every second of it, I like story oriented games a lot and I really like the character development throughout the story. Aloy is a wonderful role to play in a world like this, I like how she drops her one-liners here and there, also at places with previously completed missions to remind you of what happened at a place that you were at previously, or also her childish approaches in some situations, she truly feels human and how humans could react. Also I've found her voice to be very calming, even though the game rarely lets you feel safe. 
That's another thing that I like about the world, the lack of safety in almost all places of the map makes it very engaging. Sometimes it's a bit quiet and the surroundings are pretty empty and suddenly something pops out of the ground and attacks you and the next time you go there some entirely other machine is guarding the place. Every time I chose to get me a ride somewhere I've immediately regretted my decision as I've always felt like I missed something and went on by foot. 
The best part about this game together with the story is probably the combat system. I've never felt like I was missing some crucial information on how to fight someone or something and learning the patterns of the machines and its weaknesses is still very fun. You can customize your playstyle yourself. Do you like to just go in and fight alone with all of them at once? You can do that. Do you like to keep your distance and use your bow a lot? Sure. Do you like to stealth more? Sure thing. 

Summarized:
This game is very recommendable. It's graphically gorgeous, the story is great, the combat is great and new players will probably like this game too, as everything is meant to be easy to learn and hard to master. A must have in my opinion",1706297316,1706297429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I normally don't play games that you can complete (im an MMO player) but even once completing the storyline you can continue to hone your skills or restart for more rewards on a harder difficulty.

The story is the best RPG ive experienced, its engaging and Aloys often witty comments will make you grin.
Combat is just awesome and the weapon combinations make nothing a meta.

Even the side quests offer valuable rewards, are well written and never seem a chore.

The atmosphere is just breathtaking and sometimes you will find yourself just standing on some cliff somewhere thinking 'wow' just 'wow'.

Game play wise, its open world with many side quests and challenges. Picking herbs for your next fight or mountain climbing for the scenery. Combat is great with potentiality of being complex, from identifying enemies weakness as well as applying appropriate herbs to aid you in battle. Many different ways to bring down your targets as well as many rewards and upgrades you can get. 

Like any game, it has chances of freezing so save often or trust the auto-save feature. In high combat areas often frames would stutter or lag severely (ryzen 9 5800x 3070ti) solution was just lower your resolution for that duration. Sometimes you can get stuck inside enemies/corpses just make sure that they arent moving before you loot unless you want a rematch.

This game is crippled by a couple of things that require pointing out otherwise this would be a ""Yes"" I guess. I have 100% completed the Base game and DLC so I have seen all the options. In the category of story this game may not be ""unique"" (what is anymore) but it does come close to exceptional. Dialog is entertaining and sometimes even thoughtful. As to Combat; here we get into the mess. The IDEA is great, the execution less so. Too often the game Swaps your camera to its own liking (that is to say where you cannot see) Random swapping of ammo types without any command to do so (this might be OK if it swapped to the best type but instead it is just random and useless mostly to mess up whatever you intended.) and the ever fun you press ""turn left"" and it turns right. Then there is the most shameful game mechanic of all time; The self gratification method. This is where if you are doing well the game ""decides"" to cheap shot you. Completely ridiculous things; pure cheating (you can even watch it in slow motion with certain skills), it is disgusting. The fact that it causes so very much frustration and anger is why this game needs this warning, it can really detract from the experience. Other issues are the foolish weapon system itself, the weapons are all the same except when they are not... that sounds meaningless and now you understand the weapon system... Multiple bows to fire different arrows that would work just fine in the ""Standard"" bow. It's honestly just too messy all round to describe adequately. Just another point of frustration. Rather than smooth game play you will constantly, not just be ""swapping weapons to maximize combat"", but instead you will be FIGHTING not the enemy but the controls more often than not. 
  Okay, that said I still liked the story and the character is relatable, the fandom is about the ideas not the game itself. There are A LOT of Drama issues surrounding the game that are yours to decide upon and I will not discuss but they ARE there. This game is a good Story and experience for the most part. but the issues may force you to ""Give up"" before finishing. As to completion, as I stated before I have completed both game and DLC at 100% so issues in the past concerning Glitched items/quests seem to have been resolved. They also added items to the merchants that can be bought that show the Hidden locations of the required items for 100% completion, that was appreciated greatly. So my review is a NO only because if everyone says ""Yes"" the game just shows ""Very positive"" and that just isn't true. But in the end if the price tag isn't too steep for you this is a story worth hearing perhaps. But if it is game play you are interested in you might want to look elsewhere.",1706201380,1706201380,False,3,1,0.484945058822631836,1,True,False,False

The story and characters are interesting, learning the traditions of the different tribes and history is engaging and well thought out. Aloy is a compelling protag I enjoy her, but I do wish the game had more customization, it's a long game it would be nice to change up her appearance from time to time. Yes you can use different armor, but most of them don't do enough change aesthetically and many arn't very appealing. The helmets all look horrible luckily you can hide them. Visually it's easily in the top 10 best looking games I've played thus far, it's so gorgeous and it runs amazingly well on pc, so glad more and more big Sony games are on Steam now. The music and atmosphere of the game is extremely immersive, hours flew by just totally lost in this world. The gameplay is good but the melee especially doesnt feel that great, I wish the game had a lock-on feature. The DLC weapons really helped shake things up at a crucial moment, I was getting tired of my arsenal. The DLC in general is fantastic, some of the most beautiful vistas and memorable quests are packed into this area, I do feel like the RPG elements lack depth same with the survival aspects, the hit boxes on a lot of enemy attacks are also kinda bad. Most the minor issues I didn't care for are personal preference though it's no secret this game is awesome. Much of the side content is on par with the main questline, I did everything I could it was time well spent. Prob the best open world game ever after RDR2.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a fun action RPG where you live in a post apocalyptic world ruled over by big animal-like machines. The idea is that you craft weapons, you kill machines with those weapons, and the machines then drop goodies that allow you to make even stronger weapons. 

Most characters that you meet have an unique personality and have understandable motivations. Most questions you will come up with during your play through will be answered by the end. And these answers get pretty disturbing at times.

One thing I dislike however is the pathing mechanics specifically around climbing and take-downs. I do not know what went wrong in the development. But at times its pretty hard to see where you can, and cannot climb. To the extend I have been jumping against rocks way too many times. Sometimes the game has problems understanding which path you want to take, even though the path has been specifically crafted by the developers for the main story line. You do not want to know how many Aloy fell to her death because the game didn't register that I wanted to slide off a cable in my game.

There is also a lot of cheese possible in this game. Especially the stealth mechanics are incredibly bugged in the best ways. It can cause hilarious situations. The trip caster can also be abused very easily to cheese certain boss battles. I however, think this is great and love it.

[b]Rating - 9.9/10  [/b]

Like the most of games i completed this one cracked , so bought here and started straight from new game+ with ultra hard mode

[b] Graphics [/b] - Without Rtx this is best graphics i ever see till date,  art style and texture details are at top notch quality.plus they added upscaling so thumbs up for old hardwares

[b]Glitch and Bug [/b] - i'm amused to see being a open world rpg this game has no glitchy quests or moments nor any bug, yes some may complain at time of pc launch there was some performance issue but right now (2023) i find nothing like that. They really gave lots of patches.

[b] Story [/b] -  Extraordinary, Breathtaking and Unique with Efficient Story direction and character progress. I wont say much for spoiler. Story is the main reason you will like this game so much.

[b] Gameplay [/b] - Very satisfying and well balanced , even the dlc. They added new machines for maintaining the balance. Upgrading Everything and on ultra hard mode quests are fun and engaging.

[b] Special Credits [/b] - They create a very realistic world, Npc , their various tribes and their traditions , habits , dialogues ,movements of machines ,every thing contains precise details 

[b] Tips  [/b] - Complete Cauldron quests first If you are on hard mode and get the Purple travel bag

[b] Cons [/b] - For pc ports there is some achievement trigger issue. Achievements are not popping up for some cases",1705933450,1705933498,True,23,2,0.615777134895324707,7,True,False,False

Great game, spent 80 hours on one run. Go for it. 
I am a completionist and did all the side quests before going on main line, so that affects my experience. 
Idea and story are great. The pacing and revealing of the story could be better spread, also across side quests. 
Despite many tapes and texts with background information, in the end there are still many unanswered questions and important ones. So the satisfaction is not as it could be. 
The machines are a work of art. It was a joy to study every new kind and find ways to defeat them, where to shoot, see them explode and damage machines beside them. I even felt sorry for the deer-machines when they slowly limped with 10% hp. Could they feel pain, or could they not and were just damaged. So I learned to finish them quickly. 
Weapons are plentiful, but weird concept. Huge amount of different ranged weapons, but all enemies basically run into you to fight at close range. The spear is the only melee weapon and cannot be reasonably upgraded until the very end. Doesn't make sense. So in the early game, I mostly did stealth attacks to kill immedietely and avoid melee combat, in late I basically used the heavy bow and tried to one-shot machines from afar to avoid melee combat. Worked like a charm. 
My biggest problem is the wokeness, and once I noticed, everything became cringe. Most of bad guys and generally incompetent, confused people are men, most of good and competent and confident people are women, plus many small details in conversations, the ""war against the patriarchy"" in the hunters lodge. Through and through, just felt wrong. 
Characters were beautiful, with excellent faces and wardrobe. My favorite was Ikrie from the Banuk territory, I returned to do her trials many times. 
Sadly there was no romance, even though Aloy should be capable of feelings, should be curious about other genders in her age and some people were very handsome and likeable. But Aloy rarely showed any affection, maybe once or twice and those were just a sentence or two. 
Finding collectibles brought no satisfaction, eventhough there was a potential for altering the world with them. 
After leaving the Banuk territory to do the main quest line, I was level 50 and climbed to 60(max limit) pretty fast in the Carja territory and the previous enjoyment was gone. 
Summary:
+ machines
+ world building
- weapons and ranged/melee combat chaos
-- wokeness
- no romance

Guerrilla Games has delivered a true masterpiece that sets a new standard for action RPGs.

At the heart of Horizon Zero Dawn is its protagonist, Aloy, a fierce and determined hunter in a world overrun by robotic creatures. Aloy's character is instantly compelling, and her journey to uncover the mysteries of her world is a driving force that propels players into a narrative rich with intrigue, emotion, and unexpected twists.

The game's open-world design is nothing short of spectacular. The post-apocalyptic landscape is a visual marvel, featuring diverse environments from lush forests to desolate deserts. The attention to detail in both the organic and mechanical aspects of the world is a testament to the developers' commitment to creating an immersive and believable setting.

A standout feature of Horizon Zero Dawn is the awe-inspiring robo-dinosaurs that roam the landscape. The design and animation of these robotic creatures are a testament to Guerrilla Games' technical prowess. Each encounter with these mechanical behemoths is a thrilling mix of strategy and action, with players utilizing Aloy's agility and an array of weapons to overcome their formidable adversaries.

The combat mechanics are a true highlight, offering a satisfying blend of ranged and melee attacks. Aloy's versatile arsenal, including the iconic bow and arrow, adds depth to engagements, allowing players to approach encounters with creativity and finesse. The strategic component of identifying weak points on robotic foes adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.

The narrative unfolds through a combination of main quests, side quests, and environmental storytelling. Every discovery, every piece of lore contributes to a rich tapestry that keeps players invested in the world and its mysteries. The characters Aloy encounters, each with their own stories and motivations, further enrich the narrative experience.

Horizon Zero Dawn's soundtrack, composed by Joris de Man, contributes significantly to the game's emotional resonance. The haunting melodies and epic orchestral compositions perfectly complement the on-screen action, enhancing the overall atmosphere and immersion.

In conclusion, Horizon Zero Dawn is more than just a game; it's a triumph of storytelling, world-building, and gameplay innovation. Guerrilla Games has crafted an experience that not only pushes the boundaries of what is possible in gaming but also resonates with players on a profound level. For anyone seeking a captivating and visually stunning adventure, Horizon Zero Dawn is an absolute must-play. Enter Aloy's world, and prepare to be mesmerized.",1705869285,1705869285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I tried. I really did. I made it as far as Mother's Crown, then realized in the middle of a trial that I was simply wasting my time with this game. It's so slow and boring. I was doing better on the trial I was running... Logpile Trial... but it just wasn't fun at all.

I'd recently killed a pair of Sawtooths (Sawteeth?) for a task, and I managed just fine, but, even with tips online, it was work. Not hard, just... work. More than necessary for so early in the game. And past Mother's Crown, Sawtoothi become a regular thing.

After a couple of start-of-game must-haves (Silent Strike and Lure Call), I barely felt any ""increases"" in power, from gear or skills; either something suffers massive damage from a gimmick, or the fight takes too long to be fun, and there really isn't a way to mix the two. There's virtually no appreciable melee improvement (I'm yet to see a better spear), and, once the gimmick misses, combat is too busy to ""plan"" things like ""knocking off armor pieces"" (a selling point of some skills), because you're a paper tank in melee; two or three unlucky hits and you fold like a cheap suit. I hope you saved recently! And there's no melee options to exploit weaknesses... if they're vulnerable to fire, there are no fire-based melee options, for example.

Mobs are scattered around in groups, many of which aren't marked on the map, which makes travel unpleasant; either spam your Focus regularly, which REALLY slows you down, or be ready to run from unexpected encounters. You could use a ""horse"", but the horse controls are TERRIBLE.

And the camera. Oh god, the camera. There's no zoom whatsoever, and it clings to Aloy. Look: the player is not the character; being able to zoom out the camera a bit to look around the character gives the player info the character presumably picks up around them naturally. The game also requires knowing where key spots are to use, like tall grass patches, but the VERY up-close camera makes it hard to find what you need when you need it. Given that this is a stealth game with pretenses of melee and an expectation of mobility, the no-zoom camera is agonizing.

But that doesn't mean I can't talk about the negatives: cutscenes are often less mastered, perhaps due to the fact that I played in French.

If you don't use the right weapon, the game will make you understand and you'll suffer for it. I've already suffered for 10 minutes fighting a creature to understand that you had to use this or that weapon, you lose a bit of freedom, especially since the loot system often doesn't allow you to craft all the ammunition you should or would like to use, download mods if you can.

While the gameplay and story are really generic and not really memorable, it still delivers an enjoyable experience for the most part. Aloy is a forgettable proganist and very generic, Runs great on steam deck also at 30fps on medium. Read below for a more detailed breakdown:

Horizon starts out really strong. You get introduced to this really bizarre distopian world built on top of a destroyed previous civilization. There are these massive machines roaming the world that you have to hunt as you try to survive. You get introduced to your hero, Aloy, you can't help but feel empathetic toward her as she is a young outcast trying to prove herself. As you move through the first parts of the game you attend this challenge to become a brave, you meet some interesting people...and then slowly the story just unravels into a really basic experience. All of the people who hated you suddenly respect you (despite initial reluctanance when you become a brave) and the dialog is very redundant and uninspired. Combine that with horrible animations and you just end up skipping most of the side quest dialogs.

The game also suffers from ""large open world that is mostly empty"" disorder. the map in this game is huge, and what should be fun to explore becomes a chore as everything just blends together. The most interesting areas (the cauldrens) suffer the same problem. They also implemented this weird fast travel system that requires you to use an item in order to travel. However crafting (or just buying) this item is easy and you'll quickly get a dozen of them, and eventually you can purchase one that gives yoy infinite fast travels. You also can fast travel to anywhere also and not just campfires, so this negates the entire point of exploration or the fast travel system.

Biggest draws to me are the satisfying combat mechanics and the interesting story.

I feel like the open world aspect is a little too overshadowed by the main story and navigation hud. The main quest is the most compelling thing to do in the game, it is where most of the content is. You can find other quests by wandering around, but most of the landscape is just the wilderness between towns where you gather resources.

The navigation hud is also a little bit of a distraction from the open world. I want there to be a navigation hud, but the pointer in HZD is right in your face and always telling you where to go.

Ultra Hard with your full modded kit (as you would use in NG+) feels like how the game is intended to play. Ultra Hard from a fresh game descends into ninja gaiden territory which is very fun if very time-consuming. Until the absolute end-game most roaming machine encounters command a lot of respect and strategy, and new machines are gracefully introduced through the main missions. I've shat on lots of ""action"" games lately and tried standard cheeses like just pumping blast wires and farming materials back up and it doesn't stand up to the encounters this game has to offer. Very nice. 

I don't really care about story at all, I think this game's was pretty okay. I do have some minor gripes not tied to combat however (except the one tied to combat).

1. The beginning of the game, the first bandit camp+cauldron, the entire Nora region...is really fucking good. I was excited to see 3/4th of the map still fogged after clearing the initial round of stuff. However...once you progress out of the sacred lands, scenery and environment gets pretty disappointing. I figured there'd be a pretty segmented Osseram area and a variety of locales, but it is 80% desert. the machine distribution also doesn't lend much to the environment...you will find snapmaws and glinthawks in the early desert, you will find them in the late desert, you will find them in the jungle, you will basically only stop finding snapmaws very very far north basically. I will point out the jungle area south of Meridian is what I'm asking for; stalkers suddenly appear all over the place and the greenery and cliffs are very distinct from other areas. There's even a cauldron that is pleasantly very different down there. But the rest of the west is pretty boring. 

2. Not a huge gripe personally, but DLC has pretty standard bullshit to test gameplay limits that well and truly do not scale like the rest of the game at all. They are pretty difficult, manageable, and strategic on lower difficulties...and you just cheese on UH. I would encourage people to show me otherwise. Triple corrupted iceclaws with a useful companion, double iceclaws in a horrific arena with a more-than-useless companion...and fireclaws/scorchers in general. It is CRAZY time-consuming doing any fights against the DLC enemies and it's the only point where I would complain the game resorts to lazy sponging on UH. Corrupted thunderjaws are scarce and usually merited by the occasion, while also being pretty melt-able if you're collected and do all the right things with endgame loadouts. The DLC enemies basically always pop up in Demonic form, which is short-hand for sponge form. The challenges are kind of comical but I wish these encounters were more approachable with conventional means. 

3. Sidequests...are honestly quite bad throughout. There are few enough in the nora region that they feel like little bonuses while exploring the map. I rolled my eyes every time I unveiled a new pocket of the west and the green exclamation mark popped up. The issue isn't necessarily in the quantity since this is an open-world game after all, but damn. I counted at least 13 side quests and errands that include a component of ""well kill some glinthawks now"". It definitely exceeds this but I can't place an exact number. These quests are comically similar and are all needlessly long without telling any kind of story. You get some lore from starting it, and the end of it has some kind of closure. This is almost invariably recovering someone who is lost or just killing someone. ""Kill this enemy"", ""waste time tracking over 200m then kill this pack of enemies"", ""you found the person afterwards but there are bandits so kill them""...it is kind of dreadful. And again, every time it's glinthawks. Glinthawks surely destroyed the world, not the chariot class. To add insult to this, glinthawks are very trivial enemies with plugging a fire arrow then dispensing of their small health pool. Ultra Hard negates this advantage and makes them supremely tedious. Yes, I can kill a pack of three damned glinthawks at once. Why am I stuck doing this for any side story content the game has to offer?

Despite all of that, excellent game from start to finish. I was astonished how bug-free the game was and how pleasant the exploration aspect was until I sat down to finish 10-20 stray side quests and errands towards the end and started the DLC. This is a proper action though you might be godmode with freeze status and any dps arrow on lower difficulties. The roaming and climbing terrain like the endless mountains in this world is surprisingly pleasant given the lack of a glider or jetpack or the like. That would open up many more design opportunities for the world and is apparently one improvement from the sequel.

Generally I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, its definitely a niche game, and for me its nostalgic to play, as its when I properly got into PS4 games; but if you like killing machines with lots of varying difficulty and diversity and as well as deep lore I cannot recommend the game more.

But upon starting to invest more time the game really opened up and I had a grand old time with the exploration, combat, and everything else your typical open world game is supposed to offer!

It might seem a bit like scrambling to find a complement (although I assure you this isn't the case), but the absolute best aspect of Horizon Zero Dawn, and the one thing that most sets it apart from other open-world titles, is the fascinating enemy design. The robots mimic real animals in look and behaviour, and just generally look cool af; wires exploding instead of veins bursting, and metal chucks flaking off when you land a heavy hit. The kicker here is that certain body parts of the machines have special effects when destroyed, anything from exploding to dropping off stronger weapons you can use to turn the tides. Each machine has it's own weakness and thus it's own personality, with a story on how the beast was toppled for the first time. It's extra cool that this story is unique for each player. While there are better ways of approaching a fight, it's not like one strategy is miles ahead of everything else in effectiveness, and the strongest weapons in the game (mostly from the DLC) require huge amounts of resources to use for longer than a second, so you can't just bully your way through every fight with the best firepower.

This does mean fighting loses some of it's engagement as you level up and become stronger and more of a hoarder though. It's a power fantasy to see machines that were previously behemoths become mere insects for sure, but you do lose a lot of the adrenaline that early game fights provided. There aren't machines strong enough to provide the same rush past a certain point. Fighting a Bellowback at level 10 is absolutely not the same as fighting a Thunderjaw at level 40. I wish there was a larger category of ""late game"" enemies and something resembling a single ultra-strong final boss machine, instead of swarms of middling-difficulty mobs. They do this a little in the DLC included with the Steam version, which is miles harder than anything in the base game. But even that never reaches the rush of having to sneak around the Nora starting area praying that that yellow exclamation sign doesn't light up, because [b]you know[/b] that Sawtooth will kill you once you've been noticed. 

This issue is a little bit a product of my completionist streak. I reached the max level in the game during the final mission, and was generally a lot stronger than if you play the game with the story as your focus.


Segueing into the story it's..... fine. The narrative is pretty generic, and none of the characters (including Aloy herself) are that interesting, but it hits all the emotional beats you'd expect and is generally serviceable if not forgettable. The side-quests can be cool with unique mechanics (like the one where you get the Oseram cannon and get to bomb the hell out of bandits)! Or they can be the 10th time you're send to track down some random friend/lover/deserter/thief just to have them die on you. It's pretty insulting how much the game tries to discard any moral ambiguity in Aloy by just having all the criminals and bad people die from machine attacks instead of like, anything impactful. 

There's (sometimes) a feature where you can control Aloy's response in a conversation but it's only slightly more than quarter-baked. It's the worst of both worlds: it doesn't change the story in any legitimate way aside from the next 2 lines of dialogue to make you feel like your choices matter, but it also ruins Aloy as her own person since the player now gets to make meaningful character-defining decisions for her. i have to imagine at some point in development this was supposed to actually impact the narrative but was cut for time.

A smart decision in most open-world games is to incorporate exploration into your narrative so the player [b]has[/b] to see the world you've spent years creating. Breath of the Wild (the only open-world game as we all know) does this by giving the player the choice of exploring any of the 4 cardinal directions to stumble their way into the story, in any order at that. Horizon Zero Dawn said ""Nah."" and has a story entirely driven by the premise of ""go ride your robot horse in a straight path towards this yellow diamond to see the next cutscene"". Luckily for the team, they sort of clumsily fall into a gold mine here, since you're able to explore the map (which is legitimately good) completely devoid of any thought about the story (which is legitimately mid).


Let's end on the map, which is a real hoot to expand and explore. Tallnecks are awesome, and hearing their thundering booms in the distance is always a treat when you're lost. The game announcing every new machine camp you come across lends to a real sense of progress in your journey. Collectibles being shown on the map ruin a bit of the surprise of finding something unexpected, but it also gets rid of the ""clean-up frustration"" of having to open up a guide online and watch 50 loading screens as you teleport to pick up everything you missed. It also sort of justifies the collectibles having pretty lame rewards, since they're easier to find. There are hard-to-find things that aren't on the map, but they are smartly relegated to being just lore and do not count towards completion percentage, so they're only for people who [b]really[/b] don't like seeing empty boxes in their inventory.

The map is also just genuinely beautiful with a plethora of biomes and flora to explore. The highlight here is the snow areas (they made an entire DLC focused around this), but every part of the map is stunning to look at and they all blend from one to the other seamlessly. We're in a time now when super realistic graphics and scenery is kind of a given for these cinematic-leaning big-budget games, but I often overlook releases like this when they happen, and it feels weird to play them past their relevance, so I'd say this is probably the most realistic game I've played to date, and one of the prettiest at that.

The music adds a little to this visual experience, being more about ambiance then melody; the instrumentation will change based on where in the world you are and how ""tense"" your fight with the machines is.


I write reviews more for myself than other people, but the TLDR for the public is: I do think Horizon Zero Dawn is worth buying today if you're looking for a lengthy open-world game that places a lot of emphasis on exploring a beautiful world at your pace, even if it comes with a weaker, more generic story. 

Even though the sequel is also coming to PC soon, and a lot of it's once unique high points are overshadowed by newer games, it still features probably the best enemy design of the bunch and comes with the sweet bonus of being 75% off during sales.",1705440877,1705441285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A unique atmosphere, with a unique setting, and a story i genuinely havent seen anywhere before.
Proper rough review.

The good:
Again, story is pretty unique, enemies are really fun and varied, youve got loads to upgrade, and loot, different costumes with different bonuses, different weapons(although they basically follow a tier progression, up untill the very end dlc items that  are just OP which is not bad btw)
The combat, is unique and feels snappy, each weapon has a purpose, and the game really gives you a way to play the game  the way you want.
Crafting, yep it has crafting.
Loads to explore, vantage points, mugs, zones, its got all the classic open world survival stuff.


The bad/not so good:
Combat - the hitboxes are all over the place, and it seems to be based on dodge timings, as sometimes youll get hit even though youlll have seemingly dodged, as the attack animations dont seem to be visual but frame or some other weird shit based, can get  extremely annoying, especially on harder difficulties(you can get used to this, but its just, infuriating when it happens)

The open world and the questlines/missions - the map is HUGE, with the dlc its even bigger, the  quests are a bit all over the place, so youll be fast traveling a lot! Which isnt a bad thing, just make sure to get the infinite fast travel pack from one of the cities. The collectibles, again, not really an issue, you can buy all of the maps to find them at a merchaint, but it does turn into a bit of a checklist by the time youre nearing endgame, could be a bit, annoying.

The story -  Phew, honestly? its UNIQUE, ill give it that, but it feels a bit, weird sometimes, itll jump between , oh wow look at the people having trouble with x  to save the world from the bad robots, and at some points the tension is just, too and far  between to really keep you hooked. So dont expect something groundbraking like the witcher 3 or red dead 2 or something. Side caviat, the npcs, the facial animations are, odd in the base game, eyes wobbling all over, and npcs just stand there wide eyed whilst talking to you,its extremely offputting in the beginning (they did learn from it because when youll start the DLC content its like a whole new game in that regard, so id save it for last!)



Overrall? The game is really good, its not perfect, but for their first installment , they hit the nail on the head in my opinion.
Ive beat this game over the span of a week, taking breaks occasionally to keep it fresh , and it was a blast, will deffo be doing a ng+ on ultrahard (oh yeah theres even more content there if you like the game well enough)
Because its a pretty old game by now, id wait for a sale to get it, although after 70 hours, with probably more if i commit to a ng+ id say it is worth the full price if youre REALLY on the fence.

Looking forward to playing the sequel, when it finally gets on pc.",1705321330,1705321330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is fine, visuals are great, I'm actually interested in the world building, but the voice acting is just so bad, it makes me not want to play.

The characters just stand their while speaking, its so lifeless. I've heard the frozen wilds DLC improves on these issues, but I can't force myself to play until the DLCunlocks.

This game is not only visually impressive, but the story and the stark contrast between futuristic technology and viking-like culture makes the entire premise all the more interesting and unique to me. The amount of passion that was put into this game is truly shown by all the tiny details that accumulate in adding to the experience and immersion. Not only that, but it's open-world with tons of things to do such as side quests, secrets and collectibles, all plentiful.

The story is excellent, especially with that added contrast I mentioned earlier. Though it might be a little slow to start at the beginning of Aloy's story, it truly becomes more intriguing once you start learning about the robots and how and why they came to be.

From a gameplay perspective, it's not an easy experience. The best comparison I can make is that the combat takes a ""Souls-like"" inspiration, but a couple notches down and with its own unique mechanics such as specific weak spots on every robot, being able to dynamically tear off armor from robots, etc.. It might be hard to get a grasp on everything and understand what equipment is best used for what but once you understand weaknesses and an enemy's animation logic and can dodge properly, everything becomes fundamentally easier. Personally, I played on Hard and only really used the bow most of the game and did fine.

There's lots I'd love to compliment this game for, but all-in-all, it's a game I'd definitely recommend if you like ""Souls-like"" combat, difficulty, story, RPG mechanics, and an open-world.",1705307695,1705308459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The pros: a different take on post-apocalyptic life/gameplay, a good story, and somewhat novel combat.
I'm only really good at writing about flaws, so here they are:
Arrows fly straight, until they disappear at their maximum range. I know she's a genius, but straight arrows are terrible gameplay, period. It doesn't ruin the combat, but it definitely harms it.
Knocked down enemies can be given an extra powerful blow with RB. However, it often doesn't recognize them, so instead you whack them with a light spear attack. This is bad.
The climbing is terrible. There are yellow ropes and metals indicating where you can climb, and she's completely incompetent anywhere else. She will not use her arms anywhere else, so she falls for no reason. It's not well done.
There are other bugs, in a number of places.
Stealth attacks are really weak against most enemies.
You can't control when its nighttime, and with the glare from my windows I can't see crap at night.
Rocks in stealth don’t work right. So instead, they give you a magical single-target whistle.
She screams random things, often when stealthed, including “look out below!”
When she rappels, she jumps off a cliff and throws out an axe on a rope and it magically catches perfectly and she never falls to her death. It's stylish, but incredibly stupid.
There are other problems, but ultimately this is a good game.",1705305013,1705305013,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The mystery of Zero Dawn had me invested from start to finish. There's a ton of unique characters to meet, but I'll admit that most of them aren't super memorable outside of a small handful. There's a bunch of side quests to keep you busy as well, but there's not so many that it feels overwhelming. Some are interesting, others are a little tedious. The enemies are pretty neat, I mean, who doesn't want robot dinosaurs? Not only do they look cool, they're a lot of fun to fight. The combat is all about technique. The game gives you a bunch of tools to mess around with as you discover each new machine's weaknesses and strengths. There's a little bit of stealth too, which breaks up the pace nicely sometimes.

I spent ~90 hrs on this game. It should have been a tight 20 hr game at most.

No one wants to read a wall of text, so here's pro's and con's:

+ Beautiful graphics
+ Character control is smooth and forgiving
+ Story keeps you going
+ Characters that actually have character
+ Characters dealing with emotional situations that drew a tear from me at times
+ 

- Story takes a while to ramp up
- Story has several ""I saw that coming a mile away"" moments
- Story has several plot holes you could drive a bus through (can't say w/o spoilers)
- MASSIVE world map.. that's pointless to explore (no rewards for doing so)
- ""Open World"" busy work done to extremes
- Often quests force you to run back-n-forth to opposite sides of the massive map
- Paltry rewards for demanding quests / collections that demean the experience
- ""Detective Mode"" you have to constantly toggle on/off gets old fast
- ""Every fight is a boss fight"" gets exhausting fast
- Play the way you want (eg: stealth) until game forces you to play its way (eg: forced combat w/o places to hide)
- Contextual commands (eg: press X to do Y action!) are sketchy sometimes

This game is a dichotomy. It could have been a wonderful, tight, 10-20 hr story with light RPG elements and a few, wonderful locations.

Instead, the dev studio decided to make it like every other open world game (Far Cry, Just Cause, Assasin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, etc) and create a massive game world with a ton of busy work to fill it in. This includes ""tower climbs"" to reveal the map, scavenger hunts for junk, side quests for random follks, competitions (eg: hunting time trials.. b/c in a post-apoc world with people worried about killer beasts, we need to have a competition on who can kill them faster! smh).

Now layer in hunting and crafting. But, like most things in this game, take it to extremes, too. Every weapon seems to have it's own ammo pouch. And they each have 4 upgrades. These require common, rare and very rare ingredients to create. But, it's dumb in how they did it. Something requires a rabbit skin. Ok, I'll just kill a rabb-.. wait, why isn't there a skin on the rabbit? Oh, right.. b/c it's a rare drop. So, keep killing rabbits until one drops a skin.

It's just MMO open world tropes like this that force things to be a longer slog than they need be.

Need new gear? Well, the vendor wants money.. plus the heart of some crazy beast that almost killed you last time you fought it. Oh, but the heart is a rare drop. So, go fight 20 more of those until you get it. It just makes you roll your eyes.

They also went with the loot box trend by making most of your rewards loot boxes. Problem is, the loot boxes are filled with junk you find just wandering around. It's not like you get a new weapon or other interesting stuff. Only very few quests do that. Most give you an ""extraordinary"" loot box that, when opened, feels like someone just handed you their trash to go take to the dump. It makes whatever grand experience you just had surviving beasts or bandits by the skin of your teeth feel utterly insulting when someone hands you a bin of common trinkets you could have found on your own in 2 seconds.

The game world isn't worth exploring. A road leading to a dead-end towards a mountain is just a dead-end. There's no magic waiting for you if you check it out. There is vast expanses of emptiness on the map, and they are just that.. empty.

The most excitement you'll have is hunting or evading the robo beasts, which gets harder the further into the game you go.

The combats can get utterly ridiculous, even with Aloy being high level. You can hp every level, but it feels like they secretly also raise your damage amount. Because my gear wasn't upgraded very much, but I was one or two shotting things that were giving me serious trouble early in the game. I don't think it was skill. I feel like the game just cheats and makes you secretly more powerful as you level without you knowing. Sort of like how Borderlands has it's annoying level system, where anything one or two levels higher than you is god-like, but anything lower level than you is a push-over.. just artificially done like that.

The story is interesting, but that's why the slog of the open world aspect makes it so dichotomous. You're following along this adult story of serious events, then spending 90% of your time chasing animals around for rare drops, or going and screwing around in the hunting time trials or other dumb stuff. The fate of humanity is on your shoulders, but, ok, I'll go stop by the hunting grounds and play some games for a bit. No big rush. *rolls eyes*

It's like having a steak dinner, but in between each bite of delicious steak you're expected to eat a basket of bread. At first, the bread is tasty. But, then you realize that, at the pace things are going, this meal is going to be 20 baskets of bread to 1 tiny steak when you're done.

I'd much rather they consolidated certain events into a single, special one than to have multiples of it wasting more time. EG: you have several that let you control animals. I'd rather just have one that unlocks all the animals.

The game should have removed the scavenger hunts, consolidated some quests, etc, etc, and focused on getting the player to the next plot point as soon as possible to keep the momentum going.

Instead, we got this.

If you can slog it out for 50+ hrs with open world game tropes, then this game is worth a shot for the story. Otherwise, avoid.

I love everything about this game. Absolutely worth it. Masterpiece.

Story is great, graphics looks really good. Tons of things to explore, collect, complete. You discover a huge world with lots of characters, their background stories, etc. I really like to dialogues with the NPCs as well.

Definitely recommended if you like these types of games.

Update: just finished all 79 achievements. This is my first steam game where I went for all achievements. I enjoyed every minute of it. It become my favorite game of all time. Can't wait for Forbidden West to come out on PC!",1702041881,1705094285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BUT THE COMBAT SUCKS BALLS!
-hitboxes are janky (enemies sometimes run in your general direction and stunlock you as a result);
-FORGET about ever using melee! you'll get stunlocked (or at least take like 60% damage in a single hit) if you try to melee; and trying to finish downed/stunned enemies usually does LESS damage than shooting arrows in a weakpoint you probably can't see or is covered in armor;
-you can't even time your melee attacks, you have to button mash, and that results in the above point;
+WEAKNESSES! That's literally the only reason the combat would ever be enjoyable! There's elements and weakpoints on enemies that are kinda fun to break off, but the fact that melee is literally not an option because of all this, kinda makes the combat boring;
+if you like stealth, this game is a stealth game; encounters take so much less time and frustration if you just stealth whenever you can
-UNLESS THE PROMPT DISAPPEARS RIGHT WHEN YOU CLICK IT AND YOU FUCKING ATTACK INSTEAD OF STEALTH-TAKEDOWN-ING, ALERTING EVERYONE IN A 5KM RADIUS (the range is not an issue; exaggerating for the funny)

Very short review:

The story is very good, the characters are well written. There are also collectibles that you can read or listen to, they add quite a bit to the lore. The environment is well made, there are lots of beautiful places scattered around the world, there's also somewhat of an environmental storytelling. The different machine designs are pretty uniqe and well thought out. The sound design is nice and I love the music. One thing I found quite annoying was that I ran out of inventory space pretty often which in return made me remove/salvage some items that I would've rather kept. I also didn't really know what was important to keep at times.

Kickin' it off, where do we even start with this badass piece of art? It's like ""God of War"" hooked up with some high-class sci-fi saga, no deities attached. And out popped this masterpiece. Folks, we're jaw-deep in primo graphics, a story that's gonna blast your brain, and combat mechanics smoother than a corpo's lie.

I'm a story gonk, no denyin'. This game? It's like shooting purest narrative adrenaline straight into your veins. Dive deep into this one and you're swimming in a tale smoother than Johnny Silverhand’s last solo. ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" doesn’t just deliver; it kicks the door down and throws a fucken party.

Enter stage left: Aloy. This young chick's not just some Amazonian wanna be; she's a damn typhoon of badassery. With quips as sharp as 'er arrows, slinging sarcasm (if you choose the right words) and arrows with the same deadly precision.. Sure, she's playing for the good guys, but in a world that's a few clicks shy of total anarchy, her style of good-hearted ass-kickin' is a real breath of fresh air.

Now, let's talk heat. Aloy's packin' bows, arrows, and spears like she’s Robin Hood’s tech-savvy offspring. Spot a Bellowback? Pop its cargo sac, and it's light-show time, baby. And wranglin' those metal monsters? It’s like hackin' a Militech server on steroids – pure edge-of-your-seat, chrome-cool action.

This game slams you with urgency right from the start, like a mystery wrapped in an enigma, then dunked in secret sauce. No spoilers here, just a big-ass thumbs up for the wild ride.

To close out this braindance: Was it a blast? Damn straight. Pumped for the sequel? Like a fucken hacker on the edge of a breakthrough. ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" isn’t just a game; it’s an epic freakin' voyage. Till the next time we jack in, choombas. This is Ausy, logging off.

This game has pretty much everthing i like in a game an open world which is quite large especially with the expansion of the Frozen Wilds, quite a few costumes with different attributes for different occasions as well as weapons just wish we can have lengendary versions of it but still really good, phenomenal graphics, incredible story, ""strong"" MC and an amazing combat system.

Our main character Aloy is a brave, badass and beautiful girl that was gone throught many difficult moments in her life that make him who she is now, there are also many others interesting characters like Sylens and Talanah.
The story it self im safe to say that was literally the best in my personal opinion across the games i've played till today really intriguing.

The gameplay is a beautiful balance between stealth and pseudo bossfight mechanics for each of the creatures (enabling both the ""low level boss monster becomes a regular enemy at higher levels"" thing, along with ""shoot here to disable ability X"" type gameplay). The setting is interesting and well developed, but the story doesn't give away too much too fast. The mystery of *why* there are robot animals everywhere is teased and slowly revealed along with exactly who you are. 
Bonus points for the story integration with the ""Frozen Wilds"" DLC (included for free) which can be played almost as soon as you get access to the area rather than locking it behind the final mission. As a result, dialog both in the main quest and the DLC can change depending on what parts of the mystery your character has discovered, dynamically making sense that you can ask about thing X but not thing Y. 
The game also features a cool system where if you want to craft an upgrade or buy an item and you don't have the parts (or even if you don't have the money) for it, you can have it *make a quest for you* to get those items, and that quest will dynamically point you at the best place to farm those items. More games need a to-do list like that.

This game, despite some issues I have with it - plot-wise, for example, there's an element of sci-fi which goes against moral values we hold, as well as some gameplay elements I know some Catholics would object to - is deeply, truly, profoundly Catholic. For the first time I have played a video game which wasn't something with a crude, ""squint and you can kind of see it"" representation of Catholicism that also wasn't in hatred of my people; rather, this is a game which has so many deep presentations of the Faith I hold which makes me feel, yes! I'm finally represented in a game! Yes! There are people out there who love to make games, high-quality, holy games which present the themes of my Faith even in characters who in the game, do not believe!

I mean, Rost naming Aloy in a religious reitual some days after she was born, without a mother - is so much a reflection of the Lord, being born without a biological Father, being named by His foster-father, St. Joseph, 8 days after His birth into a world which is cruel, cold, and relentlessly dangerous. How much love must they have poured into this game! How much awe and wonder does this evoke in me! How much glory do people skim over when they play this - unaware of the truly deep beauty this game hides just below its surface?

Yes, Aloy may be an atheist in the game; yes, she may not ever believe in my Faith, even if It were shown her - etc, etc, etc. Yes. People can see this game as anti-religion. But I see the opposite: a game which is anti-idols (made of metal, mostly in the game) but which uses these peoples' faiths, to review our own religious beliefs and show that even among those who are not Catholic, there is still the Lord showing Himself on ways they themselves can only understand, reaching out beyond what they know, beyond what I might be uncomfortable with, saying, ""I am here, and I want you to know you matter to Me! That is why this game exists - beyond the images on the screen, there is Me.""

And yet, while all this is good - great, even! - I had to stop playing after about 24 hours because the plot becoming too heavy of a depressing burden. Not that I don't love the characters, or the world, but at one point, I felt this game revealed within me a fearful depression that was too much for me, to healthily continue this game. At least for now.

Still, besides that - it has holiness embedded within it beyond the surface, but barely so. I recommend this game just for that. I know this game means a lot to many people for many reasons - some of which I would heartily either disagree with or maybe even just like to discuss with them - but for me, this game matters because of its beauty, and that I felt truly presented and represented by a game which by no means is small. This game is cool. I finally feel there is a game out there I can say, ""It shows ME! It shows my Faith! My life, my beliefs! And so many people love it in turn!""

Thank you for whoever put so many of these things into a game. I finally feel like I am shown in and through a game. I feel happy to say that, nobody else could have made a game like this which shows me. My people. My family. We finally get to game in a way that shows us for us, not a caricature.

My only complaint is attaining the final achievements. Having to beat a NG+ on ""Ultra Hard"" is a pain. Grinding currency on an easier difficulty in order to be able to purchase the ""Adept"" weapons in NG+ isn't fun. It's the last achievement I need though, so I'm suffering through it.

Edit: Approximately 15 hours later I have finished Ultra Hard on NG+. The grinding for money before the switch to NG+ wasn't as bad as I'd thought it would be.

It seems to be an interesting game at first glace, with really good visuals and a mysterious, beautiful world to investigate and weapons to try out on the different enemies.
Turned out that the only good thing is the looks on this game, the game mechanics are quite bad.
Even though the enemies have certain ""weak spots"" (or so the game says, the reality is that whatever I do and wherever I hit them, they take very little damage regardless of how much I buff my weapons), it's always a struggle to beat them, and very rapidly (if there's no tall grass to hide in) you get a horde of jumping beasts hitting you, no matter how careful and stealthy you tried to be, and it will be very often your end.
Fighting humans was the most boring, poorly experience in a game I had in a very, very long time. There's just no strategy to use. Just wait away and shoot arrows one by one. So bad.
I started playing the game with a controller, but I noticed from the beginning that it wouldn't be possible to enjoy sitting back with it, as the aiming was absolutely impaired by the poor precision of the aiming sensibility.
Even after switching to play with keyboard and mouse, I found the use of traps, potions and abilities VERY frustrating, why the HELL they put these three completely different actions in one single key, for which you have to scroll with left and right keys through about 10 items in the middle of a battle with some overpowered beast just jumping over you and smashing?! It's pretty much impossible to use this in battle, I can't believe devs were ok with this functionality all the way up to the release of the game, and more so the people playing don't mind this!. This pretty much destroyed the game for me, as every combat is very difficult and you really need to use all these resources in most of them. Even walking prepared into a battle, with the item selected won't help, because you'll probably have to use 3 or 4, which can't even be sorted on your preference. Their accessibility is abysmal and it absolutely kills the fun of the combat, to the point of ALT+F4 TF out of the game.
Other things that I noticed in time are that the weapons and costumes, the loot and crafting are very basic and obsolete in essence, and definitely not fun or exciting to pursue, which as a consequence makes the exploring less exciting.
I found really cool landscapes which looked amazing visually, but there was nothing to be found within besides a generic pile of scrap to loot actually..scrap..and they were just a view from far. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
In fact, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT OF A GAME.
I'm actually curious about seeing more of the map, I'm curious, but the fact that I would have to force myself to play this game in order to satisfy that curiosity, instead of being pulled by fun mechanics and enjoy all the work that it would take, says a lot of how broken the game mechanics are. At least for me. I see a lot of people loved this game, but I didn't even find the story interesting, in that matter, it didn't catch me a bit from the beginning. A lot of talking doesn't make a good story, or a ""story deep"" as the Steam tag says.
Just another machine holocaust with a society regression to tribe life. Haven't we see that already, anyways?


First review starting the game:
I'm really enjoying this game (far from finishing it yet!), I love the post apocalyptic setting, it really does a great job with the exploring part, the world looks beautiful and intriguing in knowing how everything went wrong for the world as we know it.
There are lots of different areas and caves to explore and they really look beautiful.
The character is very expressive and likeable, the NPCs are also well acted.
A few things bother me though, specially in terms of combat. I'm playing with a controller now, and I find VERY difficult to aim to small objects (most of robotic enemies have weak points to shoot at to defeat them easier) as there's no sensitivity adjustment when aiming the ranged weapon (something that's been implemented decades ago!!) and aiming precisely with the camera sensitivity is almost impossible. This takes a LOT of the fun to have with the game mechanics, so it's a BIG deal!! Not a game breaker, but it really frustrates me not to be able to aim precisely and I don't want to be sitting in front of my computer with a mouse and keyboard.. It's a real shame. I thought it could be a weapon perk or a skill to improve but it doesn't look like it so far.
There's a skill to slow time, but it doesn't help really, as a tiny little touch of the stick will move the reticle all the way past over the target.
Decreasing the view sensibility would make looking around too slow, so I'm stuck with the poor aiming.
The melee fighting is not great neither, pretty much a button smasher and the occasional roll to the side, it could be done way more complex and satisfying with such a variety of enemies to fight!

The traversing could be more polished too, the character gets stuck in really short jumps and ledges where baby Lara Croft wouldn't have a problem.

Besides all these quite big issues, I'm actually enjoying the exploration side of the game, I loved to see how the full moon was peeking from behind the mountain peaks and illuminating the tree tops in real time while I was hiding in the bushes from a pack of angry enemies wanting my blood. A beautiful moment.

The idea of fighting robots and breaking apart huge machines is great, but the rest of the game is just mediocre to a point where it is just boring, and it stretches for way too long.

The story is meh, and I could not care less about it. My biggest problem was with Aloy who is one of the most blank and boring characters I have ever seen in the history of video games, on top of that she can be annoying with her sarcastic comments or constant whispering of her dialogue lines, making me think that the voice actress playing her was incompetent. And she never stops talking, to the point she will tell you solutions to so called ""puzzles"" before you would even have a chance to think of them yourself. In terms of gameplay, she was given some lousy controls and animations.

The landscape looks beautiful until you realize it is just a traversable empty area with nothing interesting to witness, then you are fed up with it for the rest of the game.

Another thing that I don't like a lot about this game is how scripted everything is, including mechanics, and how limited my experience with the game has become because of that scripting. The devs clearly wanted the player to do everything in the game in a very specific way and they give no freedom to achieve those goals in any other way.",1703371841,1704576877,False,2,0,0.477911651134490967,0,True,False,False

I personally don't think the game is amazing and I can understand why many people wouldn't like it. However, I found that the combat was some of the most fun combat of any ARPG I have played in ages outside of the Batman Arkham series and Shadow of War. It is just deep enough to force players to focus on aim and elemental weaknesses at higher difficulties. The game unfortunately is far too easy even on Ultra Hard if you really pay attention to stuns. Everything seems to be capable of doing stuns once you accumulate enough damage and it makes it fairly trivial to stun an entire group of enemies for brief moments while you take on the larger ones.

The story of the game is a mixed bag. The story that is happening at the present time the game takes place is nothing to write home about but it has it's moments. However, the story that takes place that you find through video logs, voice logs, and text logs is some of the best sci-fi world building/writing I have ever seen in a video game. The Faro Plague is such a unique antagonist and I was absolutely hooked on finding every single log I could find in the open world and campaign missions just to flesh out that narrative more.

This game has been sitting in my library for almost a year. After seeing the gameplay, it was interesting, but it was pending because there were many other things to play. But I started playing HZD because the Horizon Zero Dawn PC release is near, and it was necessary to play it before it was released. Otherwise, it would still be on the pending list.

Literally, this game is a gem. Emotionally attached at the beginning. Although it was slow based there, after starting to explore, it is at a different level.
Tribes vs Machines is really unbelievable combo, but its crafted perfectly here !!!

I am a HUGE fan the final fantasy games and this one caught my attention because it gave me instant Final Fantasy type vibes from the trailer I had watched. I happened to purchase this game on a Black Friday sale and I could not be happier that I had!! Let me start by saying that the atmosphere, cinema photography, the music made it all so easy to get lost within the world! The story line was amazing and literally had me wanting more. I found myself fighting and struggling within...Do I hurry through the mission story line or do I complete some side quests along the way? Ultimately I ended up doing some side quests along the way but I found myself longing to know more of Aloy's story. I found myself becoming so invested in some of the characters that I literally would become a bit emotional with watching some of the scenes. Yes, I am a bit of an emotional ball of nutty feelings most the time, but it's not very often I find myself emotionally invested in characters in video games and this is one game that was able to achieve that for me! So big Kudo points for that!

Again I cannot say how beautiful the layout of the game truly is! Mechanical animals roam rampant in this vast open world game which after a certain point in the game you learn how to override them and are able to use a mechanical beast to aid you in part of your journey. My favorite was the option of riding a mount (a mechanical horse, bull, or ram). I often just found myself riding from point A to point B because of the enjoyment, plus there's always the perk of being able to grab more items along the way. 

This game is easy enough to finish without having to purchase the frozen wild however the frozen wild seems like it may contribute more to the story of one of the tribes that Aloy meets along the way. I haven't completed the Frozen Wild yet at the time of writing this review. In fact I'm just getting ready to start it.  Make sure once you have completed the game though that you watch a scene they have added at the end of the game after the credits. It sets up for the sequel that is coming later this year. Oh goodness I don't think I've been this excited for a game release in a loooong time!!! Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and even with over 88 hours invested into it I still have plenty left to do to complete it 100% but I don't mind. I have loved every minute of it, and don't dread investing anymore time in the game either.

The dialogues with npc are facepalm cringe worthy at best, the situations hero gets into are as well. The main protagonist is a strong independent ginger, not much more to say, i think it is self explanatory. The combat felt challenging, and requiring pixel perfect aiming, and sometimes not even that worked, i guess there were some troubles with the port? Also platforming, sometimes hero would not grab a ledge, that it should, and you would fall to your death, or did not fire from the bow when it should. I also often died because got stuck in places, and could not get out, or enemy would drive you into the corner and would not let you get up, felt a bit strange.

The Good
NPC's actually do something. There are a lot of games that have companions that don't help, or hinder the experience. 
Doing side content makes it worth it, especially in the end. 
Combat is fun with lots of variety in enemies.
Game mechanics are quick and easy to learn.

The Bad
Crashed 3 times from start to 44h playtime.
NPC's conversations were mostly bland or awkward.
Story was okay.

DLC
The starter weapons and armor dlc is useful in the beginning.

I am over the moon about the animation quality of Horizon Zero Dawn. The playing character, Aloy, ran, swam, climbed and fought with such a fluid grace that it pretty much ruined me for want of another playing character. 
The dialogue is well thought out with splashes of humor. The voice acting is amazing. I could just go on and on as to how fantastic this game is but the truth is you have to play it yourself.

The entire dinorobots schtick gets stale once you realize how to work with it. Open world is basically an Ubiworld style, meaning that all side content is just like playing a single player MMO fetch quests with no meaning. RPG progression feels meaningless as you get abilities rather fast and items don't really need replacing a lot once you buy some better stuff early on. I could go on. The story and setting actually seems very interesting but the pacing of it is terrible in the 12 hours I spent with it. Even AC Odyssey with it's terrible mandatory level grinds felt better paced.

The game is beautiful (apart from lip syncing), runs very smoothly even on midrange hardware and is stable - definitely seen worse PS ports to PC... and it might just be your vibe, but for me it just didn't click at all.

Mechanics Wise: When i first started the game, the game was a bit hard for me as i am not use to this open world RPG unlike Assassin's Creed Games. Overtime, the mechanics was easy to learn and develop which made me enjoy this game a lot. Grinding Crafting materials for weapons and armor was a really fun aspect of this game!. Different Weapon rarity doing different damage multipliers really teaches me what i should use my materials on. 

Story wise: Aloy is such a Babe <3. She has really Good character development, from being an outcast of a tribe to saving the earth from machines taking over. PS: She is hot af, love her hair. x)

Uninteresting combat and climbing, pointless crafting mechanics, boring characters, stale performances, awkward cutscene animations. Enemies are kinda interesting and the costume design is pretty good. The world looks pretty and the art direction looks nice, although it lacks a unique identity.

I can't say much about the story because I didn't get very far in but it seems to be going in the direction of some JJ Abrams mystery box bullshit. The storytelling equivalent of clickbait. Read the Wikipedia article if you really want to know what's in the box. I also get the vibe that the story isn't that important but the game really doesn't have anything else going for it.

It's a shame to see all this talent and effort wasted on something so bland and uninteresting. Imagine walking into a 3 Michelin star restaurant and being served br❤️tish food. The only redeeming factor of this massive waste of resources is that the engine was reused for Death Stranding, a game with an actual vision.

This game so well made that i fully found myself invested and immersed in it from start to finish. The game play is spectacular, the story is heavy and well told and the environment feels realistic and lived in in a way that is very hard to replicate.

I heard there were issues with the PC port when it came out, but no recent reviews show this so wanted to let people know in case they think its been completely fixed. You may have issues.

I ended up beating the main story in about 25 hours of play time, and at no point was I bored or feeling like the game was dragging on. Combat felt awesome, difficulty was brutal at some points until you learn the machines attack patterns.

I love the fact that the side missions are 100% optional. I did my fair share of what I felt was interesting and still ended up well over the recommended level for the final boss. 

The less than stellar parts: inventory management, crafting and gear. It all felt tact on, which seems odd for a game where you're surviving and traversing the wild. I ended up with a ton of extra supplies that by the end of the game I just stopped picking up stuff entirely. Weapon upgrades felt fine, but armor upgrades felt lacking.

Good story and voice-acting, exceptional world-building, open-world without being too heavy on the grinding, and even the ""repetitive"" (same-style) side content had enough variation to not make you do the same thing over and over. On top of that it looks amazing, isn't overly hardware-demanding, and the port to PC is well executed.

Overall plays better with a controller than with mouse and keyboard (and that's spoken by someone who only takes to the controller as last resort. Newest console I own is from 1999), but neither option is outright bad.

Takes some combat skill to beat which includes a fair bunch of simultaneous controls and stuff, so wouldn't recommend to players who only want a story-experience but don't want to/aren't able to do typical ""console boss fights"" even on easy difficulties, but for everyone else I strongly recommend the game.

The game has a beautiful open world that will give you many photo-ops as you walk through a forest into a clearing or climb a ridge to see a vast mountain chain. The story has great voice acting and writing for the main characters, and lots of scattered datapoints that construct a chillingly-plausible depiction of humanity's future (hint: look out for white cubes on your compass). Depending on difficulty, the close-combat fights will force you to be prepared or pay the price, and over time you unlock more abilities and develop real skills that make you better at combat without grinding. The included post-main-campaign expansion will push you to your limit, and there's a new-game+ mode if you want to go beyond.

Overall, an easy recommendation for anyone who likes grand open-world exploration games. Think Breath of the Wild or Far Cry, but with much more lore than the former and more up-close and lower-tech fighting than the latter.",1704186124,1704186124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first time I played this game was on my ps4 pro, it was one of the reasons why I even bought that console honestly.
I ended up loving the game and played through it 2 times on that console. So here I am playing through it on my pc still loving every single moment. 
The story gets to me, the design of the machines, the design of the character and ofc, the world itself. The history that is going on in this world also intrigues me to no end to the point that I just sit there and read text after text of information I find. I just want to know more about the world to the point that I will stop playing just to read about it.
Are there some flaws? Of course, what game doesn’t have flaws. When I first played it I didn’t notice it as much, but now after playing it for a third time I noticed that I found the climbing a little bit annoying. Sometimes it wasn’t super clear what ledges I could climb and which ones I couldn’t, I think the main issue stems from the fact that the ledges you can climb up have a white coloured marking on it. Which is a bit hard to see when the area is either filled with snow or when the light shines a little bit too brightly upon it. It’s a bit of a nitpick but still a flaw so I felt it was worth mentioning. 

I cannot recommend this game enough. If you love a story driven game with interesting characters, an interesting world that is full of life, running around all over the place (or ride) to explore? Then I would recommend this game to you.


Reason why I bought it:
I did decide to buy it on sale when I saw that the sequel was announced to be released early 2024, a game that I also bought for the ps4 but sadly it ended up crashing my ps4, so I haven’t played it since in fear that it will crash it again and this time the console won’t start. I wasn’t willing to risk it and now I can soon finally play that game again and actually finish it.

Aloy sometimes have a hard time getting stuck on invisible edges that can be frustrating during fights.
The armor for MC is little bit dull in my opinion, I would like to have more options.

The Witcher 3 inspiration is worn pretty clearly on Horizon's sleeve, but everything it copies, just makes me wish I was playing Witcher instead.

The good is the creature design - fighting robot dinosaurs is just as cool as it sounds on paper. Weapons also feel pretty satisfying. There's also a wealth of straight up scenery porn for anyone that wants to make use of the game's built in camera mode, and just get lost in the sprawling hinterlands. 

The Bad: Pretty much everything else, including elements from the good. Very few characters feel nuanced, and even personal quests for other characters that seem to hold a great sense of significance, winds up being largely unfulfilling and underwhelming - solving the legend of Redmaw, being a prime example. The way people and documents built that guy up, I thought I'd be facing Zacama or something, but it was just a slightly tougher t-rex than normal. 

Traveling the countryside feels like an incredible chore. You know something is wrong when you're burning through fast travels just so you can finish the game sooner. When you have an encounter with one creature, you're liable to encounter another group of creatures, just from hearing the commotion. Do the different species of creatures brawl with each other out of territorial instinct, like you'd see in Monster Hunter? Nope. It's a tightly coordinated effort of Ravagers, Sabertooths, Scrappers, Watchers, Longlegs, and of course, Glinthawks - all against the woefully average Aloy. And when you find out why machines don't attack each other(with the exceptions of ones you have to individually hack and override), it's the kind of reveal that just feels insulting to the player's intelligence. 

I don't know who on the committee was so hung up over Glinthawks, but they are the biggest chore to deal with, and they never stop being dangerous in groups. And they easily make up the fixture of more sidequests and missions than any other creature in the game, combined. Just the glinthawks alone make me never want to touch this cancerous game again. Just imagine having an ability to slow down time to line up your killing shot, and because you gotta tilt you camera up at a cowardly opponent that's always up in the air, the camera keeps getting crowded out by the foliage you're standing or crouching in. That's not a good challenge, that's just sloppy, stupid game design. 

If I do play anymore beyond this review, it'll only be due to the sunk cost fallacy and me stubbornly not allowing this game to be a  complete waste of time, as opposed to me genuinely enjoying the journey. I know how the game wants the player to play it, but you burn through so much Blaze while crafting ammo for your most powerful and useful weapons, and it in turn burns out your wallet when you resupply. Overall, it's not as if I can't handle a good challenge. But the challenging elements of this game seem to mostly be implemented to be tedious and infuriating, rather than testing the player's skill or stealth or ingenuity. It feels like an amateur effort from a Publisher that has decades' worth of experience making much better exclusives. 

Now admittedly, I should also give a begrudging merit to this game, in that Horizon runs exactly as intended. Even if your graphics card is behind the game's preferred hardware specs, it doesn't seem like that'll affect your experience much. So if you like having to wrangle some grass eater every single time you need a Roche, you like having to constantly waste resources that take a lot of time to gather, and tiptoe through mountainous environments that make your footing difficult to manage, and you somehow absolutely LOVE dealing with the millions of Glinthawks this game throws at you, then there are at least some players that will appreciate Horizon more than I did. No real game breaking experiences other than temporary freezes when saving at campfires.  

Also, as a closing thought, if you think I'm being totally unfair to this game, have a look at all the achievements. I hardly consider myself an achievement hunter, but a fair number of the ones I've scored have barely been touched by anymore than 15-30 percent of the playerbase, particularly the late game ones. And they weren't like side stuff you really gotta dig around online to discover, they're just missions that push the main story forward. Seems I'm not the only one that got tired of this game's tedium.

tl;dr - Don't touch this game for any less than a 90% discount. And even then, your time is still much better spent on Monster Hunter and Witcher 3.",1623388105,1704080426,False,1,1,0.417049646377563477,0,True,False,False

Certain aspects of this game reminds me of Far Cry - which I also really liked. It might not be an amazing comparison between the two, but after exploring the open world and getting to do what I want and play how I want - I immediately thought of it. 

Haven't fully beat the game yet, but after playing for a good amount of hours - I definitely think that it is a good game and worth it. Especially on sale. 

The sequel is also coming to Steam early next year, so I will be keeping an eye out on that once I complete this one.

No stutter, no crashes even modded, this game is stable. I'm on a GTX1650, Intel core i5 and it runs smoothly. Weapon selection is good and in line with the context. Armours are varied and have style. I would like a way to better upgrade them like weapons too, but i think it's better in The Forbidden West. Side quests are a little repetitive but makes you discover the land so they are fun to do in the end. This game is polished like every Sony games i have played. Thought that the skills tree needed a little bit more depth to it, the skills are all useful in many specific situations, but easy to max out so you become OP kinda fast even on harder difficulties. Overall this is by me a good game to try and dive into. NG+ is a must now a days and NG+ for HZD is very enjoyable. When you master the way to destroy those bigger and meaner machines, you're not scared any more and the game switches to, machines own me to, i'm the master here. Even when there is some machines that are still difficult after NG+ like those RockBreakers. They all have multiple ways to destroy them and when you find those tactics, the machines are less scary, because yea, thay are scary at first. So yea i recommend this game to every open world, slash/action RPG lovers and Thanks Sony for putting time and efforts to create a good game with a nice world for us. Oh and i wanted to say, i think this game is a spiritual successor to Heavenly Sword, i'm just saying, cause i was waiting for a Heavenly Sword 2 Nariko's come back or something, but it never happened so, i'm glade Aloy's here. After HZD The Forbiden West, Sony should think about letting us create a character and make it a full blown RPG by giving us the beautiful world they made and letting us live this world without a forced character.

Best story and characters that I've seen in a long time.
At 128 hours for the play through of the main quest-line, I'm really happy with the whole experience.
The arc pulls you along and feeds you bits of the mystery and story surrounding the main character as you go. It's engaging and intelligent. It has characters to like and characters to despise. I had a lot of fun for the most part - once I got a right proper hang of combat life got a lot better for Aloy :D
Got it crazy on sale, but would have been quite happy paying full price for it, and won't hesitate to pick up expansions as they become available on PC.

It really has not had a fare try since I bought Titan 2 with all the bells an whistles while on sale dirt cheap.

Go in as a soldier save the damsel in a sexy dress. "") this time your the sexy woman so I have no issues with that. Kind of nice to have to depend on out of the normal hack and slash.

I was so thankful that I did not play this game prior to this PC. I had bought it a longtime ago but my other PC was not that great. I wanted to get a killer PC and have the Maximum affect to get the best out of it experience wise. The sound Music wise I am not sure. I turn it off and listen to all the ambient noise.

I like:
        1) The lore is interesting. This is a very interesting world they crafted. The detail and variety of machines, as well as the forbidden old world ""dungeon"" areas are fun to explore. 
        2) Combat feels good. I find Aloy controls pretty well and I was never taken out of combat immersion because of those issues. 

I don't like:
          1) Facial animations are terrible and pulled me out of this game every time. Most npc's look like they are stoned af - I dunno. There is something really off with the eyes. They also move like animatronics during dialogue. Most things in the game world are of a higher quality and I found it jarring. 
           2) Aloy is boring af and this spills into the entire experience for me. She's not funny at all. She does bad ass things, but Aloy is not a bad ass; more like a glib game warden.

great game for playing while listening to a podcast or something

long version:
games feels worse when it very very close to greatness but just falls short. rather than when its flaws are very visible and you can appreciate the things it does well. and that is the case with Horizon zero dawn.

everything it does is very close to being excellent but it just falls short... and you can see the glimmers of greatness that could be there if it was just slightly different. and it is like that on everything.

-the world and story could have been good... if was not tossed in your face like a tech startup presentation

-the monsters designs are amazing and the mechanics fighting them are interesting... but dodging and everything else never works properly. is all either too easy or you getting hit by things that are too finicky to dodge

-the world is beautiful to explore... and yet you are limited climbing only on very specific colored hand grip places, your character is capable to amazing acrobatics and climbing feats on those, but is stoped by walls and rocks on her neck height

i could go on, but you can apply that to everything in the game. 
the end result is a game that would have been great... 20 years ago. is not bad by any means, but eehhhhh",1703951703,1703951898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

These games always feel the same to me and those gameplay elements always feel like i'm wasting my time.

So yeah: Probably a good game for anyone who likes ubisoft formula open world playground style games, but i don't like it at all.

Rewarding game play and amazing story

The game itself isn't too difficult but your first playthrough you'll die a lot as a punishment for bad positioning or not knowing the attack patterns of enemies. (which is partly why its fun)

There is probably a lot more to find and enjoy but frankly if you max out the best gear you can get in normal then starting a new game+ makes it a bit too easy as the only limiting factor is how many resources are on you and how wasteful you are.

10/10 can't wait for the next release sometime in the new year

However, it turned out to be a hybrid of a FarCry-style fetch quest and Tomb Raider-esque character dynamics, but in a third-person shooter format. The storyline is lackluster, riddled with nonsensical elements and plot holes, making the gameplay tedious and monotonous. It's essentially a journey from one point to another, interspersed with frequent yet irrelevant cutscenes that add little to the overall experience. The combat mechanics are hit or miss, oscillating between being overly simplistic and frustratingly dependent on luck. The weapons, though intended to be innovative, come off as trite and uninspired. The ""Focus"" feature feels like a leftover developer tool rather than a thoughtfully integrated game element. As of now, the game feels superficial and disappointing. I plan to continue playing for a bit longer, but my hopes aren't high. On a positive note, the graphics are decent, and the game runs smoothly. However, the cutscenes, presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio despite playing on a widescreen, are a major letdown.

I didn't know what to expect when I first got this game, I didn't notice the stealth tag as it is pretty low on the tags, but the game is highly built around stealth. I usually have not been much of a fan of stealth games, however Horizon Zero Dawn allows for what I call ""loud stealth"" which is if you get spotted while sneaking, you are more than capable to hold your ground in a fight. Stealth is not necessary to beat this game, and when you play the game like I do, you use stealth as an opening tool to combat before going in bows blazing. The stealth is somewhat similar to the Assassins creed games.

There are options in the dialogues which allow you to respond to the conversation in one of 3 ways; compassion, intelligence, or with anger. It's not a lot of options but it is nice that there are at least some options as to how you would like your main character to act and behave for role playing purposes. It was satisfying to play as a compassionate character with the occasional cunning idea, but at the end of the game when dealing with one of the games major villains, I was able to show them no mercy which to me was more meaningful. I'm not certain but I don't believe the dialogue options affect the story, so don't worry about thinking too hard on which option you choose and if it's the ""right one"".

One of the things that stands out the most about this game is the atmosphere. The world creates this sense of wonder as to how things are primitive yet futuristic at the same time. The game does a good job at pacing how they tell you why the world is the way that it is without feeling like there is an info dump as well as giving you enough time to digest last piece of the stories puzzle before giving you another.

I don't remember coming across any major bugs or glitches in my play through except one which was apparently somewhat common in the steam port, when you unlock the ability to knock 2-3 arrows in your bow, it just doesn't work as if you didn't unlock the ability. This may have to do with the fact that I didn't play with a controller, this bug is by no mean game breaking but I feel that it is at least worth mentioning when leaving a review. 

Overall the game is great and I would highly recommend anyone to play this game if they haven't. Graphics are good, the story is good, the core game play of the game is good, and there is plenty of content in the game to keep you busy.  The game also frequently goes on sale and is certainly worth the money, I am eagerly awaiting the next game!",1703782691,1703782691,True,24,0,0.664771437644958496,0,True,False,False

I would expect at least 1440p/high settings but in game I only get 40-55 FPS and it's something I didn't expect at all. and I believe my specs are higher than the recommended for the game. what a shame.

UPDATE: requested a refund last night. the port (not the game) is that bad that it made me try Fallout 76 for the first time instead (where I get stable 60FPS on Ultra/1080p or 50-60FPS on Ultra/4K).

Bought it 2 years ago and had to refund it due to frequent crashes, seemed like a memory allocation problem, but after doing several fixes, couldn't justify the amount of time I was spending to get it running smoothly.  Credit to Guerrilla for patching the game and improving the PC port.  Now it runs no problem, I have it locked to 60 FPS at 1440p everything is ultra except for clouds and reflections, TAA.  

Crashed while compiling shaders.  Multiple crashes.  I had to hard reset.

It might have even been too easy this way, once I got used to the controls.  They were very different than other games I've played as I'm old school and not used to the newer controllers and the myriad of combinations they use, but I eventually got there and then I mostly only died during jumping puzzles.  (I hate jumping puzzles).  To be fair the jumping puzzles in this game require a lot less precision than in other games which is good, otherwise I'd have rage quit long ago.  I enjoyed the story and game progression despite playing it on slightly too easy.  I couldn't motivate myself to do all the hunting grounds and tutorial missions though, and the vantages which ended up all being jumping puzzles, which is why even when I finished all the stories, side quests and errands I still only had like at 75% progression in the main game and 80% in the Frozen wilds.  Oh well!

All in all, it was fun. Winning the game unlocks New Game + mode but I have no idea why you'd ever play through a second time because the stories are really what drive the game for me, but if it's your thing, have at it!

I suspect on harder difficulties it could get really hard and then potions and such are more critical, they weren't if you're playing on easy.

I was hesitant to play this game at first because I didn't really buy into the roots/tribal + sci-fi dinosaurs theme. And to be frank I don't think my thematic preferences will change even after playing the game.

But...

That being said, after playing for a few hours, I must say that it is as very well executed. While playing the game, it isn't at all a turn off like I thought it would be. I am totally immersed, and while playing the game, I love mechanical dinosaurs and I love the tribal aesthetics.

Two things that usually I specifically don't favour at all.

I must insist on this because it give important context to my praise of the game. I have two negative biases against the basic concept of the game, but when I'm playing the game, these bias completely disappear, because they are doing two things right. Well they are doing a lot more than two things right, but I don't feel like writing for 30 minutes so I'll just praise those two things which stand out the most for me.

1. The World-Building : it is done very well and you can feel that this is a LOT more than a combination of ideas, it has dept and coherence and the world feels very much alive. They have really thought about this. I am impressed.

2. The Cutscenes and the Acting : It is not only good, it is great. A shinning example of how digital faces can feel like they havce a soul. All the characters have real personalities that are not only accessories for variety but are actual characters which you rapidly feel you can know and have deeper insights about them. 

There are two reasdons I can see why it is such a success for me. First the characters are all given true credibility by actors who seem to have really poured life into their characters. That is paramount and bravo. 

Second, and for that reason alone I am glad I bought the game because this does it for me : the minuscule and constant movement of the eyes and the intricacies of the facial expressions of the models are astoundingly perfect.

THIS is the secret to creating convincing 3D models. The movement constant and subtle mopvement of the eyes is exactly like a real person would do it, and that alone gives tremendous credibility to the characters, you just get drawn into it.

Compared to it, other good narrative games are worthy attempts, but for this one, in my eyes, this is how you do it.

If the narrative experience is something that can make or break a game for you and you are hesitant about this title, then go ahead my friend, you'll be served something exquisite.

As of this writing, I am about an hour or so into the game, and hence, hadn't really gotten into the main story as of yet. But the little that I've seen of Aloy's story and the world, I do like it.

The game is set in a post apocalyptic world that had been largely inhabited by machines, with a few human tribes being the sole humans left in the world - which is a big change from most post-apocalyptic games that I've played in the past. The combat system is easy to pick up, and there are several resources you can pick up around the world and even loot the machines you fell to make better gear and weapons and even upgrade your satchels. 

This game runs great on my Steam Deck straight out of the box, and I have no issues when running the game. Ironically, it's on my PC when I run into issues, as the game lag or freeze at certain points, especially during the opening sequence, and even crashed on me a few times.

I passed by this game for the longest time, as the trailer made me think the whole shooting-robots-with-a-bow thing was a shallow gimmick. Glad I finally bought it.

The world is well-developed and characters have strong and clear motivations. The story is captivating and plays with emotions and the writers are skilled, presenting the world through the different, unique perspectives of the various characters.

I actually played on ""Story mode"" difficulty and did just the main quest, I was so eager to learn what the story was. It's like 1000 years in the future. Humanity destroyed itself. There are human tribes and machine animals. And you learn how that destruction happened and figure out what's up with the machines and save the world. Just amazing. Highly recommend.

Masterpiece.

Buy this.

The face of each NPC is unique which is what other RPG game lack of. Very good achievement system. The story is touching at the beginning but it is not that good later. The tasks are a little repetitive and there could be more variety of the gaming mode. Overall I quite enjoy the game.

The audio setting does not synchronize with PC output. Terrible control and saving system. Lots of fatal glitches. For example, I was trying to override a fireclaw but when it approached me the override symbol pop up has a few seconds delay which makes the override failed because the machine identified me which screwed up everything. After a few times I finally override successfully. However although I have permanent override skill but the fireclaw suddenly lose the override. After I killing the fireclaw, the killing wasn't counted in the statistics. Before I prepared to collect the resources from the destroyed fireclaw, I talked to one NPC then after that the fireclaw with its resources just disappeared. The overall process disappointed me several times. Another example is when I mount on a machine it cannot go down if the slope is deep. Besides the glitches, I think the collection tasks are too much. I expected the game wasn't like Ubisoft those kind of boring collection tasks but unfortunately this game is just a little better in this aspect. Also I quite don't like the hunting games with time limit. Just 1 of this kind of task is enough for me. The new game + mode and ultra hard mode are just unnecessary for achievement. Please remove this two from the achievement. By the way, in quite a few task the game designer purposely trick players. Remember a good game can be difficult but never trick players!

While I had high hopes for this game, it ultimately fell short of my expectations for what makes a truly engaging RPG.

[b][u]Pro:[/u][/b]
+ Unique and captivating scenario.
+ Excellent graphics and improved performance post-patches.
+ Aloy is a compelling protagonist with varied dialogue options.

[b][u]Contra:[/u][/b]
- The story lacks player impact, offering only one ending and feeling like a movie.
- The open world is underwhelming with limited activities.
- Side quests are tedious and seem to unnecessarily prolong the game.
- Combat system focuses too much on dodging and ranged attacks.
- The melee skill tree is ineffective, making ranged combat almost mandatory.
- Lack of a true parkour system limits exploration to specific areas only.

[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]
This game lands squarely as [u]AVERAGE[/u] in my RPG experiences. Despite its promising premise and protagonist, it falls short in delivering a dynamic RPG experience, with a linear story, lackluster world, and unfulfilling combat mechanics. It's a game that shines in certain aspects but ultimately fails to provide the depth and freedom expected in a top-tier RPG.",1625336829,1703498009,False,2,1,0.497382193803787231,0,True,False,False

Great story.  an original take on the ""post Apocalyptic"" story line meshed with ""10,000 BC"" that works really well.  The lore is interesting and you can skip reading all the little details an still now what happened.  
Shooting is fun. The primitive weapon gameplay is fun, lets a wannabe sneaky, ninja sniper like me play at his pace, while giving enough challenge in the hectic fights to be borderline infuriating.  Sometimes arrows track targets, sometimes they don't.  you can sneak up to a high spot, snipe at your targets with tight aim, or you can fire frantically at the tail of a mechanical T-Rex while he stomps you...
Cons:
Camera... All that fun arrow shooting gets  frustrating when you're crouched in tall grass and the camera settles behind a log or leaf or something and you can't see your target.  And I desperately wanted some sort of Lock-on feature. Fighting said T-Rex while he is running around the area, dodging and jumping out of the way, then having to swing the camera around just in time for him to charge past you again was getting old.  Both of these problems were worse in the Frozen Wilds maps with snow and more frantic enemies.  
Invisible Walls... In a game where climbing up mountains is part of the gameplay, and trying to snipe from a safe distance is too, I ran in to a lot of invisible walls where Aloy just wouldn't jump up on that rock or a few spots where arrows stuck in mid air.  not a huge deal, but noticeable. Only being able to climb on clearly indicated yellow ledges is a trope, but it stood out here where traversal is such a big thing in the gameplay.
Sound design.... This game made me think about playing Shadow of the Colossus... riding your horse through the wide open terrain, no music, just the ""natural"" sounds of the environment.  Horizon didn't do that... Instead, you have sometimes very intrusive synthesizer music popping up out of nowhere.  I don't know how many times I ducked for cover because of one track that clearly had danger cues to it, but was just the open world.  Its a shame, too, because the music is pretty good, just inappropriate. Then, especially in the endgame while exploring the last couple of dungeons with Sylens in your ear, you come across hologram projectors that play way too loud, then Aloy and Sylens start talking over them and you cant hear what they are saying.  One time, I had an audio story file playing when I triggered a hologram, and then Sylens started talking.  All three voice tracks going at the same time... You cant do that to the late, great Lance Reddick! Other times, Aloy is making the same dumb comment she did last time you slid down a hill, at full volume... The sound design is just so poorly done in some sections that I felt like muting my game at times.

Let's go by technology first:
The game still looks beautiful, with a nice day/night cycle, lush environments (snow/tundra, desert, lush forest and so on) and a variety of enemies. Grass moves in the wind, you leave tracks in the snow and so on. So graphics are really nice. Music is mostly subdued and only picks up during certain events. Can't say I cared very much for the music, tbh. Gameplay-wise this is a mixed bag for me. Movements are fluid, weapons are varied and you have always different approaches to objectives. For example you often are able to stealth-kill, sneak around or even take over (machine-) enemies. However there are also, in my opinion, glaring problems with the gameplay: climbing and verticality only works at certain points. So you can only climb walls the devs want you to climb, which sometimes lead to frustrating searches for the ""right"" way to climb a mountain without any indication why, exactly, only that rock surface is climbable. This broke immersion for me. You can also conquer ""dungeons"" called cauldrons here that sequentially unlock the ability to take over the machines that populate the map. Cool in theory, but you can't give them any commands and only some of them can be used as mounts. This is especially infuriating when you learn that you can take over the T-Rex style robot and the giant electric Eagle, but you can't ride them and their only function is to attack enemies that are nearby. So it's basically useless to take over these machines. I understand that having a flying mount would open up a whole different level of technical difficulties for the devs but it still feels like a big missed opportunity. 
Otherwise it took me about 50 hours to complete the main story, plus however long it will take me to finish the expansion. But beware, there is a lot of busywork that reminds of the Far Cry games (and not in a good way) where you run around getting collectables, audio and text logs, free ""corrupted zones"" of machines and so on. This stuff feels like sub-par randomly generated busywork though I suppose it was deliberately placed on the map by the dev-team.
On the other hand there are fully acted and voiced side quests with their own little story lines that are, while not  Shakespeare, at least serviceable and they also managed to let those side quests feed back into the main story in a small way. 
The main story though is excellent and I really enjoyed it and thought it was quite unique. So this game is worth a playthrough alone for the main story. There is also a ""new game +"", however that's not for me I think as I dislike the busywork and therefore won't complete everything there is in this game and the story also lends itself to only one playthrough (at least if you rummage around a bit and get all the background info in form of text/audio logs pertaining to the main story). If you're a completionist I would think you can keep busy in the main game for 80-100 hours alone, not counting the expansion. So there is a lot you get for your money if you're a completionist. 
Overall I would say this is a very competent, polished game with an engaging story and some sub-par busywork that's just there to pad the playtime. If you can stomach that type of game then I say go for it, it's worth it.",1703437677,1703437677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hello! I managed to complete the game in 40 hours, which is quite a bit for me. The gameplay proved to be engaging.

Pros of the Game:

Visual Splendor: The game impresses with the beauty of its open world, stunning landscapes, and detailed characters.

Compelling Story: A captivating turning point and a mysterious narrative following the main protagonist make the game enthralling from start to finish.

Excellent Sound and Music: High-quality sound design and emotional music create an atmosphere that enhances the gaming experience.

Now, onto the Cons:

Control Complexity: I found the controls and navigation system to be challenging, especially in the early stages of the game. However, you get used to it over time.

Rating: ★★★★☆

I recently played this game on my Steam Deck, and I must say, the visuals on the smaller screen are impressive. The fusion of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Fallout styles creates a unique atmosphere that keeps you engaged.

While the FPS drops occasionally occurred, they weren't game-breaking and didn't overshadow the overall experience. The intriguing storyline, complete with unexpected plot twists, kept me hooked from start to finish.

However, the game's attempt at promoting inclusivity felt forced, with a noticeable imbalance in character portrayal. It's disappointing to see most white males depicted as villains, alcoholics, or ex-war criminals. On the flip side, the positive portrayals of characters often come with unnecessary details like being gay or vegan, raising questions about the relevance of such specifics in the game.

Despite these concerns, the game manages to deliver an enjoyable experience, blending elements from popular franchises. With some adjustments to its approach on inclusivity, it has the potential to be an even more captivating adventure.",1703324143,1703324143,True,3,1,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Graphics 8.5/10 (For a 2020 game holding up in Dec. 2023 is great!)
Audio 8/10 (Honestly is a masterpiece and fits well)
Game play 9/10 (Addictive! Fast Travel is a blessing for side quests)
Story 9.5/10 (Refreshing take to post-apocalyptic genre)

Side missions are addictive. It's fun to sneak around and head shot robo dinos. Without spoilers I think I just unlocked the open world. It's fun to upgrade, collect and just do random missions other than the main objective. I'm curious about where the story leads because it's really good story telling. 

Verdict! Buy it on sale while you can! I've bought games on sale before and regretted throwing away 10 bucks, but this game is worth every penny. Also, It's a playstation game!

I find the story as the most intriguing aspect of the game. The first time I saw a clip about Horizon Zero Dawn made me wonder how could some tribal civilization fight something so advanced? Does the setting take place on Earth or something fictional? The questions keep coming up until I try this game for myself. Next is about the combat. The game offers various tools and various enemies, each with its own weaknesses to be exploited. One thing I find lacking is the exploration and quests. The world design is pretty bland, not much to explore. Also the quests are mostly like typical open-world games with simple tasks such as going here, fetch this, clear that, etc. As the first word I wrote, Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game, I highly recommend this game for gamer who seeks new story to enjoy (while waiting for the sequel).",1703264254,1703264254,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

still not changing my mind. because they gave us, a lot of useless side quests. for now i'm just doing the main quests.
i just want to finish this game. to get my money worth.
this game is an example of a game. that intentionally make itself longer. without making it more fun.
the level 60 cap is a huge minus.
i use a lot of mods. some of it to eliminate the inventory issues.

original review :
i do wish there is an option. other than recommend and not recommend.

the game is quite good. the graphics is nice.

but i disliked the level cap of 60. and the tiny inventory space. yes i know i can upgrade it. but still tiny.
and also tiny ammo inventory space.

there's a lot of things that i disliked and liked.

but overall i guess i can only pick not recommend. but it's actually in the middle.

i haven't finished the game. no idea if i even will finished it. the level cap thing. kinda makes me not wanting to continue playing.

but i bought this although with a huge discount. it's still quite a lot sum of money for me. so i will force myself to finish this game.

i do wish that people can make mod that increase the level cap.

60 is too low of a level cap.

overall i can only rate this game as 5.5 out of 10",1702561356,1703238248,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere and immersion factor is great. The visuals are great. The NPC animations while they are speaking to you - are not great - at all. I turned the music down to 60% but maybe that's just my speakers. NPC's will sometimes talk over each other and cause you to miss some dialog. Or you'll be in a town talking to someone and a music band will appear beside you and start playing. Subtitles help with that.

Zero Dawn is a unique experience, but I think it is similar in some ways to Assassin's Creed Odyssey (without oceans and boats). If you liked Odyssey but felt it was too big, then you will appreciate Zero Dawn which is still rather large and diverse but doesn't feel overwhelming.

Non-Spoiler Warning: You'll get a Power Cell at the beginning of the game and you're told to find more. Most of them are locked to story progression and you will not be able to find them all until almost the end of the game.

_ 3 crashes during gameplay.

_ Faces looking way off compared to the PS4 version.

_ sub 60fps.

_ Stealth does not work properly (you can be seen over 10m away while in stealth, not moving with the best stealth armor and highest vaule stealth mods.

_ Invisible walls in big gaps like a bus 2m on the right and a wall 2m left but can't shoot between), these happen very frequently.

_ Outfits clipping.

_ Ressources clipping in terrain.

_ Enemies can sometimes see you from behind walls.

_ Temporary immortality for enemies at random (mostly happens with flying ones).

_ Some NPCs not showing up on the map.

Multiple instances of rendering issues and popping textures, heavy texture glitches.

_ For a controller to work, it needs to be connected before launching the game (if disconnected during session, it won't work until the game is closed and opened again).

_ Sound not working multiple times despite audio set properly...

_ The game tries to make you want to explore but if you do so it can break the narrative pacing.

_ Open world where you should not explore before finishing a large portion of the story.

_ By the way, it's not feature complete.

_ Dualsense is detected as a xbox controller with modded in ps prompts which is weird as f*ck.

A (not so) pretty sh*try port of an otherwise okay game.
Not worth it even for 5 bucks.

I'm not sure what's funny here aside that someone found this review funny for some reason...


The story in itself is not too bad but pacing is pretty mid at times. If you explore once the map opens up, it'll misplace or skip some story beats. The ending feels rushed and unfinished and when you hit that point you'll start thinking : ""Did i finish a game or a checklist"".

Gameplay, while satisfying on PS4 is less enjoyable due to inconsistant framerate, very frequent hiccups. Were it not for this i'd say it's between serviceable and decent. Sometimes when you have clearly shot an enemy, it does nothing and you get spotted. Enemies killed can sometimes be kind of stuck like their health is depleted but they don't die and all you can do is wait. The AI tends to cheat : Stealth kill behind a wall with no enemy able to see you and regardless of the stealth kill with the best stealth armor and best upgrades for it and instantly triangulate your exact location because f*** you i guess, i even got shot through walls and sometimes when you enter slow motion, enemies pick up speed enough to not be possible to hit unless using the spear but too late, you already got hit because that whole process would require inhuman reflexes or extreme dpi and precision along with being far enough...

Graphics overall are a 5.5 on PS4. On PC, well... it's all looking worse especially snow and rain effects. On top of that, expect a bunch of cutscenes ruined by weird poly shapes (sometimes taking most of the screen) and much more. One thing that particularly p*sses me of is when there's clipping all over the place and this game sadly is one of these.

Performance is a big miss. it is supposed to run bette rthan the PS4 version.
It can kinda deal with 60fps except it is choppy as pork ribs to the point where it wrecks how enjoyable the gameplay can be. Add to that the plethora of visual glitches and you get a game that clearly has BPS (bad port syndrome).

Add to that the fact that this port is not feature complete and still not in acceptable state and you might see a probable disaster ahead (coming 2024) !

The story is pretty good, combat is meh. Side-quests are the weak point of the game, there are a few good ones but they often feel pretty stale. I have to tell you though, fireclaws and many of the enemies in the Cut suck man. I like the game but it felt like they overdid part of The Cut with some incredibly tanky enemies. That is where I got personally stuck and said, this is enough for me. Like after the main quest of The Cut, mf goes up to you and says alright so sad my sister died, can you take care of 5 fireclaws for me. The worst enemy ever, I know you can get frost and defeat it easier but I couldn't afford doing so without going back and grinding for it. Maybe one day I will go back. This also brings me to another problem I have is that scavenging is extremely grindy. They sort of fixed this in The Cut but it still exists, I don't know if they fixed it in Forbidden West. It often does not feel too rewarding to take down enemies because you gain nothing but stuff to trade with traders to get better gear. And I often feel like the gear doesn't stand out too much. It often feels incredibly taxing to go around and scavenge around for loot a ton. I know I'm ranting a lot, but these are really my only gripes with the game.

-One of the most interesting and compelling games I have ever played.
-Fantastic writing and voice acting (great work Ash & team!)
-Fantastic music and sound design
-Absolutely breathtaking visuals and world design.  I felt compelled to explore every inch that I could.
-Legitimately made me gasp when I realized what was happening.  I thought I had the plot figured out and it dropped a huge mind-bomb on me.
-Reasonable scope.  A great amount of extra quests for completionists, and a solid core experience for the ""Just give me the basics--I just want to see what happens"" crowd.
-Fun and satisfying combat. It's extremely fun to chip away at the defenses (and offensive capabilities) of the machines, and the game alternates between combat with machines and humans to help reduce game fatigue (not that I ever had that issue personally) :)
-One of the best DLC expansions I've ever played in a video game ever.

I have nothing bad to say about this game.  It scratched all the itches, some I didn't even know I had.  It literally brought me to tears.  It thrilled me.  I've gone back and replayed it numerous times and I've never felt the thrill recede during any of those playthroughs.

It may not speak to everyone, but it speaks to me, and hits me in all the right places.  From an objective standpoint, I'm sure there are improvements that could be made, but for me personally, a 10/10 doesn't feel high enough.

It grew on me with the time, the more I play, the more I appreciate the combat, some fights are just supper interesting from machine behavior perspective.

I have read some really strange complaints about how this game is really boring with your typical open-world killing/crafting/questing. In a way this is what I thought of the game at a glance. That is wrong.

Horizon Zero Dawn works so well from beginning to end because of its very believable world, the nuances in stealth, characters you can comfortably care for, and satisfying combat.

I'm pretty sure it takes a lot from the modern Tomb Raider games which I have replayed several times in the past but it does so much of a better job, where Tomb Raider concentrates mostly on action sequences, Horizon Zero Dawn has an incredible story to tell where the more you learn, the more you want to find out, even to the end.

The game does have some minor flaws. The very first one came where it seemed like I could climb rock faces that I couldn't, and this largely continues until the end of the game. Notebooks and audio logs are scattered in the world and I could not care less about them - the world building is amazing, but these are not for me. Occasionally I would play an audio log while I continued moving around and nothing else was going on, however one section of the game is absolutely littered with these collectibles and if I wanted to pay attention to this part of the story, my momentum would have grinded to a screeching halt for the sake of a lot of reading and waiting until an audio log had finished until I got to the next one - that wasn't happening.

In combat, there's no parry, but there is a ""dodge"" roll, however there were times I felt like I rolled away and still got hit. The machines in this game are designed to feel dangerous, and this never really slowed down. While earlier machines get much easier, the difficulty in the larger machines ramps up considerably. While I felt like I could beat every kind of machine, combat with them felt rough, and I liked that. 

One more thing about combat is the controls which took some getting used to - you have a spear, and all your ranged attacks. You cannot ""select"" your spear - it is your default weapon when you press attack. To use a ranged weapon, you select the type of attack you want to perform with it (ie. which kind of ammo to use), hold right click to aim it and then press left click to attack. If you weave ranged attacks with melee attacks, you have to switch between these interchangeably. Eventually I got so used to this that it worked and flowed well, but to begin with, it felt very strange that I wouldn't just select a weapon and then attack with it.

These are only nitpicks that I thought could have potentially been improved upon. The game is amazing and now that I've finished it, I'm only sorry I didn't notice and buy it earlier on. Horizon Forbidden West, its sequel, is definitely on my radar when it comes to steam soon.",1703027102,1703027102,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yes
+Good creatures design, good world design
+intriguing wold story and interesting enough main story to keep you playing
+impressive graphics and good optimisation 

But
-generic asf gameplay mechanics consisting only of 4 steps - go there/scan territory/follow the the trail/kill everything at the end of the trail or watch scene. Repeat this ALL the time! Not kidding, Majority quests build in in that way, its getting repetitive and boring after first 2 hours of game. 
-Side quests boring af, all build the same basing on 4 steps above. 
-Economics in game almost absent. You need hunting creatures only to buy more powerful weapons because hi-level weapons can be bought with money + creatures parts, and there is nothing more to buy in copy/pasted merchant with the copy/paste stack all over the world.   
-huge, beautiful, but non interactive and boring open world build in general to waste your time (like majority open world worlds games are build)
-frustrating combat with creatures. It can be very fun and engaging in 1 vs 1 battles within quests and story and occasional encounters, but in open world creatures NEVER walk alone, they roam in stacks of 2 minimum and beat the crap of you very easy. Each creature, (except the weakest  first level hounds) has attack that you can't dodge no matter what you do, start battle with 2 or 3 or more of creatures - you will be dead in no time.  

Game is recommended only for main story walk through, with limited dipping into hunting and few side quests only to get high level weapons. Main story is very solid sci-fi apocalyptic drama and, basically, the only thing that make this game worth playing. Everything else are, at best, mediocre fillers to make you waist time with no rewards or benefits.

Let me break it down to the basics.

1) Graphics: are great. You almost forget you are playing a game, and it's easy to get wrapped up in the beauty.
2) Game-play: is easy to learn. Mostly the key-binds are loosely intuitive.
3) Crafting: essentially grinding for materials is a must. It's simply part-and-parcel a staple of the game.
4) Story: it is a fantasy, futuristic, post apocalyptic world; no zombies, but machines equal to the task.
5) Difficulty: there are several difficulty levels; story based (easy) to OMG (veteran).

Yes, you are using arrows to fight metallic beasts. I have read complaints that there is no way arrows could penetrate metal. Regardless your take, so what. It is fantasy, make believe, and uses imagination to drive entertainment (equally, though there are no zombies in this game, it can be said you can't kill a zombie, it's already dead; just saying).

Bottom line, this game is well worth the investment. I got it on sale and is worth every penny. I have not encountered any game shattering bugs. I think this series is worth it as an open world, play at your pace, kind of game. Exploring is encouraged, and surprises are to be expected around every corner.

I have played for 70 hours, and 30% of the game - it should have gotten game of the year. I am having so much fun.

I highly recommend the game.",1702303397,1702910534,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Went in with no spoilers and now its got me really excited for Forbidden West's PC release which is slated to be early next year.

Pros:
1. Does a good job of familiarising you with the game's mechanics and the practices you should adopt while not completely handholding the player like some other modern games.
2. Well balanced difficulty setting (mostly did my first playthrough on very hard)
3. World building is really good, from how the world looks and how alive it feels on a base level, to the lore and fun character narratives in side missions and datalogs. Main characters of the narrative are really well crafted imo.
4. If you like machines, open world freeroam, diversity in hunting and a good narrative, the game will not fail to deliver.
5. Main narrative/story was really well crafted, with the ending amping up the challenge and being highly satisfying to get through. Felt like a good conlusion at the end, unlike some other games which just go ""play the next game to know what really happens"", while also leaving on a good cliffhanger making the player eager for the next game.
6. I would get distracted by the machines and just get lost hunting the machines for long stretches in between story mission because it just feels fun to do so, the hunting aspect of the game is really a major part of the experience, atleast for me and has me totally hooked.

Cons:
1. No big complaints with the game except for how the lipsync for some NPCs and facial expressions during cutscenes would be totally off. I've heard that they've improved upon it in Forbidden West so that's good ig.
2. Humans generally felt very easy and their AI felt very base level when compared to machines. Makes the humans very non challenging to face but that may be intentional game design, idk.

Overall, a really fun experience, looks beautiful even though its over half a decade old. Highly recommended.",1702909740,1702909740,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

when I first played this game I fell off pretty quick because I'd felt I'd already played it before
eventually, it clicked, the story was superb, the world/dinosaurs absolutely incredible

now that I'm coming back to it, my first impression has kinda crept back:
- tag all the guys
- stealth through them
- mess up, choose between the terrible human combat VS restart encounter
- tag all the guys again

the amount of quests that boil down to this exact formula is painful for a game with this much potential.

it's a collection of all the heavy hitter design choices of it's time. And while it puts them together competently and alongside an incredible world and story, it can never shake just being a collection of tried and tested, but ultimately boring and generic core loop designs.

You have robot dinosaurs, why on earth do I spend so much time tagging and stealthing humans?!?!

I don't think I've felt this enthralled by an open world since I first played Skyrim 10 years ago. It's one of those games where you enjoy just being in the world, looking at stuff and going ""Ooh! Ahh!"" because everything just looks so fucking nice. I couldn't stop taking screenshots, and that was at MEDIUM graphical settings with low textures. The story is good but not incredible, the combat is fun, the Far Cry-esque progression is satisfying, and the exploration is done well. The only major drawback for HZD is that some of the voice lines sound low-quality, probably because of faulty compression, and it can be offputting at times. It's like what happened with the voice lines in Far Cry 3. All in all, I'd highly recommend this game at $12.49 USD when it goes on sale next. If you like The Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, any of the Far Cry games or Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, you'll absolutely love this.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Like many other games like this, the game offers lots of combat alternatives in the form of various gadgets, gizmos, and devices to use other than just your fists. Such examples include spiderman, assassins creed, shadow of mordor, and Read Dead Redemption. Having played all of the games listed above (and most, if not all, of their respective sequels), this is the first game where I have ever been interested in using said gadgets, gizmos, and devices. I have always been able to rely on my own skills and the basic combat mechanics to make my way through the story and any coinciding side missions or tasks I might find myself interesting in. Horizon Zero Dawn however, does not allow this. The game at many times nearly forces you to use, or consider using, ever available item at your disposal to take down your enemy.
With horizon, many of the missions have been entirely unbeatable unless you use other things besides just your bow and your spear. I regularly use traps, bombs, different arrow types, tripwires, ropecasters, etc to take down my enemies, which is not something I've ever tried before with any other game, or at least not to this extent.

None of the NPCs are written to a level that would cause emotional attachment.
The only NPCs with half a personality - Rost and the blond brat - are killed within the first hour of the game.
5 hours into the game, there is no story to speak of and I doubt that there will be one.

The climbing is perfect where devs specifically designed it, and nonexistent where they overlooked it. 
Collision with environmental objects such as trees and rocks is funnily outdated.
Enemy attacks have wildly unpredictable hitboxes, but you can spam dodge roll for tons of i-frames.

The resource system is ... very boring but incredibly rewarding. I kill 50 boars, I am invincible for the next few fights thanks to full-heal potions. Is that good design? Idk, you tell me.
The Quests are boring and forgettable. Who cares why I am clearing out the bandit camp or taking down multiple sawtooths? It's hella fun to do it! Why the absolutely generic NPCs?

With all respect to the devs, if this game was recently published, I'd accuse them of using ChatGPT for all of their dialogue- and story-writing past the tutorial. The resource-collecting and crafting has no purpose except stalling the game out.

This game is a great example of ""less is more"". Cut the resource collecting. Cut half the sidequests. Cut most NPCs. Offer more non-linear exploration. More combats against diverse enemies. More boss-fights - or what feels like bossfights.

Well worth the full price. There, I said it... and I don't even know where to start.

You play as Aloy — a motherless child left to be raised in an environment with barely any odds for lone survival. It's your typical ""zero-to-hero"" narrative, but with top-of-the-crop ingredients and just enough seasonings that make the experience special. Without dwelling into spoilers, I would deem Horizon: Zero Dawn as a must-have experience for Sci-Fi and Post-Apocalypse nerds.

Landscape and level design are absolutely bonkers — I had a feeling even the most minuscule piece of dirt was placed there for a reason. I cannot reckon playing a game with a game world so visually immersive other than The Witcher 3. Even the relics of the old civilizations felt so eerie and somehow alive. When you add the absolute smasher of the OST (Aloy's Theme in particular), it is hard not to feel all the emotions of warmth, cold, fear, relief, sorrow, irrelevance, and grandiosity at the same time.

Ranged combat is favoured throughout the game, although I got to experience stleath in the early levels. While some of the people held a grudge against this, I found it refreshing and incredibly lore-friendly. This game does not pursue the usual RPG tropes where it's selling you its lack of vision for an ""uniquely yours experience"". This game is not that. It's Aloy's story -- a linear open-world experience not pretending otherwise.

While we are at it, as mentioned before, Aloy succumbs to the usual hero tropes -- for better or worse. Fortunately, the overall world-building and Aloy's placement in the grand narrative simply made the game incredible, at least for me. Even listening to collectible audiologs was so darn interesting and enriching. Further evidence of this is the fact that the game's ending actually feels like a proper ending. Once you get introduced to the post-credit cliffhanger, although you are left yearning for more, it's not the type of yearning where you're left with a feeling of being robbed of an experience for the sake of future installments and corporate greed. Morover, Frozen Wilds DLC fits well into the post-game lore expansion that will surely be valuable for the second installment.


Overall, Horizon: Zero Dawn is uniquely complex technical endevour that is successfully presented with refreshing well-dosed simplicity. I had 2 crashes throughout the whole playthrough — although I am more than convinced they were related to abysmal AMD drivers (7800XT).",1701967588,1702463066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Horizon: Zero Dawn while not the most stable or post-launch supported port of a PS5 game to the PC is still an amazing title and a franchise I am eager to see continue to develop not only on PC but in its story. Having said that the game does have some rough edges many stemming from the aforementioned lack of support it has gotten on PC from water interaction animations and cutscenes seemingly playing at very low FPS despite having around 200 FPS unlocked which most likely stems from the original coding and hardware limitations it had on its console launch, as well as an uneasy amount of eye movement from various characters during cutscenes which I can only chalk that up to facial animations being tied to framerate. In terms of auditory issues, the game does tend to reuse a lot of the same voice actors for various characters which is most apparent with the guards having many of the same voice lines repeated over and over and cloth armor both on Aloy and some important characters use a lot of metal chainmail like sounds which seem out of place. During my playthrough, I also encountered issues of audio playing simultaneously from audio logs found within the world at the same time important characters tried to fill Aloy in on something with important exposition causing a lot of auditory overlap. As for the story while amazing it does suffer from a slow start with many of the major events both from the main story and side quests not seemingly acknowledged by the residents around you. Often these events come with some sort of dialogue options on how you want to approach them which is a nice touch but means very little in the way of actual game-changing outcomes paired with oddly long pauses in dialogue it does take some time for the story and it's characters to grow on you. One key note I would like to make is in terms of performance the game does not seem to like overlays be it Steam overlay or MSI Afterburners overly I did experience a few mid-game crashes and one consistent end-game crash forcing me to remove MSI afterburners overly known as Riveratuner Statistics along with disabling steam overlay. I was not able to narrow down which of these was causing said issues but they did not persist after their removal. In all, I am excited for this franchise to continue with the hopes that it also continue on PC for years to come!

Combat Mechanics - Enjoyable and Fun. Easily the most under-rated RPG out there. This game is really well thought in terms of mechanics and I thoroughly enjoy playing it even when not associated with the main story line.

Graphics - I love playing games with exploratory maps with a mixture of seasons and weathers. I am not a full time hard-core gamer. I have played AC-Odyssey and AC-Origins in the past. I do not think the environment is as amazingly built as in AC-Odyssey. Characters have better models and are more good looking than AC-Odyssey.

Long range/Short range Combat - Remember that this game might not be for people with strong preference for lot of close combat. The game requires a lot of arrow usage mixed with close combat with a spear. But as I grew into the game, I realised arrows are more important in this game instead of more close combat weapons and play-style. There is sufficient variety of bow and arrows to keep the combat engaging and fun.

Story - I am not a fan of story in games, I never find myself being associated with the characters in games. All I majorly care for is combat variety and mechanics, which involved weapons, Armours etc.",1702409784,1702409784,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not super big on open-world survivals, only due to burn out of these types of games.. but honestly, this was nice! I always love sniping things off anyway and this game really encourage snipe-tactics and traps. A lot of the time laying traps feels more off an afterthought, but here.. I actually made pretty damn good use of them. 

The environment is wonderfully done. The graphics are a little dated, and talking npcs definitely feel their age in graphical date- but its serviceable. Simple yet information-ready UI and quick radial menus make really navigating through the menus not much of a hassle. Music is absolutely stellar, though some sound effects got a bit annoying. Especially with hitting critical areas of enemies. Dunno, that sound just bugged me after awhile.

I encountered no bugs on my full 70 hour playthru, start to finish on normal difficulty. The story was alright, though the pacing felt a bit off sometimes. The way gear is discovered and upgraded can also feel a bit rushed? You can end up in the best of gear pretty much mid way thru the game. BUT, doesn't mean the game gets that much easier over it. Still some challenging fights- and even more so at harder modes. 

Its definitely a game worth delving into, especially if you can catch it on a discount. Its not going to break the ground in survival-gaming for most people, but its still a solid game that does a lot more right than bad. Some of the other detractors are your usual sub-genre of gamerbros who just don't like 'unsexified' female leads. Ignore them and their whining about 'mary sues'.. as if there aren't enough bro-variants of them in every other game.

Such amazing potential that is unfortunately squandered by sterile corporatism and illogical writing. Tribalism and sci-fi technology intertwining is a big reach, so it needs to be done logically. Unfortunately we don't get that here. Why on earth would people be shooting bows when there's laser shooting robots everywhere? Even better: there is scrap metal literally everywhere, so why are you wearing leather to fight these things?

They made the races mixed like it's the USA, and made sure to portray tribal aesthetics from multiple cultures. But it just doesn't work when they're that close. It doesn't make sense. And it doesn't look right. This made it feel very forced. The introduction to this game was amazing, and honestly super adorable. But after you're made a ""Seeker"", the quality in general just nosedives. The immersion was just pretty low. The story was afraid to be different. Which made it boring/ ultra PG.

If it weren't for the amazing graphics/ aesthetics, beautiful intro, and pretty likable main character, I honestly don't think we'd hear much about this game. I'm just being honest. The gameplay was okay, but kind of clunky for me if I'm to be honest. Higher difficulties just make things ridiculous bullet sponges and perhaps it's just due to my laptop but I straight up couldn't dodge many attacks so I felt like it was pointless to try and be good. But the story just can't compensate.

But everything else, man, woof. The world is barren. Your map is covered in markers, but instead of interesting locales with dungeons or motivated little questlines, your markers are either ""you can kill some robots here"" or ""you can find a collectible here"". The sidequests are uninspired and require *so* much walking. Moreover there's little choice in how they're resolved--for example, you can't stop Aloy from being a narc and pettily demanding robin hood return the sword he stole to mr noble.

The robots are cool, fighting them is difficult and they are super varied. But a total underbaking of melee combat means you're constantly running away to plink off a shot only to run away again. Aiming your bow at close range isn't really an option at all (and trying to hit weak spots feels pretty unforgiving on higher difficulties).  You can lob grenades, but the blast radius on them also removes them as a close-quarters option. The combat pattern of shooting then running is not really to my taste. Moreover, there are lots of robots per pack so getting swarmed and ganked to death is super common at least until you realize that corruption arrows are the only viable strategy in many cases.

But what good aspects are there in the combat just doesn't overcome how much of a wasteland the world is. Nothing but trivial ubisoft style mini challenges to do, or some boring sidequests (that the game occasionally calls ""Errands"" which unavoidably makes you think of them as chores). You can do the only interesting thing, which is the main quest, but half the time the next objective is placed a mile away in unexplored territory, so enjoy your walk!!

It blows my mind that studios are still messing this up. Fallout New Vegas came out in 2010, had terrible combat and took place in the literal desert, but felt so much more lush than this. Heck, even Skyrim has better quests and some memorable characters. Horizon Zero Dawn is not worth the slog, but if you insist on playing it anyway, download some mods to remove loot drudgery (better drops, double medicine from plants, more inventory stacking) and beeline the main quests.

With the sheer and titanic amount of love and effort put into developing this game, it's easily right up there with GTA V, Death Stranding, etc - at least in my opinion.

I'm going to do my best to provide no spoilers, so I'll be making use of the spoiler bars. Since this game is all about learning more and more as time goes on, it could potentially ruin the experience if too much is revealed - but that's up to you to reveal my spoilers or not.

So what's the basics/background? I'm going to begin using the spoiler bars here - but to be honest, what's mentioned in this section is hardly super important - what's blacked out right here is nothing you won't learn in the first fifteen minutes of gameplay, but still hiding it just in case. You are a young woman who lives in a day and age of bow and arrow, spear and sling. The world is filled with violent machines, and those machines kill humans when they spot them. [spoiler]This is because long ago, humanity was actually very high tech and the world was filled with super-advanced technology... but at some point, ""something"" went wrong. Humanity has turned from super advanced to primitive, going from immeasurably powerful weapons and AI back to the days of worshiping the sun and using bow and arrow to hunt. Why has this happened? Why are we now primitive and fighting machine animals all over the world? What has gone wrong?[/spoiler]

So now you are a young woman warrior in that world filled with hostile machine animals, and you're trying to figure out your place in the world. Some sort of major revelation always seems right around the corner... But you'll have to fight your way through this bizarre world for your answers. Using nothing but the very primitive weapons of our ancestors, you will fight the mechanical equivalent of our world today.

It needs to be pointed out that an immense amount of effort seems to have been put into developing this world - this isn't your usual copy+paste world of repeating visuals. This is a detailed world with many biomes, many cities, mountains, valleys, forests, plains, deserts, and everything in between. As an open world, you can explore as you like - as long as you can fend off the machines that threaten you. The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a while (besides Aloy's hair in the elevator, I mean... well, you'll see).

You take on the main storyline missions - or, there are a plethora of side missions (side missions, errands, 'tallneck' missions, cauldrons, and many more). In this way, you can focus on just beating the game as quickly as possible... or fleshing out the world by playing tons of side missions and really getting a bang for your buck. Think of GTA V, how you of course have the main missions, but then just TONS of side missions scattered all around to take on. That is this.

The fighting was beyond satisfying. Rather than just being a button-masher, where the worse the finger-seizure you have the better you do, this one relies heavily on using the right equipment, and using it right. Also, rather than just 'shoot the big machine target,' you have to pick your shots - I mean, you're fighting an enormous machine with a bow and arrow, so your attacks have to count. You've got to find weak points and exploit them, or use the machine's overall weakness against it. So you have to actually get good at the fighting to win battles.

It's also not a ""line 'em up and mow 'em down"" game. Very rarely will you have the ability to just mow down bad guys (and when you do, it's usually with extremely limited ammo). Each fight is a lethal struggle for survival. Each encounter forces you to put everything on the line to win. Granted, it gets a little easier as you level up and gain skills, but it's never a walk in the park - especially with some of the deadlier machines.

That's one thing I really appreciate about this game - the fighting. The fights actually matter. The equipment load-out matters - this isn't one of those games where you'll just use ranged or melee all the time - you'll have to combine to overcome. 

There's also a great use of stealth in the game. If you just charge in arrows flying, depending on the circumstance you can find yourself being overrun within seconds. You're free to fight however you like, but you'll quickly find it pays to sneak around as long as possible, head-shotting enemies to reduce the amount of people charging you once the battle becomes fully engaged.

The story is gripping. I found myself almost unable to stop playing because I simply HAD to know the answers. Why do we find ourselves in a world like this? What's up with the machines? What's up with the strange ""metal cities"" or whatever it was they called them, which are filled with high tech stuff? What is the story here - and what is Zero Dawn? I enjoyed every bit of the story.

The voice acting as above par. It wasn't the most gripping voice acting I've ever heard, but it wasn't distractingly mediocre, either. I would give that a 7 out of 10.

Graphics, as stated, were out of this world, besides a few quirks here and there... but in a game of this scope, I hardly think that's unreasonable.

The music/soundtrack was fantastic - often in games I'll turn music off as it is annoying, but in ones like this, where the music blends just right with the environment, I'll leave it on. Fantastic. The sounds fit right in, also, not ever sounding ""wrong"" or ""weird.""

Amount of stuff you could buy was a bit short,  but fine. I did find myself wishing there were more a selection of weapons to choose from - but the amount of customization you can put into each weapon kinda made up for that. Same with armor. The amount of machines in the game was JUST right - not so few that you're fighting the same thing over and over, but not so MANY that you give up trying to memorize the strengths/weaknesses of each one. It has JUST the right amount of machines.

Overall, I sunk about 60 hours into this game, and still didn't complete everything. (I mostly did not use fast travel, though.. It felt like a cheat - like if Aloy wants to get to Meridian, she'll have to fight her way there, so I wanted to be a part of that journey. So maybe my time logged could be a little inflated.) Since I bought this on sale, that is a HECK of a bang for a buck... but even at full price, that would have been less than a dollar an hour. So the question of ""should I pay full price?"" is easily answered: there is enough content in this game, it was executed well enough, and is just plain amazing enough that $50 is an easy sell. I would recommend this game to anyone, on sale or otherwise.

Absolutely one of the coolest games I've played in a very.. very long while. 10/10 would recommend. Darn near perfect. The only, only thing I didn't like about this game was that I waited so darn long to buy it. I should've bought this one a long time ago.",1702247547,1702247547,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play a person who was exiled from her tribe for being motherless. You spend half the game finding out who is your mother/where you came from and the second half saving the world (naturally). The mechanics were fun to play, and the conversation aspect was good enough. Doing the side quests gave you a nice sendoff at the end. The only downfall was the color of the climb markers. The yellow and off white blended into the rock too well, and I spent a lot of time running in circles trying to find the start point. Neon green or neon blue would've been better. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the story.

That said, Frozen Wilds - 2/5. This was super boring, and I regretted playing it as recommended before the end game of HZD. It ruined the flow of the main story of the main game. There is nothing that interesting to learn that makes it worthwhile. The weapon upgrades are nice, but you can get those without doing the entire DLC. Find out how much what you want costs, run around harvesting gems, and done. If you want a better spear, it's a single side quest that you don't need to kill anything to get. There's a cool shock weapon you can get for doing the first main quest if you really want it for hardcore mode. This first main quest might be doable at early level, when you initially hear about Frozen Wilds (level 14 for me), if you try to avoid fighting. Really, though, I could've won the game without any upgrades and had a better time of it. I'd skip the DLC and stick to the main game.",1702247079,1702247079,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Light on main story as most of the game is spent wandering around the game world doing stuff and collecting stuff. You use primitive melee and bow weapons when there was an age of technology in the past. You get meat from animals and horns from baddies. You get different outfits with different bonuses, none of which look like actual effective armor. This is a BotW clone but not as fun. Except for the climbing, which is a buggy version of Assassin's Creed/Uncharted that was ripped from Prince of Persia. It does have voice acting, but it's mostly just phoned in with the main character Alloy or whatever sounding like some teenage amateur trying poorly to mimic Commander Shephard from Mass Effect. And the tutorials could be better, they spend too much time explaining obvious stuff, while I was around 14 hours in before discovering that you can expand your inventory, they definitely should have mentioned that was possible earlier. Melee combat should be better balanced too, the spear seems to just be for occasional stealth kills as it is basically impossible to avoid most melee attacks because there is no Flurry Rush like in BotW, unless that is an advanced skill I have not reached yet.

So why positive? Well, BotW was amazing. Everyone except a few XBox fanboys who never played it and are thus missing out on one of the greatest games of all time would agree on that, so who wouldn't want more BotW clones? It is a smart move to learn from the best. I have heard that they might make another one of these Horizon games one day? I bet it will copy improvements from TotK since this is basically a BotW fan game but not as good. I mean, the alternative would be a BotW clone that is better than BotW, and that is basically impossible for some no-name developer so I'll take what I can get.",1702241469,1702241768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Half the game feels like a mix between watching TV and listening to the radio. Entire areas filled with data pads that you'll need to scan in order to get the full story. You'll spend hours either reading paragraphs of story or listening to it. Add the forced NPC dialogues with wheel after wheel of babble and it's beyond excessive. 

The game play can be fun but it's basically just another Fallout / Farcry / Just Cause / Assassin's Creed / etc, re-skin. So many of the decisions regarding this games development feel like they were made to pad game time rather improve the experience. Is the story well written? Yes. Could that story be presented in a way that didn't result in the player literally barely interacting with an interactive medium? Also yes.

I remember seeing the trailer for this game and thinking it looked cool but I wasn't about to go out and buy a console so I let it go. Then it popped up on sale on steam. I picked it up for $12 I think. Glad I did. I see a lot of people talking about how the game runs, but as of writing this I only had one crash and I think it had something to do with one of the challenges I was working on. The game did stutter when I was in the main city, but only for a bit. The game ran well enough for me. If you have played Assassins Creed, or the newer Tomb Raider games you have already played this game. I like the world building and the creatures, but whoever wrote this game hates men. Almost every male character you meet is horrible in one way or another. There are a couple that are ok and manage to survive through the story. Do not buy this game unless you would like to check out the world. That is the best thing about it. Get it on sale. Its very easy. You can 100% the game in less than 80 hours if you don't try to find all the bits of the story like I did.

A few of the  downside of this game are how weak you feel in the beginning, ur just shooting arrows at giant metal robots lol, its pretty rough for a while there, and then I felt that way again at the end as well. Were there golden weapons in this game? I haven't beat every side mission yet, but i notice i got greens, blues, and purples, but not once have I seen any golds, even after beating the entire main story. Not even a reward at the end of the game besides unlocking new game+? Which wasn't that exciting for me, cuz I got enough the first time through. Another really annoying thing was the arrow capacity shit, its not fun to constantly stop and make more ammo mid fight, sure late game you get a bit higher capacity, but i'd personally rather carry like 200 arrows of the one arrow type im using rather than 40 of each arrow type. Nextly, on the not enjoyable list, THE JUMP PUZZLES! Reminded me so much of tomb raider, where i'd try and make some jump, she just wouldn't latch on to that ledge so i think, ""humm.. must be something else im supposed to do,"" proceed to run around the room for 10-15 mins exploring, until i finally say eff it, and google the answer, all to find out if I had just proceeded to try and make the jump to the ledge i've already tried jumping at 5 times, she'd eventually latch on to that ledge (even though sometimes when u miss the jump that means you're dying). That was one of my biggest gripes with the tomb raider jump puzzles, and it seems to be stirred up into this game as well. You can clearly see the way you're supposed to go, but the game just wont do what you're trying to make it do and acts like that ledge doesn't exist the first 5 times i try and jump into it. The last thing that really got annoying in this game, some of the enemies are just way too aggressive how they chase you. There were certain fights I did where I just had to roll around for like 30 seconds to a min straight to avoid being hit, just to get one arrow off which is doing like 1/30th of their health in dmg.

The conversation choices don't appear to make too much difference in the conversation at hand, which is good because some of the dialogue doesn't come out with the same tone that you might intend. And while some of the facial animations may be slightly 'off', the overall presentation is smooth. The gameplay is not far from the revamped Tomb Raider series.

The game's standout feature, combat against machines, adds an exhilarating twist to an already engaging experience.

The mechanics are a standout highlight, particularly the ability to scan enemies for weak spots and tailor arrow types accordingly. The variety—regular, tear, shock, frost, fire arrows—enhances strategic depth, making encounters truly immersive.

Visually, Horizon hits a perfect score. The synchronization between mouth movements and voice acting is impeccable, complementing the stunning graphics that beautifully craft its art style.

One facet of the storyline that left a lasting impression was Aloy's journey from societal rejection to becoming a beacon of hope. Her evolution from an outcast to a revered figure, saving countless lives from the looming machine threat, is a captivating narrative turn.

Environments remain consistently refreshing, devoid of repetition. Each area brings new experiences, save for the familiar herbs, maintaining a diverse and captivating world.

Immersed in the game's audio with headphones on, I found it both captivating and functional, aiding in tracking enemy movements and adding depth to encounters with satisfying combat sounds.

The ability to override and stylishly dismantle machines stands as a unique and thrilling feature, further elevating the gameplay experience.

While encountering a few minor bugs—like arrows passing through enemies and herbs stuck in rocks—these were hardly detracting factors from an otherwise flawless adventure.

With the inclusion of a New Game+ feature, Horizon offers the opportunity to increase the challenge while retaining progress. This feature, combined with varied dialog options and reduced fast travel, adds substantial replay value.

In summary, Horizon deserves a perfect score of 10/10. It comes highly recommended. Its immersive world and gameplay beckon players to experience it repeatedly.

I like open-world RPGs but unfortunately this is not a Witcher3/EldenRing/Skyrim-type open-world RPG, but instead is a Ubisoft-type open-world RPG.
The game looks great and runs great, but everything else misses the mark, specifically the gameplay and setting. 
While fighting giant animal-like robots in a forest seems like it would be cool, you fight them with spears and arrows literally made from sticks and stones (not a joke). Instead of having an interesting way to fight these robots, the combat consists of starting with a sneak attack, then shooting the robots 20+ times with bow and arrows.
I am going to try to tough it out and finish the main story of this game, but I think I am going to pass on the sequel that is coming to Steam soon.
I would give this a mixed review if I could, so instead I will give it a slightly positive rating of like a 5.5/10.

Horizon Zero Dawn is not just a video game; it's a breathtaking journey into a meticulously crafted world that seamlessly blends stunning visuals, gripping storytelling, and exhilarating gameplay. Guerrilla Games has outdone themselves, delivering an opus that stands as a testament to the limitless potential of the gaming medium.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Aloy, the game's fearless and charismatic protagonist, you are thrust into a post-apocalyptic world teeming with mechanical beasts and a lush, vibrant environment. The sheer beauty of the landscape is awe-inspiring, with each sunset casting a warm glow on the ancient ruins and dense forests that beg exploration.

The narrative is a triumph of storytelling, weaving a complex tapestry of mystery, intrigue, and emotion. Aloy's quest to unravel the enigma of her past unfolds with cinematic grace, drawing players into a narrative that feels both personal and epic. The writing is top-notch, filled with well-developed characters, unexpected twists, and poignant moments that resonate long after the credits roll.

But Horizon Zero Dawn's true marvel lies in its gameplay. The dynamic combat system is a symphony of strategy and skill, as players must study the behavior of robotic creatures to exploit weaknesses and emerge victorious. The satisfaction of toppling a towering Thunderjaw or outsmarting a pack of robotic raptors is unmatched, making every encounter a pulse-pounding experience.

The open-world design encourages exploration, rewarding players with hidden treasures, breathtaking vistas, and lore-rich discoveries. The sense of freedom is palpable as you traverse the diverse landscapes, from snowy mountain peaks to sun-drenched deserts, each region brimming with its own challenges and wonders.

Equally impressive is the game's technological prowess. The attention to detail is staggering, from the intricacies of the robotic creatures' movements to the seamless transitions between day and night. The audio design further immerses players, with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that complements the ambiance and intensifies the emotional beats of the narrative.

Horizon Zero Dawn is not just a game; it's a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Guerrilla Games has raised the bar for what can be achieved in the world of gaming, delivering an experience that captivates the senses and leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of players.

But other than that I want to say that I'm pretty conflicted on this game. While the story is great, gameplay is repetitive after some point. Most of the main story quests are just going into place A and  tracking your target to point B that is pretty far away from point A. I understand that we are hunter with the second sight and all, but it definetely could be done better. 

Side quests and errands, while mostly working on the same principle, are actually enjoyable since they are optional but also pretty extensive in story, which (to my knowledge) happened only in Witcher 3 before. BUT, because there is a pretty big but [SPOILERS] in those side quests most  of the time you are looking for a person, that when you find them, they will die in the same cutscene, providing basically nothing [END OF SPOILERS].

Frozen Wilds DLC is okay, four main missions and some errands to do, some pretty good close quarters weapons, which main game was lacking. Narrative is great, it get me to actually care about characters which often was hit or miss in the main story.

[LORE SPOILERS BELOW, BE WARNED]

Now to not say that capitalism was almost the end of life on Earth is like saying nothing. Ted f-ing Faro was probably getting a lot of money from countries around the globe just to issue orders of creating more of this machines. And you know what? He didn't want to know future generations that he was behind this, even when he fully understood the consequences of what he was about to do - killing Alphas and destroing APOLLO. Man, I really hate this guy and it's something when you have people like Sylens and Resh in the game too.

Having completed the game on the PS4 and earned the platinum trophy, I can confidently say that Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the few titles that have absorbed so much of my time, and every moment was worth it. The initial issues that plagued its release have been addressed and fixed, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the breathtaking landscapes and intricately woven narrative.

The Frozen Wilds expansion serves as a delightful addition, introducing new monsters and weapons that elevate the challenge for seasoned players. Beyond the increased difficulty, it also satisfyingly ties up some loose ends in the story-line, providing answers to lingering questions that had piqued my curiosity throughout the main game.

One of the game's most commendable features is its ability to leave players on the edge of their seats with a compelling cliffhanger. As a fan eagerly anticipating the release of the sequel on PS5, I'm hopeful for a PC release to continue the adventure.

In summary, Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition stands tall as an exemplary single-player experience.

You can't sexy up the main character much without making her basically totally nude . She looks like a lesbian and has very manly features . The supposed story is half baked and even when it tries to lay it all out still does not have any coherence . Completing the task seem to do nothing and have little to no rewards .

Lots of crashes on start-up, and a really weird issue where it would sometimes get past the (unskippable and fairly long) intro cutscene only to then hang on the title screen. Verifying game files worked at first, but then it didn't. So I refunded the game.

But this came very strongly recommended to me from a few friends, so I was set on at least trying to make it work... ended up getting the GOG version and, after MUCH tinkering, managed to get it running. And it ran quite well for me. But then I was confronted with the game's other issues. 

The default control scheme is Souls-like, for some reason, which is a huge negative for me, personally. You can customize it, yes, but doing the mapping feature doesn't [i]quite[/i] work... Switching things around lead into placing ""crouch"" to L1, which is where the ""weapon wheel"" is. The weapon wheel should theoretically only appear on a button hold, as it is described with a ""(hold)"" indication on the mapping menu. But it doesn't work. Having ""Crouch Toggle"" and the ""Weapon Wheel (hold)"" both on L1 (which is a combination of inputs the game accepts) completely ignored the first function, no matter how quickly I tapped the button. After some much switching around I managed to place the wheel on the left d-pad, which is as cumbersome as it sounds, but at least it didn't take any important inputs away. I had come up with another, much better, solution at some point, but it required leaving one of the inputs empty, and the game refuses to do that.

Another slight but definitely present annoyance comes with Aloy only being able to climb designated surfaces. I didn't expect this to be as jarring as it is, but years of playing games with free-climbing have spoiled me on this aspect. It feels very jank to have the character able to jump 7/8th of the height of an object and that means I have to find a way to walk around it because she won't climb the remaining 1/8 as a part of an animation or whatever. And this is a game very full of things to scale up to. And yes, it feels very cinematic and pretty when their perfect animations lead you from anchor point to anchor point up a mountain. What it doesn't feel is organic... or particularly fun.

Last but definitely not least... (actually, this is my biggest gripe with the game) Horizon Zero Dawn is the most acute case of ""uncanny valley"" I've ever personally witnessed. The game just looks...... wrong. The bit in the intro where we get to play as child-Aloy was particularly sickening to me. Her model just looks... unnatural. The characters are constantly twitching in ways humans just don't and the changes from animation to animation in conversation can be very abrupt. It's like they tried to add a ton of subtlety and variety to the movements but there is actually too much and they don't connect naturally? It made me super uncomfortable to the point where I started to actually avoid dialogue. Which is a bit of a shame because I've been told that the story in this game is actually pretty decent. I'll take people's word on that. I've played for 7h-ish hours and there is still no sight of a decent plot anywhere. The set up is nice, but they have so far done nothing with it.

Anyway, if you can get past these, this is actually a really good GAME. It feels very good to play for the most part. Most of the movement is intuitive and responsive (aside from my point above about climbing), the combat has good weight behind it, feels impactful and using the numerous traps and weapons to set up specific situations feels engaging and rewarding. I like being in the world, and could recommend on that merit alone. But there is a lot of stuff around it that I found very lacking and made me drop the game even after I managed to get it working. Which wasn't this version of it, so there is also that. Can't in good faith recommend this one.",1702041595,1702041595,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

This game kinda splits itself into two uneven parts for me. The lesser part is the ubisoft-ish open world with dosens of funpoints (tm) and the writing that is waaay too young-adult-novel for it's own good. It's all perfectly functional - this is one of the better ubisoft-ish open worlds out there. It's just a tad uninspired. 

The better part is the apocalypse event in this post-apocalypse game. There are big parts about what lead up to this world, and I was 100% into it. It was just deliciously bleak and hopeless and brutal and I loved it beginnig to end. Kinda wished the present parts were more about that and less about the Mary-sue adventures with her harem of hunky boys.

Mankind has been reduced to tribes scattered across the world. Technology is an ancient and forbidden thing, yet we live side by side with machines that act and look like the animals of the Earth before everything went to hell.
That is one of the strong points of Horizon Zero Dawn. It sets up an intriguing story that keeps you asking questions like, what happened here? Why are there machines as animals? Where did they come from? Who created them? And so on…Even the protagonist Aloy has mysteries of her own.

You start the game off as playing a young Aloy, learning how to hunt machines and other mechanics of the game. You quickly realize that the tribe has outcasted you and your caretaker, Rost. None of the tribe members are allowed to talk or play with you. But there is a trail of sorts called “The Proving” in which if you win, even an Outcast can then become a member of the tribe. This leads into a montage of the game showing Aloy growing up and training for “The Proving”. When the day comes, you are a guest of the tribe and are able to take part in the games to prove yourself along with other youths who are coming of age. During “The Proving” the contestants are attacked and killed by a group your tribe has called “The Killers.” Being the only survivor of the attack, the tribe elders task you with finding out what happened and who these “Killers” are. It is at this point of the game where you are now allowed to explore and do as you please in Horizon Zero Dawn’s open-world.

Once you step out into the open world of Horizon Zero Dawn, you can then do as you please. Follow the main story quests, which reveals what happened to Earth, where Aloy came from, and other pressing questions that the story presents you.
Sidequests are another strength for Horizon Zero Dawn, earning you both experience and shards. You can go hunting to eventually gain access to the hunter’s lounge in the main city of Meridian, or look for Cauldrons, secret locations which produce the animal-like machines out in the world. Overriding these locations gives the ability to override more machines in the wild. The freedom is yours and there is less of the boring repetitive gameplay seen in most open world games these days.

The gameplay of Horizon Zero Dawn is fun and interesting. You can get a variety of weapons and armor. The rarer the weapon, the more ammunition types are unlocked to you. The weapons and armor have to be bought from vendors exclusively. But what can be found in the wild are the many resources used in crafting and trading. Machines and humans will drop mods, resources, and shards. Shards are the form of currency in the game to buy things and are used to craft ammo as well. While exploring the world, you can also find these ultra-rare items, which specific vendors will trade very rare items for them. So Horizon Zero Dawn has a lot for you to explore for.

When it comes to the combat in Horizon Zero Dawn, it gives you satisfaction when bringing down a machine. You quickly learn that the machines are a force to be reckoned with. Especially the bigger ones. The bigger they get, the more ammo and time it will take to bring them down. Going up against many machines is a bad idea, they will overpower you and kill you fast. So using a device you get in the beginning stages of the game called a “Focus”, can show you the weaknesses of each machine. This will help you determine what weapon to use and ammo. Some are vulnerable to fire, others too cold, and others need ammo that does damage to armor.

Jumping into a battle unprepared with the machines in the wild is suicide. Plan carefully and watch your surroundings. The other aspect of combat in Horizon Zero Dawn is the fact there is no target locking. Yup, you have to freestyle every shot, so make them count. At least the game gives you a few moments to slow down time. Skills can later extend this, but it only gives you about 3 to 5 seconds of slowed down time to make that specific shot count. As you can guess, there is experience gained while playing the game. Experience will level up Aloy, which she can then put skill points in about 30 or so skills ranging from slowing down time to making your critical hits stronger.

As beautiful, fun, and interesting as Horizon Zero Dawn is to play. The game doesn’t come without faults. At times I wish I could pull back the camera some more because I always ended up hitting things that stopped Aloy in her tracks while fighting the bigger machines. The camera angles got annoying and even caused me to die at times. Another fault I want to touch on is the human enemies. They suck and are pretty boring. I found the combat and planning my attack on the machines more interesting than dealing with the human enemies in the game. Their AI is terrible, and the sections with them in it were the least interesting. I found myself avoiding the sections where you fought humans, they just were not that exciting as the machines to fight.

Horizon Zero Dawn is one hell of a game. Even with the faults I mentioned, it was one epic journey. I enjoyed the story, the combat, and even exploring the world. I got easily distracted while making my way to the next main story mission. That to me makes an awesome open-world game. There is over 80 hours worth of gameplay here. Even if at times I got frustrated with the game, I still wanted to jump back in to see if I can find that next Cauldron or plan my attack on some machines in the wild. Horizon Zero Dawn is a must own for any open-world fans.

I knew nothing about this game going in, so I didn't know what to expect. I was kind of leaning towards the impression of Vikings vs Aliens from a quick look at the Steam store page.

I love game. I love the protagonist, the story, and much of the map. It was amazing. I was so drawn into seeing the story play out, I did have to push much of everything to the side. I plan on going a New Game+ sometime after Baldur's Gate 3 so I can dive deeper into the side missions and exploration in this game.

There are a couple of things I didn't like:

+  I feel a good portion of my playtime was likely spent cowering in the grass, hesitant to make a move. The game has swarms of enemies at every turn, which often hindered my exploration. 1 on 1, would likely be no problem, but that's not always the case as there's almost always a pack of enemies, and a variety at that. Some people really enjoy challenging content though, so it's just a me problem.

+ Inventory management was a pain. I felt like a hoarder for much of the game without really understanding what was truly important and what wasn't. I didn't spend much time looking at it, but the stat management of gear didn't seem very informative. It was hard to truly tell what was better.


Overall I would say the game was absolutely amazing. Even with the combat challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed the combat system. I loved this game, and I now look forward to Forbidden West in 2024.

Overall its a very basic generic open world game. if you've played far cry, assassins creed, or any open world game. you've played this game. there are other games that do what this game does but a lot better. The robot dinos are def the highlight of the game and designed super well but clunky controls made me feel it was more of a chore to play than anything. The mounts in this game are slow and hard to control. Also I don't know what it was but shooting in this game was very off. like either the cross hair is not right or the projectile speed is off. (probably just me). 

Aloy is the protagonist of the game and i gotta say she is very bland and boring. The voice acting in this game is mediocre. The side quests are pretty forgettable and a waste of time. To me this will always be remembered as the game that launched along side breath of the wild. 

Lastly, I do think the story of this game is very good. It does have its dumb moments but overall how it plays out is pretty good. there is just too many times where I just was not having fun and rolled my eyes at dialogue. I also only had 2 crashes and had stutter in very dense populated areas in the game but nothing too bad. overall performance was good enough.

Horizon Zero Dawn... Play any other game.

The fun part is the combat loop. Acing robots in soft spots, rolling through charging beasts, tying down gargantuans and smashing them to bits, it's a thrill.

Beyond that, well, it's not really much of anything. The novelty of cybernetic tribes is awesome, but doesn't give it lasting power. The quests are all pretty much the same - go here, kill this, look at this. 

There isn't much scavenging going on. Sometimes you have to get some supplies: resources, herbs, meat. Not a very thorough mechanic. The equipment options are straightforward and simple: a few bows, a few slingshots, and then easy-to-aquire upgrades that don't really change much.

Its moderate length prevents fatigue, which I see as an advantage. Story completion and first playthrough take 20-30 hours, while the full game completion spans 60-80 hours. Besides the first playthrough and the new game+ opportunity to 100% the game, I wouldn't consider the game world interesting enough to keep you entertained outside the two playthroughs mentioned above.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

The gameplay is probably the most enjoyable part. Most encounters require preparation, which might be frustrating for people used to button-mashing. Tactical combat is by far the best gameplay feature of the game. As far as the interaction goes, there's nothing groundbreaking. It's the typical stuff seen in other similar games. The gameplay features: unlocking a specific area of the map, hunting grounds, collectibles, focus mode, bandit camps, skill tree progression, resource gathering, and crafting - everything you'll find in other games. There's nothing new like others told me there would be.

Some friends that played the game on the PlayStation console told me there are a lot of new gameplay mechanics they haven't seen before, which is wrong on so many levels. I haven't discovered a single thing that has not been already overused in other games, which only tells me that the people I got this intel from are either very biased or haven't played many similar games. There are a ton of objectives to complete throughout the map, but most of the less important ones are oversimplified. I jumped into this game with high expectations, expecting something I'd never seen before, which was initially disappointing. Most side quests emphasize the slow approach to prolong the playtime. Fast travel packs are thankfully a thing and are easy to obtain, which saves a lot of worthless traversals.

[h1][b]Presentation[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

I was amazed by the incredible level of detail on display. The game's world divides into distinct sections: lush regions brimming with dense foliage and swaying grass, empty wastelands dominated by endless stretches of rock, and snowy expanses where visibility is severely limited. The rendering of foliage remains tolerable while traversing the world on foot; however, the moment you jump onto a back of a machine and pick up speed, the landscape transforms into rapidly growing foliage. The audio experience is expertly crafted, with sound effects that are notably immersive. The musical score is so distinctive that even a decade from now, you'll easily be able to identify the game it belongs to.

Now, let's delve into the realm of animations. I must express my disappointment with the animation work, particularly within dialogues. Finding an appropriate term, I would describe the animation quality as unsettling. I'll refrain from being overly critical, but some characters are horrifying. I've also encountered peculiar glitches, such as Aloy's eyes seemingly expanding to an almost anime-like size and some unconventional hand and facial movements exhibited by other characters during dialogues. It's worth noting that the updates fixed some of these issues, though sporadically, a few still manifest during gameplay. On a brighter note, the character controls prove to be impeccable.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

The game's narrative left me expecting more. It began strongly, setting high hopes for what would follow. However, as the initial sequence concluded, the pace slowed, and the excitement dwindled. While not devoid of interest, the story occasionally felt flat, lacking significant developments. Remaining attentive to collectibles and data elements is essential to maintain engagement. The issue seems rooted in the unremarkable characters encountered early on. Though later characters don't fare much better, the initial ones are notably dull. The story's initial portion lacked momentum, making pursuing predictable main quests unappealing. The Frozen Wilds DLC is an expansion pack and the best part of the game that introduces new content, including a new area to explore, additional quests, and more challenges.

Predicting outcomes 10 out of 10 times reduces the excitement of uncovering what's next. About 90% of characters lack any meaning of life, often reminiscent of lifeless zombies spouting dialogue. Main quests become much more interesting later, yet frequently involve traveling from point A to B, discovering something, and returning. The journey lacks entertainment beyond stationary machines awaiting attacks. Side quests are often repetitive and offer time for exploration and collectible hunting. I regret choosing the normal difficulty, as the game isn't as challenging as anticipated. Strategic planning triumphs over impulsive encounters. Biased hype around exclusive titles lacking superiority to third-party games is questionable.

[h1][b]Technicalities[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 17/20[/b]

The game's initial release was unstable and full of issues, spanning crashes, consistent frame drops, and recurring stutters. Thankfully, Nixxes intervened and diligently addressed these performance issues later on. The current version operates smoothly, delivering a commendable gameplay experience that marks a substantial technical enhancement. The game does exert a considerable demand on PC hardware. Nevertheless, a comprehensive array of PC-specific settings facilitates adaptable performance across varying hardware. Playing the game on an Intel Core i7-10700K, RTX 2080 Ti, 64GB DDR4 RAM, Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVMe 1TB SSD resulted in a stable framerate above 80 FPS most of the time at 1440p maxed out preset.

[h1][b]Final Verdict[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 82/100[/b]

Horizon Zero Dawn emerges as a solid game only once you ignore the Sony PlayStation fan-generated hype. It's important not to anticipate extraordinary things from this release. I have fallen victim to other people constantly bragging about how good the game is while it's just another immersive open-world title. The key achievement is its PC arrival, hopefully signaling Sony's recognition of PC gamers who opt out of consoles for a more diverse gaming experience.",1597841511,1701625713,True,52,6,0.633165180683135986,0,True,False,False

Fast forward to now, I got it on pc for a good deal. Unfortunately, it still bores me pretty fast lol. It's not for me for sure, and I give up trying to like it. But here are the pros and cons: 

Pros: 
- looks beautiful on pc
- runs really well, getting over 200fps 
- in general, nice ability to mod to lessen some of the grinding is a huge plus 
- voice actress does a great job
- some of the backstory for the characters is good and story is ok
- some of the main monster battles are fun

Cons 
- it can be very grindy (again, get some mods to help you out...or have fun with grinding to get items if you are ok with that)
- The story is kind of hit or miss; some of the characters are endearing and others are just meh 
- side quests are incredibly boring and require a lot of walking/fast traveling back and forth and that's if you are lucky to have materials or bought the fast travel
- Aloy isn't developed as much as I'd like so not sure that it makes me care for her as much as a character 

I think what really makes me get bored at the constant traveling back and forth and boring side quests. There's not much carrying the story, so it feels like it's just Aloy walking back and forth to many places and doing the same thing all over again.",1701560738,1701560738,False,13,2,0.514631450176239014,0,True,False,False

Clocking in at 118 hours, every moment spent in this post-apocalyptic masterpiece felt like a revelation.

From the very beginning, Aloy's character drew me in with her determination and wit. The narrative weaves a tale of mystery, uncovering the secrets of a world dominated by robotic beasts. The storytelling is so compelling that I found myself emotionally invested in every twist and turn.

The open-world design is nothing short of phenomenal. Roaming through lush forests, vast deserts, and snowy peaks is a visual feast. The attention to detail in the robotic creatures is remarkable; each encounter feels like a strategic dance, keeping me on the edge of my seat.

The combat system is both challenging and rewarding. Aloy's agility and a diverse array of weapons make every battle a unique experience. The ability to override and control the robotic creatures adds an extra layer of strategy, turning them into powerful allies.

Beyond the action, the game encourages exploration. Discovering hidden caves, ancient ruins, and solving environmental puzzles adds depth to the gameplay. The world feels alive with a rich history waiting to be uncovered.

In terms of technical aspects, the PC port on Steam is exceptionally well-done. The visuals are stunning, and the optimization ensures smooth gameplay even on high settings. The attention to detail in bringing this console gem to PC is evident, and it greatly enhances the overall experience.

Horizon Zero Dawn isn't just a game I played; it's an experience I lived. Guerrilla Games has crafted a masterpiece that sets the bar high for open-world adventures. If you haven't embarked on Aloy's journey yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this world of wonder, danger, and discovery.

Story is one of the strongest aspects of the game. Guerrilla Games has done a great job. It is gripping, well-written... it is just an amazing experience. This game has everything that a good single-player story game needs to have: strong emotional moments, unexpected plot twists, relatable characters, and so on. Personaly I really enjoyed story.
The story begins with a little girl named Aloy and a man called Rost. Rost is Aloy‘s father, and both of them live as outcasts in the wilderness of the Sacred Lands. That‘s because Rost's tribe, called Nora, outcasted them, and they are forced to live outside the tribe. However, Aloy wants to know why, so she is looking for the answers. She decides to go to the Nora to look for the them. However, she is an outcast, so no one will talk with her. But there is a way for her to get the answers, and it’s a trial called Proving. When she succeeds, she will become part of the tribe and get all of the answers she seeks. I am not going to continue because I don‘t want to spoil anything. Don't worry, this is just the very beginning of the game's story.
2.	Quests
Quests are really nice; I enjoyed doing most of them. Some of side quests even had their own story, just like in the Witcher games. Sometimes even 2 or 3 side quests were following the same story. This is something that I loved when I was playing Horizon.When I was doing side quests, I didn’t feel any kind of repetition or something like that. It seemed to me that every quest had something to offer. Main quests are mostly about exploring and getting to know the story, but they are not only about this, and they also possess quite a lot of combat. Speaking of combat...
3.	Combat
Combat in Horizon is excellent. There are plenty of possible ways to fight. You can be a sneaky bastard, killing everyone quietly like a shadow, or you can be the biggest badass and start shooting at everything that moves. To be honest, the stealth approach is much more successful than the badass one. Because it may be tricky to kill enemies face to face, especially if there are many of them and not just one enemy.
What I really like about Horizon’s combat is that it involves an element of strategy. You need to think before you start fighting. You have many options to choose from. There are many types of guns, traps and also you have a huge advantage, you can override machines. This will help you in combat. What is more every machine has its unique weak point that you can find and use it to your advantage. Every machine except the fucking Sawtooth. I wasn't able to exploit any weaknesses on this son of a bitch. Horizon is an RPG, so upgrading Aloy is a necessary part of this game that must not be forgotten. Aloy can be upgraded not only by buying new gear and leveling up, but you can also unlock new skills with skill points. You will earn one skill point after each level up and after completing certain quests. They are divided into three different sections in the regular game, and if you purchase the DLC 'The Frozen Wilds,' you will receive an additional section of skills. 
4.	Game World
Horizon is an open-world game. The world is huge and filled with various activities, from destroying bandit camps to finding collectibles and taking down machines. I recommend doing all activities because they will reward you with huge amount of xp and resources. I don't think I've ever played a game that rewards exploration and collectible finding as much as Horizon does. Here's what I mean: when you collect a required amount of specific collectibles, you can take them to a merchant interested in buying them, and he will trade them for some useful items. This trade might not provide you with extremely over-powered weapons or an enourmous ammount of resources, but it can be helpful. What's also great is that you don't need to search for these collectibles randomly. You can purchase a map from a merchant, and once you buy it, all the collectible locations will automatically appear on your map, making it easier to aim for a 100% completion run.
Like in every open-world game the map is hidden. To uncover it you can find tallnecks, machines that are harmless unless you are an idiot and go right under their legs. Ahem ahem ahem, don't ask me how I know this, thanks. When you climb a tallneck, you can override it, and the entire region will be revealed. But reaching the tallneck might be challenging because they are often surrounded by various types of enemies. However, with enough patience and a tactical approach, you can reach the tallneck without engaging in combat.
5.	Graphics, audio, optimization, bugs
To be completely honest with you, the graphical aspect of Horizon Zero Dawn looks amazing. Textures are sharp, and everything looks great. This level of quality can also be attributed to the audio and optimization. Game runs smoothly, and I rarely experienced any FPS drops or similar issues. The game is perfectly optimized, and the developers have clearly put a lot of effort into it. As for bugs, I haven't encountered many. The most common issue was that some creatures occasionally yeeted from the ground after being killed, but this only happened a few times. 
6.	My opinion about this game, my statistics
So, I believe I've expressed my opinion throughout this review, but to summarize, this game is fantastic. I believe this game is still up to date. Graphics look amazing, gameplay is rewarding and tactical, game world is not empty, exploring is well designed...I believe that Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best AAA game of this genre. This review might make seem Horizon like a flawless game without mistakes, but it's not. There are some minor problems. One of the most significant problem is the facial expressions of the characters. Sometimes they didn't look very natural, and they didn't appear very real. Given that Horizon features a lot of dialogues and various characters, this aspect can ruin the overall experience a little bit. Another thing that bothered me was the main quest line, not the quests themselves but the travel involved. Let me to explain. Horizon's map is huge and at times, it felt like one quest sent me to one location while another sent me to the other side of the map. This left me surprised  and sometimes annoyed, but it isn’t a major issue. It’s only annoying.
Overall, I enjoyed this game, and I would recommend it to anyone seeking a single-player game with a good story and combat. I’ve spent 59.3 hours on the first run and achieved nearly a 100% completion so it tells something about the quality of Horizon. I would rate this game 10/10. Those mistakes are merely minor on this title, and they don't ruin the overall experience a lot. So this game is definitely still relevant and definitely shouldn’t be forgotten. It holds its own even among popular and new games like Elden Ring and even now it has something to show.
7.	DLC
Basicaly dlc is almost exactly like main game but in smaller. I definitely recommend buying it, Although story is a little less gripping than main game’s story it’s still nice. I would give this 8,5/10. Very nice dlc.",1701555626,1701555626,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Imagine standing on the edge of a dense, emerald forest, with sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating a mesmerizing play of shadows. Or picture yourself traversing the scorching deserts, where every grain of sand glistens under the blazing sun. These landscapes are not just backgrounds; they are living, breathing works of art that make exploration a joy.

Horizon Zero Dawn is more than just a game; it's an immersive adventure that takes you on a visually stunning and thrilling ride through a meticulously crafted world. From awe-inspiring locations and jaw-dropping graphics to heart-pounding encounters with colossal machines, ths game has left an incredible mark on my gaming experience.

The game's entertainment value is off the charts. The story is a rollercoaster of emotions, flled with unexpected twists and memorable characters. Aloy, the game's fearless protagonist, is a character you'll become deeply attached to. Engaging in combat is a thrill in itself. You'll employ stealth, master archery, and devise clever strategies as you face off against a diverse aray of mechanical giants. Whether you're stalking machines through tall gras or engaging in intense battles, every moment is a pulse-pounding experience.

Imagine the adrenaline rush as you confront colossal machines. The towering Thunderjaw, armed to the teeth, or the elusive Stalker (which I HATE), blending seamlessly into its surroundings. Each machine is a visual spectacle in its own right, and defeating them requires skill and strategy. The satisfaction of taking down one of these mechanical titans and salvaging their components for crafting is a visceral experience that's hard to match.

In my opinion, this game is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of gaming. Its breathtaking world, stunning graphics, captivating storry, and thrilling battles against giant machines combine to create an unforgettable experience. If you're looking for a game that not only immerses you in a stunning world & also provides hours of incredible entertainment, Horizon Zero Dawn is an absolute must-play.

The old world plot line affords you the distinct pleasure of Lance Reddick patronizing you while you spelunk for orphan clues. As you progress, you discover elon musk takes credit for things he doesn't do and isn't actually that cool of a guy. This is overall quite engaging but the plot holes are closer to plot craters - cough - bow and arrow kills megamind machines - cough.

Many new world quests, i.e. things that don't pertain to old world tech, are as developed as the cultists frontal lobes. At one point, you have to prevent 2 bombs from going off so you push one out a window which explodes and ignites the second one - this is considered a bomb squad success.

I think the devs found this out themselves as the spartan tundra hellscape dlc is damn near better than the base game. That said, no matter what portion you play, you will still be fighting the highly precise aim system that controls like a hummingbird after a bump of coke.

My only complaint was most games have 9 or 10 slots on screen (or even more) places to slot weapons and devices for easy access why we were limited to only 4 is crazy.

This game is Wiedzmin3 and Tomb raider mashed together in a mixer with a lot of downgrades in gameplay no smooth movement and aim feels like sponge instead of normal mouse.(if you play this game you know what i mean).
The story is decent in the main parts.. sometimes animations are out of sync with sound, sometimes sound doesnt even load.. But this issue is mainly in side missions and random quests. In main missions it happens rarely.
The world and npcs feels as flat as airport runway because you can bump into them, slice them and they wont even notice your presence.. some does with one sentence ussualy containing one word .. they wont even move or anything when they get to contact with you.. basicaly like a randomly moving pillars.
This is amplified when you get to market in Meridan which sounds like there is a lot of npcs yelling at each other or doing some trades but in fact there are only few npcs there hardly any moving mouth like talking.. 
A lot of the positives goes into technical side of the game.. Like how well devs managed to hide all loading screens.. Sometimes even too well that if you manage to go into certain location without poping the loading animation the game either gets corrupted or start to slowly load all the assets soo it will drasticaly decrease your fps.. Both happened to me several times during exploration.

On negative side of things: Hidden damage scaling with your character level.. I saw this when i slowly progressed trough game. On start i was trying to do stealth kills because they were highly efficient but on lvl 55 I found myself just oneshotting most of the low health robots like scrappers,watchers etc. with my spear(without dlc you cant have modifications on it soo i didn't put it on until i started playing dlc)
Also what trows me off a lot was many instances of console movement where i couldn't shoot until i stand still or vice versa.. Happened in some ''Dungeons'' also you can't do more than 2 things at the same time.. Like you can't run, drink potions and have focus activated.

Mounts in this game are basicaly obsolete thing you shouldn't use unless you want to make your life miserable. They can't jump unless the game decide its good time to jump, they can't jump down from things because it's too steep for them even if its just 20cm fall and unless you go by predeterminated road your mount will run slower than it should.

Same thingy goes for parkour/swimming in this game.. You can do cool stuff with parkour or just swim really fast but only if you go where the devs want you to go. Otherwise Aloy refuse to get up from water even tho she is basicaly swimming in a 20cm pot. same goes to parkour.. she can jump from wall to wall even 4meters away but when it comes to basic stones you are lucky to not die and you need to spam spacebar to even make her jump somewhere.. Also if you go too high in mountain which you technicaly can the game will automaticaly kill you and respawn you on last saved spot.

But hey it still have a decent story soo try this game when it gets discounted.",1701433484,1701433997,True,33,0,0.634648323059082031,0,True,False,False

A really good open world game. on release it crashed a LOT, but as the patches go the crashes have too.
(once every hour while doing story and once every 4 hours+ when exploring which is an improvement from once every 10 minutes during story and once every hour while exploring).
They're definitely working on it to make it as good as it deserves to be.

The mouse and keyboard integrations are mostly really well done. The only downsides i would give are that the NPCs move too slow in the follow missions for your default walking speed. So you have to stop, then start, then stop, and repeat since you can't just walk slower like you can with a joystick. 
That and the scroll wheel can't be rebound to something else. (like scrolling through inventory items instead of weapons)

Otherwise aiming feels good, and the movement is [i]mostly[/i] responsive (sometimes but rarely, you have to repress the move keys to start moving again idk why)

The game is absolutely gorgeous (we all knew this already) and the gameplay is fun and unique.
There is SO much to explore and learn about the world that it's given me a sense of intrigue very few games can accomplish for me. Despite the constant crashing at the start, i just kept booting the game back up anyway wondering what i would find before the next crash.

It was definitely worth the purchase for me. If you don't wanna deal with any of the technical issues at all, i wouldn't be surprised if they were all gone in the next few weeks (i was correct lol)

Oh, and if you're having severe performance issues, as well as crashing. I would recommend downloading the latest visual C++ re-distributable from Microsoft. That instantly fixed my own framerate issues (but not the crashing lol).",1598205216,1701409810,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

haven't finished the game. Had it for a while. Bought it in my (I just wanna play some good lookin, well made solo games) era. It played alright on my 3060Ti with only 16GB RAM. I was gaping for a solid 2 hours after launching the game because the world you run around in is so well made. The graphics are just spot on. Played it again with a PC upgrade and boy oh boy its even better.

It has all the ""open world but no car"" elements like fast travel and scattered sidequest / outposts to make you feel like there isn't empty space between the waypoints you run to. Voice acting is very good although there isn't enough background noise when they talk. So at times it feels like your listening to two people in a studio. Some quests can get boring and repetition is on its radar. But I don't think I ever got bored making my way around the map, even at great distances. the robots and amazing terrain makes you feel like you just played Mincraft AMPLIFIED for the first time.

Story wise: great concept. Not new but with a twist. Two completely different times are in a way connected by the main character, Before the incident and way after when humans are slowly claiming its place back as the horrible murder machines we are. Can't let the robots have that medal.

Its on sale so get it if you can. Game hasn't aged badly yet. Feel like the ones who have age is the community's taste for these types of games. I'll still buy them tho",1701344233,1701344233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Amazing scenery that goes from snowy mountains, to overgrown ruins, to open deserts and a dense forest. Every area has a unique feeling and induces awe, with great graphics to back it up too. The story is great, an intriguing and very interesting adventure of learning of the past and how that led to the current state of the world, and what may follow. Gripping battles, each different with the variations of machines to fight, with easy to understand mechanics and hard hitting enemies that become a pleasure to fight for fun (on normal difficulty). 

I had a blast just doing the small things, getting fast travel points, getting the collectibles, I enjoyed going around and fighting the machines when I didn't need to. I did all the quests I had found, and they were all very enjoyable, a few definitely worth the time for the stories they had. A great game for any that enjoy open-world rpg games, the post-apocalyptic feel is amazing and really makes each area wonderful to explore. I recommend the game to anyone who is curious about it, take the dive like I did and experience it's world. The first day I played it, I never thought it would be this great, and I'm glad I just took that chance to start playing it when I had been curious about it myself.
I had only 2 crashes in the game, were annoying at the time but weren't the worst thing, had no other problems from that.

Positive:
-The graphics are still pretty good, especially for its age.
-The lore is incredibly good and continues the story of life on earth in a realistic and well imaginable way.
-The gameplay is good and keeps you entertained for many hours.
-The weapon and combat system is easy to use and understand. However it takes time to master.
-Long playtime, especially if you do all the things the game has to offer.
-Very good DLC.
-Great character design with well fitting personalities.
-Well thought out world design with high attention to details.
-In total 79 achievements, many of them are earned throughout the story.
-Lots of collectibles and additional narrative in both audio and text form.
-Very stable engine, can´t remember it crashing even once.

Neutral:
-The game has no auto save feature outside of quests, so you have to save the game manually at campfires.
-A few side quests feel a bit repetitive
-The photo mode´s orbital camera is hard to control and when doing so has a mind of its own and the area where the camera can be positioned is quite small.
-Facial animations feel a bit old (The DLC is pretty good however).
-No ray tracing support.

Conclusion:
Everyone looking for a new story based single player game, I recommend you try this one out.",1677507859,1701279058,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You can't hear dialog unless you're looking straight at the person talking; simply turning the camera away mutes the track.
- The character's steps can be heard only from the one speaker she's closer to, basically no sound on the other speaker.
- Often you hear loud sounds from locations that are behind large objects, like buildings or rock ridges, that overpower anything that happens right next to you.

There are no in-game controls for the speaker configuration, it's opaque which kid of audio setup the game assumes.


The game's auto-exposure also has trouble setting  a sensible brightness at night or in dark enclosed areas.
Especially in Cauldrons the picture often turns pitch black even without bright lights in view that might explain why the game lowered the overall brightness.
Outside a single bright rock somewhere in view can turn the rest of the picture black as well.

These two combined make this an unpleasant experience. I don't recall these issues from the PS4 version.

There are a good variety of enemies, with a huge range of tactical advantages and disadvantages to consider when taking them on. 

The world has a lot of depth to it, with a good range of side-quests to allow you to get really stuck in.

You can even ""tame"" nearby machines to fight along your side.

Story-wise, this game have a amazing lore, with each mission you get a better understanding of the entire world. The deeper you got into the game, more secret reveals itself. And yet it didn't solve any of your question, makes you wanna proceed on the main story and find out what the heck happened.

So far the game has lived up to my expectations, but sadly my enjoyment has been lowered due to the crashes. Yes, I haven't escaped from suffering game crashes, just like so many others, though I consider myself somewhat luckier than many others because my game only crashes every 60-90 minutes. Despite that I'm still enjoying the game and Guerrilla Games ARE working on patches to fix the crashes so hopefully it won't be too long until they finally get all the fixes in place and the game crashes become a thing of the past!

I'm sure there are some who will read this and wonder why I'm recommending this game. That's because I'm looking past the crashes and just focusing on the actual game itself. As such, it's a really nice, fun game, the game world looks very nice, gameplay is pretty good and fairly solid. You can see just why this game has been so popular amongst the PlayStation crowd ever since it was released a little over 3 years ago.

Yes, some may want to wait a little longer before buying, thereby giving Guerrilla more time to nail down more crash fixes etc. Right now it's certainly a gamble: you might be one of the really lucky ones who don't get a single crash; or you might be one of the really unlucky ones who crash every 5 minutes; or you could be one of those who can't even get the game to run; or you could be like me and just get a crash every so often! So that's the gamble. Then again, you could just wait a few weeks to see how things go. After all, many PC gamers have been waiting for 3 years to play this one, what's waiting a few more weeks gonna hurt? ;)

Make your choice, buy now or wait a few weeks. But either way, this one is a must buy at some point! :)

Edit on 27 Nov, 2020: So, it's been a few months since I first wrote this review and I figured I should add a little bit of an update on how things are going. Guerrilla Games have now released eight patches (plus a hotfix for patch 1.08) so far in their efforts to address issues. Obviously I can only comment on my own experience so others may have a different opinion. I'm happy to say that the patches have helped to reduce the number of crashes I was getting. I'm now at a point where I can play for hours at a time, sadly not completely crash free yet, but now a crash is much more of a rarity, I've gone from multiple crashes every time I tried to play to an occasional crash a coupe times a week!

I'm on 400+ hours played, completed New Game+ Ultra Hard and I've obtained all of the achievements. I'm loving the whole game: the story; the graphics; the music; the characters and of course the gameplay. Much fun and enjoyment can be had here, but, like so many things, it's not for everyone.

I'm one of the nerds that wasted a lot of time playing (and getting a platinum trophy) on the PS4 version of this game, and absolutely loving the game. By far one of the best RPG titles out there! There are definite cons and pros like any game, but the cons are more about the core of what makes RPG games the way they are, and why i play very few of them.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
-Very captivating story which does a pretty solid job fleshing out and keeps interesting throughout the game.
-Combat is pretty well balanced though your addiction to dodging will be the key to surviving at least 75% of battles.
-Aesthetically, a masterpiece of a game, though it being the first huge title for a company like Guerrilla since the Killzone series (which I never was as invested in and never were as big as the Horizon series has been.) and the first in the series it definitely feels a bit lackluster/disjointed in the talking sections as the characters sometimes have unnatural movement (NPC classic moments) or the lip movement doesn't match the tone/volume of some of the lines they say. Not uncommon for the first in a series to have those issues. Those things aside the beauty of the game is incredible and it feels huge and exciting once you get going [spoiler](mostly after you leave the Embrace)[/spoiler].
-Big array of weapons, equipment, outfits, machines ect. It left me feeling like there was always something to do and much to explore. At times it was overwhelming, but as you get more familiar and understand the curve of the difficulty as you play on everything tends to work out as what you primarily will fight with and wear during certain encounters.
-Much to do and explore and it kept me coming back as most side quests were usually beneficial and relatively unique, but no game is immune from repetition [b]ESPECIALLY[/b] in an RPG title lol.

[h3]Cons:[/h3] (there maybe some spoilers but i'll try and keep it as ambiguous as i can and censor most spoilers)
-The endless running. it makes sense with such an open environment that you need to flesh out as much as possible and being a true RPG the game is going to be just massive, but if you're ok with sometimes just running 3 miles because you don't have any [spoiler]fast travel packs[/spoiler] and you somehow missed that pack of striders running amok. It sometimes feels like a drag, but it's part of the game play.
-This being a port it will have it's glitches from time to time, and i had a game breaking glitch initially where if i looted something too quickly it would either freeze momentarily or drop down to so slow for 20-30 seconds that it was less than a frame every 3 seconds. Then it would freeze to the point that it permanently ran at like 1/10th FPS which also slowed my PC to that speed until i restarted my whole laptop. I found a fix which resulted in me going to the properties tab in the game and turning off [i]full screen optimizations[/i] which has fixed the issue, buuuut it was an issue i was having. Also some textures take a crap in certain cut-scenes which is jarring, and sometimes funny at times.
-Slow progression at times. Just RPG stuff I'm not always a fan of, but I will say some of the upgrades are worth the work to acquire.

There's more i could elaborate on, but those are some of my pros and cons I have about this game. The cons are more about the issues of the port as those issues were never something i experienced with the PS4 version of the game.

[u]Should you buy this game at full price:[/u] I initially did for the PS4 and didn't regret it, but as for this version I'd say wait for a sale as I did. There's just enough issues that [b]SHOULDN'T[/b] be issues, and mostly with it being a port it takes away from the high price take of $50 still. This being said a friend of mine hasn't had a single game breaking issue so your experience may vary from mine.

Lots of exploration
Challenging battles
Awesome plot-lines
Fulfilling quest-lines
I get to play as a female protagonist.
Fights require strategy, you aren't just a tank and spank 1D character.
Lots of jumping, not as good as Breath of the Wild, and I wish they would have made it so you could scale the skyscraper rubble but I mean it's good enough.

Cons: 
Pathing is super weird, it's heavily based on stealth, and some mobs can shoot you even when you are hidden. You will learn to adjust but early game it's super annoying.
Fast travel early game is meh but improves exponentially mid game, so again, not a major flaw.
Game kicked me out three times. Usually this is not on my list of cons as I am a compulsive saver but the saving system is similar to Dark Souls as in you can only save at campfires. Thankfully it autosaved when I was about an hour and a half through a mission since I had saved but the first time I crashed I was not, and had to replay the hour I had spent harvesting, and farming.
Too many quest helper suggestions: ""I should try using this"" sort of thing, like three second after searching (once the tutorial is over that should be it)
Wonky horse movement

25 Euros on sale for this?! That's a bargain!, Well worth it's full price aswell. Very few games that have me hooked for hours at a time. 

If you like Sci-fi this, this is absolutely a no brainer to get. intriguing story, Well filled open world that doesn't feel like a lot of nothing between the action, and Side quests that kept me from progressing the main story for hours (that's a good thing). 

No bugs or issues so far, runs great.


[h1] Finished Main game + DLC around 84hours  [/h1]


So i did most of the things this game and dlc had to offer, the story had me hooked all the way through this game, and the story had me reading through every bit of text i came across, which in games, I don't normaly bother with.
The collectibles in this game add value to the game it's self, with gear and usable items + actual interesting lore attached to them, collectibles done right, if i'd say so myself. 

Game mechanics: Works more or less flawlessly all the way throughout. The one thing that i'll complain about is getting out of water in some instances can be a bit wonky, but there are so few times, i'd let that slide. 

Final words: I love how this game manage to be a medieval and a sci-fi game in one go!

However, if you're curious of the ways I found it to be a very good game, I've listed some important positives below.


COMBAT: an admirable part of the game. The combat system Isn't overly complicated to the point of confusing, but Isn't too simple to the point of being redundant and boring. The skill ceiling is a good height, and starting out, the combat isn't necessarily glaring. You just shoot machine with arrow until it stop moving. Luckily, the devs expanded on this and provided many different avenues and play-styles for dealing with bots. While I feel there could of been more done, the system works and fits well into the world they made.

IMMERSION: Most games have some sort of introduction that takes you through combat techniques and other small features. They'll have the instructor tell you ""press E to pick up the sword"" or ""use your menu to craft new weapons""  and while helpful, it shatters any immersion you had built in the world. Why would these people be telling my to press E? Oh. Right. They're not people, they're NPCs, and this is a game. In Horizon, its clear that immersion is a top priority. While there is an introduction, it flows smoothly into the main game and does a seamless job at giving expedition and providing basic knowledge on combat. The great part is, I didn't even know there was a skill tree until a few hours into the game, because they didn't shove it down my throat. I cant imagine Rost going ""Here's your skill tree, this is where you can learn important moves."" While people may not appreciate this approach, it worked surprisingly well.

STORY: The most impressive part of this game I would say is its story-line. Compelling, in-depth, and creative are very good descriptors. While slightly predictable at times, this story truly does take the interesting concept it has and makes it shine. It keeps you wanting to discover more and kept me hooked all the way through. It gives you all you want from a story-line and more. The game never forces you to watch hours of boring mindless dialog, it instead presents questions that you can ask npcs if you would want to know more. Each cutscene is Important and interesting, I didn't skip a cutscene or a forced dialog a single time.


While there is much much more positive things I could say (replayability, map design, game-play loop) I feel these are the three most important positives that I picked up during my playthroughs of Horizon. I hope you try the game out yourself too.",1701052211,1701069009,True,1,0,0.503921568393707275,0,True,False,False

For me, the most fascinating part was the history - when the game uncovers what happened and what lead to the events of the current world.

- The gorgeous graphic side of the game is already pretty obvious from the screenshots.

Steam support declined my request, citing my three hours of playtime. So, I told myself, well, **** the poor performance and the very annoying start, maybe it gets better.

Yeah, it got better. Performance still sucked extremely, which I find rather surprising, considering that my specs are above the requirements. But the story slowly unfolded. Some side missions were rather poorly designed, but others actually were quite great. The main story also slowly got better and better, and the many small snippets of info you get by using the focus to scan your environment also helped to enrich the story.

Combat against the robots was also nice, nostalgic perhaps, as I really love the combat in Monster Hunter and this felt somewhat familiar.

However, the combat against human enemies is extremely awful. You can either turn your enemies into a porcupine or they die after one good hit, against the head. Yet, the movement of human enemies is sometimes extremely erratic, making it hard to hit them without slowing down time. Furthermore, sometimes there are simply too many enemies that just throw themselves at you. This is just annoying. And it feels like the good old moment in Skyrim when you stumble into a bandit encounter after having killed Alduin with just your fists or a wooden sword.

Pal, I killed half of the known robot population, managed to kill your friends, and you still continue to fight? If all humans had willpower like that, Operation Enduring Victory would have never ended... 

I really would have loved to have some sort of mechanic that introduced some sort of surrender-flee mechanic for human enemies. I hope that the sequel has such an mechanic. Otherwise they should just remove human combat, it sucks.

Lastly, the graphics are also decent, at least one my settings. No idea how it looks on low settings. Performance, however, as I already stated, sometimes sucks. I randomly have stutters, CPU-loud goes to 100% and the game just idk uses my PC to run a focus network or whatever.

All in all, HZD is a nice game, I rarely had bugs, and with exception of the performance, most aspects are good or far above average.",1631711490,1700957139,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Excellent graphics, especially after patching for years
- Great gameplay, albeit not particularly complex
- Unique world
- Truly open world after the tutorial. Little railroading
- The robot-dinos truly are amazingly well made

Cons

- Faces look a little plastic
- Sub-par voice acting, at least at times
- A little too hand-holdy, at least in the beginning
- The gameplay can become a little repetitive

**The narrative of Horizon Zero Dawn unfolds within a meticulously crafted and expansive universe,** enveloping players in a spellbinding story that rivals the immersive quality of top-tier RPGs. Aloy's journey isn't merely a quest; it's an exploration of a world brimming with diverse characters, each contributing to the rich tapestry of this unique universe.

**The exploration aspect of Horizon Zero Dawn is nothing short of breathtaking,** echoing the prowess seen in other renowned titles. Every nook and cranny of this open world invites discovery, concealing hidden stories and untold mysteries that enrich the overall experience. The attention to detail is so exquisite that reality seems to dissolve, leaving players fully engrossed in the game's mesmerizing landscapes.

**In a narrative landscape painted with shades of gray, Horizon Zero Dawn navigates the complexities of morality much like real life.** Characters grapple with intricate motivations and moral choices, mirroring the nuanced decisions we face every day.

**Graphically, Horizon Zero Dawn stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern gaming graphics.** The world isn't merely visually stunning; it resonates emotionally. Facial animations convey a depth of expression, adding authenticity to character interactions. Dialogues become more than exchanges of words; they transform into a visual and emotional symphony.

**Elevating the overall gaming experience is the enchanting soundtrack by the talented composer Joris de Man.** The music seamlessly weaves into the narrative, enhancing the emotional resonance of Aloy's journey and the world she inhabits.

**The musical enchantment of Horizon Zero Dawn is truly magical and awe-inspiring.** Joris de Man's composition transcends the realm of mere background music, becoming a symphony that elevates the entire gaming experience to unparalleled heights.

**Each note in the soundtrack is a brushstroke on the canvas of an immersive narrative.** Whether it's the haunting melodies echoing through desolate landscapes, the tension-building beats during intense encounters, or the poignant tunes underscoring pivotal narrative points, every piece feels purposeful and evocative. The soundtrack becomes a character in itself, shaping the tone and ambiance of the game, enriching the storytelling experience.

**In the grand tapestry of gaming soundtracks, Horizon Zero Dawn's musical composition stands as a masterpiece.** It's not just background noise; it's a magical force that enhances the overall experience, making the game not only a visual spectacle but a symphony for the senses. **The soundtrack of Horizon Zero Dawn is nothing short of extraordinary, leaving an indelible mark and ensuring that the magic of the game resonates in the hearts of players.** <3 :)

First of all, the storytelling is one of my favorites in all the open-world games I played so far. The fact you just get thrown into this world with ruins of a lost civilization, not knowing what happened makes it so intriguing to find out more. I had so much fun with the whole storyline and most sidequests are great too. Furthermore, the graphic is still fantastic and can easily hold up with many recently released triple-A titles. 

But what stands out to me in this game are the gameplay elements. There are a lot of different machines to fight, and you can obtain various weapons to do so. In the beginning, big machines, like thunder jaws can be overwhelming because you do not have many weapons and don´t how to approach them. But the more you progress and the more you fight them the more you realize how easy they are with the right strategy. Every machine has different weak spots and finding the right way to target these is the key to winning the fight. Being able to shoot off parts from these machines which reveal these weak spots or shoot off enemies’ weapons to use against them, is something I have never really seen in another game before.

The progress system is pretty balanced as well. I always found enough resources on the way and inventory space is sufficient. Furthermore, the number of level-ups you get is fair as well and by the end of the game, you will probably be able to afford most of the abilities. And I got to say: Sliding under a machine to shoot its weak spot with 3 strong arrows while in slow motion and killing it in the process is probably the most badass thing I ever did in a video game.",1700663646,1700663711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are two types of gamers: Power-gamers and role-play-gamers. 

Power-gamers look for the optimal build, don't actually give a shit about the story, are just looking for something to make them feel good about their miserable, pathetic lives. This is why pseudo-combat-simulators appeal to such people. They are losers in rl, so they use games to make them feel like they are bigger and better than they ever have any hope of being in rl.

Role-play-gamers are looking to play a character, like a character-actor. They are there for the story, graphics, and ambiance. They are not looking for a combat simulator. They want to stay true to their character. They are there to experience an adventure, not waste their time trying to figure-out how to get through one shitty battle after the other, because they are unwilling to optimize everything.

I LOVED the cyber aspects of this game, and the marriage between the more primitive setting and the technological aspects. However, this game hasn't decided what it wants to be. 

Are you trying to appeal to RPG gamers? If so, you failed.
Are you trying to attract power-gamers? If so, you succeeded.

It makes me sad, because I was totally into this game, until the combat went full-force. Then, I just asked for my money back. I couldn't remember which key did what or what, how, when, why with all the pseudo-combat crap. Decide what you intend to be, then go with that, but you cannot be both.",1700653887,1700653887,False,3,7,0.309691697359085083,0,True,False,False

I'm not normally much of a fan of AAA games but it takes a lot of the typical mechanics of such games and uses them to better effect than most AAA games do.  It feels like what Witcher 3 should have been, decking out your character with gear specialized for the creature you want to fight and coming up with a strategy to defeat it is actually fun and interesting and takes thought, instead of a linear walkthrough that the game handholds you through, which takes hours and ends in a 3 minute battle.

The battles are difficult enough that it overcomes the problem of wanting to hoard all of your single use items forever, while resources are just scarce enough that it gives you some interesting decision making about how much you really need to burn and what is going to be most effective in whatever situation you're in.  Leveling feels right, where things that were deathly scary get noticeably easier and easier, but that mostly just comes from learning the game better and getting new abilities and tools, and it never gets to a point where you can just tank things without concern.  It makes better use of the open world too, not as much ""ignore everything but the quest marker"" gameplay (though still some).

I think a good example of how it takes a tired mechanic and elevates it is the use of weakpoints.  They're less just about damage and more about status effects, and tend to be harder to get to, can take multiple shots to take effect, and can have potentially bad consequences if you don't plan right.  Maybe blowing out the fuel canisters to get a DOT is a good idea, but maybe you don't want to deal with a flaming dinosaur charging at you, maybe you want to take out it's ranged attack and deal with it somewhere it can't get to you, maybe you want to take advantage of the fact that it stuns easier, maybe it's a larger heard and you do want to get that chain of explosions going and try to hide and let them burn themselves out.  What's going to work and not is going to change a lot based on your abilities and tools and terrain and the number of enemies and whether it's one or multiple types of enemies.",1700642104,1700642104,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

**Graphically, Horizon Zero Dawn stands as a testament to the capabilities of modern gaming graphics.** The world isn't merely visually stunning; it resonates emotionally.

 I was a bit out of touch with regards to playing. So I looked through my games and found Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to say. It is a pretty game. Nice graphics, great movement of the character. Interesting story and a pleasant sound track.
The game play was refreshing and I enjoyed the learning curve with regards to the characters skill set and use of weaponry. Which is basically a spear and a bow and arrows. Which is a change from my normal big axe and bad attitude type of character. Hit them hard enough until they die, more Hulk smash than finesse.

At first, the world-building looks promising, you wonder what happened to the world. However even if some questions are answered some don't make any sense and only are there for the sake of the gameplay, even if it's immersion-breaking. 

The gameplay looks great at the beginning but becomes tedious early on, you only have two hits with your spear, and bow gameplay becomes redundant very quickly.

The skill progression is awful only the first row of skills changes the way you fight and are exciting, once you hit level 10 you're done, at level 40 you'll be playing the exact same way.

The voice-acting is excellent but is mostly used to listen to people standing there, talking for hours without much happening.

The graphics are... gorgeous, nothing negative here.

The bottom line is, buy it on sale, play 10 hours at most and uninstall. Which sadly, seems to be the new way of making action-adventure games nowadays.

I would like to start off by saying wow! For a game that has been around as long as it has the graphics are still so stunning!! This game was definitely a pinnacle of gaming during it's time and I can see why. Fluid combat, Great story telling, Insanely good graphics and the game runs so so smoothly even on a Rtx 3080 w/ 4k 32:9 49inch monitor.  It is still getting about 80 - 100fps with DLSS on so keep that in mind if DLSS was off I am almost certain I would not be hitting these fps numbers. Be more like 30 - 40fps most likely without DLSS it's that big of a performance helper. I only use it on Quality setting though... Anyways back to the review. The game is a 10/10 in my book for the type of game it is and the graphics / Story Line the game tells is just so good.

If you have never played the Horizon games as far as I know there are multiple games. Zero dawn is the first and then Forbidden West is the 2nd and then there is a VR version of Horizon coming out but it does not have Alloy in it and it is a seperate story from these first 2 games.

The only things that stood out to me are lore of the world and pretty fun robot fights (but they do get boring). Story is fine, stealth is there, exploration is pretty fun, lore is interesting (and would be a lot more interesting if most of it wasn't in arbitrarily placed text logs), and a curious lack of puzzles.
Annoyingly, it still does the thing where it tries to portray realism, but then randomly f**ks up while also making gameplay worse. Example - bonfires for saving, it kinda makes sense, but is hella annoying when you can't save where you want. Another is ammo pouches/quivers - kinda makes sense, but is made almost redundant by the fact that you can quick craft arrows in the middle of combat, and make 20+ arrows in the time it takes you to draw the bow... Yeah, the only reason i see them existing is just that you would have to hunt random animals to upgrade them, wasting time. BS.

Few other points - crashes and controls.
For me at least, i could hardly launch the game at first without it getting stuck or crashing on me. An hour of looking up guides and changing random stuff, and now it was bearable, but still crashed randomly. 30h in i got to a place where it would always crash, 2 more hours or trying to fix it, reinstalling game, drivers, stuff, and finally no more crashes, no idea what exactly fixed it. The game has been out for 3 years on steam, wtf.

The controls are a mess too. Even until finishing the game and dlc i did not use dodgeroll because of how awkward and stupid it was, had to change sprint to manual from toggle, because it just toggled off if you did almost anything, and scroll wheel was completely useless because tab for weapon wheel was way better, heavy spear attack also took like 20h of getting used to, because the run and heavy attack have the same combo button, and half the time i would start sprinting into the enemy instead of hitting it.
Best part is, some keys are rebindable, while some aren't, some are combined and cant be uncombined, or cant change into specific keys... Wanted to use scroll wheel to scroll through consumables, nope, have to use a button to do it one at the time. Ugh.

So yeah, if you like ubisoft style sandbox games, you gonna like this too, but if not, dont expect too much more from it. I had my fun with it, because i rarely play this type of game and dont have the open world fatigue, but i would still only recommend it to be played on console, 3 hours of troubleshooting is way more than i would like, and the controls are probably better with a controller. Also, if you play on pc, for your own sanity put this game on an SSD if you have one, literally cut the loading times by 7x (1min 45s to 15s).",1699607048,1699644416,False,1,0,0.474452555179595947,0,True,False,False

Horizon Zero Dawn is undoubtedly one of the best open RPGs in recent years, and it has taken the leap onto the Steam platform with great success. As a long-time console gamer, I was ecstatic to finally experience Aloy's thrilling adventures on my PC, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations.

The Complete Edition not only includes the original game but also comes packed with the Frozen Wilds expansion, adding even more depth to an already engrossing storyline. The first thing that struck me was the breathtaking graphics. The PC release takes full advantage of the enhanced capabilities, allowing for crisp details and stunning landscapes that immerse you in the post-apocalyptic world of the game.

From the very beginning, the narrative captivated me. The story unveils itself layer by layer, gradually revealing the truth behind the enigmatic past. Playing as Aloy, a strong and resilient protagonist, I found myself invested in her journey and committed to discovering the secrets of the ruins that scattered the world.

One aspect that sets Horizon Zero Dawn apart from other games is its combat system. The battles feel exhilarating and dynamic, thanks to the variety of weapons and tools at your disposal. The fluidity of Aloy's movements and the strategic element required to take down towering robotic beasts is simply unparalleled. Each encounter, whether against massive Thunderjaws or agile Stalkers, provides a thrilling and rewarding challenge.

Moreover, the inclusion of skill trees allows you to tailor Aloy's abilities to your playstyle. Whether you prefer stealth or brute force, the game offers ample flexibility to experiment and customize your character's approach to combat and exploration.

The Frozen Wilds expansion, while not altering the core gameplay significantly, does introduce a new, snowy region with its own set of challenges and quests. It seamlessly integrates with the main story and adds additional hours of content, making the Complete Edition well worth the investment.

The optimization of this PC port is fantastic, offering a wide range of graphical settings to suit various hardware specifications. On my mid-range system, I was able to enjoy smooth gameplay without any noticeable performance issues.

As for the technical aspects, I encountered no crashes or major bugs during my playthrough. The developers have done a commendable job in bringing this console-exclusive gem to PC, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for players.

In conclusion, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition on Steam is an absolute must-play for fans of action RPGs. Its immersive world, gripping storyline, and outstanding combat mechanics make it a standout title in the genre. From the remarkable graphics to the smooth gameplay performance, it's evident that this port was crafted with care and attention to detail. Dive into Aloy's post-apocalyptic adventure and prepare to be utterly captivated by this masterpiece.

[list]
[*]Scenery so beautifully picturesque it makes you want to experience it firsthand. 
[*]A fascinating post-apocalyptic story with plenty of background lore to slowly piece together through detective work and exploration, which I love. 
[*]Very cool and imaginative machine designs.  
[*]Fun combat that encourages creative use of weapons and methods of engagement. I was generally drawn towards the predictably reliable ""stealth archer"" approach, but there are situations when that isn't the most effective strategy. 
[*]Just about every skill on the tree is actually useful, which is kind of rare. 
[/list]
The meh:
[list]
[*]The side characters (other than Nil) aren't particularly memorable.
[*]The final battles aren't particularly challenging or interesting. 
[*]The enemy target focus tends be fixed on the player even when getting help from friendly machines or NPCs. 
[*]The hunter bow is redundant, especially later in the game. The tearblast arrow is clearly better than its hardpoint counterpart, and harvest arrows are pretty much pointless. A snapshot bow with fire arrows would have been the preferred option.
[*]Combat balancing in the DLC area isn't great. The tougher enemies - namely Scorchers - are so aggressive and resilient that brute forcing myself through fights using explosives ended up being the most viable strategy.

I approached this expecting a ""Sony interactive movie"" because of how much this game has been memed to be more in tune with GoW rather than being a gateway into Monster Hunter. 

If this was supposed to be interesting because of its story and characters, in my opinion it failed miserably.
 
The setting can basically be described as Rise of the Machines meets Jurassic Park on a post-apocalyptic reborn earth, where humans live in tribes and fight each other while hunting big dino-robots.

But the story is not bad because of the setting, which is pretty good actually, its bad because they just made it non interesting. Really, is just boring. 

And the fact that a good portion of the background events that led to the world being in the present state is told to you through f*cking AUDIO LOGS and DATA PADS is just icing on the cake to make it even less interesting. 

I reaaaally hate the use of audio logs to tell a story. I can cope with it if its an indie or a walking simulator, maybe its good for some horror games too, but only if its purpose is to get you acquainted to SOME of the story/background.

Not to tell half of what's going on and what happened before... That's just lazy, and also very badly implemented in this game. 

Why? Because if you're going to leave audio logs scattered around every single main story mission location, you might as well make Aloy shut up a little and don't let her interrupt the audio every single time...

I'm listening to something interesting for a change, only for Aloy to make a remark about something in the environment and then the audio cuts off... 

Forcing me to pause the game and go to the menu, search through tons of other logs to find the one I was listening, and then play it again from the beginning, hoping she doesn't interrupt it again this time.

That's dumb, I stopped listening to audios and reading data pads halfway through the game unless they were critical to the story. Otherwise it gets tiresome, I just scan them and move away, not like I'm missing on much anyway...

Also, the characters play a crucial role in making a story to be engaging, and there's not a single memorable character in this game. Not a single one. 

Sylens might be the less bland and boring of the main characters, and there was also a pretty funny guy from a side quest, I think his name is Gildun. Those are literally the only two characters I remember....

The rest of them are generic brown tribesmen (seriously they're all brown, was there something wrong with the color palette?) looking for an errand girl to send on a fetch quest.

Side quests are given by characters who are supposed to have a bit more depth than your average town NPC but are still bland and will also send you on the same generic quest over and over.

Go to X, investigate scene with your focus, follow tracks. Rinse and repeat. That's what almost 90% of quests are about, and it sucks.

What about Aloy? Completely forgettable, one of the most boring protagonists that I can remember, she only looks good, and that's about it.

I don't see who would play this because of the story and I've seen people praising it as if it was something marvelous. To each his own, I guess. 

Now what's really good about this game tho, that's the gameplay. 

Setting out for a hunt, scouting an area, scanning the robots to learn their weaknesses, laying traps and preparing your loadout, then finally facing them in thrilling, intense fights, is so satisfying and fun to do, especially when you go after big boys like Fireclaws and Thunderjaws. 

There's a lot of weapons, traps, and outfits at your disposal for every type of playstyle and situation and the game does a good job encouraging you to try everything, making the combat very dynamic. 

You won't be using the same weapons and outfits all the time, unless you want to at hard time with the toughest enemies. Although that was on very hard, which is the difficulty I played on, I'm sure on lower difficulties this will be way more forgiving.

Overriding a Thunderjaw and just watching this giant apex predator wreak havoc demolishing absolutely anything that crosses its path, is some of the most fun and satisfactory moments you can presence here.

I recommend to visit Cauldrons as early in the game as possible to get more machine override options and make them fight by your side. Is worth it just for how fun it is to watch them.

Now about the technical aspects. It looks wonderful, not exaggerating, this might be one of the best looking games I've ever played. I can't believe the PS4 was able to run this at a playable frame rate. 

But PC is what we care about and here it runs smooth as butter. Not a single frame rate drop in almost 100 hours played. Never crashed, no stuttering, short loading times, almost unnoticeable LOD pop in. Its technically impressive.

There's plenty of graphic options to choose from, customizable FOV, 144hz support, good amount of AA techniques... I don't think there's any major feature missing. Just about everything you expect a solid PC port should have is present here.

tl;dr Nice game despite the story being a bit underwhelming and a bad quest design structure. More gameplay heavy than I expected it, almost like a Monster Hunter ""lite"" of sorts. Looks very good, runs smooth, and has quite a satisfying combat system.",1621555246,1699294575,True,5,0,0.52595984935760498,1,True,False,False

pros:
-absolutely stunning, still one of the best looking games out there, easily, and also runs steady 60 fps at 4K with all settings maxed on a middling system (Ryzen 5 2600x, RX 6700XT, 32 GBs GDDR4).
-great gameplay. A bow and arrow is always a good gameplay weapon, but Aloy can acquire trap casters, elemental launchers, etc, as well as use her spear to take on enemies. Enemies are stacked with components to knock off for bigger damage and crafting uses, and a basic but effective skill points system adds to your skillset throughout the game.

mids:
-the story is very intriguing, but some flat characters and a lack of meaningful worldbuilding hampers it some.
-the world is good looking but nebulous. Having grown up in between Colorado Springs and Denver and near the Rocky Mountains, where most of the game takes place, i can say it A, looks very little like the actual Rockies and B, is simply too small to be a semi realistic depiction of Colorado and Utah, and yet too big to be fun to walk/ride everywhere. Utah and East of the Rockies is much more accurate looking though.
-Towers are boring but at least they move.

Cons:
-Aloy talks a bit too much. It's not as big an issue as the sequel, but it can get annoying, despite Ashly Burch doing fantastic work.
-detection percolates too far too fast. getting discovered in a bandit base means everyone knows where you are within seconds.
-combat against humans is inconsistent and often unfun due to a lack of damage indication, you'll often find yourself dying because arrows fly and theres only a little red vignette to indicate low health, beyond the heath bar.
-world is devoid of activity. Aloy literally cannot do anything but kill. open world games need what i would call distractions; back in the GTA San Andreas days, they had clothes to buy, gyms to get buff at or learn new melee moves at, fast food places to get fat at, haircuts and tattoos, dates to go on, races and gambling to do, etc. whether is for immersion or just to have something else to do, open world games of today have completely forgotten about that. when im tired of killing machines or humans, what is there to keep me in the game?",1698608838,1699249418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I expected it to be very action-focused (like Darksiders for example), so I was suprised to see it had more RPG elements with like crafting and skills selection. Pleasantly surprised, mind you.

Still, let's start with the robot-shooting : it is as satisfying as you'd expect, there are lots of different ways you can go at it, and combat feels really cool and dynamic. I think stealth is maybe too good an option to choose something else, but you are free to experiment as you like, and with different weapons too.

As for the robots themselves, their designs are unique and cool and I loved seeing all the different kinds and how they worked. I was delighted every time I saw a new one. And, something that blew me away with their designs is : sometimes, you see a big one and your first thought truly is ""wow, I want to fight that"". It had never happened to me before and I think it adds to the cool factor.

The environments were varied, wide, and beautiful. You always want to explore, it feels good to find new places and admire the view. It also felt new and exciting to go from somewhere like a hut in the snowy woods and end up in a giant futuristic robot factory hidden in a mountain. Stumbling on these futuristic ruins without warning added something special to the world, you really felt like you were discovering a whole civilisation.

You also meet a lot of characters with different personalities, attitudes, and prejudices. They react differently to Aloy, making the interactions feel more real. I was also extremely impressed by how real the characters looked (I think they're modeled after real people ?), and how well the lips movements matched their speech. It's a tiny detail, but every time I thought ""damn, that's neat"".

The story started in a fairly standard way about a young woman wanting to prove herself, then it goes in a lot of unexpected directions. I loved uncovering information little by little, and through Aloy's story discover more about the world. The blending of worldbuilding and character development was really well done.

One negative point I have to talk about is the fact that a lot of lore is found through written logs. There are LOTS of them. And they're NOT short. And while I usually LOVE lorebooks and the like, Horizon is not the appropriate game to have to player just READ things. It's about adventure, exploration and environmental storytelling. So I basically ignored the logs, which is a shame.

But there is a lot more positive than negative, and I definitely recommend Horizon, it was a great experience full of wonder and epicness !",1699214375,1699214375,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And there's harder modes that keep others entertained fairly well too) but the real reason this game just lives on in my head as a wonderful time is how the story unfolds. Maybe not so much in terms of characters, which is pretty surprising, as Aloy stays more or less the same person with a lot of sass and a bit of a chip on her shoulder -- but in terms of the story *telling*. You get to see the lore of the game unfold in such a neat way as you progress from spot to spot in a natural and well-paced way, and see the history of the world and how it came to be, well, [post-]apocalyptic. There are some really cool reveals, which make a bit impact, which is extra interesting because most of the reveals aren't really about you, they are about the past, but still make an emotional impact. And again, along the way, slow mo jumping and sliding arrow shots shooting off specific parts of robot dinos is just so satisfying. There are incredible visuals all over from the natural scenes to the human settlements to the underground tech dungeon-like places to the decaying ruins of humanity to the revitalized parts reclaimed by nature.

Graphics/performance:
The game looks and runs great, I had no bugs or glitches, and only one crash. You have to be lucky to see the beautiful stuff though because I feel, its either night or raining all the time ;P.
I could max out everything on a 3070 and had no frame drops at all, I haven't checked the fps, but it felt smooth.
When you skip cutscenes, Aloys hair jumps around a lot, but I only did this once after I accidentaly was mean to Rost and reloaded the save, normally I don't skip cutscenes ;). Also sometimes in cutscenes some textures were flickering, but thats it.

Gameplay:
What I loved is that it seemed like using certain dialog choices (Aloy despite the Nora) or doing certain sidequests changed the dialog in the main story. Alsos it seemed like main story also had custom dialog for situations, where you entered locations earlier than expected.Or if you already completed some sidequests before, I really liked that, the story feels more connected.

Combat is fun and very fleshed out, there are many different unique weapons and ways to use them. You can either use machines to fight for you, use brute force and just blast enemies with bolts or shockwaves, or be stealthy, use silent strikes or different arrow-types to use the weeakspot of enemies against them. All of that is explained neatly with optional tutorial quests and hunter trial, that you can easily skip if you want.

Side quests are mostly: Kill A, follow Tracks at B, Fetch me item C or talk to D, but I didn't get bored. There are also bunkers/cauldrons to explore and some puzzles, the puzzles are extremely trivial though.

Can feel a bit video gamy at some times, why do I only have a chance to get an animal skin, did that one arrow destroy the whole thing? Also NPCs feel a bit NPC like, just standing around in cutscenes (which is way better in the DLC). Also climbing is very videogame like, you climb, whereever there are yellow ledges, and nowhere else.

Story:
The story is very interesting to follow and really hooks you, its generally well made.

------------------ DLC -----------------------
Same level of quality as the main game, brings new unique Weapons and Enemies. Story was very interesting to follow and answers many questions from the main game as well as advances the story in general.
Also, NPCs and Aloy are Motion Captured in Cutscenes now, which greatly improves the quality.
New areas look great, but in some areas I had some very low frames this time, mostly in the cauldron with many lights, not sure if this was because Raytracing, if there is raytracing in a PlayStation Game.",1699118333,1699146558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE GAME:
- The game is flashy but shallow, watered down the floor.
- Meaning Graphic may looks nice but exchange for the bland/simple combat where you do the same thing over and over again.
- Story is fine but the NPC/MC voice acting and interaction is as flat as a board.
- AI is not very good, ironicly human enemies in this game is also a mini robot.
- For PC it still remain an unoptimized mess after 3 year. Crashing reports are still coming...
That said, there are still fun to be had playing this game. If you play games mainly for the graphic and like simple gameplay then this game is for you. If you craves for renovated gameplays, riveting story or something abit more substantial then i suggest you reconsider.

- Release terrible,lazy ports/full price because they just an ""small indie"" studio.

The story is BEYOND AMAZING, beautiful graphics, authentic characters, the best combat I have ever experienced in a single player game, a rewarding progression system and an open world that's fun to explore and fight in!

The combat system offers a ton of skill expression and rewards experience and practice. There's huge variety when it comes to types of enemies you will fight and each of them have immense depth. 

The more you fight a certain type of enemy, the better you get at fighting them as you find out what weapons work against them and which don't, their attack patterns (helps you dodge) and their weak spots. And MAN does that feel rewarding, being able to outmaneuver and kill a type of opponent that seemed intimidating and close to invincible the first few times. 

This also motivates me (and many others from what I've read) to re-play the game at max difficulty at some point to put that experience to use and challenge myself. 

Crafting allows you to tinker around with all different kinds of modifications to tune your weapons (and outfits/armor!) exactly the way you need them for YOUR playstyle. 

If you're here for the (absolutely amazing) story and less interested in learning the deep combat mechanics of this game, there's a ""story"" setting that eases combat so you can fully focus on the narrative. 

Spoiler-free recommendation: Throughout the (open!) world of Horizon Zero Dawn, you will find „Data Logs“, little snippets of information in various forms.  Listen to them or read them! They are never directly required to complete a quest, but they add soooo much depth to the story that they will leave you googling theories after you‘re done playing for the day.

Now to the details! This game is a joy to behold, from the wonderful crafted ecosystems that feel real to the haunting and yet still beautiful soundtrack... Horizon: Zero Dawn does not disappoint. As you step into this world, an ice cold stream on one side and a field filled with swaying grass and deadly machines on the other, I hope you will be as captivated as I am.

Each has unique mechanics that make them all a very real threat, they force the player to adapt to the fight at hand or get squashed. They also all make sense, each filling a niche in the ecosystem and each playing a vital role in the new Earths future. 

Sure, there are some issues. The performance on PC isn't great if you don't have a very powerful PC and there are aspects of the game that are REALLY buggy. There's also a brutal difficulty curve if you want to 100% it as I have. But through these issues the core gameplay still shines for me.

I was originally playing it on my Playstation but found the mouse and keyboard settings much easier to deal with, especially the aiming aspects.

The story is interesting to start, since a lot is hidden from both you and the main character until you progress more. About 2/3 of the way through the story when you learn why the world is like this, I was amazed and enthralled and pushed through to the end of the story right then and there just to see more, it was awesome!

But to be honest with regards to gameplay I'm on the fence. I am not a major fan of the combat as all your doing is dodging while trying to do damage (mostly with the bow). In my opinion this makes the game very tedious to play. Stealth is also pretty easy and I've played against smarter AI.

Music is okay but nothing noteworthy in my opinion especially compared to games with amazing OSTs like Mass Effect or Subnautica.

The best part of the game is the main storyline but I felt the prologue was done very poorly as it didn't draw me in a well as games like Mass Effect, Jedi Fallen Order, Spider-man or Assassins Creed game do. I think its a combination of poorly written introduction to the characters and the tedious gameplay.  To be honest I was even thinking of quitting early on and just refund the game. It was only because my mate told me to keep playing because it gets better that I didn't refund it.

Side story don't really contribute much to the world building and are just boring tasks of do this or do that. The few side quests with storylines that do exist seem to wrap up real quick. The collectables are a joke with most of them being random message talking about random stuff. And the rare collectables only seem to give you metal shards in return once you collected them. Which was useless because by the time I found all of em I already had like 10000 metal shards or something.

However I have to admit that is game is made really well with decent graphics, weather effects that have a effect on gameplay. And in my time in the game so far I have only found like 2-3 minors bugs but nothing game breaking so its pretty wel made. It also works with no issues on my PC unlike a few other games that recently came out (looking at you Spider-man remastered and Jedi Survivor).

Overall I would rate this game a 6/10 (maybe even a 7/10 taken into account how well it performance).",1688047912,1698324097,True,0,0,0.487152010202407837,0,True,False,False

Many time your arrow will go pass through like you shoot air.
Hit box was also lame, if you lower or higher than your target  it so hard to hit with melee.
Your animation got block by enemy if you got too close to them.

There are many weird decisions in combat, I dont say it bad or not fun but it annoying it like they dont finished adjust it.

Horizon Zero Dawn balances out the action component of the story with excellent skill quests, side stories and a straightforward skill tree.

The story line is MUCH better than I anticipated with multiple story threads unfolding into a logical and richly textured whole that unfolds as you play.  I have a lot more to experience, but so far, I'm intrigued and enjoying the experience.  I'm not totally happy with the level of resource hunting/gathering required for inventory upgrades, but common resources are readily available, the resource ""randomizer"" and placement are good and they provided a key 'red flag' indicator which is visible at a distance for resources that fill up (like healing herbs) so you don't run around trying to harvest thinks you can't keep.

Gameplay is fun, use different weapons and such to take down robot monsters. Story is decent but I absolutely dislike how much GRRRRLPower there is in the game. Anytime a guy is talking to Aloy, she pretty much always has a threatening response to them. Same with other female characters. It gets annoying so I skip cutscenes. 

Game gets a 3/5 because of that weak armor that's locked in a bunker. Spent most of the game excited to wear that cool lookin armor with a HELMET that covers the face. Unlocked the armor and it's ruined because it has to be converted to the NORA armor. So no cool full faced helmet. The Carja Blazon Heavy Armor you can buy looks way cooler.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a unique and awe-inspiring adventure that I've invested 15.2 hours in, and it's a game that transcends the boundaries of traditional open-world action RPGs. It's a stunning amalgamation of primal and futuristic, nature and technology, and above all, a masterful narrative that keeps you entranced.

In this post-apocalyptic world, nature has reclaimed the earth, and colossal mechanical beasts known as ""Machines"" roam freely. You step into the shoes of Aloy, a determined and resourceful hunter seeking answers to the mysteries of this world and her own origin. The game's narrative is rich and emotionally charged, slowly unveiling the secrets of the past as you journey through stunning landscapes.

What sets Horizon Zero Dawn apart is its remarkable world-building. The mix of lush forests, vast deserts, and ruined cities creates a breathtaking backdrop for exploration. The attention to detail in both the environmental design and the intricately crafted Machines makes this world feel like a living, breathing entity. The day-night cycle, weather patterns, and dynamic lighting add further depth to the experience.

Gameplay in Horizon Zero Dawn is a unique blend of hunting, combat, and strategy. Aloy's agility and precision in using her bow and various tools to dismantle or override the Machines is both thrilling and tactically engaging. The sheer variety of Machines, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, encourages strategic thinking, ensuring that encounters are consistently engaging.

One of the standout features of the game is the ""Focus,"" a high-tech device that allows Aloy to analyze her surroundings, track enemy paths, and gather information. This device not only enhances the gameplay but also strengthens the connection between the player and the world, encouraging exploration and uncovering the game's rich lore.

The game's audio design deserves special mention, from the immersive sounds of the Machines to the enchanting musical score. The voice acting is superb, with Aloy's character brought to life with depth and authenticity.

Horizon Zero Dawn offers more than just a captivating main story. The game's side quests and additional content contribute to a sense of agency and exploration. The lore found in data logs and ancient relics paints a vivid picture of the world's past and adds layers of depth to the narrative.

With 15.2 hours invested, you're likely to have only scratched the surface of what Horizon Zero Dawn has to offer. The game's extensive world, narrative, and optional content can easily double or triple your playtime, making it an excellent value for the avid explorer.

In conclusion, Horizon Zero Dawn is a remarkable work of art in the realm of open-world gaming. It seamlessly blends a unique world, exceptional storytelling, and thrilling gameplay into an unforgettable experience. It's a game that transcends its genre, offering players a chance to lose themselves in a world where ancient mysteries and futuristic technology collide. If you value immersive storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and dynamic gameplay, Horizon Zero Dawn is a must-play, and it's a journey that you won't want to end.",1697696817,1697696817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After dumping tons and tons of hours into the game I have just gotten bored with it. Outside of finishing the story the game progress is super minimal. There’s really no need to continue playing because most of the weapons and other things are earned through traders. In order to buy these things you must kill enemies and collect pieces. It starts to get super repetitive. In order to fast travel you need to purchase fast travel packs that require you to have items in your inventory. So yet again you have to go out and kill to collect.

It hits all the boxes for game enjoyment, and delivers a very unique experience.

Pros:
- Dynamic and Engaging story. Very creative, apocalyptic, and thrilling.
- Very satisfying combat system. With a variety of weapons and tools that gives you freedom to approach combat differently. With the right approach, you can control any fight you are thrown into.
- Amazing visuals. Very soothing and eye catching environments.
- Very interesting concepts. A post-apocalyptic, futuristic, cyber, tribal, primal, and medieval mix merged together very nicely.
- Well-structured missions. Map and mission design is on-point, providing a dynamic experience with enough freedom to keep everything interesting. 
- Excellently written main character. Alloy (the main protagonist) is by far one of the most proficiently built character I have seen in modern gaming. She is also brilliantly voice acted. 
- Sylens. He's a very interesting character. Lance Reddick did an amazing job with this one. 

Cons:
- Loading times. They can be a pain sometimes.
- Limited parkour. You can sometimes feel obstructed by the terrain, and limited to few areas to climb. 
- Too much knock back effects. Some are unnecessary and can feel annoying sometimes. 
- Uninteresting characters. Some (not all) characters are not well written and voice acted. Some are extremely annoying and you can end up skipping their entire conversations. 
- Although the game has a diverse array of weapon and armour, it could had still used a bit more, as you can remain stuck with a few weapons for a very long time.

Pros:
- Great gameplay that will stick you to the game until the last moment and doesn't get boring after a while.
- Graphics are excellent. Aloy, her enemies, the environment, nature, and even the fruits. :))
- Good music and sounds.
- A lot of thought and effort has been used on machines' design. They are good, and fighting them is fun.
- The story is good, both main, and side quests. Storytelling, even better.
- Aloy is a likable character.

Cons:
- By far the biggest negative of the game is the disgusting type of feminism that the game suffers from. When feminism is about strong women I like it (as I said I like Aloy). But the thing that makes me want to throw up is the way men are being pictured in the game. Almost every man in this game is either evil, weak or stupid. Even when the game surprises you with a good man, he starts to apologize to Aloy for stupid reasons, so that you understand he's only good because he's the apologetic ""I'm sorry"" type of man that is being advertised in the modern world! Sometimes this simple factor makes playing the game a torture, and it almost convinced me to give it a negative review. Please guys, stop receiving funds from the groups that do this to your game in exchange for money...

- Other than that, the game is almost perfect. No big complaints, I only liked it more if the gameplay was a bit less focused on Aloy's bow, and other weapons were also useful in different conditions.",1696513273,1697486954,True,4,0,0.520447015762329102,0,True,False,False

This game is near perfect for me. The graphics, character and outfit design, world-building, quests, etc. are all VERY well done. 

I only have a few gripes with this game. First and foremost is that you need save frequently bc this game crashes pretty often. The other is that the controls are a bit clunky sometimes, and it can cause Aloy to miss jumps or run into things when you're trying to evade a machine. 

But my biggest issue, which is honestly infuriating, is the enemy AI. 
You'll hit a machine in one spot, and then run to another spot so you can get a vantage point when they run to your original location, but the AI just, goes to your new location automatically even though it absolutely did not see you move spots. It also has some other strange location issues. One such being if you alert an enemy into search mode from a specific point (even if the enemy can get to that spot no problem) the AI will just go to the middle of its spawn area and wait for you to move to another hiding place before literally bee-lining for you, even though it didn't see you again. 
In other words, the AI sometimes just interacts horribly when you're trying to stealth, which is strange since a massive part of this game is literally stealth hunting.",1694916595,1697430659,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The machine combat mostly works well, the human combat is... unsatisfying. Human enemies are split into 2 types, first type takes 1-2 arrows to defeat and flinches easily. Second type never flinches and will ponderously walk towards you and hit fairly hard. The human boss fights were disappointing and not well fleshed out.

The world is pretty large and broken up by impassable mountain ranges as is standard for open world games. Machines roam a bit in the land and you'll run across other humans on occasion. The exploring side of the game didn't altogether appeal to me after spending many hours going around special spots marked on the map.

For a significant period of time I didn't have much care for the characters, Most of the prologue characters weren't a presence afterwards and for those that were (Teersa, Erend, Olin), I wasn't a fan of those people and couldn't get invested in their stories. However once the main story progresses some way through, my interest was restored and I'll talk about that later.

Now onto the main positives of the games.

Voice acting is excellent in the game, most characters feel appropriately voiced and you can feel it most strongly from the audio recordings later in the game. Some recordings earlier are there merely to showcase the old world that existed before and aren't overly interesting, but later on I couldn't wait to hear these recordings and how the stories of these characters was unfolding.

Finally the story, it starts well enough but goes very flat for many hours (depending on how much time you spend exploring or doing side quests) and I struggled to find motivation for a while to push on with the game. Eventually though when some of the mysteries began to unravel about the world, I became much more invested than before and got back to enjoying the game. The ""lore"" was told extremely well and I could care about what happened to those characters.

Overall I'd recommend the game, if the combat exploration becomes a drag, consider dropping it to story mode and just experience that part.

One aspect of the gameplay that awed me the most was how dangerous enemies were at both minimum and maximum levels. Yeah sure Aloy can tank a lot more damage at higher levels, but a Scrapper will still put you in your place if you don't keep practicing what you have learned.

The only caveat I have is the texture loading and unloading. There was constantly textures popping in and out as I panned the camera. It was annoying and jarring at first, but I got used to it after awhile. It is a well-documented bug that probably isn't getting fixed anytime soon. So, if texturing popping is something you feel will take you out of the world and ruin the experience of HZD, then I advise you to do some background research to see if someone has optimized graphics settings to reduce the popping before considering sending your money to our Steam overlords.",1697249311,1697249311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although the market is saturated with post-apocalyptic video games, Horizon manages to turn such a cliché setting into something innovative. Let's see, the plot is not a literary masterpiece, but it keeps you intrigued. 

The interesting part here is the world, one devastated by wars, and in a desperate attempt to preserve what might remain, they ended up pronouncing the final verdict. Now the planet is inhabited by ""primitive"" tribes, and the wild fauna consists not only of animals but also of machines—those machines left behind in the attempt to safeguard life on the planet. I don't want to reveal much more to avoid spoilers, but in that regard, it's worth it.

The gameplay is typical of open-world settings, featuring a not-so-charismatic but adorable and innocent female protagonist. The controls are agile and swift, providing a dynamic experience. At certain points in the plot, we can even choose between various dialogue options, although they don't carry much weight in the long-term experience.

The combat, which I believe is the most important pillar, is a lot of fun, and if played on higher difficulties, it becomes a fairly intense challenge. In these situations, we'll need to devise strategies and closely study the enemy's movements in detail to overcome them. Not to mention when facing multiple enemies on your own – that's where the real difficulty kicks in.

As for the technical aspect, there are quite a few drawbacks here. While the game looks beautiful and boasts a top-notch artistic direction, especially in enemy designs, the PC optimization is absolutely terrible. In my personal experience, I had to scour the internet for hours to find a way to make the game run decently on a modest system that met the recommended requirements for a smooth 1080p experience. Issues included textures not loading, poor memory optimization, glitches and bugs, crashes, and minor visual anomalies.

But, beyond all the issues, once I managed to get the game running as it should, having tinkered not only with the settings of the software itself but also with the GPU and operating system, it's a more than recommendable experience, just for the setting, the combat, and the overall experience.

Final Thoughts:
Overall, Horizon: Zero Dawn is an incredible Action-RPG (light RPG) that has a very interesting and unique story with incredible graphics. It has very smooth gameplay that allows the player multiple options of how to attach their foes with numerous weapon options. Enemy variety is also impressive as most machine enemies have unique methods to defeat. I also did not experience any bugs on my playthrough, which is a positive. I would give the game a 9.4/10.",1696948849,1696948849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aloy is awesome, the world is beautiful, and the story will entertain you. For those who are not as inclined to enjoying just lore and art, combat and exploration in this game is fun as well, though on the easiest difficulty it might get a bit boring at times as the enemies pose no huge threat.

The Frozen Wilds expansion is also fun and provides nice supporting lore for the main game as well, though the game should maybe make it a tad more obvious that you're probably supposed to visit the addon locations well before finishing the main quest to finish the game bit more smoothly story-wise. As a spoiler: [spoiler]after you finish the Grave-Hoard main quest segment, that spot is a very smooth transition into visiting the expansion world which is literally next to the Grave-Hoard entrance, as long as you've leveled up enough at that point.[/spoiler]

The game is big, but luckily not too big as to become a boring side-quest-grindfest, which is something many other open-world games suffer from.

Next up for me: NG+ on Ultra Hard. You know, to balance out the easy playthrough of Story difficulty and to get my ass handed to me. Aloy and I need to be put in our place this time, after being Matrix Neo -style badasses the first time.

Note: this PC Complete Edition version is the first time I'm playing this game. The PC port worked very well and I did not witness any game breaking bugs.

The gameplay is approachable but challenging. It's open world and kind of a blend between an action game and RPG. There were times I thought I'd never be able to kill these things, and then over time figured out how through strategy, leveling, and skill choices.

There are many stories in this game since it's open world and the side and main quests weave many threads as well as some independent journies. They have some hokey bits but kept surprising me with depth. You're mostly fighting rouge AI machines, with some occasional human battles. The approach they took allows most of your hunting to feel guilt free, since these machines are messing stuff up and shouldn't be here. Kill em! Nice and clean and no misgivings you might get about killing living things. But, as a post-apocalyptic world with lots of lost and untold history, there is no shortage of mystery and nuance in the stories themselves.

The writing and gorgeous setting are really the highlights of this game. I'm glad the developers included ""Story"" difficulty for folks who just want to explore those aspects, making the fights super easy if you prefer. I like the challenge and gameplay enough to keep it on Normal, but having the option is nice.

Takes a little bit until you're given freedom from the story, however once you do it's great to freely explore, lots of quests to keep you busy and being able to do the DLC main quests alongside the plot's main quests gives you more than enough to do.
Completionists will love this game as there's a bunch of collectables throughout the map to keep you busy, but not too much that it becomes unmanagable, on top of that, almost all of the achievements are doable in 1 playthrough, there's just one final achievement that requires you to beat the game in NG+, which shouldn't take too long.
I will say however, I did find myself having to use a few utility mods in order to improve QOL of the game (more inventory and more wildlife spawns). Without these the game is still enjoyable, but if you value your time I recommend using a few of those mods (I tried not to use any that would break the natural progression of the game).",1696777604,1696777604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rock paper scissors style ""can you hurt it?"". Most of the time you can't, You do 16 it has 4000. Not all monsters of the same type attack the same and sometimes you have no defence because of game mechanics so even rock paper scissors is pointless. It is 'weak' to fire and you still do 16 with fire arrows - how is that an advantage.

The game doesn't scale properly, so at your second main set of encounters you find can no longer head shot for the kill and they now parry your attacks - making it a boring grind that burns resources and arrows. Or you have to come back later when you randomly gain skills.

Game mechanics let it down, they go through trees yet you can't, the animation of standing up or the animation of moving from walk to run leaves you vulnerable to combination attacks. Game mechanic of re-crafting arrows mid-fight really isn't helpful with menus and sub menus to do even basic tasks.

And when you die you respawn miles away at the last camp fire like old console games that can't handle quick saves.

The moment you start playing your breath gets taken away by the scenery- the graphics are gorgeous and you can tell there was a lot of thought put into the environment details. Aloy is a very compelling MC and the story itself is well done. My favourite parts of the game are the open world exploration and combat; there's so much attention to detail in the story elements and lore and you can definitely tell when you explore, like when you find a rusted swing set in some ruins. Combat is very well done; it's a really nice change of pace to have a MC whose main weapon is meant to be long distance and not melee, and very satisfying when you target a Watcher from dozens of paces away and hit it square in the eye. However, it's pretty obvious this game was intended for Playstation and not PC from the layout of certain things, like the tools menu. I personally don't really like how the tools menu was done for PC use and it's a bit of a pain. The save mechanisms in game aren't my favourite either- I don't like just being able to save at campfires or major points- but those are really my major complaints at least so far. I had to review this game before I finished though because it's just... brilliant. Everything about it is thoughtfully designed and beautiful, and you'll never want to stop playing.

I didn't have high hopes - just another committee designed safe, balanced and unsurprising game, right? Let's buy it off a sale and regret later. Fortunately, Zero Dawn proved me wrong. Not without flaws, but with several very strong points. The biggest winning points come from a good balance of characters, a sufficiently complex and multi-tiered plot and game play mechanics with just the right balance of complexity and simplicity. The basics could be learned quickly, but mastering them would take time. 

Delving into the main and side plots bit by bit offered a very pleasing, though heavy and dark story line, offered in nice servings. Every time you had a question answered, two better questions came up. The boss fights were good old fashioned boss fights, where the mechanics were the same as before, just with more challenge at once. It felt like all the work you put into practicing paid off. Finishing tough situations felt rewarding, all the way to the end. Yet even after knowing all the tricks, you'd move carefully in the open and choose your fights. Even with a high level, you could get into trouble. This provided good realism.

As a player with somewhat limited hand mobility, I found Zero Dawn to be a bit on the difficult side. A steady hand will take you far, as you can't really hack and slash your way through very well. The variety of difficulty levels does scale nicely, though for some players with certain limitations, even the easier levels will offer unwanted challenges. It's by far not as bad as with several other games, but I would kindly suggest the developers to put some more effort into this. As for accessibility, I will applaud them for a good subtitle system and generally a helpful UI.

The downsides include several graphics glitches that tend to make especially close quarters fighting unnecessarily difficult. Graphics were generally okay, nothing to write home about but nothing to call bad either. Climbing mechanics let me down more than once, from both bugs and just bad design. Pushing left would make Aloy jump right, choosing to drop down carefully made her fall to hear death, and sometimes just finding where to jump to was infuriating. Too often planning had to be replaced with luck. Also, the audio side, dialogue, effects and music were rather lukewarm, not really trying too hard.

[b]In summary[/b] my expectations were very low and my surprise was quite happy. Expect a good amount of time spent, an intriguing plot and mostly well designed game play. 

The DLC wasn't quite as good. It was very heavy on puzzles, which were fun at first, but then they were taken to [b]WAY[/b] excessive amounts of just repeating and increasing the same old trick. It was playable, but clearly made with far less consideration than the main game. As with the main game, the plot and characters were the best parts, but this time game play wasn't as well tuned. The additional weapon options did bring some spice into the main game.",1696717279,1696717279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The voice acting can be inconsistent, wooden at times especially with minor characters, but wanting to know about the central mystery of the game and how it ends is what kept me playing.

The gameplay is alright. Sometimes the combat is really fun, but other times frustrating. I think the worst part about the core game design is its resource management. Gathering materials is very tedious, and having to constantly pause mid-combat to craft ammo totally breaks immersion and excitement. There's a lot of evidence that they want you to approach encounters carefully and with adequate preparation, but didn't completely commit to that. You're left with mid-combat pauses while you menu around and craft ammo because well darn, you ran out while dumping 30 arrows into a robot. You can definitely roleplay or artificially restrict yourself to not doing that, but it pains me to see that they spent all this time assembling the bones of a tight prep-based stealth action predator-style combat system and ultimately didn't stick with it.

I think the open world, though beautiful, doesn't really add much to the experience. I'm extremely tired of open world games and I spent the majority of this game figuring out how to get to the next main quest as quickly as possible. 

The movement in the game feels kind of wooden so I never found the act of just moving through this big-ass world satisfying. You can feel that underneath the pretty animations, you are just moving a 3D coordinate through space in the game engine in a stilted fashion. They just didn't blend it enough to make it feel seamless. I'm not expecting something on the level of MGS V, but when you are spending most of your time wandering around the game world it is hard not to notice. The worst thing that came to mind while playing is that I felt flashes of how it felt controlling a character in WoW. They say this game was instantly dated on release when BotW came out that same week - I think this rings most true when you go from playing a game with that much freedom of movement to this.",1696660167,1696660576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GAMEPLAY
- Smooth as butter
- Everything handles just how you would expect it to
- There is not a ton of grind. most of what you need to gather you can do while you are traveling from one location to another
nothing besides the main quest is ""necessary"" you can focus just on the story and beat the game (I highly recommend exploring around, especially if its blue on the map)
- The amount of things to do is just right.. there isn't a ungodly ton of things to do and not so little it feels empty
- Each enemy is unique and takes a certain approach to defeat with their weak spots
- The story is in depth and enjoyable to follow
CONS
- Side quests are kinda repetitive. Good thing is there is not a unnecessary ton of side quest

If I had to come up with one sentence that would describe Horizon Zero Dawn it propably sound like this:

""If you hadnt tell me the name of the Developer Studio behind, id mistaken it for a standard modern Ubisoft Title with actual good writting.""

Prior to its release on PC HZD was one of Sony PS exclusive titles i didnt care about. Yeah at the time of its initial release it looked beautfull and intersting. But i tied myself to the PC and never had the money to buy a consle and didnt i consider to buy one. I like PC more than Console. But i was suprised to see this game on Steam one day. At the time of my purchase I was in the middle of my Red Dead Redemption 2 Playthrough and I made this kinda promise of not buying another fullpriced triple AAA title before i finished the last purchase. Sounds smart ? Well at this point I was close to 4k games and I tried everything to stop this escalated shopping spree. I beat Red Dead and I planned to start HZD. And i didnt. No real reason, I just did play other stuff. But for a very long i followed this ""rule"" of not buying anything full priced. Eventually i crossed the 4k line and eventually i started this game about a month or more ago after seeing enough videos to remind me what made this game intersting to me. 

So I had two bigger play session one before I left for a two week vacation and one after I got ill with covid a few weeks ago. In my first session I manged to complete the starting area and all its side quest and i got a 100% in the DLC. For the second session i finished what i started and beat it again in ""speedrun"" to get the missing achievements. 

Lets dive in a little deeper. For me its always important to look at the emotional side of my adventure within a game. And I wanna reflect on that. Overall id say that i enjoyed HZD. But there are some things that i dont like. You need to understand that when you look at the reception, most positives Reviews here on Steam, magazine, videos or any other form of media, this game is easily praised as a masterpiece robbed of the title Game of the Year. 

I cant see that. Not gonna lie this game has its moments. But is far from perfect.

Starting of we venture into the world as the outcast or shunned huntress Alloy. Alloy is someone I enjoy venturing on a journey. She has this tough situation that gave her the clarity and wisdom in world full of religion, spiritualism and symbolism. Knowing where she came from made her actions believable in a world where most NPC tagged hers as weird or crazy. In general this game has a good sense for world building and ecspecially its take on things like relegion, spiritualism and symbolsim. I would go so far that the game has prepared some background story that would work as its own game or even as a television series. The world I walked was world that made me wanna listen to what it has seen and its the main reason I continued and finished the game twice.

The best part of the game in general was the narrative. The game has a promising start, settings us up for so many questions and pursuing all those felt awesome. Each discovery had an impact and tieing all things together delievering the final answer was satisfying. This only counts for the main quest of the game.

The side quest where awfull. Awfull in all ways. The game chatagorizes Side Missions as Side Quest and Errands. The difference between both is that Side Quest have a little more step and Errands have about on or two. However the suffer so many problems I started to ignore what was going on with them. You find a character willing to give you a task. You then go and try to fullfill that task. Some start interesting with a stolen ware or a missing person. You find yourself following trails with your device in order to find someone stuck in the middle of knowhere or being ambushed by a bunch of machines. When found or saved they tell you that from now on they will get along alone. Quest over. No conclusion, no talk nor development for all the side characters. And yet thats not all. 
Random folks and espacially side quest givers have recyled faces. Same look, same animations they only changed stuff like hairstyle, beard or clothes. Have you any idea how dump I looked when I saw the death of a character and then had to take a side quest by someone with the same size and face. I felt betrayled. 

Another problems is kinda tied to a world building part. I dont have a problem with the world building choice. Rather with the lack of varation in how its portraied. So the world is centralised arround curtain believes. One is that men are surpirior and that curtain tribes are savages. Our luck Alloy is strong female characters that doesnt hide herself and she is from the so called savage tribe. As you might imagine a lot of conversations start with a disgusting look, some really unpleasant words and the command to go away do what ever women ""should"" do. 

I wanna clarify really quick. I am a white 26 year old boy from germany. I cant relate to the stress and disgrace women or person of colour have to go thru day by day. I wished it be different. So for me this was kinda of hands on experience how annoying it can be being talked down for being from a curtain tribe and curtain genders. Ofcourse this only a reflection of the real world and not be mistaken as full on experience. For this opportunity I am gratefull, however having boring characters all having the same or similiar dialog is more than just unpleasant. A lot of characters had the same personality, the same behavior and spoken line. At the end I could clearly identify those and predict their conversation. I feel that they wasted the potential here and it adds up to having boring side quests and forgetable characters. 

Another problem that kinda speaks against Alloys choice is that in the story she hesitates to help other, because she is so focused to fullfill her quest. But in the side quests she jokes that she does it for everybody. For what reason I had to be accused on listen the monolog of a friend about being selfish, if I accepted a side quest before that asked for a same or similiar thing. Side Quest felt if the where added late into the game and the had no budget to pay the writer.

I wanna briefly talk about gameplay. The game has a simple gameplay loop. It is interesting enough to keep playing but it has clear limations. While the story is well written, the special enemies and ""bosses"" are not. In general you find yourself running into machiens while traversing the map and they use the same machines with one exaptions as boss fights in the story. Sadly with the story we got introduced to three special enemies that are the greatest danger every discovered. However only two make an ""living"" appearance while the third can be seen as dead body. Its sad that we didnt got to fight atleast one. I mean they are scattered arround the world it wouldnt be that difficult storywise to bring back atleast one as the final big threat or boss. 

I still think HZD is a great experience. It feels like the average Ubisoft title with climbing towers to uncover map parts, having terribles side quest and map and world looking shiny with all the hightlighted things you could pick up. Underneath all that there is a great story with atleast a few good characters beside the incredible Alloy. The game has a fair share of moments and I cant wait to play the second part with it rumored to be released at the start of 2024 on PC. 

One last word on the DLC. It kinda can be played at anytime in the story. Canonwise for what i heard it happend before the end of the first game. I did pretty early on and I wanna say its the hardest and toughest part of the game. With me beating it early on I had a great advantage for the rest of the game which lead to fairly easy gameplay. I wont state this as an issues, i did this on purpose. I might recommend for you to do otherwise.",1696608385,1696608385,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Great graphics. Huge world.

Just can't seem to get invested in anything this game offers. Maybe it does get better when you sink in a couple hours more but for me it is pretty clear that it will be more of the same for the next 10-20 hours.

Game still looks nice and I do like the overall design but the world itself seems incredibly inconsistent in every aspect. It's like the devs came up with a basic concept of how this world should look, how the map should be designed overall and how the player should progress but nothing is really fleshed out in any way. It is what it is I guess. It does make sense from the perspective of the protagonist herself and the tribes inhabiting the world because they are unable to make any sense of it, but the player is just thrown into it and most will start to wonder at one point or another. IT IS nice to run around that world but there is just not very much in it to find. Most places seem to be completely overdesigned for that matter, yes, very nice to look at, but you can run through it anyway because there is nothing of interest there.

Starting with the machines: They do look cool and all but they are EVERYWHERE and -surprise- attack any human on sight.  You will have to deal with them all the time and it gets tedious after about half an hour. The further you progress, the harder the machines will hit and soak up more damage. It is fun at first to look at your arsenal and formulate a strategy to take down a couple of them, but as you can imagine this fun does not last long because...that's right, the world is littered with enemies. I think it is part of the main story to find out why they are roaming...well the whole world but I never got that far to find out. Fortunately the game does have difficulty settings to mitigate this nuisance. I remember my last attempt at a playthrough shamefully flicking the switch on ""Story mode"" to just run through the world but just could not do it.

The story itself and RPG elements: Don't know. Never got that far to get really involved with the story. What I've seen was pretty uninvolving to begin with, because most players will have seen a variety of this starting scenario a dozen times already. At some points you get to choose how Aloy should react to someone which seems to be a watered down version (yeah, i know) of the Bioware Renegade/Paragon system. I don't know if there are any consequences whether you answer with violence or compassion, haven't played that long, but I doesn't seem so. It's just what Aloy says at that moment, the outcome seems to be always the same. The perks you can pick up are boring at best, most of them just leave you asking ""Wait, why wouldn't I be able to do that before?"" because it is mostly very basic stuff with very limited use. I guess you forget about most of them after seconds. I did. Kinda hard to imagine that your character trains 10+ years and not having thought of just ramming a big ol' spear down the guts of a machine to take it down.

Sidequests: All I have seen some kind of fetchquest or ""rescue"", sometimes just kill X. Can't remember any rewards to speak of, not even any meaningful conversation or getting any insights. Anything. It's just more stuff to do and often it seems like more fun to collect whatever collectibles are closest than fighting another dozen machines.

Controls: Clunky at best. Using an X-Box-controller they were intuitive enough but everything seems...off except for running straight forward. Especially the climbing parts seem implemented as an afterthought. The climbing itself is holding a button most times but be aware once you reach your destination. Can't tell how many times I fell off a ledge because everything is so darn imprecise. Only a fallen tree with yellow ropes indicating the only way to progress in front of you? AND THERE GOES ALOY FALLING TO A MISERABLE DEATH ONCE AGAIN. Haven't played an Assassin's Creed for ages, but wouldn't have had any problems doing that with Ezio or Edward. It has been done better so many times. Just infuriating.

The gameplay loop gets pretty boring for me in no time. I can't see how after leaving the tutorial-area this will change dramatically. This is all you do for the next hours, you have seen it all already. It is probably enough to keep some gamers entertained well enough, but it is just not for me. It reminds me of Dragon Age Inquisition where they literally threw a dozen versions of collectible stuff into the world with zero relevance to the plot just to pad out the game and that kind of seems to be the whole game in HZD.

Despite how generic the open world may feel, this game shines through its visual presentation and setting. The odd mixture of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic themes alongside Nordic tribes and beliefs shouldn't work on paper, and yet here we are. As humanity got pulled into their own demise by their own acts, it shines on through getting by using what brought them here in the first place.

While combat can be frustrating at times, nailing strong enemies and bosses down feel very rewarding. Although you may think those are just beasts that happen to look mechanical, they still bring their own spin to combats with their own weaknesses and strengths alongside specific attacks. Much like humanity in this game's lore, you will have to improvise, adapt, and overcome. While I pretty much have a pea brain when it comes to planning my gear ahead of combat, I know there is an incredible depth to it although it feels overwhelming at times. Combined to a very smooth movement system, this game handles like a charm nonetheless despite having a fairly clunky melee combat.

Where the game truly shines though is in its narrative. While it takes a while for the game to truly open up, it becomes utterly beautiful once it does. Every step that I took made me yearn for more about humanity's past and present. What are those mechanical beasts? Why are they? What is this ""All mother"" my tribe keeps talking about? What's behind that steel door? How did humanity bring itself to the brink of extinction and why? Who are all these people? This is something you are immediately introduced to during the game's introduction, and in hindsight it probably was the best way to do so. As you step into the unknown, the game sets you straight with the mysterious passing of an entire crew underground. From this moment on, you know something isn't right.
This whole feeling is conveyed perfectly well with the game's environmental design as mother nature took over what mankind left behind. As amusing as being referred to ""The old ones"" is, this adds so much character to the present events and furthers the mystery behind humanity's past. As the people fall clueless of what lied before them, we find familiar places in an otherwise inhospitable world.

It is with joy that I brought this game and its DLC to 100% completion. It isn't without its flaws, such as the rather generic open world setting. But the story behind it, the world design, intricate combat, incredible post-apocalyptic setting, and sense of mystery, made it an unforgettable experience.

Playing the game on the PS4 for the first time was rough to say the least. Enter, HZD PC edition: Wider FOV (up to 120) Better visuals, access to quality of life mods and the option to use KBM make this the definitive way to play the game.

At it's core Horizon is focused on telling a story of discovery, The world has fallen, but has been remade by machines? Answering these questions whilst engaging in some very unique and at times challenging combat, made the game quite the experience to play for the first time. If you like a good story and a lore rich world, Horizon will give you just that, while also pleasing players who are perhaps less interested in the plot and more so in the gameplay.

After playing the game multiple times and finally experiencing the Frozen Wilds DLC, which felt like a tease for whats to come in future tittles. I give Horizon 7/10.

I'd love to moan and groan about all the different ways this game sucks ass, but when it comes down to it the game just falls short in a lot of ways that could've set it apart from literally any other open-world RPG. As it is, there are too many comparisons to make to games that have done this formula so much better.

To concentrate it down, there are a lot of uninteresting mechanics in this game, combat encounters are slow and grindy and resource intensive, meaning you'll have to grind more and more the higher your difficulty is to get the materials you need to grind out more difficult encounters to get the materials you need to grind out more difficult encounters to get... And on and on.

I turned it down to Easy just a little bit into the game, and then to Story, and I really think the beginning of the game is just horrible. Once you start getting the tools required to take down enemies, turning up the difficulty makes sense as you are actually equipped to take on a challenge, but the first couple hours of this game are easily 2/10 territory, the rest of this game is just kinda meh, even when you take the difficulty up to normal or hard. Really wish they had done more to make every enemy more than just an arrow sponge if you aren't hitting the specific weak points. There is absolutely no depth to encounters outside of ""hit the glowy spots until it dies, and dodge"" and that's a big ass letdown tbh. Every encounter is so 2-dimensional since you have to do the exact same thing for every enemy, as they all have the exact same weak points, and you somehow deal even less than negligible damage doing anything else.

I see professional speedrunners and long-time players getting shit on all the time because the combat is brutal no matter what, and I also see the average players on reddit and in forums resorting to exploits in quite a few areas because way too much of the game is just bullshit. Manufactured difficulty to pad out the playtime. If the game were truly fun and you weren't just banking on gamers™ continuing out of spite, you wouldn't have to stretch out the few encounters and quests the game actually has by ramping up the health slider on every enemy until the game is just barely fun enough to play... And why does every enemy respawn the instant you turn a corner?

PS I absolutely skipped the shit out of every single cutscene and dialogue in the game, I don't have time or patience for that boring BS. Really thankful you can skip them though, for sure. Some you can't for some reason, but by and large they are all ignorable. i'd also recommend turning off the music and dialogue audio sliders right when you boot the game up.

PPS This port is horrible, crashes, frame issues, model issues, everything clipping constantly, and the controls would work a lot better on controller but I can't give up aiming on a mouse to sit back and rely on auto-aim these days.",1633241197,1696099421,False,4,0,0.434913218021392822,0,True,False,False

I'm not a hardcore gamer, I played some GTA, Max Payne and Tomb Raider years ago but since I got the Steam Deck I mostly play chill games and walking simulators in various forms. BUT I loved this game immediately after booting it.

Pros:
- Beautiful graphics on the SD even in recommended settings (medium)
- EXTREMELY well-written story (could literally be a Sci-Fi book I wouldn't mind) For the first time in a game I listened and read every piece of information to understand the story.
- Amazing post-apo universe and art
- Attaching main character (Aloy <3 )
- Good mix of combats, stealth and exploration 
- Great cinematics and voice acting
- Well-managed difficulty in normal mode, you never really feel that you're blocked.
- Every quest is interesting and brings something to the big picture, you see the efforts of the writers here also.
- The included DLC is great (but harder)

Cons:
- you'll make nightmares about dinosaurs machines :)
- You'll get a sleep deficit anyway

I could say it's a mix of Zelda BOTW, AC and Tomb Raider. But it's so much more.

Both games I felt could have been better in different ways.  But Horizon Zero Dawn?  As soon as I started, I realized It was perfect - the world, the game-play, the characters.... All of it

It's an awesome, beautiful, and empowering game.   I got it initially because I saw some concept art for it and I feel like this game lives up to it's concepts.  There is a huge diversity of characters and the combat, stealth, Role-play, dialogue are all perfect.  Even though I have open world fatigue, I don't feel that way wit Horizon Zero Dawn; Thus I say is an awesome game for everyone especially those who love beautiful environments, a rich and engaging combat system, A ton of cool lore, and an epic story which is a blend of Sci-fi and Fantasy!",1695842494,1695842844,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The first and most important aspect worth praising are the graphics which are absolutely superb, one of the best graphics in a video game to this day and it's not debatable. Just look it up on the Internet- absolutely breathtaking in all aspects.
The story is certainly immersive, atmospheric and original- same goes to the created world- for this alone the game is worth giving a thought. However, most side missions are at best okay.
The main character is fine but I found her rather bland and apathetic in some missions but the main ones in which she suddenly gained a lot of character. Not sure why it is like that but it's not a deal breaker in most situations.
The combat is really fluid, dynamic and feels just great. There is a vast variety of weapons, tools, traps that may or may not help you deal with similarly varied enemies. You can exploit their weak spots and learn their feats so that you can optimize your plan how to approach them.
There is some looting and truly nice gear options to look for. 
The soundtrack of this game is certainly a pleasure for ears, undoubtedly.

I played the game on Ultra Hard from the start, so my gameplay was slow and painful but it didn't really bothered me. I liked the challenge.

But discovery part of the game was just meh for me. Random texts scattered around the map, most of them just random people talking about their daily lifes or commercials that centuries old. It's not interesting.

What Aloy wears not interesting or game changing. Weapons Aloy use are not interesting. There are a lot of different arrow types. But you will always use the most strongest ones. Because that means easy kill. And good upgrades open later in the game (mostly DLC) so there is nothing to looking out for when it comes to loot.

After completing any quest, game gives you weapon mods as a reward. Just random weapon mods that you can find from any other enemy. So you only complete the side quest for the immersion and most of the time there is nothing to do out there in the world, except for killing machines.

Story of Aloy is interesting at the begining for a short couple of minutes, but game doesn't make anything with it. She is an out cast for her whole life and after a short sequence of events she is the seeker of the whole tribe in a few days. That's just a weak writing there. 

What really interesting is what really happend to the world itself. And Aloy is the key. And the key opens the door that led to an unsatisfiying answer. At least for me. 

Maybe Forbidden West is a better game when it comes to the story. I don't know. If it comes to Steam, I would like to play it.

Other than everything up there, game looks great, sounds great, combat is good and fun.

Widać to w konstrukcji świat gry (otwartego, ale na tyle ograniczonego, że jego wielkość nie rozprasza uwagi), mechanice eksploracji i walki, a na interesującej i oryginalnej historii kończąc. Długość wątku głównego (podstawki i dodatku) oraz ilość zadań pobocznych starczają na długie godziny zabawy. Stopień trudności możliwy jest do dostosowania, więc to przyjazna produkcja także dla osób, nie będących na co dzień z grami akcji. Oprawa audio-wizualna (będąca na najwyższym poziomie, nawet po tych kilku już latach od premiery) swoim bogactwem dopełnia pozostałe elementy gry. Nawet bezcelowa wycieczka przez las potrafi dostarczyć pozytywnych wrażeń. Zwłaszcza nocą w okolicach Meridian. W kontekście grafiki, bardzo miłym dodatkiem jest możliwość ukrycia prawie wszystkich elementów interfejsu z poziomu aplikacji, bez konieczności korzystania z mod-ów. Nie dość, że zwiększa to poziom trudności (i satysfakcję płynącą z walki) to jeszcze pozwala na głębszą immersję.

The map looks and feels stunning with it being the perfect size for a story game. I reckon you can go from one edge of the map to the other in max 10 to 15 minutes. 

-At first I didn't like Horizon Zero Dawn at A L L because some of the game features gave me a bad first impression. I dropped and picked right back up the game and ever since then it really grew on me. Went from annoyingly thinking I have to force myself to finish the game to exploring every location, completing every quest, attaining every achievement. I feel like this is what people meant when they called Days Gone bad for its start and I was atleast partly to blame for it in this case.

-At times the mount would get really janky, also the occasional stutters that will happen right before entering the biggest settlement (PC-port maybe bad? besides that the game ran a smooth 60fps even in the biggest of fights. Eats/R-word's your CPU tho, viewer beware!). I somehow didn't realize that there is a whole crafting mechanic in besides all the other menus that I was using. One thing that is a bit odd is that there are in-game lootboxes built into the core of the game so when you complete a quest for example. You go to your inventory go under a specific tab and there you have your openable lootboxes that give you materials or whatever. While looting you can find materials or yet again lootboxes, come to think of it, every big drop not from a dead enemy is in the form of a given lootbox, a bit strange in my opinion but doesn't ruin the game since there luckily aren't any microtransactions :D Stealth is a mixed bag, It's a good opener to a fight is what I'm going to say.

-Although even if your mount isn't like the Skyrim horse your character sure is. When there aren't any put in place parkour places to grab onto you cannot use parkour animations but you can stand & jump endlessly on every slight edge of a mountain or building for example. Even though you're not technically parkouring when you end up reaching your destination it can feel much more satisfying to do so. The mount on the other hand can go off course with automatically reaching the destination or require much patience if you're on any rocky path or steep incline, when so it will reduce the speed to a crawl basically and do the jumping animation, can be troublesome when other machines are aggroed and out for blood lol.
 
-I really liked the mysterious, simple premise of the story and the looming atmosphere. The ""Frozen Wilds"" story DLC was just stunningly gorgeous, reminding me the views of Skyrim. Got a couple nice pics in photo mode, all in or near the new DLC-area. It was very saddening to complete everything and having to put down the game because there wasn't any content left to play. Only wish the face paints and focus variants came before completing new game+ :D they just fit so perfectly when accessorizing. Cannot wait until Horizon Forbidden West comes to the master race. 8/10

I'll keep it simple.

Played in 2022 on modern PC operating smoothly/constant high fps, at max settings.

Tweaks:
I think I used a reshade setup to make it more to my taste on a calibrated monitor and PC capable of enhancing the already beautiful game (better AA for example).

I *may* have altered the Field of View (FOV) to reduce motion sickness... can't recall sorry. If I did it was ingame or via ini file adjustment. I do it for most FP or 3rd person games that are too narrow a view.

My play style:
I may play for long sessions on a game of some hours if I'm really into it - but I'm not into ""Day 1 rushed the main story to be done so I can tout about it and whinge about lack of end game content""

I like to explore and adventure doing all of the side quests along the way. A not hardcore completionist :).

HZD offered many hours of play. 118 hrs is me doing one play through with the DLC.

Immersion: 
This is the best story based campaign and open world adventure game I have played. 
I finished every nook and cranny and wanted more. 

The game has astounding, beautiful vistas and a genuinely captivating story that makes you think about our world today as it is. A few times I just hustled to climb to the highest point or best view because it really stimulates the imagination and brings you into the world. There is a sense of real scale here that works with the story. 

Reading/listening to the historic recordings you find builds the story - it's not all nonsense and fleshes out the quest lines. Not essential yet again, builds immersion and losing yourself in the story.

I never felt frustrated with the controls using KB and mouse. The port is well done and doesn't pull me out of the gameplay.

Progression:
I needed to develop skills in order to kill beasts and I could use different methods - required different methods yet it never felt like classic rock/paper scissors. The terrain and what you were up to matters. 

I had to grow, sneak and plan quite often instead of relying on weapon power. I sometimes went where I was not powerful enough to be safe and had to rely on stealth. This is the true value of a world that doesn't normalise itself to your level (eg like Diablo IV). That's bland. This has scale and earning more power feels more powerful. 

The world is genuinely enormous. It's genuinely full of animal life and I spent a lot of time hunting between point A and Point B so I could have the resources to enhance my gear. Bring up the map to see the available encounters and you think ""Holy SH#$""... because it's so many!

Games I rate this with:
Fallout 4, The Witcher 3 are two games I put this on a pedestal with. Each had similar depth of story, crafting, some puzzles, combat and flavourful NPC connections. HZD has no base building though.

Star Wars The Old Republic (ok that's an MMO but still big story based focus), Jedi outcast/survivor, are also story based games I really liked that were not as open world but offered similar experience of adventure and ""feel"". 


I rate the game a full 10/10.

It's a good game with a good story and well written characters. I feel the weakest part is the itemization. They should have taken an ARPG approach instead of making very few weapons that you just buy in the shop, with bland mods that just increase percentages.

- A lot of fixed scripts and little freedom. 
- The world is not really open, at least in the beginning.
- No character stats.
- No first person view.
- No manual quick save at any time - only in specific places. 
- For fast travel you need to find special disposable travel packs, which are one time use.
+ The graphics is nice thou, and the battle system is better than in Witcher) at least it allows ranged and stealth features, not only melee hack and slash.

UPD @106h:
Have finished the game (main story) plus played further. Some more personal imho:
+ for fast travel you can buy some sort of ""fast travel device"" later in Meridian, and can can fast travel infinitely;
- dialogues are meaningless, they have absolutely no impact on quests. You can not even decline quest, no such option in dialogues with any NPC ever; 
- the game play is harder than in other popular games like e.g. Cyberpunk, FO4/76, Witcher etc. Seems there is no robots auto-leveling which is rather good, but it also means at the beginning you could be getting killed a lot. And remember, there no quicksave at any time. So if you fought boss for 10 mins and died, please start all over again from beginning. Only around lvl. 40 I felt a little bit of confidence;
+ a lot of herbals and animals, at least you can collect some basic healing and other potions, no limits;
- the game scripts are rather sneaky, they often bring you 'surprises' when you don't expect it :)  you should never relax and wait for 'ambush'.

The developer only determines certain ledges and ridges which was very infuriating especially with the vast terrain. 

Now onto the pros, combat was more strategic than head-on which was sooo satisfying - especially when Aloy was facing predator-like machines. A hunter at heart, a marksman at bay.

The normal mode is quite challenging and seems a lot harder than normal mode is for most games and if you try easy thinking it will be more like normal, it's not. Easy is too easy for me.
I did not have any crashing, though I did experience really bad lag  at some Cauldrons. But the rest of the game is fine.

The Keyboard mount controls are terrible, left shift to move forwards to sprint faster and left control to slow down and stop. I would prefer if the mounts had usual movement controls like how they are in Skyrim.
 I don't like riding them at all. Besides it's very limited as you can only ride 3 the Strider horse like, charger horse/ram like and broadhead bull like. It would of been more fun and interesting to ride sawtooths.

Facial expressions and movements can look really strange at times with weird looking eye movement and  rapid blinking. A NPC moved her face left and right jerkily kind of  robotically in conversation with her, it happens with others as well.
And an NPC was talking about something tragic but also smiling at the same time, seemed out of place and the wrong emotion to convey. Also lip syncing is not very good at times.

I find the combat, hunting and destroying machines the most fun part of the game.
Even so I felt there was too many machines around, I was fighting so many along the way that I ended up over levelled at lvl 40 and was only up to a lvl 15 main mission. As I got towards the end I just ended up feeling sick of fighting endless machines everywhere so just ended up choosing story difficulty so I could get rid of them quickly.
Hitboxes can be really off, arrows often don't hit where you were aiming for. I tried for both auto aim and with it off.
And often after using a critical hit on a downed machine I can't immediately use any other attack and she just stands there a bit and I can't attack again until the machine stands back up if the critical attack isn't enough to fully kill it. It's annoying.

I loved the story even though it was predictable. But the way the story is told I did not find it immersive. Any dialogue choices you make don't seem to affect anything. You're just following the story, there are no branching paths or any decisions to make, you don't help make or shape the story or outcome as there is only one ending. It feels like I am watching a movie, it does not feel like Iam a part of the game world as it's not immersive or deep.
Interacting with characters is not interesting they seem as robotic as the machines.
Only a few characters were memorable, the majority are very forgettable.
A few things did emotionally affect me though.

Underneath the pretty graphics and fun combat it's just a standard open world game that doesn't break the mould. Simular to the formula Ubisoft uses with a lot to do that is enjoyable and fun to play but lacking any depth.
I'd rate it 7/10 it's an enjoyable game to play through, I just feel it has some missed potential to be epic.",1695382556,1695382556,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Nice story, at least the bits I've paid attention to
- Graphics are decent, despite being a port of a game that's a few years old
- Dodge/roll mechanic is easy to pull off, especially after playing Elden Ring

Cons:
- Save files can get out of order and it can feel like your progress was lost
- The merchants are pretty similar
- I wish the game would auto save when I modify a weapon/armor

Overall I really enjoy the combat. There's a cycle of dodging, aiming with arrows, enabling slow motion mode, repeat. Being able to craft ammo mid-combat is pretty nice especially with boss battles.",1694130512,1695355325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dialogs: stupid and cringe-worthy
World: empty
Combat: primitive
AI: dumb
Crafting and inventory system: too simplified
Graphics: well, it'll do. Level of 2014-2015

I agree to those who were surprised by the fact that people bought consoles to play the game. As for me - i had flashbacks of the dark era of gaming (2007-2012), when games were made at once for PC and 7th generation consoles (PS3 and X360) and mostly sucked. I don't want to go any further. Money wasted, sadly.

Солидарен с теми, кого удивил тот факт, что люди покупали консоль ради такой игры.

They need to be a threat. You need to be a weak little maggot at the foot of these behemoths, so that when you actually take them down, it felt like you did something. Because that’s where the game shines: fighting the robot dinosaurs in these ridiculously gorgeous environments – because it really doesn’t have much else going on. The YA style story telling is just embarrassing, the characters and their millennial attitudes are less interesting than watching paint dry, and as soon as the game tries to do anything even remotely interesting in terms of world building, it rushes through it, moving on to something else – so why even bother? Just shut up and let me fight mecha dinosaurs.

This was the BEST game I have ever played in my life so far. To put it in perspective, I hold fond memories of Final Fantasy 7, 8 and 9 that I played more than 25 years ago! Yet this game surpassed even my FF series experience. It's a masterpiece with exceptional graphics, good music and sound effects, enthralling narrative, and great character control.

I really love the fighting system of this game. There are many types of weapon to choose from for your own fighting style: hand-to-hand combat, stealthy approach,  attacking enemies from a distance (which I frequently did ;), etc.

I have played tons of these kind of games, and while I know many people hate them and have become tired of devs just pushing the same game over and over, I like them, I love the thrill of exploration and the necessity to find the last little collectible on a huge map, so this review is a bit biased.

However, HZD is not like Assassin's Creed, having played every single one of those, I though it was just Assasin's Creed Playstation Edition, but let me tell you, it isn't. Yes, it has several mechanics and ideas from that kind of game, and while it isn't as great as RDRII or Witcher III, it is almost there. Most Open World games have an immense map that looks overwhelming and ends up being a big empty space where you're just gonna travel through or admire the landscape, and yes, Horizon is a graphical marvel deserving of it's praise, but there's stuff to do too! The world feels alive and thriving and gives you the opportunity to get into some cool machine hunting with tons of different weapons, including RPG elements like elemental weak points, it's great!

The lore and story is intriguing too, and I was on the edge of my seat searching for clues and audio files to understand, what happened? The ending answered most, if not all of my questions, and while it leaves an open ending I don't really need another game, the story feels complete, unlike Days Gone for example. 

Now, the game looks incredible and breathtaking, is full of beautiful landscapes and diverse biomes, but it all comes for a cost, it needs a powerful machine, I played on medium-high settings and was a fluid 60 fps experience still looking good, but it is indeed a very demanding game, there are a few bugs here and there like with some achievements not unlocking unless you start a new playthrough, but the one bug that really bothered me was the audio issue, if I understand correctly is an issue with the compression and mix, the only way I managed to solve it was using external speakers or headphones, so beware.

A fantastic game all around, the exploration is fun, the combat is amazing, and the story is top tier.  Horizon has solidified itself as one of my favorite series.

Now to go more in depth, Horizon Zero Dawn is one of my favorite games ever.  The story blew me away the first time I played through it.  I went in completely blind thinking that it was just a game about primitive people fighting robot creatures, but slowly learning what was actually going on is an experience that no other game has given me.  A big factor in the buildup of the story is the characters though.  Every character in Horizon feels important, even the small side ones and random NPCs living in settlements.  All the important characters are acted out and voiced incredibly and they really elevate the experience.

The combat is also very fun with a lot of variety.  The standard bow feels strong to shoot, ropecasters allow you to set up cool traps, slings are just fun to use, and there are even more to choose from.  The melee attacks are the only weak point here, but that option is still there although a little bare-bones.  The robots are also varied and interesting.  There are some that fly, there are robot bears, there's even a T-rex robot.  It's all so cool, and each one offers their own challenge and different ways to approach fighting.

The world is probably my favorite part of Horizon Zero Dawn though.  The map is filled with details like real-world places and beautiful scenery.  There are snowy mountains, arid deserts, and jungles full of terrifying machines.  The people living in the world are what complete it though.  People are fighting to survive in a post-apocalyptic world and each one is unique.  Everyone has their role and place and it really makes Horizon's world feel special.

Apart from that, the joint-physics of machines is best and glitch-free.

Overall its 9.5/10 tho there can be many improvements with animations, player control & more dynamic shooting but still this game is a wholesome package.

love the game, story was fantastic and map design all throughout. haven't played a game that made me cry a bit on some cut-scenes. the lore is great. got 99% on both main and dlc. idk what else i was missing besides tutorial missions.
ride-able mount movement was lacking since it only went full speed on a road and movement on it felt a little clunky. same with the climbing at times. you'd have to be in the middle to climb up, because if you were on the side/edge, it wouldn't let you climb up for some reason. 

ultra hard wasn't that hard... maybe if i did fights and not run past everything that i could then it would've felt hard.

Movement is floaty and ""parkour"" to climb is just ""hold w to proceed"". Most of the game you spend walking or in cinematics. 
Combat is clunky and often locks you into place, like you down a machine and then if you go for a critical hit it will lock you into an animation for 2seconds. Constantly having to craft ammunition is a mechanic introduced to waste your time since you always have the resources(maybe different on harder difficulty). Fighting machines is always rock paper scissors, did you bring the right weapon with right ammunition? Rather than some level of skill. Part of it is due to the floaty animations that plague every single movement or attack or step or jump or anything you do.

I enjoyed the game because there's a lot to do and so much to discover and uncover, BUT the highlight of the game is the ""machines"" and that is what made me lean towards the screen the first time I saw the game in 2017.
The story is really well-written and makes well-logical sense. You might question how an ecosystem co-exists with the machines and how they are made and what their purpose is, but having completed the game answered my questions. Campaign has a good amount of hours, and having done a lot of side quests made me play to a 60 hours time which is a lot considering a semi-RPG game and I'm still not character level 60 (I'm 57).
I think the game could've been much better and be a GOTY(2017) if it had a nice and distinguished soundtracks appropriate to the era. Additionally, the boss fights didn't feel like big and important and different than the normal brawls with thugs and bandits. The DLC "" The Frozen Wilds"" is equally enjoyable and persistent to a well-written story and worth playing for the sake of calling to be DLC.
I confidently recommend this game to anyone who is hesitant to buy the game. The developers are great to have been squashing the bugs and optimising the game. And lastly, rockbreakers are d!cks.",1603312833,1694846945,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

This is one of too tough for steam deck games. This will drain 1% battery per a minute even with lowest graphic setting. (FSR won't help.)

There's a moment that you can override machines. But the people around won't be surprised by it. The humans have been treated all machines as predators but once they saw it's tame-able, they are like ""Oh yeah. That happens.""
🤔

Overall game play is... ordinary. I don't think I can pin point the good ones but the opposite.

- Open world
The world is filled with resources. You won't run out of them. Then why do I need to do collect them?
Side missions are like... Let's say they treat me as a maid. (What is this, Bioshock?)
You have to prepare long hiking between each missions. Good luck.

- Combat
I laughed so hard every time I can do jump strike by standing 1 inch higher than the target.
You can wipe everything by doing this.

- Stealth
You are busted. Get out of the bush, then go back into the same bush.
They lost you.

- Climb
Seems like highly inspired by uncharted but not good as it.
To jump over the short gap, player decided to grab the ledge instead. I'm pretty sure that's more dangerous than step on the platform safely.

- Dialogue selection
There's no change story branch. Just pick the fastest one. Others aren't worth your time.

- Boss fight
If someone ask ""What was the best boss of this game?"", I don't think I can answer. You fought the final boss in the quite early game and you will against the same boss multiple times.

[b]Pros:[/b]
 1. Amazing environmental art
 2. Amazing character art
      - Really good facial animations. Not Call of Duty cutscene level, but close
      - Really fluid character movement while traversing the world 
 3. Great world building
      - Cognitive cohesion between characters aim and players actions
      - Motivating to explore the world
      - Likable characters that you feel invested in
      - Gripping storyline
      - Collecting story bits in audio or text format feels natural and entertaining
 4. Great, fitting soundtrack, but not really memorable like TLOU or Mirror's Edge
 5. Great fighting mechanics against robots. 
      - Involves using variety of tools and ammo types, it feels satisfying to see a robot and instinctively use ammo that hurts it the most. 
      - Game paces enemy strength quite well. Even maxed out player will find a challenge in the end game, however it depends on the skill and/or amount of cheese used.
 6. DLC is more of the same goodness, but harder. Builds upon existing narrative. Was definitely planned together with the main game. There is a character voiced by female V voice actor. ;D

[b]Cons:[/b]
 1. Torturing vacuuming simulator. Welcome to the ""Connect the dots"" game. Unless you are playing on easy difficulty, you [i]will[/i] be walking from red plant to red plant while traversing the world, as its the most cost effective way of getting healing items.
 2. Fighting against human enemies is underwhelming. Feels like they were the last thing developed compared to marvelous fighting you get with robots. It is great that it's not the focus of the game.
 3. Minor visual glitches. Mostly a black skybox during sunrise.

[b]Other Notes:[/b]
Well optimized game. Runs well, didn't crash, has solid autosave. I recommend maxing out the graphics as it's a marvel at every corner, and AI upscaling is worth using.
Worth its asking money, but is often on discount as well. A must play IMO.
Time needed to 100% the game: ~100 hours.
Time to complete only main quests on NG+: ~5 hours.",1694638926,1694638926,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But then, Horizon Zero Dawn strolled into my life, and let me tell you, it's like that feeling when you first bit into a perfect burger – mind-blowing.

Gameplay & World Building: 5/5

You know that parkour thing we love in Assassin's Creed? Well, Horizon Zero Dawn takes it and dials it up to eleven. Aloy's moves are smooth as butter, and I swear, I'd choose her over any Assassin for a rooftop race any day. The best part? Mission objectives are so darn clear. No more wandering aimlessly in an open world. This game holds your hand just enough, so you're never lost but free enough to explore.

But hold on to your gamepads because the real treasure here is the story. It's like Witcher 3, but on some next-level complexity. Aloy's journey, folks, is something else. It's not just a hero's tale; it's a quest to uncover the truth about the Faro plague that rocked her world. Every character, every choice, every twist, it all adds up to a narrative masterpiece. You'll question your every decision, and you'll love every moment of it.

Performance: 3/5

Now, here's the kicker. If your gaming rig is anything like mine – an i5 and a GTX 1050 Ti – get ready to play this beauty on the lowest settings to maintain that smooth 50 FPS. Yeah, it's a hardware hog, no two ways about it. But let me tell you, I gladly sacrificed some graphics for the storytelling feast this game serves.

Conclusion

In the end, Horizon Zero Dawn is not just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster. It knocked Witcher 3 off its pedestal in my book, and that's saying something. This game's got parkour to die for, mission clarity that's a godsend, and a story that'll make you question your own existence.

It's all about finding the truth – about the Faro plague, about Aloy's true self, and about your own gaming heart. Even with its hardware demands, it's worth every pixel. Horizon Zero Dawn isn't just a game; it's an unforgettable journey into the depths of storytelling and self-discovery. So, grab your bow, jump into Aloy's world, and prepare to be amazed.",1694632972,1694632972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is super enjoyable and the characters are interesting. Definitely enjoying my trek to full achievements with this one! Combat can get a little stale, but there are so many options for combat that if you switch it up occasionally from whatever your main four weapons are, it should keep things a bit fresher.

Positives: the main char is atleast bearable & has some personality  in Zero Dawn to make it somewhat interesting.
the premise is definitely interesting but squandered whatever potential it had in the sequel.
on Combat , yea its fun there is really nothing beyond that sets this apart from other Games in the Monster-Hunting Genre.

Cons: if u can even call this a game instead of knock-off version of Monster Hunter with a Bare-bones generic as heck Sci-fi story and this is a review after playing FW since this is continuing game if u want play this for the story , go watch video on Youtube since they drop the ball heavily on Forbidden West so not really worth the price even on a sale cause doesn't have the same narrative ground to stand in the sequel if u are the person who gets invested in the narrative after playing Zero Dawn.

so as a solo game it is pretty serviceable if u are ok with a single ending and it has 0 replay value since story has a fixed ending and doesn't really warranty second play-through other than for Trophies.

The skill progression system and typed-enemy preparation mechanics combined with stealth remind me a lot of the Shadow of Mordor/War games, and the crafting system is integrated without being clunky. The world is very big but far from empty, resources are abundant without feeling cluttered, and the machines are always around to either fight or be carefully avoided. The weapon options, once fully unlocked/upgraded, give the player about a dozen ways to approach any fight or hunt, further augmented by unlocking the diverse skill perks. Lob AOE bombs from a distance, snipe weak points, trigger elemental explosions, distract, disarm, sneak up and stab them with your spear, turn wild machines into allies to fight beside you, or pepper them with two-foot-long stakes from an impossible thing called the rattler, all of these are viable play styles.

I'm 40+ hours in, and I've been grinding pretty hard because the hunting is so fun, so according to the game I'm at 50% completion. This with having uncovered the whole map, unlocked all top-tier weapons and gear, and encountered all enemies but specials/plot enemies. So believe me when I say I'm enjoying this game. But the character interactions are mediocre at best. Acknowledging that this game is 6 years old at the time of this review, HZD was clearly pushing up against the boundaries of the tech of its day. With everything else the game does so well, I can't be too hard on it for having a couple flawed facets. The writing is stilted, the voice acting is inconsistent, the body animations are random, and the facial animation is . . . so close to being good it makes me that much more frustrated with it. They clearly spent more time on the protagonist, so I end up hating her animations less, and that's good. The story is intriguing, and now that I'm thoroughly over leveled I'm going to rip through and see what it's about.

I got this game on sale, and if the story ends up disappointing I still would say I definitely got my money's worth. Open world action/exploration game, Monster Hunter meets Shadow of Mordor with a techno-viking crunch. 3/5",1694490894,1694553404,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun, engaging, game play. Plays OK on steam deck. 
Once you get past the intro video. (Crashed twice before I could)
After the intro you can lower your settings for more stable gameplay on the deck.
After that. Still had to give the deck a break about every hour.
Or it overheats and crashes.
My only complaint. Was WAY, WAY, to easy. Only ever died to falling. Never to an enemy. 
Never used mounts, potions, or traps. 
Was too easy without them.

Overall solid game but it has minor flaws such as hitboxes of ennemies, especially humans one.

The protagonist goes from a nobody to a ruthless but yet compassionate warrior as she takes the world of chaos head on and survives against all odds. Among the games I have played, I was pretty invested in Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider series as a victim turned badass survivor and still like her but Alloy is easily one of the best female character in the universe of survivors bringing everyone together and saving the world.

The mechanics, mods and weapon system in the game is also interesting. You can modify the weapons to get a maximum damage or corrupt the machines and watch the chaos from afar and the damage you can conjure after the new game plus extra slots and collected mods is insane which practically makes you a god. 

And for the open world, it's one of the best I've ever seen both aesthetically and in size specially with the Frozen Wild DLC. I haven't seen an open world this beautiful following Day's gone.

My original review was at launch and extremely negative because the game was just huge broken terrible mess. Fast forward ~2years later and I give it another try and it's better now, it still has some problems but it's nothing compared to the mess it was.
When it comes to the game it's good but it's nothing special. It's a reskined Far Cry Primal with 3rd person camera and female protagonist with added witcher tracking and witcher sense( aka focus). Don't get me wrong this is a good thing but this is what the game is.

[b]If you think 1-2-3patches will fix this think again, this is so broken it's ganna take at least 1-2 months....
When it's fixed i'll gladly go back to it but right now evade it at any cost. [/b]

Cons:
1. Initial Learning Curve: The game's complex mechanics may take some time to grasp, especially for players new to the title, which could potentially lead to a steep learning curve.
2. Limited Character Customization: While Aloy is a well-defined character, some players might have appreciated more options for personalizing her appearance and playstyle.
3. Occasional Technical Hiccups: Despite the generally smooth performance, some players may encounter minor technical issues such as occasional frame rate drops or texture pop-ins.

Overview:
Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition offers a captivating blend of exploration, combat, and storytelling within a visually stunning post-apocalyptic world. Its unique premise, combined with a well-developed protagonist in Aloy, immerses players in a rich narrative filled with mysteries and engaging gameplay. While the initial learning curve and minor technical hiccups may pose slight challenges, the overall experience is nothing short of exceptional.

Gameplay:
The core gameplay of Horizon Zero Dawn revolves around a dynamic combat system where players utilize a combination of ranged weaponry, melee strikes, and tactical strategies to take down robotic foes. The introduction of Aloy's Focus, a device that provides critical information on enemy weaknesses, enhances the depth of combat, encouraging players to approach encounters with a mixture of cunning and precision. Additionally, the integration of stealth mechanics allows for diverse playstyles, further enhancing the tactical depth of the game. The vast open world encourages exploration, offering a plethora of activities and secrets to discover, ensuring that players are constantly engaged.

Graphics and Sound:
Horizon Zero Dawn sets a new standard in visual excellence. The game's meticulously detailed environments, from lush forests to barren deserts, showcase a level of craftsmanship that immerses players in a believable and awe-inspiring world. The robotic creatures are beautifully designed, with intricate animations that convey a sense of realism. Moreover, the dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add an extra layer of immersion. The sound design complements the visual experience seamlessly, with a score that heightens the emotional impact of key moments, and ambient sounds that further enhance the sense of place.

The character development is superb, with well-rounded personalities and nuanced relationships. Memorable moments are plentiful, and the game masterfully balances moments of quiet introspection with high-stakes action.

Performance and Technical Issues:
Overall, the game runs smoothly on PC, with stable frame rates and minimal load times, even on moderately powerful systems. However, some players may encounter occasional minor technical hiccups, such as infrequent frame rate drops or texture pop-ins. These issues, while noticeable, do not significantly detract from the overall experience.

Multiplayer and Community: Horizon Zero Dawn is primarily a single-player experience, with no multiplayer features or online modes. However, the absence of multiplayer does not diminish the game's quality, as the focus on a rich, narrative-driven experience is a strength in itself.

Final Thoughts:
Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is a tour de force in the action RPG genre, offering a captivating blend of exploration, combat, and storytelling. Its stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and immersive world-building make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. While there are minor technical hiccups and a learning curve to navigate, these pale in comparison to the overall excellence of the experience.

Gameplay has its ups and downs, but for the most part it's quite fun. Parkour is easy and intuitive, you just have to look around and know the keys. For example, using space-bar + directional WASD keys makes you jump to further handholds.

Combat is fun, puzzling, but repetitive. After your second Thunderjaw you really have beat them all. Later in the game many more puzzling enemies crop up, especially within the DLC area. Some are pleasantly challenging while others are annoying. I'll leave it to you to decide which ones are what.

The inventory is not amazing. It's a little cluttered? The UI is fine, but there are so many things in each tab it's easy to get lost, and most tabs I don't even touch. The notebook and lore entries are one thing that's very dumb, and I hope it's improved in HZD:FW when it comes to PC. Picking up a reading entry and often losing it because it puts you in the mouse-over UI rather than simply activating the entry itself is painful.

The lore of this series is incredible. I'm not sure how the second game did or what its problems are, but I hope it lives up to the sheer epic feel of this story. I'm sad to put this down, but I guess I'll replay it in a few years time to rekindle good memories.

Rest in Peace, Sylens. What a complicated and well acted character. Lance Reddick's acting and premature death prompted my purchase and playthrough. Certainly worth it, I think he'd be glad to know that his incredible acting has brought joy to another soul.",1694244357,1694244357,True,0,0,0.464659720659255981,0,True,False,False

It can be tricky taking aim at a mad machine charging at you. However, melee strikes with your spear will do plenty of damage. Besides, you can change the difficulty level if it gets too tricky.

There are lots of characters who will speak to you and plenty of side quests. Now it's a bargain price, it would be rude not to buy it!

Levantando as considerações positivas, o primeiro acerto para mim foi ter finalmente uma protagonista feminina, onde sua personalidade é bem construida entre uma pessoa amorosa, porem forte diante o que passou e precisa enfrentar pela frente.
A jogabilidade é boa, as lutas sao intensas, as maquinas sao bem feitas, tem ate interações entre eles, os diálogos sao coerentes, a historia principal te faz querer saber mais a cada momento, o mundo aberto é muito bem feito, as variações entre gelo e deserto, nos faz imergir de uma forma formidável.
Minhas criticas negativas, mas que nao me fizeram desestimular, foi a lança que ela usa pramlutar, do qual eu sinto que deveria ser mais livre o combate do que ela ter ataques pre feitos ao atacar (ela sempre vai atacar da mesma forma), tive problemas tambem com a mudança de tempo em algumas ocasiões que simplesmente um passo alterava de forma drástica o clima ou iluminação do ambiente, os NPC's poderiam ser um pouco mais distintos (muitos com a mesma cara), as roupas/armaduras sao bem feias e a fase final é energetica, mas eu particularmente queria algo mais intenso diretamente com Hades.
Do mais, otimas batalhas, otimos bosses, otima historia, side quest ajudam na exploração e aquisição de itens, Eloy é feita na medida certa, o cabelo é realmente um dos melhores ja feitos, boas opções de escolhas em missoes, o clima/tempo/ambientação é muito lindo, no geral vale a experiência e deixa um gosto de vontade para o segundo jogo da franquia

I really liked the story and premise of the game, to me it was as good a story as Mass Effect or other AAA games.  Overall I felt it immersive and engaging and din't feel that I was 'grinding' for gear.  I really like the story mode that lets you turn down the difficulty a lot to get a by a frustrating boss fight, then flip it back to normal so I don't  get annoyed with tedious boss fights that make me quit the game out of frustration.  I would have liked to have seen more ability to customize armor or weapons.  Perhaps a way to forge multiple mods into a single 'legendary' mod to affix to armor or weapon instead of tossing out all your common mods as you filter to keep only the purple class mods.  I think that would help with the more difficult levels of game play and add another dimension to the game as you tend to get your kit setup and don't change it much after midway through the game but that is a small nit.  Maybe a way to store gear 'at home' and have a forge at home to do something with stored gear.  Also I felt there were too many weapons and armor sets you are changing out often (from silent armor to something more durable once you are discovered).  Too many weapons for a 4 weapon wheel - again changing out weapons assigned as 1 or 4 options on the wheel...  Hopefully some of this is refined in a subsequent release of the game (I have not looked at Forbidden West yet but will).

The gameplay itself is also rather basic, using the Assassins creed style of combat alongside the specific flavor of open world in those games.

great combat, great enemies, amazing graphics, good map, runs well enough.

interesting story concept but bad delivery, unrewarding looting system, human combat is boring compared to robot, unsatisfying bosses and some questionable balancing choices for a few items.

Pros 
- great combat and enemy variety. There are tons of different robots to fight with the majority feeling extremely diverse (apart from the striders and their 4 or so counterparts). Each enemy fells great to fight as well down to how you can influence their AI by targeting weak points or using elemental arrows. Combat never got stale throughout my play through.

- One of the best looking games I've ever played. Animations for the robot enemies are also very well animated.

- The map is overall very good. Quite large considering there aren't any good methods of travel, but i didn't really mind because it meant I got to see more of the environments. Great variety of biomes which all look great. Decent coverage of content across the map. Tall necks are a fun way of uncovering sections of the map.

- I found the side content pretty fun, especially the cauldrons and dlc fireclaw encounters.

- The game ran smoothly for me, I also didn't experience any glitches outside of one or two floating objects (judging from other peoples experiences this isn't always the case, so don't take my experience for canon). For reference im running a 3080 + ryzen 7 5800x + 32gb of ram.

Cons 
- The biggest con for me is the story, which if you can be asked to pay attention, is at times interesting, but the delivery is terrible. So much of this game is talking to random npcs where you will be given different dialogue options, which is weird because they make no difference at all to the story. On top of that all the characters are very lifeless, meaning I didn't care about any of the dialogue options anyway so I would always skip the interactions and or choose the dialogue option which would end the conversation faster. The best parts of the story are when you visit the remnants of the old civilisation, where you discover more about what happened to earth and how/why Gaia was created etc. However 90% of this part of the lore is told through optional messages, audio logs and holograms rather than actual story telling.

- The looting kinda sucks, especially because Aloy has to stop dead for an animation to play of her picking something up every time you want to pick something up. This gets very tedious considering how many items you need to pick up for ammo crafting materials and health items. Also the only valuable things that enemies drop are the purple mods which means the reward for killing even the toughest enemies is pretty underwhelming, unless you like to have a lot of currency I guess.

- human enemies are boring to fight in comparison to robots.

- side content can be repetitive 

- The dlc weapons make everything else obsolete and so does the shield weaver armour. I started a new game + on the hardest difficulty and it was a breeze with those weapons and armour apart from the fireclaw encounters. Kinda trivialises combat because all you have to do is spam ice arrows and then either hardpoint or regular sharp shot arrows, which do so much damage with the dlc bows that I didn't find myself using any other arrows or tools most of the time.

- Boss fights could be better. There aren't really any boss fights in the game which feel like boss fights, because all the bosses are just regular enemies which can be found on the map.

- Mounts suck ass. It feels pretty unresponsive when you try to turn, not sure why robot horses have such terrible handling. Also when you do manage to turn your mount looses all of its speed for some reason which means you have to constantly hold shift. I just opted to walk or fast travel to objectives most of the time.


I definitely think this game is worth a play, but i wouldn't pay full price for it especially considering it goes on sale for about £15 pretty regularly in 2023.",1693785365,1693785661,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Introduction:

In the world of open-world games, where many tread similar paths, ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" is a shining gem that taught me the value of patience. If you're willing to invest time and emotion into its prologue, you're in for a profoundly rewarding experience.

A World of Wonder and Redemption:

Imagine the thrill of stalking gigantic mechanical beasts armed with nothing but a bow and arrow. ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" places you in the shoes of Aloy, a compassionate hero on a quest that involves not only helping villagers but also seeking the pieces of her shattered heart. It's a journey filled with themes of bullying, revenge, astonishing discoveries, and the unbridled joy of exploration.

A Heart-Wrenching Tale:

This game didn't just immerse me; it gripped my heart with its emotionally charged narrative. Learning about Aloy's painful past – how she was abandoned and mistreated – left me with a lump in my throat. As the story unfolds, you witness a transformation in how people treat her, and the fates of those who once looked after her (I'll spare you the spoilers). ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" tells a beautiful story that resonates deep within.

Masterful Skills and Combat:

Aloy's abilities are nothing short of extraordinary. The power to slow down time became more than a gameplay mechanic; it felt like an extension of my own skill. As I upgraded my bow, I grew more powerful, ready to face any challenge. The combat in this game is not just cool – it's an adrenaline-pumping, heart-pounding dance with destiny.

A Game for the Heart:

Now, it's important to acknowledge that ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" isn't for everyone. If you're a hardcore souls gamer seeking relentless challenges, you might not find them here. There are also lengthy conversations you can skip, but I implore you not to rush. Each dialogue adds a layer of depth to the characters and the world.

In Conclusion:

So, what's my personal verdict? I can't help but declare my love for ""Horizon Zero Dawn."" It's more than just a game; it's an emotional journey that left an indelible mark on my heart. It taught me the value of patience, the power of storytelling, and the exhilaration of mastering one's skills. If you're ready to embark on a deeply personal and emotionally resonant adventure, ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" is waiting to embrace you.",1650516515,1693682298,True,11,0,0.590311110019683838,0,True,False,False

The game is a very good sneak with bow and arrow-game. But unfortunately some missions require a more head-on approach. Your character does not do well in close combat, and being attacked by more than one enemy is pure chaos. There are a lot of armor options in the game, but I felt they didn't help anything, so I just kept using the stealth armor and later the shield weaver.

The missions and pacing in total, felt ok. Even though I did a lot of side missions, the main missions were difficult enough. The story was very compelling and I think this universe really has potential for many more games. The puzzles and parkour paths could have been cut shorter. It wasn't too bad, but it started to feel like a chore after a while. The Hunting grounds was both maybe the worst and best experience in the game. I utterly loathe time limits, so finishing them was something I never thought I could do. But it was possible after using all kinds of tricks learned through the game, and also a little bit of cheese.

The sounds and music is really spot on. You really don't want to turn off the music. The voice acting is up to AAA standards, but the random comments and grunts misses from time to time. The dialog feels sometimes just routine acting from the voice actors. They doesn't live into their characters, but still does a passable job. The same goes for the graphics. Really stunning landscapes with a lot of biomes and variation. Well animated enemies and wildlife, but the people feels and looks like marionettes too often. 

The expansion The Frozen Wastes feels a little bit tacked on. It just dials the difficulty to 11, removes the possibility of controlling most of the machines, and give you armor and weapons that replaces everything in the base game.  So everything you earn and learn in the base game, is just thrown out of the window.

Note: For those of you that really want to experience the story, and fear the battles: In the last patch, they included a Story-difficulty. In this mode you can one-shot all the enemies more or less and experience the story without dying over and over.",1693609427,1693609427,True,8,1,0.602406740188598633,0,True,False,False

-For a game whose main weapons are bows and hitting PRECISE PARTS is key, the tracking is oddly sluggish and both hit boxes and projectile detection are mediocre. You will often find arrows acting weird or hitting a part that was NOT what you saw it hit.
-It is fairly easy to get stuck in a movement animation or just on a random piece of terrain. If this happens in a fight it will either cost you all of the healing you have stored up or just get you caught in a hit animation and kill you.
-Taking dmg specifically tick dmg can easily lock your character in a reaction animation and kill you.
-Most things travel in packs of 3++....... You will understand how insanely annoying this can get ESPECIALLY if you have to fight in a restricted area and the creatures scale up. In the later half of the game it's very common to be fighting 5-9 things at the same time.

it's not a good stealth game. 

there's no actual strategy or risk to it. you just have to crouch which makes you completely silent, then enter tall grass and you become completely invisible unless you attack. that's part of why the ability tree doesn't have enough specialization into stealth, there's nothing to actually improve. this type of stealth has no actual risk, so it's not at all satisfying to use. and on top of this, because whether or not you can be seen or heard is a binary, higher difficulties don't make the stealth more difficult. this combined with the stealth kill issue means that the difficulty increase with higher difficulties is honestly negligible, only really making combat take longer.

you know exactly where every nearby machine is due to your focus, which can see machines from around a hundred feet away through solid stone. not only that, but it can see the paths of machines that patrol, removing the fun and the challenge of figuring that out yourself. part of the fun in a stealth game, at least for me, is when i managed to miss an enemy during recon, meaning i now have to find a way to deal with them or i get seen, and have to switch to combat.

very near the start of the game sums this all up pretty well, when you have a mission to sneak past a few machines to save someone and there's zero challenge whatsoever, despite the fact that at the time you're 7 or 8. you see their paths, and once they walk past you then you sneak to the next bit of tall grass. this is essentially how it will be for the rest of the game.

combat just plain boring. there's nothing really to add to that. the process of combat is this brief loop:
1. identify the weak points of the machine.
2. shoot the weak point until it starts an attack.
3. dodge out of the way of the attack.
4. repeat from step 2 until the machine is dead.
this process doesn't change by the way if there are more enemies. it's just the same thing, with more dodging to not get hit.

the one part of the game i do actually enjoy is the story and the lore supporting it. it was interesting seeing how these people with nowhere near our technology today interpret things far beyond our technology. an example of this would be the mountain at the start of the game. you end up being brought into a sacred mountain, in which there's what turns out to be a door leading into something similar to the vaults in fallout, minus the experiments. it scans you, and says it can't let you enter due to there being corruption that you can fix. this gets reasonably interpreted as their god electing a chosen one to cleanse the corruption in the land. i just find this kind of stuff interesting.

despite this though, it doesn't make it worth it. stealth is unsatisfying, the combat is boring, and the numbers reward isn't worth the effort to level up, nor is it particularly satisfying to do so. i really do wish a could recommend this game, the idea is so cool to me but the execution just doesn't lead to a fun or satisfying experience.",1693452245,1693452245,False,3,0,0.483096212148666382,0,True,False,False

+ Beautiful environments
+ Decent stealth mechanics
+ Decent story
+ Impactful combat
+ Doesn't replace important gameplay with QTE.

- Huge info dump sequences with irrelevant flavor mixed in, making me want to skip most of it, but paranoid about missing the story.
- Disrespectful of your time. The inventory management, and crafting is mostly not fun, just busy work to get you to waste time hunting animals to get random drops to make bags bigger, and making arrows in a paused menu from thousands of ingredients when you run out. 
- Leveling contains ways to reduce these annoyances, forcing you to play most of the game just getting slowly less annoyed, until you finally get minor stealth and combat bonuses in the endgame.

Bought on my PS4 when it first came out and it was one of the only games i ever truly enjoyed to 100% complete. Feels like decades ago since its launch, but back in 2017, games felt truly 'finished' on release and none of these absolute sh*t shows over the past few years like CyperPunk 2077, Anthem, Fallout76, No Mans Sky etc which are marred with issues during their launch, and to be honest just completely ruins the experience of even getting started after all the hype. In that sense, Zero Dawn was never spoiled, which made its incredible gameplay, storyline and mechanics, even better.

I think my favourite part is the narrative. I've never felt more immersed and drawn to the story as i have with this game. The 'rebirth' of humanity, coupled with the events that led up to the near destruction of Earth, had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Most games have a fairly obvious storyline and you aren't too surprised at its progression. (SPOILERS) But with every revelation of Gaia, Hades, the Alphas and even finally Aloy discovering the exosuit of Elisabet after her sacrifice at the end of the game, was just.. wow. I don't normally get emotionally invested in a game's story, but this was the first time i think ever where i shed a tear during the epilogue. Its similarity to the real world i think is what gave it that hook. All the games mentioned above are truly 'this would never happen in real life, or at least in our lifetime', but Zero Dawn (not to be a doomsayer or anything) is an increasingly possible situation for our planet, and i genuinely wonder what life will be like 1000 years from now. In that sense, you aren't only becoming a hero in this story, but you are saving the humanity that we all live in every day.

I bought this game on steam because my PS4 broke and i have no plans on getting the PS5, but i had this itch to relive that story again and god it was worth it. This will be my first and probably only review i ever write, but i wanted this to pay homage to the absolute perfection that is Zero Dawn, and as a tribute to everyone that was a part in its creation.

I was absolutely blown away by the depth of the plot, the sheer visual beauty of the game and the distinct characters.  The game is set in various biospheres (desert, grassland, mountain etc) each of which is populated by specific tribes with their own unique look and philosophy (religion?) based on their fragmented understanding of the world around them.  The visual design of this game is stunning and there are a lot of unique character designs which keep the game's look fresh even if you find yourself in the same biosphere for  a long period.  The development of the story as Aloy learns about her past and the evolution of the world she lives in is really involving and there are plenty of collectable text points which you can collect and read later which add a lot of colour to the story.  In terms of gameplay there is the usual FarCry/AC skill tree and weapon upgrade opportunities with the focus very much on range weapons (melee fighting barely exists in this game), tripwires and traps.  Each robot has their own strengths and weaknesses to particular elements all lovingly detailed in Aloy's notebook (tip: if you refer to the notebook before engaging a machine your life is going to be immeasurably easier).  Some machines are harder than others (I've still not managed to kill a Rockbreaker) and their variety keeps the combat element engaging.  Downsides? Its quite common to get stuck on or inbetween scenery necessitating restarting from the last save point; also at the end of the game after completing the final battle and watching the post-credits cut scene the game returns you to the start of the final quest (you still get all of your XP from completing the game so not a major issue but not very clean).  Aside from that minor niggle a fantastic, immersive game and definitely recommended for fans of the long form RPG.

I wouldn't play for the gameplay itself, because constantly running into machines is a little annoying HOWEVER the plot has me on the edge of my seat. I'm always excited to see what's coming next.

The world space is beautifully crafted, the story is one of the best SF story in a video game (I already finished the game on PS4) and the combat system is top notch. The monsters are the best I've encountered in a video game so far and their design is only surpassed  by the sequel (by design I mean their weak points, abilities and behavior more than their visual aspect which is pretty cool too).

It's almost too perfect. The only flaw I can find, and let be honest it's a big flaw, is the side quests which are really tedious and not interesting. They're 100% fetching quests. It's almost always ""go there, find my missing -insert parent/friend/object-""

The PC version is really good and I didn't run into any framerate issue or technical problems. Running the game on Ultra settings at 1080p with a Ryzen 5600X GeForce 1080 and 16 Gb of RAM. Moreover, I'm so glad to be able to play this game without the handicap of a controller.

Briefly said this game is for you if :

- you're a Action RPG lover,
- you're a SF RPG fan,
- you're a Post Apo RPG addict,

However, I am going to have to give it a firm NO, on account of the Parkour elements in the game, that aren't made clear in the game description.

Let me be absolutely clear. If you love platform games, parkour, or any of that kind of silliness, then this won't disturb your enjoyment of the game. However, at the moment, I'm literally trapped, inside an underground complex, because the fucking game has dumped me there, with no apparent way of escape, except for falling to my death. I've spent about an hour wandering around a space the size of my living room, to no avail.

This is complete BS. I HATE PARKOUR and think that games with it should come with a health and safety warning label. Frankly, irrespective of how good you think your game is, there is precisely no universe, in which parkour will make it better, UNLESS it is a parkour game. Throwing minor, seemingly random, parkour elements in just to fuck people over is not cool.

So after 20+ hours of enjoyable play, with much of the game still to be explored, I'm stopping here, because this simply isn't a fun experience. 

I've left my original review below and am keeping my thumbs down, on account of the stupidity of the situation I find myself in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Incredibly disappointed. Even running 1080 resolution (instead of the 2K I easily manage with other games), I am lucky if I get even 1 FPS on this. 

I'm running an AMD graphics card, so maybe the game doesn't like it, but I certainly cannot recommend a game that is so poorly optimised as to be unplayable.

The premise is quite unique, when it comes to the world, which immediately elevates it above any generic sequel of which we get way too many nowadays. 
You learn about the world and its alternate history through different datapoints throughout the world, which could have been done better. At the same time, it isn't terrible. 
Visually it is very well realized. It is one of the few games which gave me a sense of actual height, whether it is the height of buildings or the height of a mountain when you are standing on top of it. 
As is always the case with a good game the gameplay is the best thing about it, mainly the combat. You get a lot of different weapons to use on a multitude of different enemy types and the fighting is mostly smooth, even though it can be frustrating since a lot of enemies knock you down and it can snowball when there are a lot of enemies.
The in-game economy also works quite well, because there are a lot of incentives to go out and get different machine parts and get different wildlife in order to afford all sorts of weapons, outfits and upgrades. 
The story is surprisingly well written. It fits perfectly into the world and has a few twists and turns which makes it quite interesting. Unfortunately the characters themselves aren't really interesting, which does impact the story presentation negatively.
The only other negative would be the size of the world, which in my opinion is a little too big. There is a lot of open space that isn't critical and only increases travel time. 

As a sidenote: The game has been ported very well to PC. It looks fantastic and I had not a single dropped frame during 85 hours of gameplay.

As a PC player, this game is an obvious port of an original console game.  That being said, if you play with a controller and / or are used to controller movement and commands, this game might be right up your alley.

Even in story mode, some of the fights were tough to win without dying.

The setting is honestly very intriguing and thought provoking, but a little on the nose. The interactions and ""moral"" decisions however have little to no impact on the characters and game progression, missed opportunity. There is only 1 ending, and there are two parallel main quest-lines so the game feels quite linear. The side-quests, DLC and overall environments do a great job at making the world feel alive and definitely enhance the storytelling. Subtlety is however completely out the window, with the main character constantly talking to herself in the typical videogamey fashion ""oh I wonder what happens if I press that button over there"". Visually it's fantastic, not much to say, typical mega big budget polish. Although character animations are a little uncanny.

By far the best thing is the core game-play surrounding the combat. The enemies a very varied in their behavior, attacks and sizes. With unique strengths and weaknesses that force you to play smart and counter them with a wide arsenal of weapons at your disposal. The crafting and elemental systems are IMO very fun, although there are clear weapon imbalances. Still having all this choice doesn't feel overwhelming and gives the player great flexibility on how to tackle combat.

The only true big negative is the main campaign length and lack of NG+ challenge. The actual main game is quite short, most of the content lies on the side quests and DLC, which are quite engaging. While I took me around 65 hours to max out all the game in NG, my NG+ run on ultra hard lasted only around 5 hours. By the end, it honestly feels like the game is way too easy. I do wish there were additional mechanics to increase the challenge further. This is more or less addressed in the DLC with new more dangerous enemies and equally more potent weapons to match.

TLDR: Game good, like an easier Dark Souls or a better ubi-game. Looks beautiful, short main story, great combat, kinda short campaign, lots of good side activities. DLC OK. Recommended, specially if you like collectathons",1692126853,1692126853,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

STOP SPOON FEEDING AGENDA IN GAMES

The game has been hailed as a feminist action game with a strong female lead by many critics and feminists . They claim that the game shows women as strong, capable, and virtuous, and men as weak, flawed, or evil. They also claim that Aloy is an inspiring and feminine heroine that challenges the patriarchal norms of her world. But I disagree with these claims. I think that the game is not feminist at all. I think that the game is actually sexist and anti-feminist.

Why do I think that? The game does not portray women and men in a balanced and realistic way. It portrays women as superior to men in every way possible, and men as inferior to women in every way possible. It portrays women as having no flaws or weaknesses, and men as having no strengths or virtues. It portrays women as being able to do anything that men can do, and men as being unable to do anything that women can do. It portrays women as being the only ones who can save the world, and men as being the ones who ruined it.

Let me give you some examples of what I mean:

Aloy: She is the main character of the game, and she is essentially flawless. She is smart, strong, brave, kind, curious, determined, and skilled. She can hunt, fight, craft, hack, and learn anything she wants. She can overcome any obstacle or enemy she faces. She can solve any mystery or problem she encounters. She can defy any authority or tradition she opposes. She can befriend or ally with anyone she meets. She is the chosen one, the savior of the world, the one who can stop the evil that threatens humanity. She is basically a Mary Sue, a perfect character who has no flaws or weaknesses, and who can do no wrong.

Rost: He is Aloy’s adoptive father and mentor, and he is one of the few good men in the game. He is a noble and brave man, but he is also a disposable and replaceable man. He serves as a plot device to motivate Aloy’s quest for revenge and identity, but he has no other role or significance in the game. 

Avad: He is the king of the Carja tribe, one of the largest and most advanced tribes in the game world. He is also a weak and dependent man. He inherited his throne from his father, a tyrant who waged war on other tribes and sacrificed people to the sun god. He rebelled against his father and killed him with the help of his sister Ersa, a strong and capable woman who led a group of mercenaries called the Vanguard. He then tried to reform his tribe and make peace with other tribes, but he faced opposition and resistance from his own people, especially from his brother Helis, a fanatic who joined the Eclipse and tried to overthrow him. He relied on Aloy to save him from his brother’s plots and attacks, and he also relied on Ersa to protect him and advise him. He was in love with Ersa, but she was kidnapped and killed by Helis, leaving him heartbroken and helpless. He then developed a crush on Aloy, but she rejected him and left him alone.

Erend: He is a captain of the Vanguard, the group of mercenaries that serve Avad and Ersa. He is also a drunk and a fool. He is a friendly and loyal man, but he is also a clumsy and incompetent man. He often gets into trouble or causes trouble for others, and he needs Aloy to bail him out or fix his mistakes. He was Ersa’s brother, and he loved her dearly, but he also failed to protect her or avenge her death. He had a crush on Aloy, but she ignored him or friendzoned him.

Sylens: He is a mysterious man who helps Aloy in her quest to learn about the past and stop the Eclipse. He is also a selfish and treacherous man. He is a smart and knowledgeable man, but he is also a greedy and ruthless man. He was once a member of the Eclipse, but he betrayed them when he learned about their true plans. He then contacted Aloy and offered her his assistance, but he also used her for his own agenda. He taught her how to hack machines, but he also hacked her focus device, a device that allows her to scan and communicate with others. He gave her information about the ancient civilization, but he also withheld information from her. He helped her stop HADES, the artificial intelligence that wanted to destroy the world, but he also saved HADES from destruction and kept it for himself.

These are just some of the examples of how the game portrays women and men in an unbalanced and unrealistic way. There are many more examples throughout the game, such as:

The Nora tribe: They are a matriarchal society that values hunting and nature. They are led by women, who are called matriarchs. They are mostly good, noble, and wise people, who respect Aloy and honor her as their savior. The men in this tribe are either warriors or hunters, who follow the orders of the women. They are mostly loyal, brave, and honorable people, but they are also subordinate, passive, and disposable people.

The Carja tribe: They are a hierarchical society that values trade and religion. They are led by men, who are called sun-kings. They are mostly bad, cruel, and corrupt people, who oppress other tribes and sacrifice people to their sun god. The women in this tribe are either nobles or slaves, who have no power or voice in their society. They are mostly oppressed, abused, or ignored people, but they are also resilient, defiant, or rebellious people.

The Oseram tribe: They are a democratic society that values technology and innovation. They have no leader, but they have no leader, but they are governed by a council of elders, who are both men and women. They are mostly good, friendly, and helpful people, who support Aloy and share their knowledge and inventions with her. The men and women in this tribe are equally skilled and respected, and they work together as partners or rivals.

As you can see, the game portrays women and men in a very biased and unrealistic way. It shows women as being better than men in every way possible, and men as being worse than women in every way possible. It shows women as having no flaws or weaknesses, and men as having no strengths or virtues. It shows women as being able to do anything that men can do, and men as being unable to do anything that women can do. It shows women as being the only ones who can save the world, and men as being the ones who ruined it.

Feminism is supposed to be about recognizing and respecting the differences and similarities between women and men. It is supposed to be about empowering women to achieve their full potential without limiting or oppressing men. It is supposed to be about celebrating the achievements and contributions of both women and men in history and society.

But this game does none of that. It does not portray women and men in an equal and diverse way. It does not recognize or respect the differences and similarities between women and men. It does not empower women to achieve their full potential without limiting or oppressing men. It does not celebrate the achievements and contributions of both women and men in history and society.

Instead, it portrays women and men in an unequal and homogenous way. It ignores or denies the differences and similarities between women and men. It empowers women to achieve their full potential by limiting or oppressing men. It celebrates the achievements and contributions of only women in history and society.

This game is not a feminist action game with a strong female lead. It is a sexist action game with a perfect female lead.

And this is why I think the game fails to represent women and men in a balanced and realistic way, and why it actually undermines its own message of female empowerment.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game for its gameplay and story, but it is also a disappointing game for its portrayal of gender.",1691979322,1691992006,False,0,1,0.449874162673950195,24,True,False,False

Despite having a somewhat beefy system (i7-11700K, RTX 3070, 3200MHz RAM and 980 Pro SSD), this game struggles to perform in many instances and exhibits issues not seen in any other games. 

List of issues:
-Game ALWAYS uses 100% of all 8 cores on my CPU at all times, no matter what is going on. No enemies present? Every core. Looking at vast, barren landscape? Apparently, every core is necessary for this. 
-Awful performance in 1440p, as its more CPU intensive. Can only play this in 4K. 
-Ridiculous pop-in even when running on a 980 Pro and 3200MHz RAM. 
-Every cut scene is impossible to take seriously due to the ridiculous pop in. The world rebuilds itself with every camera change, the characters pop-in and ""settle"" into the scene well after the camera changes position. 
-Terrible audio mixing. A character will be far away and sound like they're right in your ear, or randomly sound like they're in a tunnel with an echo. The bit-rate for the character's voices is screwed up somehow, it sounds like the dialogue is coming through a telephone. During intense scenes it is nearly impossible to distinguish the music, sound effects and dialogue as they all just jumble together. 
-Sometimes the textures just refuse to load, have to restart my entire PC for this to go away. Aloy's model will also just randomly refuse to load all the way for several minutes, walking around like OG Lara Croft. 

I play many graphically intense games and none of them are as taxing on my processor as this game is. In Cyberpunk and RDR2, even the most populated areas use less than 100% CPU and I maintain a stable 72 FPS in 1440P ultra settings. HZD goes sub 60FPS in 1440p just walking around, regardless of the settings, with my CPU temps as high as a Cinebench stress test. This is unacceptable for a game that released on the PS4. 

I hate to leave a bad review for this game, simply because the game itself is good, but there's just no excuse for a port that's been out for 2 years to have this many issues.

It was a very pleasant experience, with some strokes of annoyance along the way. Mainly in annoying machine fights (sounds like a skill issue but whatever) and too many collectibles.

The game and setting are beautiful but you can't interact w/ any of it. 
The idea of being able to use and upgrade different weapon types as well as utilize different fighting styles sounds awesome but it gets repetitive really quickly. 
The idea of exploring the complexities of characters placed in such a unique setting sounds like it will make for some great story development but none of them stick around long enough or have enough character growth to make you really want to see them grow and change as the story progresses. 

Overall, It feels like a standard experience. It's great for passing the time but that's exactly the problem- or perhaps its the expectations I had that I set too high for how much I would enjoy this game. Either way, this game doesn't have any outstanding features that make it something really special and memorable for me. I find myself reaching for it only when I can't thing of something else that I want to do for the evening. 

I'm sure the developers put a lot of love and care into it- you can see it in the design (the game is beautiful) and the premise really intrigues me, but I think in this instance, it's just not my cup of tea.",1691827051,1691827051,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Constant stutters and massive frame drops. Like you cannot play more than 20FPS for half an hr even on the original settings. CPU and GPU temp 79 C(thanks to offsetting) but heats up so much. Many heavy titles do not struggle even on the high settings, but this game does.

First, I was impressed by the game's world and its beauty. Vast grasslands, forests, mountains, and wildernesses are depicted with breathtaking detail and reality. Even the robotic dinosaur-like creatures are amazingly elaborately designed, and the effects and movements during battle are breathtaking. The sunsets and sunrises are as beautiful as paintings.

The story is also deeply moving. The main character, Arloi, confronts his past and forges his destiny in a mysterious world. The complex relationships and surprising plot developments draw the player in. You will share in their adventures as you become emotionally involved in the characters' growth and conflicts.

The combat system is very comfortable and makes hunting and fighting fun. There is a wide variety of weapons and traps, requiring strategic play. The battles with the robots are a perfect combination of action game-like thrills and tactical elements that make it hard to stop playing once you get going.

In addition, the soundtrack and sound effects are excellent and further enhance the game's atmosphere. From the sound of the wind, to the sounds of animals, to the tense atmosphere during battle, the detailed sound design immerses the player in the experience.

Horizon Zero Dawn sets a new standard for open-world action RPGs, and I can assure you that its beauty and depth are second to none. It is one of those games that is well worth playing. Once you play it, you will be captivated by its charm.",1691590469,1691590469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If a good story interests you, and tidbits of information motivate you to unearth the reality of the world you live in, I can promise you HZD will leave you in tears and shivering. It's such a well crafted experience, you don't want to know anything about it before playing.

The world is one of the most beautiful I've lived in, some of the characters will stay with you long after the game ends, and the gameplay is really satisfying but only after you master it. Remember, there is no shame in experiencing this game for the story alone and you can always turn down the difficulty to relish one of the best stories ever told. The game allows that.

Take your time with it, there is so much lore spread around this world, you don't want to rush and miss it. Once you start piecing the clues together, you will want to find out every hidden story. The whys and the hows never leave your mind.

It's a 10/10 for me. The graphics, the music, the characters, the gameplay (once I got good at it) and the crazy, riveting, moving story of Aloy and her world... I'll never forget these. Wish I could. To relive it all again.",1691537211,1691537211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I picked it up in a steam sale for about 20 dollars and TLDR I would recommend it for some reasons and not recommend it for others. It very heavily feels like an Ubisoft game where Farcry and Assassins Creed had a robot dinosaur baby. All in all I feel like I got my monies worth, but I would never do a second playthrough.

The Good:
- The story is incredibly interesting and fascinating to uncover from a position of not knowing anything about the game beforehand.
- The visuals are stunning and the attention to detail in some areas is astounding and easy to get lost in their beauty.
- The combat is fun, challenging, and fast paced enough to keep it from getting repetitive (mostly.)
- The game ran pretty smoothly (there was some stuttering on load-up, but would flatten out after a few minutes) on a computer that is starting to show it's age on more modern games.
- All cutscenes are voiced, as are about 30% of the collectables.
- The enemies are wonderfully designed and you can tell how intricately crafted they were.

The Bad:
- There were some instances of environment merging problems where you could see pallet swapping squares on the floor rigidly cut and not blended.
- The main character is unlikeable, whiny, stubborn, and tries to make you feel things for her when it's not set up correctly emotionally.
- Voice log collectables and in game voices while exploring will play over eachother, making it impossible to hear what either thing is saying.
- Some characters faces have a very ""uncanny valley"" look to them. Sometimes a characters face will go from relaxed and calm to ""Running aggression protocol"" and stretch to angry mode. The main characters teeth don't always sit right in her head when she speaks too.
- There's a need for suspension of disbelief for parts of the game aside from the obvious. Like rappelling down a rope with her bare hands uninjured or enemies talking in gentle voices while using sonic attacks to disable people at the same time.
- Platforming is somewhat inconsistent sometimes. Sometimes you just have to nudge the character in the right direction and they'll jump automatically, and sometimes they'll walk off the edge to their death, and there's no way to know which way it is until you try it.
- Inventory is a nightmare in this game. Even with the extra slots from the DLC there is not enough slots and nothing tells you whether an item is still useful or not. You'll often run out of the items you need for crafting your favourite ammo types too, somehow. Also, you have to hunt for meat in order to make fast travel tokens. Super Annoying.
- Fast travel puts you into an often 20-30 second long loading screen if the area is far from where you are. In fact, most loading screens in this game are kind of wayyyyy too long, even for an older pc.
- What you're fighting scales wildly in difficulty. Some enemies are just attacking you constantly, and you spend 99% of the fight mashing your roll button for iframes. Other enemies are so slow you can run circles around them or kill them in 1-2 hits. There's not really any enemies in between. Also, flying enemies are more annoying than any game I've come across before, ever. 
- 80% of the side quests are uninteresting with characters you won't remember five minutes after you're done with them.

Again, I would never do a second playthrough of this game, nor did I stick around long enough to collect all the odds and ends. By the time I was about 80% of the way through the game I was tired of it, and then I did the 8 hour long DLC and just wanted the game to be over. However, I definitely recommend playing through it at least once for how interesting the story that doesn't involve the main character is, if you can find it on sale.",1691322290,1691322290,True,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

I hope they do the same for this one but unlikely now. RTX users got away with DLSS which fixes this game's AA issue.

Here you can notice if you download this video. I ran it on 1080p native max settings. Disabled Sharpening as well. No upscaling. Looks like shit due to shimmering everywhere full of grass. Many people have reported and acknowledged the bad port.

From the moment I set foot in the game's vast and diverse landscapes, I was captivated. The lush forests, desolate wastelands, and bustling settlements created a visually stunning and dynamic backdrop for my adventures. The coexistence of nature and technology in a post-apocalyptic setting felt refreshing and thought-provoking.

While the main storyline had its ups and downs, I still found myself invested in Aloy's journey. Her quest to uncover the truth about her past and the world she inhabited was emotionally captivating.

However, what truly made Horizon Zero Dawn exceptional were the side quests and the vast amount of lore to explore. Each side mission introduced me to compelling characters, each with their own fascinating stories and struggles. The depth of the lore enriched my gaming experience, making the world feel alive and immersive.

The gameplay mechanics were smooth and intuitive, allowing me to master Aloy's combat skills and take on challenging foes. The strategic approach needed to defeat the robotic creatures added an extra layer of excitement to the game.

The stunning visuals and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack further heightened the overall experience. The attention to detail was commendable, making every moment in the game feel immersive and enchanting.

If someone has ideas, I'm still listening for the moment

The world is gorgeous and interesting throughout, and each regional tribe has their own aesthetic. The machines all have great designs and are fun to fight, and there are different options for taking them down to suit your playstyle via several different weapons and arrow effects.

The story is really well done, with engaging characters throughout and some different dialogue options to keep repeat playthroughs interesting. Though it's worth noting it's not necessarily a ""choices matter"" type of rpg. 

Performance seems to be a mixed bag; I've had good luck, but it may be something to keep in mind.

Overall it's an overwhelming yes from me, definitely one of my favorite games now. For sure worth full price, and even more so on discount.

Somehow Horizon avoids the bloat that plagues most games in the genre, and is able to tell an incredibly genuine and focused story. It has some of my favorite world building and my absolute favorite setting (Colorado Springs + the cool parts of Utah). I didn't realize where the game was set until I discovered the ruins of the Air Force Academy, and when I did it made my jaw drop. The attention to detail in these familiar locales makes for a very believable post-apocalyptic narrative, giant death robots and all.

The gameplay stands out as well. The rush of adrenaline that comes from narrowly dodging the attacks of a massive robo-dinosaur thing only to pivot into a quick arrow shot into it's barely-exposed cooling vent is exactly the type of experience I wished for in games like Monster Hunter. Machine hunts can be short but are always intense, and there is absolutely no shortage of enemies on the map. The stealth mechanics are well done, and this is one of the few games in which traps and lures actually make sense. Fighting humans is not nearly as cool. The bandit camps in particular are one area of the game that I was a little disappointed by. Luckily, these encounters are rare compared to machine hunts. 

The graphics are insane. The incredible art direction and shockingly good textures, animations, and models make the world and the characters feel so vibrant it's almost uncanny. almost any frame at any point in the game is a set-piece moment, and it provides a beautiful backdrop for the story and gameplay. 

Some of the writing (ESPECIALLY Aloy's dialogue during side quests) suffers from Fallout 4 disease, where the protagonist is a sarcastic jerk to every NPC even if you truly want to help them. This isn't really a problem in the main questline, but it can get annoying.

It also helps to think ahead of what potions you'll need. The melee combat is fun, but best used in conjunction with ranged weapons. Stealth is a lot of fun, and is more consistent than a lot of stealth games today. I don't think I got tired of the combat at all.

Upgrading weapons is fun. You get some great mods to really customize a weapon to fit you. The only drawback to this system is you need DLC to upgrade your only melee weapon, and you only get one slot. That could've been better.

The story is alright. I thought they did a great job building the lore of the old society, it's fall, and the birth of a new one. The problem is the massive amount of lore out in the world. You have to go looking for most of it. Some of it is also hidden behind poor side content that I have no interest in (hunting and racing challenges are just lazy content to me.) Only a small part is where you end up naturally. It can be Ubisoft level of collecting these. Lance Reddick turns in his usual solid performance. Aloy is a mixed bag. She shows some growth, but is often a douche to people. I notice more towards men. It's odd. Rost seemed to be good to her, and the matriarchs cast her out. I also notice that the majority of men are either a bad guy, completely inept, apologizing for their behaviors, or putting themselves down. Aloy and Sobeck are also too perfect for me. Despite this, I still stayed with the story, and enjoyed it.

I ran this on an R7 3700x, with a 3070, and 32gb of RAM. This is clearly one of the best coded games I've played in a long while. I can only remember one framerate drop (very uncommon today,) no dropped button presses (also far too common,) and no crashes. This is a well made game.

While all worlds are beautiful today, this isn't very important to me. Kudos to this world. It's far more detailed than most, very beautiful, and not too big. Well done!

One thing broken with the game. Silent Strike from above never once gave me the option to use it. I was always unseen, and would often fall on them trying to make the prompt appear. Silent Strike from Below also never had opportunities to use. They were just wasted points spent. Also, Silent Strike on RB caused my stealth to be blown often, as it would change the prompt right as I hit it (like AC Valhalla.)

I got BOTW vibes, Final Fantasy 3 vibes (especially in the soundtrack,) and even some AC vibes from it. Overall, I recommend this game. I got it for $17, and it's often on sale. Don't pay full price!",1690488568,1690491052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The post-apocalyptic/sci-fi/hunter-gatherer/ancient-world/but-with-robot-dinosaurs thing they got going on is absolutely enthralling to me, it's wonderful. It's a unique aesthetic that also lends itself very well to the gameplay: Said robot-dinosaurs are interesting (though, very rarely, frustrating) challenges that have different damage/elemental weaknesses and strengths that push you to use your whole arsenal in a way I don't experience in games often.

Aloy herself is awesome (which may or may not have something to do with my bias towards her voice actor, so, full disclosure: YMMV). The supporting cast has been mostly forgettable, but not grating or bad, per se. I will say that the facial animations of the generic character faces are a bit uncanny. They have naturalistic touches that show an attention to detail in their conversation animation system thingy, but things can feel a bit stiff and don't quite form a satisfying whole.

Overall, it's an incredible game and one of the few open-world games I stuck with. If you dig these, or liked them in the past but got burned out, Horizon Zero Dawn might be a good choice if you're looking to get stuck in again.

For my part, though, the amount of... padding in these games detracts from the experience. I've currently spent 50ish hours in it, but I was playing it like a completionist, even though I don't have the dedication or attention-span of one. It just left me falling off of the game part way through, playing less of the content that would've been worth my time than I should have, if you get my meaning.

One thing : do not expect an RPG, though. There are choices in dialogs, but they merely extend the player's interaction. The story arc is fixed, with a single ending. Also, do not expect a deep reflection on themes like artificial intelligence (especially when applied to weapons), climate change and the like. As I said, this is about entertainment.

The characters are colorful, and the clothes and cities also have something special.
The robots are inspired and the weak point system is also a good idea.

But the story just feels spread too thin to be enjoyed. Your missions also send you left and right without any focus in one area, so you will just end up using fast travel and skip about everything exploration like. 
The only character i felt I would grow to like died a few minutes later, and the other I don't really give a fornication about.
The fighting system is too stiff and the camera never helps. When you reach the area with flying enemies, if you want to shoot at them you better hope there is not a single piece of grass on the floor because the camera will conveniently place at the root of it. 
Sometimes you fell like you have to build a plan before actually fighting in an arena, but there is no place to hide, too many enemies, and you end up drinking potion like munching tic-tacs.
I wanted to climb and run freely, but you will only climb if there is a yellow rope or some yellow paint, and nothing else. And the time you have to react is unforgiving.
It is soooo stiff

And then I start to think about the world building, and I barely believe that with bows and arrows you would be able to destroy a machine like these, even more when they kind of destroyed civilization !
The girl that was thrown out of the village without a right to even talk to anyone, just climbs to the highest rank of warrior.
She and only she can hack into machines
She learnt to read the alphabet ?
There is a desert at walking distance from a jungle and a winter area.

I wanted to like this game so much, but there is nothing to do. I end up having fun the first 10 minutes and be frustrated the rest of my playtime.
I also want to finish at least the main story but more and more time opens up between two sessions, so I need to get used to the controls again, and it reminds me how stiff they are etc etc.

So no, I cannot recommend this game, even though it really makes me sad.
-----------------------

After 10 more hours of gameplay, new problems come and hit me. 
This is an example of a boring open world. Missions are too far from each other, and if there is a fast travel spot, there is no reason to go across the map on the back of a robot, or walking. So since the map is big, to ""encourage you"" to visit, they placed random collectibles and event missions. I am not curious about what I may find.

Then another example of why I do not believe the world building. I told about jungle, desert, forest and icy mountains all being at walking range, but i forgot to mention: during the entire game you will be hunting animals and picking flowers. So you will be astonished to find the forest poppy, the iced mountain poppy, the desert poppy, and the jungle poppy. Those plants are often eaten by the forest turkey, the iced mountain turkey, the desert turkey, and the jungle turkey. There is a very low diversity, and there is no exclusivity or even skin variation.

I can play on the higher graphics (with no changes to my PC since original review) with no problems. The game play and story are amazing and while i think some things and aspects could be better explained (what each icon for weapons means/ how upgrades effect overall stuff) the game is amazing and ive been super into the stories its telling. I have been following a side mission quest and am baffled because its not the main mission but it gives so much depth to characters and the world


So i had bought horizon zero dawn, with the initial intent to TRY and stream it, i know people had problems with it previously but i had above recommended settings so i thought i would be fine.......... wrong it took literally almost 30 minutes to auto-optimize and start up, even the second time after i had made it to the main menu and the whole maybe 30 minutes i actually got to play the game it still stuttered, i tried dropping all setting to low and then to  the ""favor performance setting"" and it STILL stuttered and would lag behind if there was too much happening in the scene, i double checked the ""minimum"" and ""recommended"" settings for this before i bought because i heard it was a rough game to play but even having a better gpu and cpu then recommended its still functionally unplayable because even getting through the simple tutorial and cutscenes it wasn't running right. I'm trying to get a refund on steam since i still have less than 2hr total play time but also means a third attempt today just cant happen because those intro auto-config screens took up SOOO much time.

GOOD:
_ Graphic is not enough comparing to masters such as Red dead 2 but it's enough to deliver the whole point, atmosphere.
_ Story is the most competitive edge of the game. It's cleverly written by, at first, creating a confusing world mixed up with real and cyber animals, tribes with technology, then revealing one by one mysteries. Character development is tented to very well and careful. No one is coming up with fancy story but step by step everything is built up slow enough to enjoy but fast enough to be thrilling.

NOT GOOD ENOUGH:
_ This could not be consider as ""bad"" point, but disappointing. While I'm enjoying the game so much, plus it's open world, sadly I have to say replaying the game is kind of not so interesting, though I still made it to completing New Game +
_ The enemies are quite, easily to be predicted. Anywhere anytime you have a good spot to cover around and make your shots, they are helpless. Trust me even the big-arse Thunderjaw, reckless Fireclaw/Frostclaw, or even deadly Rockbreaker are hopeless when you triple arm, aim shoot, hide around, then repeat till they dead.

Two days in a row. I felt bad about not playing AC Valhalla but this is the perfect game to fill in the void. Everything from the characters to the story itself were so well crafted I never found myself going along the main path just for the progress, but to also see where it takes me. I really love this game, for sure. So instead I'm dedicating this review to all the things I disliked about the game, but  it wasn't necessarily easy.

By far the most disorienting thing about the game are some of the settings, or rather, what it lacks in them. You see, there's a kind of ""Dynamic camera"" that follows Aloy, the main character around. So if you walk to the right, the camera pans to the left. If you go to the left, the opposite happens. It'd be fine if you could disable it, as it's not what I'm used to and I think it's a poor design choice. So instead I needed to download a mod from GitHub to fix it. Similarily, there's no option to disable hints. Even when you're at level 30, half-way to max, the game'll say to press G to highlight the track. Or if you run out of inventory space it'll still remind you that you can discard the excess. Why in a game with so much polish have these things been overlooked? Still, a minor issue.

The other thing I found to be somewhat poorly made was the skill tree, or rather, the unlockable skills themselves. In a game where you defeat monsters to harvest parts to make arrows, why isn't there an ""auto-loot"" skill for the most basic resources? Why isn't there a skill to pick herbs up faster, since that's what you're constantly doing? The worst offender by far, is a skill the game *does* have, the ""Dodge Prowess"" skill. Before acquiring the skill Aloy could do rolls back-to-back as a form of speeding up sneaking and being more efficient. But with the skill, the whole system is completely redone with Aloy being limited to a roll every few seconds? Why? As someone who snuck around the entire game this was especially infuriating, Before I could get around an area with some quick rolls, but with the skill which is required to unlock at some point, I was no longer able to do that. Rolling just seemed redundant at that point. There's also some skills I never wound up using, too. For instance, the ""Strike from below"" skill that lets you kill an enemy from a ledge above you is never used in the game, or at least I never encountered a chance to use it. I just feel like they should've put some more thought into the skills, is all. 

Now for the more nitpicky stuff. For one, I never used traps. Even in the one quest where the giver says ""some traps would be nice"" in a passive aggressive tone, I didn't use a single one. Why would you want to use a tool that alerts others, when using your stealth attack is more efficient and doesn't draw attention? The only time I did use a trap, was in the tutorial. Other than that they're really only good for selling to merchants, at least is what I thought of them.

The other thing that got annoying over the hours was the menu music. Every time you open your map, inventory, quest book or statistics, the same track gets played. It's this nice tribal(ish) song that starts off with a woman vocalizing. So when you want to see where to go, or what to do, that one specific note from that one woman gets nailed into your skull. It almost made me want to use the menu less because of it, and maybe subconsciously I did. Apparently a lot of people like the song, but I personally disliked it. 

The game also discouraged hoarding resources, especially in the late game. You can fit a lot of stuff in your inventory, but at a certain point it's no longer manageable. I was constantly barraged by red names implying my inventory was full. But as a natural hoarder in games like these, I couldn't help but manually make more room each time it happened. Maybe this issue could've been tackled better, but I don't know. It's fairly player-specific. 

One last thing is that the game can be fairly hand holding at times, but not enough to be irritating. Sometimes when you jump to catch a handhold on a cliff, Aloy will instead stop dead in her tracks mid-air to grab the lowest possible thing, because that's what the devs wanted. Even though she could very well have made the jump to the higher thing. Similarly there's situations where Aloy needs to jump a gap, but instead of landing it like by all means it looked like she could've, her trajectory changes dramatically to grab the ledge.

That's all to say, the game's near perfection. The voice acting is bar none, and the facial animations especially makes the game look very realistic. Even without playing the game on the Highest settings due to performance reasons, the game still looks fantastic. And aside from all the bad things I said about it I think it's one of the better Open-World games there are. There were times I would see a new enemy so big, I couldn't believe the size of it. And hours later I'd discover I could not only kill them, but also tame them? As a perfectionist I can also appreciate how some things could be ignored for the 100% steam completion. Not all the little collectibles needed to be found, and those that did have an achievement tied to it had in-game maps to determine their location. The game is just very good at what it does, and you should play it if you're at all interested.

Here's hoping Forbidden West comes to PC as well.

I have been wanting to play this game for so long since it was released on ps4 but sadly I did not have one. Finally I had the opportunity to play this [strike] but the games performance and crashing situation make this a very difficult game to enjoy on PC. It breaks immersion sometimes and can be a little frustrating, however I am changing my review to recommended as I have played an additional 22 hours now without any crashes. [/strike] Awesome game with a killer story and incredible combat.

[list]
List of problems especially the first point as I have not seen it discussed here yet:
[*]  [strike] 1. Sound? I don't know how to describe the voices but something is off, no surround sound maybe? its all very FLAT which is disappointing considering the amazing detail and character development that I have seen in the first few hours.  [/strike]
[*] [strike] 2. Crashing Obviously, only played a few hours and have crashed for the 6th time now as i am writing this. [/strike]
[*]  [strike] 3. Performance, now for whatever reason the game runs better for me in borderless fullscreen. In fullscreen no matter the graphic settings I am stuck at 41fps? how is that a thing? I have changed everything I can to try to balance performance/quality and at benchmark i get 61fps, however in game i can hardly stay over 50fps... that just errrr.. EDIT: Still having a hard time keeping frames up hopefully they will optimize soon.  [/strike]
[*]4. [strike] Keyboard SLOW WALK, there is a binding to set your run/walk however half the time she will just start to run again without me pressing anything and then back to walking speed. Obviously just a little thing that bugs me but I noticed in as soon as i started this game as I wanted to enjoy the environments. Figured out this happens when pressing ""A"" and ""W"" together.  [/strike]
[/list]
TLDR:  [strike] Port has issues with lots of crashing, bad performance, and glitches, wait for updates to fix the issue before buying. Or pick it up now but be wary that these issues may still run amok with you. Sadly I will be putting this down until it is fixed so I can enjoy this game the way it was intended to be played. Obviously I have played and have enjoyed it so far now, however i still hope for further improvements. If i could change recommendation to a ""not sure"" I would.  [/strike] Pick it up now, it is well worth your time!

It was on the PlayStation 4 Pro, but I could not help myself and also purchased the PC version. I do not say it often, but Horizon really left an impression – I might actually love the games. Therefore, I wanted more great Horizon at more frames than the PS4’s 30 fps. As a nice bonus, it also looked better.

To quote my [url=http://the-codeslinger.com/2022/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4-pro]own in-depth review of the PS4 version[/url]:

[quote]Horizon Zero Dawn has one of the most beautiful worlds and world-lore ever conceived. The period that the authors cover is mind-blowing. Never has an apocalypse, the events that lead up to it, and what happened afterward been stretched so far apart as in Horizon Zero Dawn. It is called a post-post-apocalypse scenario for a reason.[/quote]

While Zero Dawn might be “just another Open World Action Adventure”, it has its own charm in a very compelling world.
When I came to the PC version, most of the kinks had already been ironed out. Horizon Zero Dawn played very nicely, and the addition of DLSS even afforded my 3060 an almost-high-fps experience at 1440p. The game also seamlessly switched between keyboard + mouse and gamepads. It even differentiated between Xbox and PlayStation controllers by adapting the on-screen icons. Nice attention to detail.

I watched a playthrough on YouTube when it came out and did not yet have a PlayStation. Then I played it on my own PlayStation several years later and, to top it off, finished it once again on PC. I think it is safe to say that I recommend Horizon Zero Dawn.

Combat in Horizon Zero Dawn is an absolute delight. Aloy's use of her trusty bow and a variety of ingenious traps to take down the mechanized creatures is an adrenaline-pumping experience. Each encounter feels strategic, requiring players to study enemy patterns and weaknesses. The thrill of bringing down a colossal mechanical beast with well-placed shots is unparalleled, making every battle a truly memorable feat.

Beyond its captivating story and engrossing combat, Horizon Zero Dawn boasts an impressive array of side quests and activities that enhance the overall gameplay experience. Whether it's unraveling mysteries, aiding the locals, or discovering ancient relics, each side quest adds depth and context to the world, making it feel alive and dynamic.

The combat is also great, with movement playing a huge role in surviving, as well as stealth.

Some of the controls are a big annoying, game play it's a bit slow in the beginning and get yeah, used to running... but that is about all that I can say negative.

This is a Very Beautiful and Very Well Made Assassins Creed style game, but with much simplified climbing.
The combat in this game is unlike most any other game I have played.  It's was very weird to get used to the fact I can't just tank n spank the mobs.  It actually makes you use all of your skill and weapons to get through the battles.  A very refreshing feeling once you get it down, but still challenging as you progress.
I purchased during the summer sale and is well worth the price I paid.

Oh, and Aloy, yes Aloy... It is nice to have a female protagonist :D

One more thing... Drop your healing potions :-)

The game itself is ""good"". It's big, it's fairly open, it's diverse in it's enemy types, the story is acceptable, the difficulty is, generally, the right fit.

My key issues are that Horizon feels like it would like to be open world Soulslike but then it uses a female protagonist and it feels odd because of it. Aloy is a wonderful character and I LOVE her red bobbing hair twirling in the wind as I scale massive robot creatures. That red hair tells you everything you need to know about her, she's fiery, she's hard headed, she's tough... but on the same token it just feels weird that a 150 pound female character should have a slow, undexterous fighting style. I feel like she should be witty, fast, quick, like a shadow in the weeds and combat just doesn't do that. That disconnect pulls me out of the immersion for the rest of the game.

I understand that won't bother some people (and I plan to finish this game anyway) so I've given the game a thumbs up but... they really missed an opportunity here creating a gameplay style that mirrored Souls but also gave it it's own flare and it just doesn't do that.",1689613933,1689613933,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I came into this game blind wanting to experience the game without any prior knowledge. I had a blast with the story and I really loved some of the combat engagements. The visuals took me by surprise and was blown away. I can really say I got hooked later in the game and it was an amazing game to experience.  But this game felt incomplete and it falls flat from perfection due to lots of bugs, poor immersion, cramped environments, annoying movement in dialogue, issues in cut scenes and the list can go on. I chose to look past the issues to continue to experience the game. I upgraded my monitor and graphics card to play game on high refresh and ultra graphics. I recommend you play this at peak quality or the other issues will drag you through. I knew how great this game would end so I pressed on to see it through. This is a great game and I hope you take the time to experience at its max or else I would wait till HZD2.

Story:  I'll address my first issue and go on from there. Its confusing for the first bit of the game and I don’t know why but it did not grip me for the first few hours of the game.. IT GOT BETTER. That's what ill tell people when I talk about it. It sums up later, and it wraps up greatly! BUT. It isnt great at the beginning. 
Beyond the game's beginning, what gets you hooked (for me especially) ""what happened before now"" what was the then, what is the now. So many questions as the game gives you GREAT questions to ask and the slow roll of info and answers as you progress the game is so satisfying. 
The little text stories you can discover, and the little audio stories are Awesome! It was a little touch of feeling instead of a fact, or the game telling you what is going on. its just a feeling you'd get by awesome voice actors throughout the game that really added to the atmosphere. Bravo. 

Visuals: WOW! AMAZING! Characters look good! The scenery looks AMAZING! The shadows are killer! The creatures are so well designed it is a shame we cant just get some time to admire them, some high quality slow shots would be amazing for some of the creatures. But the game is truly beautiful. The areas are so well thought out and designed. 
Talking about it for me wouldn’t do it any justice so this is a game that I recommend you experience and that can be said for a lot of games.

Game play: great game play, I enjoy the rouge like hiding and killing this game has to offer. The skirmishes were enjoyably difficult and there are plenty of resources to play around with. This game very much caters to how you play the game your way. If you want to fight straight up, go for it. If you want to sneak around assassinating everyone, go for it. Do you want to setup traps and have the advantage? We got you. How about sneak past the enemy ""cause fk that shit"", we go you covered there too. 
There are lots of ways to play the game I applaud that. This is great to see for players to feel like what they want to do in the world is an option.

Open World: The game is vastly open world, it has a lot to offer but there was too much to deal with to really appreciate it. 
There are times where I felt that the game was pretty cramped. There was so much space but you could be having a tough battle and walk into another group across the ravine or hill. Then it isnt just a battle of 3 specific enemies its become a fight for survival as you're chased 1 v 10. also there would be animals posted up in spots just to fill a hole it felt like. 
There are a lot you can cheese, ill admit there were a few times I decided to cheese and go around cause it was way too tough to not go around (And not sneak by I mean I climbed the hill where I shouldn’t have been able to get to, to get around). There is allot of that available. Rocks you shouldn’t be able to climb up or down, but it is what it is, it doesn’t ruin the game entirely 

People in the world: the characters are great, the npc's are poor and clunky. Which isnt a deal breaker, youre the main character so who gives a shit about the random towns folk or whatever. I don’t care but as they're apart of the atmosphere and environment so they account for something. My problem is their uselessness as teammates or guards. They really just useful distractions against enemies but nothing else. 

Immersion: there was a disconnect for me at the start where you as a player to charater have to learn what they know and overcome the skills to do so. Climbing isnt a challenge at all which was unfortunate. People and merchants are posted up in random spots sometimes. 
There are wild aggressive animals right out the gate in your own land, it just didn’t seem to add up. What they were there for to warm you up about the creatures but they did not fit the atmosphere. You ask questions like ""how is this even possible"", ""why is this here"", ""how would you have tribes and cities running around or merchants trading with enemies on your front lawn""… constantly.

issues 
- the sound in cut scenes at the end of the game were switching from my speaker and then my headphones while the audio was set to headphones. lucky i didn't miss the ending with no sound.
- refresh rate drops during cut scenes which was a bummer 
- people falling out of the map which is crazy 
- the head nodding and eye twitching in dialogue pulls the immersion right out of the game unfortunately.
- finishing the bandit camps would automatically reset you for no reason. (Let me light the fire and then reset the camp plz)
- right after fast traveling to campfire you could recive agro from nearby creatures. 
- The level gap between creatures is not evenly placed as you try to progress the story, you could run into some hard fights easily, now add other creatures nearby and you got a shitstorm to deal with.
- beyond the cut scenes there were lots of audio issues, hearing creatures not there, not hearing sound effects just empty noise. There was lots.
-no banking system to store mods or resources, I constantly had to break things down to make space as my bags would fill and there was no more bag upgrades.",1689529070,1689529070,False,3,0,0.50043034553527832,0,True,False,False

This is a super pretty game with some obviously super pretty graphics to go along with. The story starts out very strong and heartfelt but as you go along gets a little more tedious. I am giving it a thumbs up because for me it works but some things that others might be skeptical of I will list. 80% of the game is clearing an area of what kind of robot prowls the area. Clearing area tasks soothe me so I am ok with it but there were even points where I was like my God does it fricking end. The remaining 20% of the game was some pretty good story telling. The tracking on the eyes is super weird. Everyone looks like they have tourette's with their eye movement and it is super weird. There were also areas where FPS sat at 90 or so but would still experience some pretty severe frame stuttering. I didn't see FPS drops so I am not sure why the frames stuttered. Every NPC minus a few looks the same which is a little immersion breaking. In my opinion, the game would have done better to be smaller and have less clearing of a robot exists here and added more content. When I didn't have a career, I would have been ok to run around endlessly clearing areas with nothing it in but now I barely get the time to play so content over area in my opinion wins.

Prepare your eyeballs for a visual feast! The graphics in this game are absolutely mind-blowing. Seriously, they should come with a warning label: ""May cause temporary loss of speech due to excessive jaw-dropping."" But wait, there's a catch! While the visuals will make your eyes go all heart-eyed emoji, the game itself plays it safe. Yup, it's like that guy who wears a suit to a costume party - no risks, no surprises.

Combat mechanics, oh boy, they're as solid as a rock. You'll need the reflexes of a cheetah and the strategic mind of a chess grandmaster to survive in this mechanized zoo. But don't get too attached to the action because guess what? The gameplay loop becomes as repetitive as your alarm clock every morning. Snooze fest!

Now, the story. Brace yourself for a mind-bending blend of ancient civilizations and futuristic tech. It's like Indiana Jones meets The Terminator, except with fewer whip-cracking cyborgs. The premise is intriguing, no doubt about that. But hold on tight, because some of those side quests are as shallow as a puddle after a light drizzle. Who needs depth, right?

Let's talk about the open-world, shall we? It's vast, expansive, and... as interactive as a museum exhibit. Don't expect to dig through every nook and cranny, because most of them are just for show. And don't even get me started on the user interface. It's about as user-friendly as a Rubik's Cube in the hands of a three-toed sloth. Good luck navigating that mess!

So, to sum it all up, Horizon Zero Dawn is like a reliable family sedan. It'll get you from point A to point B without much trouble, but it won't set your heart on fire or make you question the meaning of life. It's a safe bet for those who enjoy open-world adventures and want their retinas massaged by stunning visuals. But don't expect it to leave a lasting impact or make you reconsider your existence.

In the wise words of the great Dunkey, it's a market-tested, risk-averse product that most people will enjoy, but only a select few will truly love or absolutely despise.

[h1]게임 초보들도 쉽게 입문할 수 있는 대작[/h1]

Horizon Zero Dawn은 지금으로부터 머나먼 미래를 배경으로, 노라 부족의 아이, Aloy를 중심으로 하여 펼쳐지는 오픈 월드 RPG 게임입니다. 게임 속에는 각종 기계 동물들이 등장하는데, 사람들은 이들을 사냥하며 살아갑니다. 주인공 Aloy가 이 아름답고 신비로운 세계를 탐험하고 파헤치는 것이 이 게임의 주요 스토리입니다.

액션이나 전반적인 게임의 틀은 몬스터 헌터 시리즈나 다크 소울 등의 게임보다는 파 크라이 내지는 유비소프트 식 오픈 월드 게임에 가까운 형태를 지니고 있습니다. 경험치를 쌓아 레벨업을 하면 받는 스킬 포인트로 여러 가지 능력들을 해금하는 식입니다. 기본적으로 활이 많이 쓰이나, 폭탄, 덫, 구속용 로프, 특수한 화살 등등 가지각색의 무기를 사용할 수 있어 다양한 상황에 유연하게 대처할 수 있습니다. 더하여 액션 게임 초보자, 입문자들을 위해 내러티브에 집중할 수 있도록 스토리 난이도 설정도 가능하게 되어 있습니다. 조작 자체는 어려운 편은 아니나, 키보드+마우스 유저인데 조작이 불편하다면 일부 설정을 자기에게 맞도록 바꾸는 것을 추천드립니다.


좋았던 점:
[list]
[*][b]먼 미래, 포스트 아포칼립스 배경[/b]
최첨단 슈트 대신 털실, 가죽을 짜맞춘 의복과 기계 조각 장식. 레이저가 나가는 총과 광선검 대신 활, 창, 새총 등으로 전투하는 사람들. 마천루와 네온 사인 대신 나무, 벽돌로 만든 가옥... 그야말로 부족을 이루며 살던 원시 시대로 퇴보한 인류의 모습을 보여주며, 그럼에도 기계 동물이 있다는 차이점이 이 게임의 배경을 특별하게, 궁금하게, 흥미롭게 만들어 줍니다. 

[*][b]액션 장르에 익숙하지 않은 사람들을 배려해주는 시스템[/b]
초심자들을 위한 난이도 설정은 물론이고, 맵 여기저기에 사냥을 연습할 수 있는 장소들이 마련되어 있습니다. 새로운 무기를 얻으면 튜토리얼 퀘스트를 통해 사용법을 익히는 것도 가능합니다. 전투 중 사망하더라도 패널티가 없으며, 스태미나 또한 아예 존재하지 않아 타 액션 게임에 비해 제약이 적습니다.

[*][b]내러티브가 전개되는 방식[/b]
스토리를 대놓고 읊어주거나, 지나치게 잘게 쪼개어 놓지도 않았습니다. 딱 그 중간이며, 큰 가닥은 잡아주면서 세부 정보를 편린의 형태로 제공합니다. 게임 내내 혼란스럽지 않았고, 주인공의 목적도 확실했으며, 정보의 파편들을 습득해 여러 가지 내용을 유추하는 재미가 있었습니다. 

[*][b]사냥의 다양한 선택지 및 직관적인 전투 시스템[/b] 
여러 가지의 무기를 사용할 수 있고, 전투 중에도 바꿔가며 수렵할 수 있습니다. 또한 특수 무기나 잠입 등의 능력을 활용해 상황에 맞게 다양한 플레이를 선택할 수 있습니다. 또한 슬라이딩, 점프 중일 때 원거리 무기를 조준하면 슬로우가 걸리면서 액션의 쾌감을 한층 높여줍니다. 적들의 약점과 급소를 쉽게 파악할 수 있고, 각종 속성과 도구를 적극적으로 활용하도록 유도합니다.

[*][b]숨 막히는 절경[/b]
개인적으로 가장 좋았던 부분 중 하나로, 그래픽이 단순히 좋은 것을 떠나 세계가 아름답게 만들어져 있습니다. 맵도 작은 편이 아니며, 다양한 생태계를 지니고 있어 눈이 즐거운 탐험을 경험할 수 있습니다. 사진을 예쁘게 찍을 수 있도록 Photo Mode에서 심도, 밝기, 기울기, 시간 설정 등 다양한 옵션 또한 제공합니다. 평소 스크린샷에 관심이 없는 사람이라도 F12에서 손을 떼지 못하실 겁니다.

[*][b] 탐험을 유도하는 수집 요소들[/b]
오픈 월드에 빠지면 섭섭한 요소들로, 특출난 보상은 주지 않지만 이곳저곳 탐험할 수 있도록 유도합니다. 이렇게 찾는 수집 요소들의 설명도 흥미로운 읽을거리와 상상해보는 재미를 제공합니다.

[*][b]입체적인 캐릭터들이 만드는 흡입력[/b]
스토리가 진행되면서 주인공은 물론이고 NPC 캐릭터들도 대사, 행동 등에서 변화하는 것을 볼 수 있으며, 많은 주요 인물들이 다양하고 입체적인 모습을 보여줍니다. 주인공 Aloy도 강인한 신체와 정신을 소유하고 있지만, 여러 고난과 역경을 겪고 비밀들을 헤쳐나가며 감정적으로 흔들리기도 하는 등, 만능이 아닌 주인공이라는 설정이 더 와닿았습니다. 더하여 특정 상황에서 Aloy가 어떻게 대답할지를 플레이어가 정할 수 있으며, 이를 통해 스토리에 빠져들 수 있는 몰입감을 제공합니다.[/list]


아쉬웠던 점:
[list]
[*][b]게임을 루즈하게 만드는 사이드 퀘스트[/b]
메인 스토리 자체는 아주 흥미진진하고 재미있었는데, 사이드 퀘스트가 상당히 많은 편입니다. 저는 메인을 밀기 전에 그 지역의 사이드 퀘스트를 다 끝내 놓는 식으로 진행했는데, 중후반부에 들어서면서 슬슬 지친다는 느낌을 받았습니다. 그나마 다행인 것은 지쳐갈 때 즈음 더 이상의 사이드 퀘스트가 없었다는 점입니다.

[*][b]어려운 초반부와 쉬운 중후반부[/b]
적들의 약점을 알기 쉽다는 장점은 후반부에 들어서면 새로운 자극이 없다는 것과도 일맥상통합니다. 후반에 특별한 적이나 변이한 개체 등등 새로운 형태가 추가되어 변화를 주었다면 조금 더 흥미진진한 전투를 해볼 수 있었을 것입니다. 

[*][b]어중간한 스펙으로는 어림없는 그래픽[/b]
그래픽이 수려하다는 말은 거꾸로 하드웨어의 성능을 상당히 요구한다는 말도 됩니다. 이 게임의 가장 큰 적은 제 컨트롤이 아니라 뚝뚝 끊기는 프레임이었습니다. 제일 낮은 그래픽 설정에서도 버벅이면서 힘들어하는 컴퓨터를 보며 언젠가 새롭게 PC를 장만하면 다시 처음부터 해봐야겠다고 다짐하고 있습니다.

[*][b]오픈 월드를 표방한 게임치고 부족한 상호작용[/b]
맵 상에서 할 수 있는 상호작용은 NPC에게 말 걸기, 적 때려잡기, 약초 등 파밍하기 정도 뿐입니다. 이는 GTA 등 자유도가 아주 높은 오픈월드보다는 엘든 링의 그것과 조금 더 흡사한 형태입니다. 주인공이 무엇을 하든 스토리는 선형적이며 (메인, 서브 모두 포함) 주인공의 선택에 따라 퀘스트의 흐름이 달라지거나 하지는 않습니다.[/list]

[h1]마치며[/h1]
Horizon Zero Dawn은 여태 해 본 오픈월드 게임 중 세 손가락 안에 꼽을 만한 수작입니다. 게임 내 시스템, 맵 구조, 스토리 전달 방식 등에서 개발진들의 고민과 배려를 엿볼 수 있었습니다. 액션의 재미, 스토리의 몰입감, 섬세한 감정선, 눈이 즐거운 황홀경. 그 모든 것을 사로잡은 훌륭한 게임으로서, 추천할 가치가 차고 넘칩니다. 오히려 세일할 때 구입한 것이 미안할 정도로요.

Although the gameplay is very different from others (as there is a big focus on archery and stealth, while melee combat is not really useful), the storyline makes up for it. 

The protagonist (Aloy) lives in a post-apocalpytic world where killer-machines roam the planet, while tribal villages try and survive. During the game, Aloy will embark on a journey where she searches for her own origins, the origins of the machines and what happened that caused the apocalypse. 

The graphics are stunning and probably the best graphics of any game I've ever played. 

The only negative thing I have to say about this game, is that most of the side-characters are very one-dimensional, and aren't that interesting. Just a couple of characters (including Aloy) are interesting and have a variety of motivations and intentions, but a lot of 'main story'-side characters are just boring. I wish they'd delve a bit deeper into the side-characters and have a series of quests where Aloy is WITH the side characters, not just doing a job for the side character. More dialogue between them, more cutscenes, etc. would make it more interesting.

Story is uninteresting.
You can buy shard lootboxes in game for some reason.
Finished ammo is cheaper to buy than components.
Platforming dungeons (with enemies and a miniboss) with no checkpoints. (you will die trying to jump onto something you think is accessible but is actually not and spend the next 20 minutes redoing it).
Your epic bluetooth chirper with super-bionics actually tells you nothing about enemies. You will be opening up the journal to read about what parts of the body you're supposed to explode with what arrows in what order, what their elemental weaknesses are, etc.

I've played 15hrs or so and I feel no compulsion to keep playing. While this is a fine-looking game, the NPCs are not and there is a lot of dialogue. Feels incredibly generic, the video-game equivalent of Terra Nova. 

The main character is boring and has an axe to grind because she's the chosen bastard. The game refuses to let you talk to and humanize your surrogate dad (who has a weird face model) for no good reason. Not a single character you meet will move you in any way. I wanted to choose an evil option on sidequests but even though you're an outcast and rebel you're a goody-two-shoes.

In the first real quest (too late for you to refund the game) [spoiler] literally every named character you know except the priestess is killed off in an ambush. But you do not care because you have never gotten to know any of them. Worse than Cyberpunk 2077 into main quest. [/spoiler]

You think, story-on-the-backburner I'll go play the open world. Wrong. Hunting monsters in this game is about as fun as combat in Gothic 3. You spam traps and bombs because you're playing on the highest difficulty and stealth-kill weak mobs and kite.

Compared to many other console games very well adapted to pc, innovative and often challenging combat style, easy to grasp levelling and crafting system, satisfying skill tree, relatively balanced economy system. I didn't have to consult the wiki for at least the first half of the game, which is rare, because most things are well explained or even intuitive. Above all a great story which is not at all unlikely, even has a very good chance to become true if humanity goes on like it does. We won't be around to verify that, though. I really hope the sequel comes to pc soon, because the game ends with a cliffhanger (after the credits) that looks promising, and I'm really curious how the writers will convince us why it's worth fighting for to save humankind.

The game feels like it was created to be an PRG with an epic scope with some Bioware style stereotypes: you start in a small house as a nobody, but then become a part of an ancient/dead/rare order after your foster parent dies (not really a spoiler). You then go into the world, becoming well known for your deeds, you enter the largest city in the kingdom/realm, meet the king, work for him, eventually vanquishing the great evil and becoming a legend. Except you do not care for anyone or anything, since the RPG parts in this supposedly RPG game are completely throwaway and mean nothing. It tries to be a good Bioware RPG with none of the charm, none of the characters, none of the story.
Character progression is a bit better than Far Cry New Dawn. Yes, it's that basic.

Storywise:[list]
[*]Aloy herself comes off as rude at times, but generally just 'meh'. Sometimes she's an insufferable, stuck up b*tch. She's just a horrible person. Additionally, she comments on the most obvious situations, as if the player was blind and deaf.
[*]The story, like the rest of the game, starts off strong, but becomes very boring very quickly with glacial pacing and throwaway side quests.
[*]The lore? The writers tried really, really hard to flesh out the world with tons and tons and tons of collectibles with pages and pages and pages of text. None of it is engaging. The lore should be interwoven into side quests and main quests. The codex pages should have been only an addition, if you wanted to learn more. But in Horizon Zero Dawn collectibles are basically the only way of learning any details about the setting. You can ask a few NPCs this and that, but that isn't engaging as well.
[*]The dialogue wheel is just there to be there. Very few meaningful choices can be made and the NPCs do not acknowledge quests that have been finished before you encountered the quest-giver.[/list]

My biggest gripes concerning the story:[spoiler][list]
[*]The antagonist is present in 3 quests of the entire main questline: once at the beginning of the game and then at the very end. I literally forgot about him up until that point. 
[*]What the Zero Dawn project was, is probably the only good mission with actually interesting lore, but it's not something sci-fi hasn't done dozens of times.
[*]Elizabeth Sobeck is a literal Jesus figure, saved the world twice, and then sacrificed her life (with a sad violin and singing in the background no less). She had no negative personality traits. Perfect Mary Sue in every possible way.
[*]This makes Aloy a clone of Jesus. At least she's an a*shole, so she's not THAT perfect.
[*]Ted Faro is a one dimensional, irredeemable dumbass. How this man became a trillionaire by creating, and heading, such a powerful corporation, is beyond my understanding. While Elizabeth saved humanity twice, he doomed it twice. When he purged Apollo it was so farcical, so comically blind, it appeared as if it was created just to make Faro even more of a complete idiot.[/list]
I'm genuinely baffled how the writers thought both Sobeck and Faro are good characters. It's comedic. It's so bad, this alone made me want to give HZD a Not Recommended.

Come to think of it, Elizabeth is better than Jesus: he saved the world only once, she did it twice, thrice if you count the sacrifice. She is a superhero, not a human. One good thing about her: even though it's the same person, she's very well acted in comparison to Aloy. Don't ask me why that is.
[/spoiler]

Gameplay:
It's a stereotypical Ubisoft-like open world game. Tedious. The combat and stealth are unique in that regard, but those also become old fast. Combat is basically dodge-shoot weakpoint-dodge-shoot weakpoint against machines and headshot extravaganza against humans. Stealth is tuned for large areas and distances against beasts, whereas small and packed human camps cause you to become spotted nearly instantly... until you gain the best stealth armor equipped with the best stealth mods at which point you are nearly invisible as if it was Skyrim with Sneak at 100. Also, the fact it's all line of sight and hiding place (e.g. tall grass) based, means you will get easily noticed even in pitch black rooms.
However, despite all of these issues, combat against machines is the best part of Horizon Zero Dawn. It took me a long while to finish the story, because I was doing all the side quests and activities concerning combat.

Other thoughts:[list]
[*]The game looks absolutely gorgeous, downright beautiful.
[*]You will be spending much of your time gathering plants (especially for your medicine pouch) and meat. Yes, it becomes extremely tedious lightning fast.
[*]You can only climb at specific spots and it's even more braindead than Assassin's Creed. What's worse, the jumps are often predetermined, i.e. Aloy will inexplicably jump noticeably further or closer just to match the specific point she is scripted to grab.
[*]The silent takedowns against humans look very slow and clumsy.
[*]The mounts are behaving somewhat realistically, making them awkward and clumsy to ride on.
[*]The takedown from above sometimes only has a split second prompt making it really hard to use against fast targets.
[*]There is no method of quick switching outfits, even though there are separate outfits for stealth, melee resistance, ranged resistance, elemental resistance etc., and you can switch between them manually during combat, which means it is encouraged to do so depending on the type of enemy you face.[/list]

To sum up, it's a good time waster, to play an hour or two a day. But a game to be remembered? Not really, no. HZD has an interesting setting, but fails to use it properly, the backstory/lore is only ok, and the main plot is formulaic. Good for a single playthrough and never touch it again affair.

Positive things :
- Good atmosphere
- Good plot and captiving story
- Some really good and emotional moments
- Meaningful strong woman character as a heroin

Some problems : 
- sandalously low amount of side quests, poor quality of side quests in general
- Tastless ecosystems designs, a lot of elements like plants and wildlife is designed with a lack of knowledge about natural environment; They were too lazy to design more than 10 animals to populate jungle, desert or mountains; No bear? No snakes? racoons in desert?
- mediocre item system
- too many waypoints sparkled on the map like chocolate chips
- Graphical optimisation is not good
- Failed attempts to create a deep and developped background with the lore, We follow the main quest line and the story relating to the past but almost no information about the present, just 1 or 2 quests to present each character.
- Some scenario choices are really poor and drasticaly damage the depth of the story
- The game ending bring you back to before achievinf the last quest, they didn't bother fixing that, even after the sucess of the game,
- Why the ********  king is randomly hugging a gard?

A game with good potential but poor delivery. If you really want to discover the story, go for it, but I do not recommand if you would like to get a great experience.",1688846583,1688853625,False,1,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Yes, you will need to lower your expectations from graphics to adjust the settings but at the beginning of the game, you can experience good quality of the world.

I did not however appreciate the inventory management, the weapon upgrade system and the at times slow transit between locations of value. As a golden rule an open world needs to provide a plethora of options far enough to allow for the player to feel safe, but never to be bored. At many an occasion I was doing stuff I considered tedious such as hunting specific animals to upgrade my satchel to carry slightly more arrows or what not. I feel like having to hold down the button to craft/dismantle/perform any operation made it feel even more boring. For its time this game was visually stunning, but it looks about the same as ghost recon wild-lands to me looking back. I definitely had fun playing this game, but don't buy it unless its on sale, the game-play while fun, and a good story. Cannot save an open world that isn't always eventful. For full price I would have wanted more. For example, ghost recon wild-lands, while having a terrible story, allows me to use vehicles such as helicopters to cover ground very quickly. I am rarely spending more than 15-30 seconds between locations if I target every item of value. This game does not share the ability to fly, which makes sense but at the same time. I do not see myself getting the full value of the game, as I lack the energy to explore every last corner.

Aloy navigates a world where she was an outcast and is now the symbol of her tribe - the Nora - and a symbol of hope for many of the other tribes also.  The mechanics of the game - which were refined for the excellent sequel - are at times clunky, however they do not detract to heavily from the excellent gameplay.  Combat is a mix of learning enemies patterns and attacks, while making sure equipment is upgraded and players make use of a skill tree to maintain an edge on enemies.  The story is post apocalyptic, but the world is far from barren and players can explore diverse biomes with unique creatures and challenges.

(The game is set in the future) you use a bow, spear, and a few other handy gadgets to trap, kill, and loot giant robot dinosaurs and sometimes humans. The gameplay and combat are pretty solid, and the story very interesting. There is a lot of dialogue In the game, which is good if you like getting in as much lore as possible.

This game took me a whole year to complete but it was worth every moment. It's a beautiful world to explore with awesome machines and combat I enjoyed the most compared every open-world game I've played. While I loved Aloy right away, many of the characters took time to grow on me but by the time I finished this game, I loved every single one of them. Be warned, the story started off a little slow but the more I advanced it, the more exciting it became, as I learned more and more about this fantastic universe, so I'm glad I continued to push through.

Before I bought this I wanted to have a look at some gameplay on YouTube; what I could expect, if it would be something for me. 

The game environment is what drew me in at first, when I scrolled through screenshots and trailers. But as I started watcing a taped playthrough the story got me instantly hooked. To be honest, I couldn't stop watching. I didn't. Which meant I now knew the whole story - beginning to end - before even having bought it or played myself. However, for someone like me who gets easily stressed in games where you hunt or are hunted, it sort of helped knowing everything going it. It didn't turn me off from buying it myself.

When I do play now I play for hours and hours. It's easily my favorite game. I spend time on main quests (despite knowing the story), take on side quests that I haven't seen anything of, foraging and just try to get better at taking out machines and various foes. I love that it has so many choices for difficulty, including a story focused mode. I absolutely love the world. It's breathtaking when it's at its best. And the story is fantastic.

Story: 9/10, was engaging but somethings were a bit stupid, but in a funny way. It did follow common story base but was still quite unique and enjoyable. Also nothing wrong with using common story bases because new does not always mean better. Usually quite the opposite. [spoiler] The common story base being a chosen one story [/spoiler].

 DLC: 8.5/10, was cool but there were only 3 or 4 new machines and none of them were ridable which was a bit saddening, especially because there weren't many ridable mounts to begin with. Besides that the story was good and the characters were fine, [spoiler] (wasn't attached to the characters so the death at the end wasn't very touching for me to be honest.) [/spoiler] but the ending was perfect. It was satisfying but still left so much room to be expanded on that makes me excited to play the second game. (Also bonus .5 because they had the voice of Yasuo as a character in the game. Totally threw me off at first but still happy that I noticed the voice.)

Quests: 9.5/10, most quests were quite easy and a good way of quick level ups to stay on level with the story. Wouldn't recommend doing all the quests you find though because I did the final main story mission 17 levels over the recommended level.

Open World: 9/10, the world wasn't spread with a ton of trash, and usually following the markers led to loot that often an upgrade to what I had. 

Main Character (Aloy): 9.5/10, the main character was perfect. The only reason its not 10/10 is because it seemed like none of the choices mattered which comes with pros and cons. Cons, they don't matter so it just seemed like a waste, was what I thought till I thought about it even more, which is where the pros come in. Pros, even thought the choices didn't matter, allowing to choose without consequence allowed me freedom to make the character understandable and like-able, it made the characters personality feel different depending on your choices, even though they weren't really effecting anything. Overall good character though, also hot.

This game was/is beautiful, the landscapes are diverse and graphically stunning. I had never heard of the game before and bought it on sale on a whim, and don't regret it.

The game definitely can challenge you especially if your trying to 100% it like I did on the hardest difficulty (as It is part of the 100% for the achievements), there's a few spots where I had to change my play style because of the harder difficulty as it's not like the lower ones -- stuff is much more expensive, you have no visual health bar, enemies have no visual health bar, they hit harder, and they respond super quickly to seeing you VS lower difficulties and you gotta get a creative a little bit to survive. the Ultra Hard difficulty wasn't too bad (I believe partially because I was already hugely stocked up on resources just because I'm like that which, Ironically helped me tremendously when I switched to Ultra as I didn't have to waste much any time gathering them) just took a little creativity compared to lower difficulties but wasn't impossible to do, and that's coming from someone who doesn't play games on the hardest settings, and I still found it enjoyable as hell (although more challenging in a great way)

Fighting the Grave Hoard Deathbringer in the facility on Ultra Hard Difficulty had me stuck at first because of the weapons it has do a lot of damage on that setting, and I found a minor tip to avoiding dying by watching a YouTube video, or else I wouldn't have been able to complete the game and would've been really frustrated. 
I used this to get past it (it does possibly take a few tries to get it, or else you fall to your death the deathbringer kills you and you have to retry like I did a few times) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S46KKRlS-qE

Overall it was a beautiful and wonderful game, challenging the right amount, fits all play styles, open world, various ways to kill enemies and makes you think a little bit outside the box on harder difficulties. The was the only issue I really ran into through 3 runs was fighting the Deathbringer on Ultra Hard at the Grave Hoard facility, besides that it was the normal challenge for the difficulty and working past it in different ways.

The game's world is one of the most beautifully realized I have ever explored in a game, in a style that I can only describe as ""artistic photorealism"". You could go anywhere, put the game into photo mode, and just gawk at how amazing everything looks.

The combat is also wonderfully satisfying, requiring you to literally break the pieces off of your enemies to defeat them.

But it suffers greatly from its worldbuilding, which is very overwhelming. There is so much lore to find, so many people to talk to, that you become lost and really don't even know where to start. And most of the side quests in the game can be distilled down to doing two things - talking to a person, or defeating enemies. There are no minigames, very few truly impactful dialogue choices... It's kind of disappointing.

I spent around 55 hours, in that time, I completed all main quests, side quests, errands, bandit camps, Tallnecks, and hunting grounds in the ""vanilla"" game, plus the main quest line and one additional side quest in The Frozen Wilds.

I recently bought it while on sale for my PC and the game is still fun but I've noticed more flaws in the game then I did when playing it through the first time. The game gets heavily repetitive in combat. After you get through the pro-log of the game the game doesn't slow down to build more into the world and in to your current levels. GRINDING is a MUST in this game. (unless you play it in story mode which then the game is overly easy and lackluster) in order to get levels fast you need to grind out side missions and hunting trials and randomly killing everything that moves. The game is not balanced for easy combat build up. You can and WILL be overwhelmed by the robot beast if you are not careful. the stealth element in the game is okay but the kill animations can get you noticed very easily by other creatures. Its easier to fight the humans than the beast. The AI isn't very smart and has the Metal Gear Solid style alert status. You can grind out levels fast if you use it to your advantage by exploiting some areas that wont clear until a specific task is executed. (The enemies with never run out but your supplies might) 

Overall I still enjoy the game and I'm waiting for the next one to get ported over to PC. I do however recommend to only get this game if you see it on sale for a decent % off.

The pros:
Being able to hit and run. so if I cannot take a machine down, I just get close enough to hit then run away.
being able to hide
the override feature is so useful, I do not have to fight
Story is captivating
the world is gorgeous
there is always a mystery
controls are easy to understand
I thought I would not like bow and arrow, but it is one of the best feature of this game
frame rate is so smooth on my 3060ti. it is well optimized
The shield weaver armor

Cons:
Hard to enjoy any other game after playing this one. Yes it is that good
Aloy takes a while to get up after getting hit
My man rost dying. I sobbed after that. (spoiler because I finished the game)
I got attached to the story. now any other game's lackluster story feels off

Horizon Zero Dawn is not a bad game per se, it's fluid, combat is paced, the story is... well... It is what it is, it's not served by a particularly stellar organization of missions, but it's still nice.

So... Well... It's... Grindy. The game is beautiful, but as a lot of open worlds, it's reaaaallly empty, it's basically endless lands with some villages here and there with nothing to see except vendors and quest givers, and then the rest is full of packs of the same types of monsters over and over again. You could have a map a fifth of the size of the map of the game and give the exact same content, three biomes, the monsters and go.

The combat at some point is just too much of the same, it's either stealth or bows/weapons, because melee will get you killed, and you cannot upgrade your spear until late in the game, so the damage is just lame compared to the other options, plus too much melee will get you swarmed and ... you guessed it, killed.

Some parts of the UI are not really well thought and some items are too difficult to handle and poor in comparison to other choices (potions and trap seem a bit hard to use and the UI really doesn't help).

The Level up system is nice but it fails to give either real choices or an actual change in the gameplay.

The plot is interesting---not quite compelling---and the side quests are mostly rewarding. A couple of NPCs have interesting and compelling arcs that happen in tandem to the PC's. In the 60-ish hours it took me to finish the game, there was only a little grind, and I found it largely rewarding.

Mediocre: the world is huge. to the point that exploration becomes a goal unto itself, which can be overwhelming in an open-world game like this. Most of the weapons and upgrades, skill tree, and armor mechanics feel ancillary---they're unnecessary and don't really contribute to gameplay. The economics of crafting and shopping are yet a hair worse. And combat and knowledge can be subtle. You can effectively complete the game without paying too much attention, spending time to stealth, etc (although combat becomes much quicker if you pay attention to your Focus' output).

Bad: many of the NPCs are flat and uninteresting, despite fascinating side-quests they send you on. You also are very much railroaded, despite the RPG-feel of the game: your choices broadly don't matter, making these elements feel useless. Also, combat doesn't really scale as you level---This was a very nice feature of e.g. AC:Od, but here, if you skip something until you are well past the ""recommended level"", it can be completely trivial (sometimes. There are some player-skill tasks that are at best eased by leveling, taking skill tree components, having the ""right"" armor/weapon/modifications).",1688271654,1688271654,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you're looking for a well-crafted open world game, you'd be better off with those previously mentioned; and if you wanted thoughtful speculative fiction about a post-climate change world, you'd look into Citizen Sleeper and In Other Waters.

The only thing Horizon does that's unique and a delight to behold are its enemies. They're lovingly animated, dynamic to fight, and depending on where you aim, and with what, the battle changes, as does your loot. You can snipe off a fuel canister from as machine, then leave without killing it; alternatively, you can target it with a flame arrow and set the machine on fire. There's a wee crab fella that carries a container on its back, and you can shoot it off, and, after fighting for a bit, the wee fella will just scuttle over to it, pick it back up, then try to leave.

Game's great! Not nearly as good as The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt; quite different, actually, but quite fun, and the story is deep and well-thought out.

Just from a technical standpoint, the animations are janky while traversing the terrain. This is especially apparent in caves as you constantly get stuck on the stalactites and other geometry. Character clothing, hair and the various accessories they wear constantly clip through their character model. Why does quick saving fade the game to black? There are texture pop-in issues in the pre-rendered 30fps cutscenes.

The artstyle and setting is amazing. Essentially the ""prehistoric"" tribes are considered the ""modern humans"" and the sci-fi robot killers are what's left of the ""ancient civilization"". There is even some Greek mythology in there. But it's all wasted potential. The world is empty, and the side quests are painfully boring. ""Go kill x amount of enemies"" and go investigate footprints which lead you to some boring character which regurgitates shit you've heard from every other npc in the same monotone voice. For some reason they focus on the inconsequential characters and ones who actually have some character development in the story are killed off. Dialogue choices have no effect on anything. 

Combat is very flawed. The idea to have weakpoints on enemies would have been good if the game rewarded you for shooting them. On normal difficulty you have to shoot some weakspots at least 6 times to deal significant damage. Enemies are spongy and have huge amounts of health, would have been better to actually reward player skill which would lower the time to kill. Melee attacks are a joke and should have been cut. Stealth exists but I don't see why anyone would use it. Robots will become alerted as you can't silent kill big boys and humans are so easy to kill, why bother.

Why do I have to stop every 2 minutes during combat to craft arrows? Unless you loot absolutely nothing, you will never run out of crafting materials. After 10 minutes of gathering you could probably craft thousands of arrows. Having to craft them just ruins the flow of combat.

The map screen looks decent until you buy the collectibles maps and then it looks like a Ubisoftdick game. The UI is constantly cluttered with status effects and damage numbers. I don't like RPG elements where most upgrades are along the lines of ""Wow this legendary bow which does 69 damage is much better than my common bow which does 60 damage"". The skill tree, weapon and armor mods are pretty bog standard, but a nice addition.

The last ""boss"" is just some standard enemies you've fought before. As Tak Fuji would say ""numbah two graphics""",1685650193,1688133773,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The characters capture the timeless human dichotomy of making sense of the insensible through seeing or believing - but in the end everything is somehow tied together on a deeper level. The attention to detail permeates everything from the visual environments and their biome-specific weather events, to the music that fits each landscape and civilization dispersed throughout the open world. The main story is uniquely captivating and the lore you find along the way might shed some light on the stories of life you unearth... 

Simply put; a masterpiece deserving of a play-through, and of which I almost feel bad that I got on sale because it was worth every penny.

Hoping to see the next installment Horizon: Forbidden West developed for PC.

General comments:
-never had any crashes, no major bugs or glitches seen, played with controller input
-the story and world lore you can find isn't as extensive as Skyrim or the Witcher, but some of it is hard to make sense of until you find more information (not a negative for me, perhaps for some users)
-some of the side quests/errands and decision making doesn't seem to change the story/world much.
-options for outfits/weapons and modification/personalization and their stats aren't as expansive as they could be (ex Skyrim). Additionally, merchants in the different areas pretty much sell all of the same things, and I would have liked to see some variability there. However, there's at least enough to be able to get the job done.",1672945701,1688120658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the story of HZD. The way in unravels, the logs you find around that really flesh out the world. It is one of them few games that hit me in the feels and also makes me wonder about certain things

As for crashes, I have had none, no issues what so ever.
PC SPECS:
Mobo - ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (WI-FI)
CPU - AMD Ryzen 9 5950X
Memory - Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 32GB 3600MHz 
GPU - MSI RTX 3090 Suprim X

I really look forward to Horizon: Forbidden West coming to PC. I can not wait to continue the story and adventure. 

SPOILER BELOW:
[spoiler] When I first played HZD, I was curious about the world in the game, where did these machines come from? Why are humans so primitive? Why is Aloy being confused from this person in the past, is Dr Sobeck alive? 
I thought maybe this could be an alt timeline or not even set on Earth. I was trying to think of all the possibilities, and then I was trying to figure out what Zero Dawn could be. But once the story reveals the truths. What Faro and his robots on roids had done. I loved it! I genuinely did not see the twists coming. 
Like Aloy being a clone; it never crossed my mind.
But the fact that Zero Dawn was not a super weapon. That humans lost, the planet died off. Everything was gone. Like it hit me, because of reading the logs, listing to the Audio logs, and also collecting the Vantage points. Like man. There was no happy ending, all those people who tried to fight the Faro bots died, the entire planet died, there was no magic button, no last minute heroic brake through. Everyone and the world was going to die. 
I honestly loved that idea, but also, like can you imagine if that happens in the near future, it would honestly be terrifying.[/spoiler]

Gameplay - 8/10
I love the hunting mechanic in Horizon Zero dawn and all the fights with the big machines are very fun and release at least 1 serotonin (yes, i did have to look up how to spell 'serotonin')

Graphics - 9/10
This game looks beautiful and rivals games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 in terms of detail.

Performance - 6/10
You will need a fairly decent PC to play this at a constant 60 fps at high/ultra settings.
This game however, runs perfectly on my mid-high range PC (RX 6600 XT, R5 5600X, 16gb 3600MHz RAM) with over 80 fps all the time on Ultra graphics settings.
However, I did have some major stutters in Meridian (The Big City). This could just be as it was loading as it only happened after fast travelling to Meridian and fixed itself after 10-20 seconds.
Edit: Fixed the stuttering almost completely by just enabling the AMD Radeon anti-lag feature in the AMD Radeon Software settings for HZD with only minor stuttering now that fixes itself in about 10 seconds (Nvidia users will have to find the Equivalent to the anti-lag Feature)

Story - 8/10 (No spoilers)
Great so far but i will not spoil. I will give my full opinion without spoilers once i complete the game.
Some of the mission, however, recommend that the player should be level 7 or over when they have a level 18 boss at the end. This does also happen in some of the side content such as the Sigma Cauldron that recommends level 7 but has a level 18 boss at the end but most of the time this doesn't happen as the side content doesn't have as many bosses at the end of each mission.
Edit: I have finished the story and it is great

Sound - 10/10
The noises that the machines make are something out of a Jurassic Park movie if the dinosaurs were robots.

World - 8/10
The world is pretty big and has a lot of things to do. I have completed many side quests which are very immersive and don't feel like the usual, 'Oh no, the world is going to end, but sure i can fetch some flowers for you'.",1649699997,1687984592,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Almost perfect game. Beautiful open world not bloated by anything: side quests, dungeons, collectibles etc. There´s not too much of anything, so there is no feel of grind or boredom. Devs really hit the right spot for amount of content.

Combat is awesome as well. I played with KBM, hard difficulty, no aim assist of course. It was challenging and forcing me to think about ""what, when and how"".

Story and lore really stands out, learning about human history was interesting.

Sound direction shines as well. However, soundtrack is average at best. It´s got some good moments, but very few and overall, it´s forgettable.

This is a cautious recommend. The port is really good actually it runs super well even on mid tier hardware and looks great doing it but. The gameplay feels quite lacking while there is a decent sand box a lot of it feels incredibly less powerful and useless and the progression is also quite skewed the moment you get to the main local from every vendor there you can get endgame equipment which just leaves a weird taste it my mouth. the characters are serviceable at the least with Rost being a strong outlier (He's just the best Dad ever) with most characters voice lines feeling off like it is a poor quality dub, the designs of everything and the art style is almost breath taking but definitely too sparse. Moving around and getting the collectables feels like too much of a chore and there's no real reward to doing so. Still like most games even this one has it's good moments.

 I have one issue though. the One problem is- the robots spawn back in areas you've cleared, there is a system where corrupted areas can get cleaned out but regular robots just re-spawn. That'd be nice and dandy if I could decide they came back or if they weren't so clustered on every route. I love exploring and HZD really scratched that itch until it became tedious to kill every single robot again and again on the same trail. the issue extends to mounts- i loved the whole ""override to ride"" thing but I could never use it when in the next minute i'd run right through another 3 robot areas.

Fighting machines is a real chore and brings no joy, only alleviation of annoying activity, while fighting human enemies is lackluster and very plain. Mechanics of the game feel like they are designed for a very different character, a superhuman of some sort, and in the sequel they give Aloy proper tools with AOE attacks and many other tricks to compensate for her being only human. You always run out of ammo and have to break the flow of a fight to go into inventory and craft some more. You always get stuck in some tree or a rock while trying to dodge enemy attacks because the camera doesn't allow to keep an eye on both. Weapons are just weird and not well balanced, it's clear by the end that heavy guns are most satisfying to use, but they are few and far between.

The entire game plays like a slog, from basic function such as having to pick up tons of herbs for healing because there's no reliable way (shops, traders etc) to refill your healing items, to combat which doesn't feel that exiting and satisfying to play (compared to Monster Hunter or any other Souls-like game). Imo, there's also way too much bullet-time combat than it needs to. You could argue that  

There's exactly no reason why the game needs to have an extra menu when salvaging enemies, and the animation that plays every time you collect world items (sticks, herbs, materials etc) makes everything a lot more tedious. Unlike RDR2 where animation plays a major role (such as skinning an animal) for it to be justified, this is not a game that focuses on it, so having to stop each time to collect anything really ruins the entire flow.

Yes, the story might be decent. Yes, the terrain and surrounding looks fantastic. Yes, the enemy designs are of top notch. However, the combat just doesn't click with how the play style revolves around shooting arrows and dark-soul-rolling 90% of the time, and the rest being melee combat that does not feel satisfying to play nor anything amazing to look at.

You could say I didn't spend enough time to reach the good part of the game. But if the game fails to capture my attention for the first 5 hours, I can't bother to finish the rest of it too. I might be biased on my gameplay preferences, so take this review with a grain of salt.

Although the combat system is a bit much for my fumble-fingered self, what with having to quickly switch weapons all the time on a PC using a UI designed for a controller. But that's probably a ""me"" issue, not a game issue. Still enjoying it though. Nice story.

That said...

Whoever created the grind system for this game should be taken out back, tied to the bottom of a sewage tank, and forced to empty it with a small spoon as it fills up. SO messed up especially for a single player game! The drop rate on *required* components is just too low.

Also, the continuing tendency of devs to create situations where the character is just a stupid idiot and just stands there while bad things happen is getting annoying. No, the paragon of combat would NOT just stand there and gape while someone throws a bomb at her! At least make the traps BELIEVABLE! d*rnit!

Das erdachte Zukunftsszenario wird dadurch faszinierender, da es an Teilaspekte unserer Gegenwart gekoppelt ist. Die Erzählweise ist komplett verzerrt, was bis zum Ende einen angenehmen Spannungsbogen aufrecht erhält. Man bekommt hier und da Fragmente und malt sich selbst mögliche Szenarien aus und wird dann völlig überrascht.

Das Gameplay
Die Kämpfe fühlen sich immer gut an. Die Animationen sind klasse und es existiert eine taktische Bandbreite für alle möglichen Spielstile: getarnt aus dem Hinterhalt, immer feste druff, maximale Effizienz, Kreaturenbändiger oder geländeverminender Stratege, du hast die Wahl und kannst binnen Sekunden deine Strategie wechseln. Am meisten haben mir die Jagdgebiete Spaß gemacht, welche die unterschiedlichen Spielstile vorstellen.

Altersgrenze
Das Spiel ist offiziell ab 12 Jahren gelistet. Keine Ahnung, wie das möglich war, denn die detailierten Animationen, wie man auf unterschiedliche Art und Weise menschlichen NPCs seinen Speer zwischen die Rippen rammt.... uff! Eine Einstufung ab 16 Jahren macht definitiv mehr Sinn bei dieser Darstellung von Gewalt. Solche Auseinandersetzungen kommen geschichtenbasiert auch relativ häufig vor (bei mir ca. 30% aller Kampfszenarien).

Optik
Das Spiel ist auch unglaublich schön. Perfekt, um auch mal im Moment zu verweilen. Man wird regelrecht dazu eingeladen. Probiert ruhig einmal den Foto-Modus aus!
