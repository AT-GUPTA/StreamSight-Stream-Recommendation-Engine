Fur-real, this is a very furmidable game. The Ninja Cats are clawverly hidden, and the mewsic ain't bad either.
 
The last cat was litter-ally impawsible to find and I have a feline that purrhaps others had difficulty finding him too.
 
I highly suggest you purrchase the DLC which furtunately is a good CATch at less than a buck!
 
Some of the Ninja cats are hissterical, unless you're CATatonic, metafurkitty speaking...I'm not kitten, these Ninjas have catitude, and may go down is hisstory furever.
