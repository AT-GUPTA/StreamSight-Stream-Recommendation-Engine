This game has gone from a simple survival game to a very nicely detailed game with fairly advanced style survival mechanics. The creators have even added in great easter eggs and terrifying monsters to fight.

Now...this game has changed IMMENSELY since it's original introduction around 2014 (or whenever it was). It was originally dubbed the ""Castaway Simulator"" (i.e. the movie, Castaway). It has indeed changed over the many years...and many players complained when things changed and eventually called the game ""unrecognizable"" from the original version. Well...that's the idea. I think that these guys have lovingly worked on this game for about a decade or so. Sure, things have been added and taken out...but it's still essentially the same game to me. Just better. Added Co-Op, Map and Island builders, customized game modes...it's all nice to me.

To be honest, this was the very first survival type game that I really enjoyed. It has a very chill setting and tone. It's wonderful to play casually or in-depth (no pun). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a fun and interesting tropical-style survival game. With the new features these days and the extra things to find, it's a very cool adventure.

I have played about 7h so far. You have crafting, base building and survival elements and combat with wildlife. Animations of attacking wildlife are jittery but acceptable, although the boar is especially janky.

Playing the game in co-op and it's pretty rough with a bunch of disconnects and it takes about 5-10min to rejoin while both are just waiting for a loading screen to go away. There's objects that ""vibrates"" a lot, like you usually see in multiplayer when desync is happening, sometimes the raft throws a tantrum and launches you like a catapult.

 There's a lack of information about how the game works and I randomly died while having 50% health and breath underwater whilst being poisoned. It was also unclear whether I died or not the first time, the UI just vanishes and you're stuck only being able to rotate the camera, scratching your head.

The UI and crafting is rough, needlessly clunky even though I'm starting to get a bit more used to it. We figured out you could get to a specific category of crafting depending on what tool you have in hand. I would rather have an overview of all categories at least instead of the system they have now where you gotta click several times until you hopefully see what you want.  

You have a hotbar showing tools/weapons that arent necessarily there, gotta check the ""wheel inventory"" if it's actually there or not. Many small negatives adding up and large gaps between game updates is the reason why I decided to not recommend it.

If you are really interested in the game, I would recommend checking out gameplay before deciding.

Edit: 

I decided to try multiplayer mode (MP) a second time after a QoL update, but sadly we still had the same issues with crashes and desyncs. So I decided to play the game in single player mode (SP) instead.  The game is much more playable in SP and haven't encountered any crashes.

""Stranded Deep"" - гра, яку наразі граю з другом. Я ще не закінчив цю гру, але вона вже вразила мене своєю механікою! Ми з другом вирішили грати, не дивлячись жодних відео-проходжень перед тим, щоб було цікавіше, і це вже дало нам багато емоцій. Завдяки нашому рішенню я досі дивуюся механіці розпалювання вогню. Ми зрозуміли, як розпалити вогонь, тільки подивившись це відео (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPGjJyULhU4). Дякую автору за надання посилання на підказку. Щоб не спойлерити текстом, я впевнений, що це також вас вразить. Також раджу вам не втрачати перший пліт, оскільки подорожувати на плоту, а не плаваючи, як ми почали спочатку, заощадить вам багато часу та нервів, а також зробить ваші подорожі по океану безпечнішими. Це поки що всі поради, які я можу дати новачкам. Свій другий відгук я залишу, коли завершимо гру; зараз у нас 12-й день виживання. Залиште свою реакцію лайком і діліться своїми порадами для мене та інших читачів у коментарях. Приємної гри! Дякую за увагу!

""Stranded Deep"" - игра, которую на данный момент прохожу с другом. Я не прошёл эту игру ещё до конца, но она меня уже успела поразить своей механикой! Мы с другом решили проходить, предварительно не посмотрев прохождение, чтобы это было интереснее, и не зря она подарила нам много эмоций. Благодаря нашему решению я поражаюсь ещё до сих пор механике развода огня. Мы додумались, как развести его, только посмотрев это видео (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPGjJyULhU4). Спасибо автору, приложил ссылку на гайд. Чтобы не спойлерить текстом, я уверен, вас это тоже поразит. Также советую вам не терять первый плот, поскольку передвижение на плоту, а не вплавь, как мы это делали с другом сначала, сэкономит кучу времени и нервов, а также обезопасит ваше передвижение по океану. Это пока что все советы, которые я могу дать новичкам. Свой второй отзыв оставлю, когда пройду игру, сейчас у нас 12 день выживания. Свою реакцию можете оставить лайком, пишите свои советы мне и другим читателям на будущее в комментариях. Хорошей игры! Спасибо за внимание!

On English:

""Stranded Deep"" - a game I'm currently playing with a friend. I haven't finished this game yet, but it has already impressed me with its mechanics! My friend and I decided to play without watching any walkthroughs beforehand to make it more interesting, and it has already given us a lot of emotions. Thanks to our decision, I am still amazed by the fire-making mechanics. We figured out how to start a fire only by watching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPGjJyULhU4). Thanks to the author for providing the guide. Without spoiling anything, I'm sure it will impress you too. I also advise you not to lose your first raft, as traveling on a raft instead of swimming, like we did initially, will save you a lot of time and nerves, as well as make your ocean travel safer. Those are all the tips I can give to newcomers for now. I'll leave my second review when we finish the game; right now, we're on day 12 of survival. Feel free to leave your reaction with a like and share your tips for me and other readers in the comments. Have a great game! Thanks for your attention!

first of all, I get the feeling that the devs were not given enough time to make this game feature-complete and refine some aspects of the game.

I will go into detail with things I didnt like and there might be some mild spoilers ahead. You've been warned.

_______________________________________________________________________

Tutorial:
basically useless.
I had to figure stuff out myself.
This would have been fine, but if you put a tutorial in a game, please try to make it actually helpful.

I strongly dislike the combat in this game:
the AI is dumb af. Either they are running away from you, or they will just headon fight you to the death.
The bossfights are very annoying and take ages, because they are bulletsponges, even with high skills and the best weapons. (possibly several ingame days).
Of cause you could call this ""challanging"", but its clearly not the way I would want it from a game.

Ressources:
I dont understand a lot of the logic behind the ressources in this game.
The only fully grown trees you can cut down are palms. Other big trees you simply can not interact with, wich does not make sense to me.
Trees will not regrow, which is fine, bot neither will flowers you picked and I dont get why this is, because you can clearly plant them in a farmplot. Just so you actually have to use the farmplot?
big BS if you ask me, especially because the remnants of those flowers will stay there for every, like a grave saying ""this used to be the home of an innocent flower UNTIL A BARBARIC MONSTER CAME AND RIPPED THEM OUT!""
Another thing I dont get is, why cou can not pick up certain items. I can carrie a fully loaded chest with 5 logs in them. why cant I carry one empty oil-barrel? Yes, you can drag them, but not put them in your inventory.

Story:
If you can call it that... At some point you have to fill up a container with food, but this container does not give a single soletary flying f*** abut what food you give them or if it is even prepared and that just doesnt make any sense to me.

Building a raft:
This could not be more static.
I understand that this is not meant to be a game where you only leave your raft to gather ressources, since this is not ""raft""(the game), but it is not very fullfilling to see how limited the options are when it comes to building yoiur raft and especially to build stuff on top of it.
Building doesnt feel very polished either.

Game-map:
you get a map even before you start the game, but I dont understand why there is no option to have a map in game. The only orientation you get are the ocean current, the sun and a compass. Not what I would expect from a game like this. but thats just me being salty I guess.

I really liked the concept of the game, but the way it was made in the end, completely destroyed the fun for me and I got more frustrated with every day that passed.
I'll rather go back to raft and put a couple of hundred hours into that.

If you made it to this point, thank you for taking the time to actually read it.
I hope it helps to figure out if this game is for you.",1708169341,1708169341,False,5,0,0.588235259056091309,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy survival games but this one was a combination of Raft and the Forest with only the most annoying elements retained.  I tried to climb down a ladder and since I didn't hit the space button, my character took a gainer off the platform and broke his leg.  When I restarted after death, I tried the same ladder and pressed space this time to avoid the broken leg.  When I pressed down to climb down the ladder, he slid at a high rate of speed and broke his leg once again.  Come on.  When a person goes to climb down a ladder, it shouldn't require multiple tries to learn how to do it safely as any normal human would have done it with ease.

Started building a cliff base on a single player game but due to having to have a floor below (as otherwise you can't build above) proved impossible so shelved that idea.  Maybe if you created an island you would have more joy with this.

Would have loved to have missions to complete like in Raft but once you've built your base, visited islands and killed 3 bosses theres no challenge anymore.  The game sets you up nicely to play other survival games.

It's too buggy and feels like it never left early access. The graphics and mechanics are awful and the game is not intuitive at all.

I feel like the trailer and images don't reflect the product realistically either, so be prepared for that.

I wish I had listened to the negative reviews. I should have bought any of the other similarly priced survival games that look so much more polished.

can tell that a lot of you really put a lot of time into this game and it does have a lot of good potential.

i completely revise my review. THIS GAME IS AWFUL BECAUSE OF THE BUGS. I Hundreds of hours playing the game and then I decided that I wanted to swim with a whale that was near my raft.

today, as of Feb.16th tried the game again and I'm really disappointed even i couldn't believe how they managed to get the game less appealing.

there are some fundemental problems with the graphics / shadow settings. back then, those bugs errors were not that much visible also game graphics somehow it looks like terrible than the older version.

also I'm sure theresn't any beta tester for this game, just a little settings stuff;
game comes with keybinding setup like this
Crouch = C
Craft = C

good job really.

also, they added new crafting options like concrate and such which makes you feel awkward. game instantly looses the first impression of being alone in a wast ocean. (there were more basic and primitive materials only nothing more in earlier version, which gave more survivor feeling)

They also removed of freedom of choice elements it seems.

Three  things ill say i have bad and good opinions. 
I gives a yes simply because it was my very first survival game ever lol.

1.  Theres only so much content. Read other reviews and youll see others say game has potential, the devs are really throwing away the potential here. They need to add more content, more items, more foods, more animals, more buildings, more storms, more weather types, more events, more features, better multiplayer, and more islands that are bigger. Once they simply add more content we good!

2. Great for simplicity, if you wanna cool isolated atmosphere. Basic and nice survival mechanics. again just not enough content

3. play for 5 hours at MOST and youll experience all of the game. yup. that is how it works. Then youll download some workshop islands and play them for maybe five minutes. Because again lack of content

Thats all i got. Again only buy when on sale, no more than 5 dollar game, until the devs stop being lazy explicit words.",1706121370,1706121370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Acredito que seja difícil de avaliar quem seja o público-alvo do jogo, pelos seguintes motivos:
[spoiler]
- Você constrói base em uma ilha (mas 99% do jogo, você estará em outra ilha e é muito fácil se perder)
- Caso queira navegar por mapa (o mapa só é acessível pelo menu do jogo, não tem um mapa durante a gameplay)
- O combate contra o Javali é só chato (não tem uma estratégia para lidar com ele em melee de forma eficaz, diferente do caranguejo)
- Não tem uma linha narrativa, nem ao menos nada para explorar nas ilhas que seja interessante
- Tem muita ilha para pouca variedade (não tem cavernas, todas as ilhas tem quase o mesmo tamanho/fauna/flora/recursos)

EDIT: Somehow the devs managed to fix the game, at least 90% of it, now it plays and runs way better in many aspects (gameplay, interface. crafting, mechanics, and even graphics). The devs also added a co-op mode in which you can play with friends, truly a huge improvement over the old Stranded Deep which seemed abandoned by its devs.

EDIT 2: After finishing the game I have to say this. Stranded Deep is a pretty clunky game, but it exceeds on atmosphere and survival mechanics. Exploration is this game biggest flaw, dozens of virtually exact islands all over the map with nothing that differentiates them, (apart from the 2 abandoned survivor camps I found in my whole game, one of them containing Cast Away's Wilson). I had to install a map mod since this game provides virtually no map or way to make exploration bearable. Ships and even the gyrocopter go extremely slow and exploration gets tedious after 4-5 islands. Apart from that Stranded Deep is worth the grind and provides a great survival experience, plus the ending is interesting and makes up for the boring mechanics. Crafting could also be improved as well as animations, but like I said before, the atmosphere of a sunset over the Pacific islands and the interesting progression (need to kill 3 bosses to progress to the end) manage to make up for it. Would recommend playing co-op since it would make the game faster and more fun. Overall I recommend Stranded Deep.

Throughout 24 hours of play I couldn't help but constantly compare it to Raft and Green Hell. As best I can tell, this game is an attempt at merging the aesthetics and mechanics of Green Hell with the setting of Raft but failing to attain either. I'll try to break it down to several categories and compare.

Story. I know it's not a priority for many survival games but there is essentially no story, whereas Green Hell has an amazing story that I highly recommend. Raft doesn't have a narrative per se but it does have a lot of world building through out the ""story locations"" that are fun to find. 

Building and Crafting. In short they are not very fleshed out and often are poorly designed or just plain buggy. You can build a raft, but you basically can't build anything on it meaning that you can't use it as your base. In Raft, your raft IS your base and you can build everything required to survive on it. You can also build a base on land however the building mechanics themselves are quite poor and trying to place items will seemingly randomly decide whether they want to snap together or not. The base itself serves no real function apart from storing crafting appliances, which can be built on the bare ground anyway. Having said that, the whole point of the game is to island hop so trying to drop down roots somewhere is kind of pointless anyway, it's like the devs couldn't decide if they wanted you to have a home or be a nomad, so just didn't really give you the tools to do either in any meaningful way.

Progression of (crafting/skill? not sure what to call it). It's boring. You do the thing and you get xp, then you can do more of the thing. Both Raft and Green Hell gate your crafting recipes through progression in the game/story so there's an actual sense of reward or development.

Our co-op playthrough devolved into us playing our own single player games and streaming it for each other since multiplayer is so dogshit and would crash player 2 constantly. 

So many of the animals are not able to be killed or interacted with anymore because reasons I guess idk. 

Game balance is ass and resources become limited so quickly, and instead of things growing back or respawning they allow you to LEAVE YOUR GAME to view the map, which then allows you to regenerate random new islands I guess. Wack.

however once you start to play it, it can get very boring. there are many problems like lack of differentiation, every game is the same, I feel this could be remedied by such features as multiplayer. There is also the fact that development is very slow, two years and a half and not much change, I'm afraid it may become like Dayz standalone but it may not end like that and development will speed up and at some point we will have a full game.

Another problem is that I feel the developers dont have much sense of direction, adding small random features that are useless, sure alot of features are fun and different but alot arent.

Im excited for the future of this game, but for now I will have to not recommend it.

- Got more annoyed after I kept on getting lost all the time ... tried to figure out why this was n imo its cos all the islands look the same when u are at a far distance ... its 2021 ffs :/

- Got even more annoyed when you figure out half the crafting stuff is useless as u cant doing anything with them apart from make ure base look pretty :(

- Most annoying of all tho is that in a crafting exploration game ... you have no map & you cannot even craft one ... u cant even use large buildings or smoke from a fire as markers ... as the draw distance is way too low :/

Building mechanics make absolutely no sense. There is literally no gameplay difference between building a twig shack and a brick fortress (apart from costing you significantly more). Not only that, there is zero incentive to build *anything* at all, as buildings won't protect you against rain, wind and cold - they simply do not exist in the game apart from visuals/sound fx. Animals pass through walls so no point in building a base, apart from trying to RP which in this game gets boring fast.

Same applies for rafts - different materials used to build the raft hardly matter at all. Do not read what is written as information - I can barely notice any difference in the way the raft behaves if it is built using different materials. So why you need level 4 crafting to build the barrel raft when a twig one can do as much is beyond me. Or, why do you need to put an expensive brick floor on top of the raft base when you can go around with planks of wood. Also, bricks as a raft floor - are you serious? And if you are trying to haul barrels - no matter how big your raft is, you can barely load a barrel or maybe two (if you are lucky) before the raft starts sinking or going awry in circles. In my game, I managed to transport a couple of barrels using the starting dinghy - so the only reason to build a raft is speed and to be able to haul crates on a shelf. You cannot even build some sort of a half-wall to prevent stuff like tyres and barrels from falling off.

Resources are also bland and far not enough. Sure, the basics are there but oh my god, the crafting menu and UI is abhorrent. It is all over the place, you cannot favourite certain items, only pin what you will need to gather before crafting it but not actually craft it unless you go again through all the menus. Horrible. Variety is bad, soon you will end up with dozens of label makers, compasses, underwater torches, vehicle parts which are fairly useless if you already have 1 of each (or a few in the case of vehicle parts). Inventory is disorganised and honestly this is the only game where your empty hands count as a part of the inventory. On top of that, you can easily stack everything in boxes and then pick the boxes with the items inside, game seems to not care. But as soon as you have all the slots occupied and have - lets say 2 axes, you suddenly cannot equip neither as the game tries to split them into two slots - without any logic whatsoever. A total mess.

AI is also incredibly poor for a game this new. Animals get stuck on everything, combat is incredibly clunky and lacking anything interesting. Sound effects are lacking, soundtrack is nice but very short and easily becomes very repetitive as everything else in this game. And why the hell do the tiger sharks make a growling noise when biting?! They are sharks, not tigers. What's next? Horse flies that neigh??? Graphics can either be good or bad - some aspects are nice but they still feel very outdated.

All that being said, there are some good features. Procedural generation offers some replayability so long you are not incredibly bored by the time you finished the game the first time. The map itself is not infinite as the devs would like you believe, rather it consists of a few dozens small islets but scattered around differently every game. 

There is also an option to create custom maps and islands but the map editor is so frustratingly terrible to navigate, this options is borderline useless. Trying to build a simple island, raise tool actually lowers the land, the other tools are buggy as hell, did not stay there for more than 5 minutes, it was THAT buggy.

Overall, you will like the idea of this game, but not the game itself. There are way better games in the same category out there.
If you are still willing to buy, do not buy at full price. This game does not deserve to be priced that high.

-Icons of items disappear from inventory so you need to restart to fix it
-Getting stuck on building mode so you have to restart to fix it
-Not being able to destroy part of your raft so you lose on a a lot of resources
-Save doesn't work sometimes
-Client randomly crashes for my friend so if it happens on a trip I have to go find a way to make a tent to save before he joins back in.

!!!But the most annoying of all is the time it takes to sync on Co-op!!! 
Every time you want to play with a friend, it has to sync the world. At the start it took like 2-3 mins. As we progressed it took more and more. And because of the bugs we had to restart a few times per session and it became extremely frustrating.

First, you're on a plane.  No dialogue, no narration, nothing and suddenly it crashes.  It tells you to exit the plane by swimming and get to the life boat.  Once there, it will tell you to press and hold E to paddle.

That's odd and annoying but I have eyes so it's fine.  Okay, let's get to the island.  Done.  Pick resources up on the island and open your backpack is the next objective.  Okay, let's assume E is the button to pick stuff up since that's what I used to paddle.  Oh, it is! BUT The item you picked up will stay in your hand and there is no button to put it down.  E doesn't work.  Left and right mouse button doesn't work.  Weird.  Will it work if I pick something else up with E? Nope.  Those items will go into the backpack.  Then there are Items that are highlighted with a name but I can't pick those up either.  That's fine, maybe I need a tool but I still have a rock in my hand!

For example, most tools have one level (crude). A couple (knife, axe?) have a refined level. That's it. The different islands have nearly all the same resources. It feels like only the first quarter of this game was implemented.

My negative review is due primarily to the inventory system. There are way too many long hold button actions. Want to drop something from your inventory? Hold tab to go into inventory, long hold right mouse, wait, drop. Want to drop 10 things from your inventory? Do that 10 times in a row. Picking up things is nearly as bad. Chop some wood and you get to click pick up 4 times in row. You need to long hold a button to feed materials into the water still. Why? You have to have the material in your hand to do it (which also sucks), so it's not like you are going to accidentally feed it those materials.

Storage containers are just as bad. Removing 10 rocks from a container will take 12+ clicks/button presses.

Piloting a raft? Need to turn around to face the rudder, long hold a button to stop and then turn back around to long hold on the mast to pull the sails. Can't pull the sails while running the rudder. Can't look at your watch either, or hold a compass.

No auto pickup, no group/bundle drop.

Very appealing for the state of this game seeing how long it has been out. I have no idea why this has an overwhelmingly positive score on steam.

One of the best in the ocean survival crafting building games and they actually update and fix stuff over time! Only Raft surpasses it imo, and a few others are near it. There are a LOT of copycats trying to do what Stranded Deep did tho and they dont even come close.

Loved it, but mostly for the custom maps not the default one. I played it near the beginning when things were still being added. Very decent for its type. The only thing i miss in these crafting and living games is the variety, sailing around xploring the islands didnt catch me as much because it was much the same unless u chose custom maps with way better island variety. So the world xploring and uniqueness in that area is lacking but its underrated and worth playing if u like these kind of games! 

I would have loved more building options tho, also in the ground/area u build on, but i know its not a huge building game on that scale, so its still very well done compared to others similar to this building wise.
If u liked  Raft and this is worth a little of ur time also for sure, but the default map and xploring is very dull and i enjoyed it much more with  certain custom built maps with major differences. the standard island are just all the same with not enough incentive to go xplore them all and build a home otherwise.

>> It's like GreenHell Sea Version
>> Coop game only holds 2 players

To be improved:
1. crafting UI is still not decent and not easy to find the categories for it. 
2. Log to plank is 1:1 , it would be more reasonable to make it 1 : 1~3
3. well, one hand lantern one hand tool, it makes sense. Yet, we can't do that in the game.
4. the movement going on the raft is bad
5. well the final goal and how to get the things for it just doesn't make sense at all, would be better we get it from it's habitat or just drop it

well, it did get better than the previous version, yet it has a lot of thing can be improved
Not really recommend this for now



glad to see the game improve little by little, I will keep playing it and update the notes.

Pros:
- looting sunken ships
- coral reefs
- kinda like summer vacation for those who hasn't had a vacation in years
- objects can be tossed really far using dragging mechanism

Cons:
- everything is trying to kill you - animals and environment - and they are doing a great job
- why can't potatoes be baked?
- if the driver falls off the raft, the raft will leave. The chanses of catching it by swimming are very slim and only in the first 5 seconds. If you didn't swim at full speed with maximum physical points - it's GONE. Use your latest save
- super modest backpack space and stacking limits of 1 and 4 are just unfair
- drinking or eating more than 2 coconuts in a row will give the character diarrhea. I mean, sure, coconuts are fatty, but it's the only source of water on new islands
- tutorial will help understand controls but nothing indicates that there's a story or bosses (yea, there's cartographer, but it's not a traditional map and it's for some reason only accessible from main game menu - you gotta save and quit to see the map)
- islands are extremely alike and it's very easy to get lost even with a compass
- some controls are ridiculous - to use hobo stove one must equip meat (to hold it), drop it on the floor and use dragging control to drag each piece on the stove surface
- handling coconuts and other food is equally unnecessarily complex. Equip coconut, drop it on the floor, equip a knife or an axe, hit the coconut until it's peeled, pick it up, equip it, click left mouse button to drink. To skin fish it must also be dropped on the floor and then hold E to skin it one at a time
- tool belt is useless. You might think: it will free up space in my backpack since it has slots and [i] literally has a pouch on an icon [/i]. But no, you can assign some tool to the hotkey, but the tool is still taking space, and if you remove this tool from the backpack (maybe you don't need a building hammer when looting ships), it unbinds from the key so it's useless
- ammo you used on bosses sinks with the boss so you can consider yourself lucky if you pick 3 arrows out of 50",1702261438,1702261935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My survivor got stuck in the container of a boat helm... died to drowning.  After all these years, developer still has no clue how to program.  Uninstall... still a bad interaction experience... concept would go far with a better dev team.


Cons: 

Has some good ideas but I would stay away from this until they figure out how to make things work and mesh better.  The bottom of the ocean... as SOON as the game starts, has ALL objects floating above the ground.  Then, don't even bother trying to climb a palm tree as your mentally challenged charecter has a tendancy to just jump and ""break something"" if you're lucky.  Otherwise, he lays down to die... START OVER.  Basic starting game concepts fail.  Get over all that and you might be able to figure out how to fumble through the islands.

Pro:

*  Game has NO issues with graphics performances.
*  Graphics look nice along with nice sounds.
*  Lots to explore.

That being added, it turned out to be fun co-op survival game. We've played through and completed many (The Raft, Green Hell, The Forest, etc.) and while this doesn't rank with the deepest, it's price is right for what it gives: good bang for your buck for a $20 game (even better if on Steam Sale), but not quite enough pow to justify a $30 game.

I primarily played this split-screen co-op (which Valheim does not have) and as I bought it on special I feel like I have my moneys worth as a group activity.

However the more I have played, the more I want to play Valheim. To start, the biggest let down has been the building; if there is a collision (even with a rock formation) you can't build there. Building stairs has to be over a platform not from the edge. Placing structures is buggy as heck. Building a raft is cool but placing structures on it sucks (they can only snap to the middle of a raft platform).

Farming heh, feels half finished; some things rot and spoil where others don't. Meat/cooked meat will spoil but if you leave it on the fire it wont. a bunch of the plants you can pick don't have a purpose.

Cutting trees leaves stumps you can't get rid of, half the shubbery you can't even get rid of which made a fantastic looking community island, horrible.

Base game islands are boring, community islands are mostly from older versions so have items with no use and floaty objects. Modding community is very small.

Sailing is ok the waves are nice. Diving around your island to explore sunken ships cool, but 20 meters away from an island there is just a drop to a bottomless ocean, no ocean exploring.

Animals will run around up in the air, clip through terrain. My character has shoes on, but stepping on a spiky starfish will poison me. Bumping a snake or lion-fish also poison.

This is far from a complete game, videos/screenshots make it look much better than what it is. Graphics are meh especially for the FPS you get.

If you are specifically looking for split-screen survival, buying on special is ok. Most of the cool mods appear to only work for player 1 tho.",1701352496,1701352496,False,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

I wish more early access titles were like this. Not overreaching and under-delivering.

If you want to know what this game is like, it is essentially Raft with better graphics and you make your home on an island rather than your raft being your home. This is a classic case of a better looking game (graphics wise) does not equate to a better game (gameplay wise) and i have spent a reasonable amount of my time playing this game debating/pining to play Raft instead as while it is not as advanced it actually works.

I initially found this game as one of the games included in the playstation subscription. I spent 15-20 hours getting into it and noticed it was also on PC with the PC version having a much larger world, downloadable maps and mods so i then bought it on steam and started over.

Now i am glad i started over on the PC version as the world is much bigger and the main fun from this game (for me) is the exploration and building side but i immediately noticed a few differences between the two versions where the PS version was actually better than the PC version, such as when loading into the game each time you can choose if the enemies will be passive or aggressive which you can't do on PC although you can go into the save file and change it if you wish.

This leads us to the first issue i found. I started the game (on PC) with it set to passive as i was still getting into it but the first time i reloaded it i discovered the game had reset to aggressive. As there is no option to change it (like on the PS version) i searched to see how i could change it and found out this was a long standing issue and found out how to change it in the save file.

Without going into every single issue, throughout my time playing the game there have been numerous issues like this with a variety of 'workarounds' employed by the community and also suggested in official dev replies, some which work and some which don't. This is not uncommon with games and part of the reason i often prefer PC vs console is that there are often options available to fix issues with the game but what concerns me and dissapoints me about these issues is that when i search for sollutions i often find posts from as much as 5 years ago asking for advice on the issue, considering the game was only 'released' last year. The fact that many of the workarounds often don't work and you are stuck with the issue or as per my lastest issue where i returned to my home island to find a number of my storage crates had just dissappeared (finding posts mentioning this issue from at least 2019) means there can be no solution and you just have to suck it up.

For those reasons alone i cannot in all faith choose recommend and thus i have given it a thumbs down.

If this was still in early access i would have given this game a definite recommendation in the expectation that many of the games issues would eventually be fixed but instead of fixing these issues it seems time is being spent on 'improving' the game by taking away useful features like being able to interact the the sail/anchor while steering with the rudder...you probably won't fully understand how stupid that decision seems until you actually play the game...luckily there is a mod to revert that decision.

Having said that i would not flatly right off the game as i have had and am still having and plan to have many hours of fun exploring the game but that is solely because of the numerous creators of amazing islands that you can add to the game, not because of the base game itself which if nothing else the standard islands available in the game are very small, generic and quite bland as well as the small number of mods available for the game which make the game (reasonably) playable.

This is my personal oppinion but if you do play the game i wouldn't bother with having the world as aggressive, especially if you don't start on a modded island as even with experience and optimisation it can be impossible to actually get off the first island and start exploring depending if you actually have the basic materials on the first island to make a raft fast enough to avoid any sharks, which may or may not be around your island or islands you wish to explore initially and that sharks will constantly tip your raft over if they catch you. 

I started turning on passive purely because in my initial learnig starts it was impossible to get off my starting island in agressive mode and also as the game gives you zero information i was constantly getting poisoned and hurt without knowing why and while most dangers can be avoided or countered certain dangers cannot such as the unkillable poisonous sea snakes. If nothing else, most real animals, even dangerous ones will generally only attack humans if aggravated or provoked rather than automatically attack on sight and sharks only attack boats in the movies.

I wouldn't mind this so much if it wasn't for the fact that the main source of counters to being hurt is coconuts which don't respawn are are in very limited supply, especially if you don't play on modded islands. I understand that the premise of the game is to escape home rather than make a new life here but i feel that is one of the aspects where the dev hasn't understood who is likely to play the game and how they will enjoy playing it.


Overall i would say if you like this style of game, it is on sale, you have spare cash to burn, don't mind having to 'workaround' numerous issues and reasonably technically competent (are happy finding game files/manually installing mods in games etc) then give it a go. Be very prepared to be annoyed, frustrated and dissapointed by the various issues while playing the game though.",1701105048,1701105048,False,24,0,0.682122468948364258,0,True,False,False

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone thinking of buying this co-op. The amount of absolutely jarring bugs, glitches and absolute garbage you'll have to deal with just isn't worth it. 

Before I go any further, I will say that solo is fine - you can probably play the game solo and you'll have a good time - if you're into games like this. 

But co-op... 

It feels like a solo game with co-op mode patched onto it right from the very moment you attempt to play together: 

* the exact same character (only choice being male/female)
* inability to set a fixed password
* inability to send a Steam invite to your friend (especially fun if your friend uses a Steam Deck)
* painfully excruciating loading time whenever you start the game... Oh my Gaben, I wanted to pull my hair out every time we tried playing/crashed/glitched/had to restart. 
* the glitches: flying pigs (just your normal game), stuck blueprints when trying to craft rendering you unable to do anything at all (forcing a restart of lobby which takes 2 years), LSD trips underwater with the inability to do anything (forcing a restart of the lobby which takes forever), being INVISIBLE to your friend (which is hilarious if you want to maroon them on an island but will probably force you to restart a lobby which takes an endless amount of time), among anything else I am too PTSD to remember. 

Now we did have some fun, admittedly. Certain elements of the game (like navigation and getting your bearings) are somewhat unique until you realise there is a map... OUTSIDE of the game and in the menu which, yep - forces you to restart your lobby which will take a millennium to sync back up. 

Just... no. Don't buy this if you are looking to play with a friend. It could have been so much better but you can just feel it's been done half-arsedly and it shows. 

If you're looking for a more enjoyable co-op experience - try Sunkenland. Game is still in Alpha as of me speaking and yet 10x more fun co-op than whatever this forever-loading, glitchy mess is.",1700858017,1700858017,False,63,6,0.792917370796203613,4,True,False,False

I prefer a sandbox game so when I tried it again in October I was really happy to see there is now a version where I won't die and the animals leave me alone. I like to build. My other favourite is Anno 1800. Yes, the game has issues. I have flying pigs and a floating stick structure I cannot remove. There should be a way to interact with the very limited furniture. Like sitting in a chair. I wish I could craft more stuff. The graphics for some stuff is very clunky. However the graphic artists did a great job on the sky, and waves. The underwater scenery is beautiful. I swim for ages just looking and gathering clay or fishing. The storm is too long and the thunder on a repeating loop so not natural.

Single-player is fun, if a tad bit more intimidating. The ""story"" is vague and feels more like ""something to do"" rather than a directed story line, and I think this game feels in the best place as a sandbox game (no pun intended) over something like Subnautica that has a direct and progressive story. 

The problem with this game is it's co-op multiplayer. First off, the game is limited to 2-player co-op, which was not expected or easy to find out. Other similar games like Raft or Valheim put this paltry 2-player to shame if you want to play with friends. Second off, the multiplayer feels unfinished, the tutorial is disabled in multiplayer, meaning if you (like me and my partner did) jump right into multiplayer you are given no idea of how to work anything, and the menu does not give much help at all, forcing you to scour the internet for help. Then on top of that, the sync of both player's games is shoddy at best. Recently, after playing together for several hours we loaded in the next day and found that on my screen our house, raft, etc. were in their rightful place whereas for my partner the house was on the opposite side of the island and the raft embedded into it. She could no longer interact with objects I could see and I could watch her float above the ground as she climbed the invisible house. We were unable to remedy this problem.

So overall, I'd recommend this game for single player only, for players who enjoyed Subnautica or Raft on their own but I strongly warn against people hoping for a multiplayer experience like Raft, Valheim, or The Forest.",1699900537,1699900537,True,75,1,0.86070781946182251,0,True,False,False

I find that to progress in any way, you gotta get your butt in the water and face some sharks. And time management is key. I have restarted the game a few times just to get a hang of it before I started progressing. 

I definitely recommend playing with a friend if you are looking for an easier playthrough, though, it is a bit buggy. I do have issues every once in a while trying to connect to the lobby with a friend, but eventually it works and we have a lot of fun together.

-There is no animations. Like you pull a log over to the plankstationd and click a butten and POFF..  you got a plank.  IT is made way to easy.  i want to see some sawing animations or something, and not just instant make.

-Weight system sucks. put a few rocks or something on the raft and you flip the raft or something. You can fill boxes and put it on shelfs and then the weight do NOTHING to the raft..   it is not logical

-You can finish the game in just a few hours if you want.  All you need is to make some spears.  Bosses are to easy.  I want to make some armor and upgrade to better weapons but there is no armor or better weapons.   It is spears and speargun..

-Houses is almost a total waist.  You can place everything on the beach . I want to have a good reason why you want to make a house. Like surviving storms  and things that can only be placed inside.

-Your garden get auto water from rain when you are on the island.  If you leave it then it stops raining there and the plants die if you stay away to long.   Makes no sense that the rain follows you

If you enjoy a more ""realistic"" survival game compared to the very arcade-y Sunkenland, or the very cartoon-y Raft, I highly recommend giving this a try.

One major con:
The multiplayer is honestly *horrible*, it sync's the world data to everyone as a loading screen when they join a game, and it takes around 5 minutes on a locally-switched network with sub-100ms latency. I can't imagine how long it would take for people living in different states or countries. If anyone get's DC'ed, *everyone* has to re-sync when they rejoin.

Stranded deep is a very good survival game, with lots of tool crafting, base building, cooking and hunting. Raw materials such as wood or stone are very limited and finite. You must explore lots of islands other than the first in order to proceed. I would say it is of moderate difficulty overall. The thing I disliked the most is how slow is your raft and how difficult it is to create a good portion of fuel. My main playthroguh lasted about 50 hours and got me 35/37 of achievements. The last 2 I got from a second playthrought in creative mode, without playing, by just running the game over night, when i slept. I did this for 5 nights.

I just love the atmosphere of it all, the raft-building aspect, the animals, the graphics. Just nice but given all this, there's also a lot of things that could make this game so much better.

I find myself going from island to island with no actual purpose other than gathering loot, the mystery fades very quickly especially with the lack of variety of ships, buildings and island types - there's about 3 different looking islands, 5 different ship types and I feel that they could have really really added some mystery and variety here.

I love raft building, something about taking your entire ""house"" with you is something ive always loved but I'd wish they'd extend on this concept, like being able to add more to the raft than the default items, maybe like adding a bed or being able to build walls and roofs.

A lot of interaction and graphical glitches plague this game, graphical glitches especially getting too close to (sea) animals make it sort of frustrating approaching any of them; you get dragged by a shark and when you turn around it vanished into deep sea, what. The fact that this game has controller support amazes me, it works well within the gameplay but not at all within the cartographer or map builder, you have to go as far as disconnecting the controller & restarting the game to use the thing with a keyboard again. 

As for graphics, the game looks like a super modern RTX looking demo yet at the same time like they took a default unity starter template but in a good way.

TL;DR: Add more variety & mystery and extend on the raft building aspect.

The whole idea of the game is pretty unrealistic, and so is the game, but that's not a bad thing, it keeps things simple. Open world and being able to do anything the world allows is nice, but it doesn't allow for too much.

The major general drawback of the game is the ""slightly"" wonky physics which sometimes causes things to go horribly wrong, so do yourself a favour and save often. Luckily, although the game disallows saving all the time and does not offer autosave, you can carry around the item which allows you to save almost everywhere and anytime (which makes the decision to require an item to save the game a really weird one).

There are only two things in this game which I would call ""bad"".
1. The raft seems to have no issues carrying a lot of wooden boxes and doesn't even sway much with you walking around on it. But putting an animal on it (like a [spoiler]""huge pig""[/spoiler]) or a [spoiler]Hammerhead shark[/spoiler] puts such a weight burden on it that the raft is barely keeping floated. Even a big raft does not help much there. The physics model of that behaviour is just too simple. It kills the fun. And I don't even start speaking about the weight of the [spoiler]barrels[/spoiler].
2. Hitboxes for animals - both you attacking them and other way around. It's impossible to ascertain why something happened. [spoiler]Snakes[/spoiler] half a meter away hit you without moving, you're stepping on [spoiler]Starfishes[/spoiler] which are half a meter away, [spoiler]Poisonous fishes[/spoiler] sometimes hit you half a meter through stones. [spoiler]Sharks and pigs[/spoiler] attack you and run ""through"" you, but you can't hit them with your weapon when they do.

Those two things make the game really take a downturn. I'd really love to have them fixed.

There are a few more minor issues, which should be fixed as well, like, you stand on the raft with something in your hand, move it down to where the raft is, and the raft gets displaced by stuff in your hand, making it spin, dip or accelerate without any reason, or the issue that stuff simply disappears into the floor or assets, mainly it's stones and clay which do that.

The ""normal"" difficulty is way too little of a challenge regarding food and water.

The game needs a few more prominent pointers of dangerous situations like dehydration, famine, low health, air, and especially it needs them *persistent* and not as a popup which is visible for like 3 seconds.

The issue that you can not use your second hand while steering the raft, not even looking at your watch for stats or holding a compass, despite the second hand being displayed idle and not in use all the time, is nervewrecking and infuriating.

There is literally almost no reason to build something on the island, except that you can't build something like a ""cabin"" on the raft. But actually there is no reason to build one except roleplaying, the house is not even rainproof.",1693121393,1693131837,True,10,0,0.617956340312957764,1,True,False,False

Graphics: Average
Game mechanics: Strange
Character movement: Very strange
Crafting system: Boring and messy
Difficulty: This game is not hard; it is just crazily unbalanced. At the beginning, you need resources like fiber, of which you will find only about 10 on the first island (you need approximately 30 to obtain basic items).

Overall: The game could potentially improve later on, but the beginning is so boring that I ended up requesting a refund.

The UI is not as intuitive as GH, and the items have fewer uses.  For example, spoiled meat having no purpose, not even as bait for scavengers and fish, is nonsensical.  I also don't like not being able to use coconut halves as bowls to either cook with or collect rainwater.

It's a sandbox survival game and we just want to craft stuff and not starve. I like that you have to change island for resources and once you get a decent raft with a sail it's not a problem at all. Navigation is also quite easy. But there are little details that really annoys me like:
- Poison: It's omnipresent in the game and you get poisoned quite often by snakes, purple sea creature lying on the coast and fish. To get an antitode you have gather this pipi plant that should be present on most islands but it is a nightmare to find because it's a weak yellow over a green grass that it's everywhere. I spent the last 10 minutes looking for one and this is what I call bad gameplay. Once you start to farm, it become easier to have access to multiple of it but till you get there is a pain to find it.
- Bad UI: getting used to how to craft, select items, drop them, rotate, etc is a pain. Even when you get used to it you just have one question. Why?
- Mobs: I like a challenge when it comes to monsters but what I don't like is when the AI path finding is so bad that they keep doing zig zag all over the place or even flying! Yes, I was trying to shot a damn flying pig that was killing me.

Stranded Deep, a game that promised an immersive survival experience, has unfortunately left me stranded in a sea of disappointment. The concept of the game, which seemed incredibly enticing, was overshadowed by a myriad of bugs, issues, and graphical problems that made the overall experience unplayable.

My partner and I set aside an hour to delve into the world of Stranded Deep, eager to explore its unique survival mechanics. However, our excitement was short-lived as we were met with a series of glitches that not only disrupted our gameplay but also necessitated complete restarts, erasing all our hard-earned progress.

One of the most glaring issues we encountered was visibility problems. There were instances where we couldn't see each other's characters, which significantly hampered our cooperative gameplay. This was further compounded by incessant beeping from our in-game watches, which served as a constant distraction, despite there being no apparent issues to warrant such alerts.

Crafting, a crucial aspect of any survival game, was also fraught with problems. Crafted items would often remain stuck on our screens, obstructing our view and making them uncollectable. This issue, in particular, was a significant hindrance to our gameplay, as it prevented us from fully utilizing the game's crafting system.

The game's concept, while intriguing, was unfortunately overshadowed by these bugs and issues. It was particularly disappointing as the co-op mode, the primary reason for our purchase, was rendered virtually unplayable. The potential for a unique and engaging survival experience was there, but the execution fell short.

In conclusion, Stranded Deep, while promising on the surface, was a deep dive into disappointment. The game's numerous bugs and issues, coupled with its graphical problems, made for an overall unplayable experience. As a result, I found myself compelled to request a refund, a decision I made with a heavy heart given the game's potential. I hope the developers address these issues in future updates, as the concept of Stranded Deep is one that deserves to be fully realized.",1691306806,1691306806,False,11,0,0.522843778133392334,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, co-op is really the only way I play most survival games. From inventory bugging out so my slots were unusable to us not being able to see each other's items or built structures, not to mention having to drop something every time I wanted to use something already in my inventory because it for some reason wants to move the single stacked item to take up another slot for me to use it, just too many bugs to list. The game has so much potential if they can just fix the multiplayer. Unsure when/if that will be, as the last update was in December. :(

EDIT: We decided to give it another go after I left my initial review. Despite the bugs still being ever-present, we did manage to make a bit more progress than our first few attempts, so it's incredibly hit-or-miss as to what kind of experience you'll have with co-op. 

I just can't recommend the game in its current multiplayer state, especially not for a 1.0 release. We might keep struggling along with it, but I would suggest others wait for a big sale on this to buy it. Full price is too much, especially if you're like us and really only want to play it with people. The bugs make it feel like it's still in very early access, though I will say the graphics are lovely.

Also I found out you have to defeat huge creatures to finish the game and get the parts for the plane, I don't like this game play as its not realistic and the fighting mechanic is just poor.

WARNING: Co-OP is Broken..  
--Now, newer game, maybe new crew, awesome. Learning & creating a game is great. so they get plenty of lee-way on this, plus they have to compete with other similar games (Like Raft) and they start with what i wanted to try in that game, the base building part. Nice world creation idea to.

The part I must WARN people who are looking for co-op or any multiplayer, the game forces host, and all other players to 'sync' up, pulls out all the players into a new load screen, which may or may not actually connect.  (black screen with loading word on it) so you can't even play while others attempt to connect, (if it was seconds, or maybe 1 min game freeze, doable) but sitting 4-10 minutes to have it connect, not feasible. (which, while doing this, put us over the ""time played"" to not qualify for refund)

Until they get this fixed, it really made the whole interest of doing this with friends and exploring the world of this game strictly unplayable.  

Disclaimer: besides attempting to join/create other sessions online, I have NOT explored the single player experience, as a general review of other reviews, the amount of bugs and play for a single player does not appeal to me nor do i have confidence that it's been polished enough to be tolerable play for a full-release game.

host can play properly, client/second player keeps getting fucked over with bugs or random crashes

a few bugs I've come across include:

- no longer being able to drag items like the boat
- no longer being able to attack
- not being able to save the game (prompt is not given, only sleeping is possible)
- and of course being kicked out of the session by the game itself

another thing that is incredibly annoying is the fact that when you start up the game, the intro music is ear-numbingly loud and the settings aren't saved properly. You adjust the volume only for the game to completely ignore this upon the next startup UNTIL you go back to settings -> audio

bugs double checked by hosting the game myself/ having a friend host it instead.

not recommended unless those problems are fixed

other than that it's a really fun game to play but I can imagine the bugs listed above could be annoying for anyone

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Stranded Deep is a survival game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Your plane crashes in the ocean and you have to get to the lifeboat and survive.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game starts off with you in the plane  as it goes down and then you must leave the plane and board the lifeboat and paddle to a nearby island. My main issue with the game is there is no real winning. You go from tiny island to tiny island. In a dozen hours I never found an island I couldn't stand in the middle of and see the ocean on all sides. The islands don't have sufficient supplies to establish a base and there is no point in setting down roots on an island to live from one boring day to the next.

Crafting leaves a lot to be desired. It starts off with having to create a Water Still. You need to create a coconut flask, an item that is not in your crafting list. You can eventually find one, but if you have a raw coconut and lashing you can craft one. Once you get poisoned you might as well just lay down and die because you won't be able to find the items required to create an antidote and death is the only other option. But, you don't even know what to look for as it isn't in the crafting recipes you have. Having all of the items required for a Boat Motor in my inventory, and it still doesn't come up as a crafting option until you equip your hammer. So, I try to craft the motor, but can't find a way to attacch it to the lifeboat. So all of those cool vehicles you see on the store page, you're going to need to search the web for how to get them, because they aren't in your crafting book. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
The game has promise, but is hamstrung by its crafting, small islands, and no clear goals.

Stranded deep is a fantastic game. The survival aspects are difficult without being dark souls, the crafting system is the right level of wonk and sense that you need for a fun but not tedious survivalcraft, the controls are simple to understand without being press-button-to-win, the enemies are balanced enough that there's going to be a bit of strategy on new islands even into the late game, without being unfair at low levels.

Unfortunately, the physics engine is a mess, and multiplayer has frequent game-breaking glitches. The game will decide that taking certain items (like logs or tree heads) into your hands means that the chest you were about to put it in needs to be yeeted into the distance, sometimes putting items into a secured chest on a raft will result in the item both having physics where it was in your hands while also being inside the chest, resulting in a tipped raft...meat isn't separated into cooked and uncooked, so if you eat too fast you might get poisoned by raw meat even if you had enough cooked meat in the same stack...

And when you get to the multiplayer, sometimes the game will decide that only the host needs to be able to interact with items, resulting in the other players needing to disconnect and reconnect (which temporarily boots the host to a 5 minute loading screen) in order to eat/drink what's in their hand.

This isn't even halfway through all the glitches I encountered, and my review is already too long. This game is glorious and has a heck of a lot of promise, but the frequency of the glitches mean it's not really playable in its current state.",1689984944,1689984944,False,7,0,0.607097625732421875,0,True,False,False

Almost 20 hours spent on this game each between my partner and I and while the mechanics and UI is fun and interesting (actually makes you think and look at guides rather than being dead simple) the bugs are the lowlight here. 

We had rafts fly out from under us while sailing because my partner was holding a log, rafts flipping over as I was dragging a shark to shore, coming back to our island and realizing 5 containers have suddenly gone missing (setting us back a considerable amount of time as we had lost all our tools and rare items). Not being able to interact with items/containers that one of us had dropped and the list goes on. While the game is fun, I'm not sure we would continue playing in the state that it is in currently as our progress could suddenly be lost for no apparent reason. 

On a last note, imo if a game makes you look at guides and tutorials, the devs did not do a good job on showing the basics and tutorials. Eg. the fuel still should have a prompt to say that it requires potatoes to make fuel, regular enemies in the game should have some sort of visible health bar and they shouldnt be able to glitch out of the island, running into the ether.",1689831924,1689831924,False,12,3,0.637098550796508789,0,True,False,False

Not too challenging to make me wanna quite the game, but still difficult enough to force me to think ahead and be careful while using rare resources. Most enemies are relatively simple to fight, but do have some nuances that make them interesting. For instance, the giant crab is weaker than the hog in terms of health, but if you shoot it with and arrow or throw your spear at it, your projectile breaks, so it forces you into melee. The limited resources initially felt burdensome and grindy, but when I realized that you're supposed to overcome this by exploring, it became a lot more fun and interesting. There is one really annoying bug that I have encountered where pressing the mouse buttons no longer does anything, which can be frustrating, Luckily reloading your save does fix the issue, but you can only save at shelters so you may lose a lot of progress which can really suck.

It has a really fun looting and crafting system with a skill tree and leveling aspect to it. These are traits to making a fun, lasting experience. I rate the game 2 / 5 stars, and not 5 due to the subsequent reasons.

The only caveat which caused my friends and I to stop playing a couple hours in was the total lack of probably the most important resource: fiber. 

Everything seems to need fiber, and your small island has a very small amount. You need fiber to do practically everything, even going to a new island that to find more fiber. You can plant the fiber trees, but it's level locked and to unlock it you need to craft a multitude of items that all need fiber. The plant plot also needs a bunch of fiber. 

The main issue with all this is it doesn't respawn, and you'll find at best 8 fiber pieces on your island. It baffles me seeing the store page images showing all that progression because I know for us it was impossible to progress due to lacking basic resources every playthrough.",1689798714,1689798714,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

""higher"" materials like barrels or tires don't make anything better on a custom raft, its just for looks. so you may as well just make one out of sticks. once you make yourself a big raft and attach the 10+ boxes you collect on a single island, you've pretty much beaten the game.

This game is good, but it isn't great. I've had many new experiences, such as sharking, coastal rafting, and ocean diving. I've also been dragged underneath by sharks until it turned black, I have fallen off my raft in the middle of the ocean and watched it drift away, and even died from giant hogs.

Get this game, and take some time to get past the frustrating UI, because once you've muscle-memorized everything you will have such a blast surviving.

The loading screens are infuriatingly long, and if you get disconnected and have to relog (which is often) the main player also has to sit through the abnormally long load. 
There is no way to talk to people you are playing with if you join a random online which is super inconvenient. 
The animals have super weird tracks and glitch all over the place. Boars fly. Sharks swim on land. Fish swim in the air. *facepalm*
There is only a few things in the ocean to enjoy. Everything else will kill you. Not to mention eels will poison you, and there is nothing you can do to them.

The only upsides are the islands are pretty, and it is cool you can fly and make certain things. Other than that wait till it goes on sale, or don't waste your money.

The game does some things good, hence why I've played it plenty of hours. But if I knew about all the bad things I'll list below, I'd choose something else to buy.

• Very bad view distance, even on highest settings. Strange because this is about being out on the ocean looking out for islands and different objectives. Game even has binoculars.
• A ton of fish you can't hurt or interact with.
• Some thing that look very dangerous are completely harmless and no interaction (same as above).
• Some trees you can chop down, some you can't.
• Several items that are pretty much useless that you can gather several stacks of but you can only craft 1-2 things with, that you only need to craft once. And the game makes you think you'll unlock a lot more things to craft as you level up.
• Quite little raft options.
• Lots of inconsistencies.
• Zero feedback if you do something incorrect with the wrong tool or so.
• Fruit and vegetables never respawning so they can completely go extinct in your world. And they seem to be able to de-spawn as well if you get close to them, not see them and walk away. This can make it impossible to complete the story.
• Extremely minimal guiding + random generated world layout = You might end up like me who basically unlocked everything, built everything, maxed my skills, found 90% of islands before finding any story progression/bosses.
• Flying pigs, erratic animal movements, weird melee hitboxes.
• Bosses can re-spawn while you are fighting them.
• A useful world map in the main menu that you can't access is in the actual game while playing.
• Bad story (almost no story).
• Useless furnitures that could easily have added features.
• Got pretty grindy and repetitive quickly due to lack of content and story elements.
• Why are there not metal tools but you can build metal houses? And why is there an achievement to build 10 metal furnitures, but the only metal furniture to build are 1 table and 1 shelf (both purely cosmetic lul).
• Sucky keybinding system for binding tools to hotkeys (I ended up not using it at all).

OK. It basically feels unpolished and not fully complete. I still enjoyed the little progression there was; building my first own raft, getting strong enough to repeatedly kill sharks and try to get some achievements.

I guess since this has been in early access since 2015(?) and fully released 2021 I don't have any hope to fix any of this. Fingers crossed though ^^ I think there are more recently developed games that are better.",1689383020,1689383184,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So! Dev peeps, This section is just for you oooor I guess for anyone who wants to read it, idc. The chance a dev even reads this is slim to none, but! here we go. Building in this game could be so much more fun with three little changes; 
  - Plantable, growable trees to replenish wood supplies.
  - Relaxing the overzealous ""cannot build here"" thing because you're a pixel too close to something, sometimes it's something not even visible.
  - Bringing walls and stairs down about a brick to prevent the huge gaps for buildings more than one level tall before a roof section. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you want to build a lighthouse!

There is a 4th which would be pretty easy to implement I think, (and this one's more for weirdos like me) give the garden plots an option with a key press or when selecting to build them to auto-level instead of matching terrain.

I would definitely recommend Stranded Deep to anyone who loves the idea of trying to survive in a tropical environment with sunken ships, sharks, and the ability to build bases and rafts to traverse the island chains to uncover a way out.

I have never tried the multiplayer option so I don't know how it is. A lot of people are saying its pretty buggy and crashes a lot which is unfortunate, but I would definitley say to give single player survival a go to see how long you can survive. 

What I can say is take your time to learn the ins and outs. Using a quick press and a long hold of ""C"" to craft items that you pick up is your best friend. And ""Tab is your Backback"" Make a Coconut flask, a Water still, and a food smoker as fast as you can. If you can do these and then spear hunt fish you should be golden and good to go to work your way up. Also, the raft has emergency supplies if you need them.

Just be careful of Purple pokey starfish, sharks, crabs, snakes, boars, and you will be the best castaway survivor out there.",1689188436,1689188436,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, this shipwreck of a game fails to deliver on its enticing premise, leaving players stranded in a sea of frustration and disappointment, especially after coming to it after playing Raft and Valheim. 
First and foremost, the game's visuals are lackluster and fail to impress. While the tropical island setting initially seems appealing, the graphics quickly reveal their outdated nature. The textures are dull and muddy, lacking the level of detail one would expect from a game released in this era. The lack of visual polish severely hampers the immersion and fails to capture the awe-inspiring beauty of a tropical paradise.
Stranded Deep's gameplay mechanics are equally underwhelming. Multiplayer is an insult – after restarting several times, the game crashed on the third island when I tried to build a roof for my shack. The survival elements, which should be the core focus of the game, feel shallow and tedious. Gathering resources quickly becomes a monotonous chore, as the game lacks depth in its okay-ish crafting system. Building a simple structure in this game is a test of patience and will and it feels as satisfying as befriending an angry eel. 
Furthermore, the game's AI is a constant source of frustration. Whether it's the erratic behavior of wildlife or the clumsy movements of enemy creatures, the lack of consistency and realism in their actions is glaring. These shortcomings break any semblance of immersion, making it difficult to suspend disbelief and truly engage with the game world.
Another major flaw is the lack of meaningful objectives and progression. While survival games often rely on the thrill of exploration and the sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming challenges, Stranded Deep fails to provide satisfying goals or a compelling narrative. As a result, the gameplay quickly becomes a repetitive loop of mundane tasks without any sense of purpose or direction.
Moreover, the game suffers from a number of technical issues and glitches. From frequent crashes and save file corruptions to problematic collision detection, these technical hiccups further undermine the already disappointing experience. It's frustrating to invest time and effort into a game, only to have it hindered by an abundance of technical difficulties.
Lastly, the developers' lackluster support and minimal updates add insult to injury. Despite the game's numerous issues, it seems that the developers have largely abandoned it, leaving players stranded with their frustrations. The lack of meaningful updates and communication with the player community suggests a lack of commitment and care, further exacerbating the game's overall disappointment.
In conclusion, Stranded Deep fails to live up to its promising concept and falls flat in almost every aspect. Lackluster visuals, shallow gameplay mechanics, frustrating AI, absence of meaningful objectives, technical issues, and a lack of developer support all contribute to a deeply unsatisfying experience. It's difficult to recommend Stranded Deep when there are far superior survival games available on the market that provide a more engaging and polished experience.

Initial impressions were pretty good, the water grind was a little bit rough, but the game seemed fine enough as far as survival sims go, then came the first disconnect/desync of what ended up being many.

Every time you reconnect to a server on this game, you and everyone attached to the server have to ""sync world"", a process that takes a good few minutes, even when everyone you know has a great connection, almost no ping and relatively beefy rigs.

Reconnecting wouldn't be an issue if the server was stable, unfortunately it's just not, we probably lost connection a good 5-6 times over our roughly 2 hours of owning the game.   A few minutes every time this happens means we basically wasted 15-20 minutes just waiting for multiplayer to connect, however the final nail in coffin was the world desyncs.

Stuff you build, objects you harvest and even enemies sometimes wont show up for everyone.   Half the time, what you build simply refuses to function, the prompt may be there but nothing happens when you use said object, also, getting attacked by a boar/shark only you can see, or getting poisoned by something invisible is incredibly frustrating.

After dealing with all the disconnects and then this, I just cant imagine dealing with these issues over a period of time lasting longer than a couple hours, making this the second game I've ever refunded on Steam.

This game's been out since April 2020 man, issues like this should be fixed by now, or so you'd think; I'd honestly still be playing it if so.",1688594023,1688594023,False,4,0,0.547753274440765381,0,True,False,False

Some of it is due to being designed for both PC and console, which on the one hand does increase the userbase and thus developer ressources. On the other, you still end up with a poorly designed PC interface which should mean worse reviews and lower PC sales. Either way, I ended up fighting the interface much more than the environment for no discernible reason. The radial inventories are merely wasteful, the biggest issue is that you can't carry big stuff with both hands (at, for instance, the price of losing access to the rest of your inventory while you do so) but have to drag everything awkwardly holding right mouse button. This extends to smaller stuff as well, you can place meat in the smoker, but have to drop it on the floor and then right mouse fling it onto the hobo stove. There is a skill levelling system but it's no barrier to crafting (which is good) but also doesn't for instance allow you to bypass annoying animations at higher levels so not sure what it is needed for.
The loot is weird, lots of compasses and motor parts, very few stones and most importantly, little in the way of dual use. You either have the part you need or you don't. You practically never end up regretting a particular crafting decision because later finds open up different opportunities, it's very simple and linear in that respect.

It had potential but it was mostly a janky, grind to try and keep your bars up long enough to explore.
It mostly seemed to lean into the worst of the mid 2010's survival game trope.

8 years later I decided to give it another shot.
It looks marginally prettier now, but it's still not worth you money.
Even if you like survival/crafting games, this game is not fun.
Your food and water bars deplete ridiculously fast, but eating or drinking too much will make you shit yourself, depleting both of them even more.
Its set in the tropics, but you have an 'SPF' bar than basically makes you stand and do nothing in the shade while it takes minutes to refill, thats when the game actually registers you being in shade.
Movement is janky, your stamina and oxygen bars for running and swimming are gone in about 10 seconds and theres even bars for how good you are at

1. More good to say than bad. Overall the aesthetics and atmosphere of the game is virtually unparalleled in my opinion. The excitement of exploring, the way the shipwrecks and coves make your imagination ponder not only the games story, but if there's places like this on Earth that still lay untouched (unlikely - but nice thought).

2. Upkeep is annoying. Having to refill fibre into water collectors takes enjoyment out of the game somewhat. I understand that this is a survival but it just feels unnecessary. 

3. Getting poisoned at the start of the game is possibly the most irritating thing ever. Either make antidote relatively easy to come across or remove altogether - such a silly mechanic in the early game.... ESPECIALLY for new players (makes you just want to stop playing).

4. BUGS/GLITCHES - my raft which I spent 7 hours working towards got stuck on some shipwreck and even in fly mode I couldn't budge it. Finally, after 20 minutes or so of faffing around, I got it loose but now it is unusable because I cant right click and move it????? HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? It made me extremely angry and I quit the game, when I revisit I will likely remake using the console but I would rather you just not put shallow level ships on every island which easily interfere with the raft. Make an invisible wall so you cant go near or something.

Lastly, I like the game a lot, exploring and playing feels both therapeutic and exciting.... BUT,  it genuinely feels unplayable at times due to BS issues. Please fix.

I rate positive because for £15.99 I would still have purchased and played this game.

EDIT: Several months later I tried playing the game, 7 hours in and a bug where I died shortly after saving meaning that I am stuck in a death loop when entering the game. Seriously guys? Several people have reported this issue over the years and you haven't done anything about it? Earliest report of this was 3 years ago....",1674141444,1687017068,False,0,0,0.660431206226348877,0,True,False,False

What finally caused me the ""thumbs down"" on this game: Lack of any ""mapping"" system or a mountable compass to (easily) keep up with your direction and places you've discovered. You have to give up stability (risk falling off the raft) to ""anything"" while sailing and, sometimes, you get glitched into the water and lose your craft. There should be a ""mountable"" area for your compass to aid you in sailing but isn't.

And, really, the premises of this game is a little underwhelming: Find the big ship and the parts to leave.


This is basically the video game version of ""Castaway"" with much deeper and darker situations. Thankfully, the ""modders"" have made this game better.

Once i finished the game i felt a little let down because it was so anti-climactic. If it hadn't been for modders i think i would have quit playing the game all-together.

Rating: 4/5

Stranded Deep is a captivating survival game that thrusts players into an unforgiving world of deserted islands and treacherous waters. Developed by Beam Team Games, this title offers a unique blend of exploration, crafting, and survival mechanics, delivering an immersive and adrenaline-pumping experience.

One of the standout features of Stranded Deep is its atmospheric setting. As you find yourself marooned on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, the game's stunning visuals and attention to detail immediately draw you into its world. From the shimmering blue waters to the lush vegetation and diverse marine life, the game excels at creating a visually striking and believable environment.

The core gameplay revolves around the struggle for survival. You'll have to scavenge for resources, hunt for food, and build shelter to protect yourself from the elements. The crafting system is robust, allowing you to combine various materials and items to create tools, weapons, and even rafts to explore nearby islands. The sense of progression is satisfying as you gradually upgrade your gear and expand your survival capabilities.

What sets Stranded Deep apart from other survival games is its focus on realism. The game incorporates elements such as hunger, thirst, and injuries, adding a layer of complexity to the survival mechanics. You'll have to manage your limited resources wisely, making tough decisions about when to venture out for supplies and when to conserve energy. The threat of dangerous wildlife and environmental hazards keeps you on your toes, creating a constant sense of tension and excitement.

Exploration is a key aspect of the game, and Stranded Deep delivers in this regard. Each island you encounter holds its own mysteries and unique resources, encouraging you to venture further and discover hidden secrets. From underwater shipwrecks to ancient ruins, the game rewards curiosity and encourages you to fully explore its vast open world.

While Stranded Deep offers a thrilling and immersive survival experience, it does have a few shortcomings. The game can sometimes feel repetitive, especially in the early stages, as you follow similar routines to gather resources and survive. Additionally, the absence of a compelling narrative or long-term goals may disappoint those seeking a more story-driven experience.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Stranded Deep succeeds in delivering a captivating survival game that will keep you engaged for hours on end. Its stunning visuals, realistic mechanics, and sense of exploration make it a standout title in the genre. Whether you're a fan of survival games or looking for a challenging and immersive experience, Stranded Deep is well worth your time.",1588367012,1686510168,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Than there is the moment when you think evrything is working and all of a sudden you aren't able to do anything besides collectin or crafting, so you are slowly starving or getting killed by some monstrous crabs.

BRAVO!! I am leaving my old review so other's can see what some of as asked for compared to what we got. Thanks again. ;)
...................................................................................................................................................


[OLD REVIEW]
So guys, let's fix this:
- The maps need to allow you to ""name"" or ""label"" the islands you have been to. If you were able to make fabric in the game, build entire settlements, water sources and whatnot, you would also be able to make your own map. Now, if this IS in the game and I'm just not seeing it...make it a little more accessible.
-Sunburn progression is a bit fast. Some people do not burn that quickly and not having plants that respawn or regrow doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  I mean, what's the point of building a house on an island that has little to no resources left...yeah yeah ""just go to another island""...but not having a map (like I mentioned above) can make island hopping a huge hassle. I have literally had to make arrows by manipulating objects on the island and using the label maker on items to explain to myself how to get back to my ""home"" island. Like....make this a SMIDGEN easier by allowing us to create our own maps. Please? 
-Not being able stack crates is just...well it's just dumb. If we have to navigate to other islands with our tiny little hands and backpack AND you've given us crates (which store very little), can we please be able to stack them on our rafts so that we can transport our crap back and forth? Like....we would totally do that if we were actually surviving, right? I would. Now, you CAN attempt to stack them but if the wind blows just right, they will literally ""explode"" and SINK (even though they are made of wood) and everything you just traversed across the expanse of the sea to collect for your little island is GONE, forever...including the crate. You can't just swim down there and get it, either.
-Some of the harder to make tools should last longer. Having to rinse and repeat all the above stuff just to make a sturdy knife, just to turn around and have to do it ten more times gets really tedious. More tedious than it actually would be in real life, because plants would grow back eventually, saplings would turn into adult trees, you can cut those down, thus spreading the seed and you'd think a new tree would start growing, right? 
Come on ya'll. This game has some serious potential. I'd pay twice what I paid for a game with like this with all the fixings.",1602727625,1685952276,True,7,0,0.571516156196594238,2,True,False,True

-graphics are interesting, the textures and animation aren't the best (player models are outright bad), but the lighting effects are very nice. 
-gameplay is ok, always something to do, and some neat locations to discover. can get bogged down by storage management.
-polish is... mediocre at best usually, this game has been an early access for years, and still feels like an early access game, at least BeamTeam didn't take the approach of releasing a bad game and patching it later. some locales are very engaging though.
-ending thoughts: I like this game as a time-killer and exploration sim. bad animation can ruin immersion. it's a bad game in good ways mostly. 

Coming back to the game after a long time, i now feel as if there's a lack of recipes and progression in tooling. I feel as if there should perhaps be upgrades to farming and mining.

A friend of mine convinced me to have a look at ""Stranded Deep"".
I was under the assumption that it was still in Early Access, which surprisingly it wasn't!
The problem here is, after just 30 minutes of gameplay (Singleplayer) i felt as if it was still in Early Access.

Later the same day, my buddy and i started an Co-op session which proofed to be as fun as the singleplayer. (not)

Among Syncproblems (he had stuff in his hands which he put down already: paddle, stone, spear etc) 
we got a random disconnect, starting with me being booted and then him crashing back to main menu shortly after.

The animations look very..clonky, the soundengineering is not the best. item icons look rather cheap..

I know, the game costs not too much, its just that 15€ but to call it ""Released"" is way too early in my opinion.
Like in many other games, i can see potential but seriously, right now you should only get it when you enjoy a singleplayer survival game which is a little rough around the edges.

It's a game that will suit many people, as it has the 'creative mode' for those that just want to mess around, or 'passive' animals for those that want the lite-survival, or full survival mode which can be very challenging until you know everything.

There are bugs/glitches, though they don't ""significantly"" detract from enjoying the game. Things like fish flying above the water, watching a boar render in the distance - 20 feet in the air, abruptly fall, then run circles in the air. Cutting down a tree to watch it go flying across the island. Re-arranging barrel scrap 50 times before the game allows you to build it in to your raft. You know, funny bugs/glitches - minor irritations at worst.
Navigating by compass and still getting lost.. feels bad. It's very fortunate that the ""Cartographer"" option is there to see where in the world the player is, but seeing that your base is due East, you go due East, then find you're on the bottom of the map... yeah.

All this being said, minor irritations aside, I still recommend this game. It's fun, picturesque, enjoyable and frankly (regardless of the annoying potato grind) - I am very much looking forward to flying the Gyrocopter! That being said, I've had my raft motor for ages but absolutely no fuel because finding potatoes was.. challenging (after the one on my starter island died before I knew how incredibly important it was).

Ingredients
for 6 servings

7 tablespoons butter
4 oz cream cheese
½ cup milk
8 eggs, yolk
¼ cup flour
¼ cup cornstarch
13 large egg whites
⅔ cup granulated sugar
hot water, for baking
powdered sugar, for serving
1 pt Strawberries, for serving

Preparation
Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C).
In a small pot over medium heat, whisk together the butter, cream cheese, and milk until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool.
In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then slowly drizzle in the cream cheese mixture, stirring until evenly combined.
Sift in the flour and the cornstarch, whisking to make sure there are no lumps.
In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
Fold about ¼ of the egg whites and into the yolk mixture, then repeat with the remaining egg whites until the batter is evenly combined.
Grease the bottom of a 9 x 3-inch (23 x 7.5 cm) round cake pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper. If using a spring form pan, make sure to wrap the bottom and sides completely in foil twice to prevent any leakage.
Pour the batter into the pan and shake to release any large air bubbles.
Place the pan into a larger baking dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels ensure that the heat is distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan about 1-inch (2-cm) high with hot water.
Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 285°F (140°C), and bake for another 55 minutes, until the cake has risen to almost double its original height.
Remove from oven, and carefully invert the cake onto your dominant hand and peel off the paper. Be extremely careful, the cake will be hot. You can also invert the cake onto a plate, but this will cause the cake to deflate more.
Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar, then slice and serve with strawberries while still warm!

Multiplayer is also great. I have such a fun time wandering around, exploring, and building with my friends.

There's also a bit of a balancing act when considering the game as it was almost entirely developed by just two people and in that respect is a very ambitious title, but on the other hand there are many issues which were tolerable when it was in early access but should not still be present now we essentially have the finished product. For context, my 125 hours of gameplay consists of several incomplete playthroughs where I got bored and didn't play for a few months at a time, and one complete playthrough which I eventually worked up the motivation for.

Graphically the game looks nice on first glance with a suitably colourful tropical environment, decent water textures and some nice lighting effects. Up close however everything is quite low res, and worse still the game suffers from the worst object and texture pop-in I've seen in a long time, it reminds me of an old PS1 game where large objects on the horizon suddenly appear out of nowhere and textures remain in super low resolution even at quite close distances. For a game which involves a lot of long distance exploration in an open world this isn't great.

The audio effects are perfectly fine overall. The music adds a bit of atmosphere and the sound effects are generally ok, although the very limited 'voice acting' (in quotations because it's really just the odd single word comment from your player character) gets repetitive quickly.

The UI is functional although the crafting menu isn't the best, it would be nice if it remembered where you last had it open so you didn't need to scroll through every single time. Also, while the game makes it quite clear what items are needed to craft various recipes, it doesn't always give a great indication of what the resulting product is actually used for. I had played for a very long time for example before I discovered that a meat smoker isn't actually exactly the same as a campfire for cooking food.

Gameplay wise, Stranded Deep suffers from the exact same issue that most survival games do - a rapidly diminishing difficulty in the survival aspect itself. The first few days in game definitely require a bit of careful thought with regard to gathering food and water and so on, but once you've crafted even just a basic encampment it becomes very unlikely you'll be in danger of dying of thirst or starvation or whatever. Another issue with the crafting is that a number of the objects you can make are actually pretty useless in the grand scheme of things. Now admittedly if you just treat the game like a sandbox and don't worry about the endgame (which is entirely optional to complete) being able to build houses and so on is quite fun, but there's hardly anything to furnish your creations with and from a survival point of view a massive house is really no more useful than the simple shelter you can build right from the start, other than perhaps providing a bit of storage space. Likewise you have things like toolbelts which you might imagine allow you to increase your inventory space but in reality just provide some quickslots for accessing items which isn't really worth bothering with.

Regarding the game world, once the survival aspect has been dealt to, which as I mentioned above will happen pretty quickly, the emphasis switches to exploring the game world. This is fun to begin with as the different islands will have different loot and resources to find, but it very quickly becomes apparent that there is very little variety in the randomly generated islands. They essentially just fall into two categories - big islands with pine trees and wild pigs, and small islands with palm trees and crabs. Once you've visited three or four islands close to your starting island you will have pretty much seen everything the game world has to offer. It is worth mentioning that player created maps and islands are readily downloadable and this is probably the best way to play from an exploration point of view but it's a shame the default content seems so limited in scope.

Finally, it's worth mentioning that the game world itself is still fairly glitchy - it's very common to see animals spawning in mid air, fish swimming through the air during storms, wild pigs running around underwater on the beach, and so on. None of these issues are game breaking for sure, but they do hurt immersion.

So with all the problems I've pointed out above it might be difficult to see why I'm giving this a recommendation, but ultimately if you're looking for a survival game which is just you against the environment this is probably one of the more complete games available. Buy it when it's on sale and you probably won't regret it, but expect to constantly feel like you're playing a game which is still in pretty early access.",1682294536,1682294536,True,13,0,0.650793671607971191,1,True,False,False

I would still avoid this game. It is visually appealing, but that is about as far as it goes. The game feels like it is still in early Alpha stage with so many bugs and glitches it just makes it a frustrating experience. From snagging on scenery and jarring transitions between water and land, it just breaks you out of the immersion the game tries to give you. Simple physics like jumping and climbing is just too strange a process. 

For example, to get on top of a boat, there is a ladder, but the ladder isn't usable. For some unknown reason you have to climb up the wall, which is a combination of running headlong into the wall while randomly mashing jump. Only occasionally will your character even jump. If you are in water, you will randomly find yourself unable to surface as you get snagged on a stray atom that means you have to WASD yourself like mad to get free.

Building is a nightmare. It goes white when you can build and red when intersecting with scenery. Makes sense. Except when it doesn't. Want to build a raft base on that flat bit of beach? No chance. There is a grain of sand that is too high. You have to wade out into chest-deep shark infested water and try to put some planks down. 

How about building a home? Nope. Same issue. That non-interactive leaf in the way means you will have to have a 2m x 2m hole in the floor where you cannot place that piece of floor. 

I can't believe the game still has these issues since 2015. I think they just got bored of it and decided to release it. 

There are mods out for the game, but they are so unsupported they often crash the game. 

Save your money.

EDIT: 2023... Still very much the same. Placing objects is still a very frustrating process. Leaves still hamper you putting down items. You have to hack the entire tree down and clean up the debris just because a single leaf is blocking your path. I am swearing at this games physics more than I am enjoying it.

Although there are some bugs in the game that can be frustrating, they are mostly funny rather than distracting. Plus, if you play with friends, you can laugh together at these funny moments and enjoy surviving on the island even more.

The game's world is procedural generated, offering a new and dynamic experience for each play through. One of the standout features of Stranded Deep is its attention to detail.

+Positives+

+Loneliness feeling
+Decent graphics
+Some crafting

-Negatives-

-Garbage dynamics 
-Bugs everywhere 
-Fishes follows static line, their movements are not interactive with waves, when storm happens, fishes are flying 
-Not only fishes, wildlife also flying
-Speaking of wildlife, there are only 3 land based animals. Boars, armored crabs and snakes
-Boars circle around everywhere, even on the ocean
-Story is laughable, there are 3 almost impossible to find monsters and you have to kill them to finish the game
-Those creatures are so hard to kill, it is possible but there is no saving option on the raft or sea, so you are wasting your hours to kill stupid monsters
-Even on normal difficulty, game takes lots of hours from you, very less content but huge amount of game hours. What a lazy devs..
-Lack of content, elements
-Almost no animations
-Loot system also trash
-You can loose your item while carrying sometimes
-There are gyrocopter and raft with motor, but to get fuel you have to boil potatoes, finding potatoes is so f*ucking hard, growing them requires 3746597346574943 days. Pretty useless game
-There are 2 fruits, i've managed to visit almost all island in the game but i couldn't find the one called quawava or something, and you need them for treatment of bleeding, reducing spawn of something on these conditions is like ''hello im a lazy dev, can you play my game for 100+ hours, sorry not much content though''
-Repetitive gameplay
-Many, many more 


This game should had 5-8 hours length because of less content. But it inhibits you by level system, loot spawns, lack of everything. I wasn't waiting for this

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.

- 2 players maximum for multiplayer ??? like at that point just make it solo player.
- Speaking of multiplayer, only way to revive your co-op partner is with a bandage. Which you only get 1 at the start. With no recipe or hint on how to get more.
- Give us the ability to turn off the annoying flashing during storms or at least make it not as bad. Don't need a csgo flashbang in my face every 5 minutes per storm.
- Can't skip the starting cutscene so you have to watch it every new save even tho there was no point in trying to have a bioshock-esque opening just to have us swim 2ft out of a plane.
- No proper tutorials or information by the way, how the hell am I supposed to know how to craft a coconut flask when no recipe or even a hint on how to make that??? 0 tutorial or information unless I go on a wiki or google which is crazy that it knows more about the game than the game itself.
- I wasn't starving, poisoned, bleeding, etc or anything but I couldn't tell what I was taking damage from then proceeded to get stuck on a rock and die instantly?? bro- how 
- Can only cook 1 item at a time on the fire pit so I thought maybe the stove will let me cook more ! I was super wrong when the food  (1 item btw) still went on the fire pit but this time it was under the stove and I was unable to cook more or even pick up my food.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1678858866,1678858866,True,35,0,0.687925994396209717,0,True,False,False

While the game follows the proven formula (gather ressources, craft tools, use tools to gather other ressources, fend off predators, hunt prey) and has a pretty clear cut objective (it's in the trailer), Stranded Deep ultimately get's it wrong, unfortunately.

Navigating the seas is frustrating, as there is no map. I can live with that, provided there is some way to navigate between landmarks (which there isn`t - be prepared to reload if you get lost and don`t want to abandon what you've built).

Islands and wrecks basically all just have the same ressources, and exploration is absolutely NOT rewarding. Diving may tickle your Thalassophobia a little, though.

Inventory management is a hassle, although the crafting system is well implemented. A skill system is used, but I feel it is only there to lock out some vehicle crafting recipes until you've built enough structures on several islands.

There is much less pointless busywork (I`m looking at you, Raft!), but much of the time in game is spent watching the waves, as you search for the very few important landmarks while steering (good thing the wind magically changes to match the heading of your raft). This makes progress feel like a snail trying to crawl over sandpaper.

Lastly, we experienced connectivity issues at least once per hour in the game. The guest client is then immediately disconnected, and reconnecting forces both clients to fully sync the game world, which takes around four minutes staring at the loading screen.

[b] Overview: [/b]
Stranded Deep is an enthralling open world survival game that offers players an unforgettable adventure. Developed by Beam Team Games, this game will test your survival skills as you find yourself stranded in the Pacific Ocean following a mysterious plane crash. With no means to call for help, you must craft, build, and hunt for resources to survive.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]
In Stranded Deep, players are tasked with exploring the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean while collecting supplies, crafting tools and weapons, and building shelters to stay alive. You will need to manage your character's hunger, thirst, and exposure levels through an interactive survival watch. The game also allows you to level up skills such as harvesting, craftsmanship, cooking, physical, and hunting to increase efficiency and unlock new crafting combinations.

[b] Crafting: [/b]
The game features an interactive crafting menu that allows you to craft various tools and weapons such as spears, axes, bows, and spearguns. You can also quick-craft items from your inventory or the ground around you. The crafting system allows you to turn almost anything into something useful, making resource management a crucial aspect of the game.

[b] Building: [/b]
Players can build their own homes away from home with dozens of tiers and building pieces to choose from. You can start with a weak and flimsy palm frond shack and upgrade to a solid clay brick house. Customizing your raft with sails, canopies, storage, anchors, and boat motors, or constructing a gyrocopter, are also great ways to explore the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.

[b] Exploration: [/b]
The game's procedurally generated world ensures that no two islands are the same. Players can dive for sunken shipwrecks, search for abandoned shelters from previous survivors, or search for rare sea creatures like whales. Hunting, fishing, trapping, and skinning animals are other ways to collect food or assert your dominance over the Pacific islands. There are also three bosses to take on, which offer rewards upon defeating them.

[b] Multiplayer: [/b]
Stranded Deep allows for online or split-screen co-op modes, making the game even more enjoyable to play with friends. You can also customize your world through the map island editor, which allows you to manually place trees, rocks, and creatures to create your own adventure island to share with friends.

[b] Conclusion: [/b]
Overall, Stranded Deep is an excellent open-world survival game that offers players a unique and exciting experience. With its immersive gameplay, stunning graphics, and challenging survival mechanics, it's definitely worth playing. So if you're looking for a game that will test your survival skills and provide hours of entertainment, then Stranded Deep is the perfect choice.",1678059886,1678059886,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a Survival Game, this one is actually pretty good. When you read about what survivors in the Pacific Ocean had to go through to survive; this game puts you right into that feeling.
You have to worry about food, sleep, and the elements; including the local hostile fauna. 
I do wish there was a bit more 'guidance' with how to procure certain things/items, or at least when to expect such things.
I understand why the Dev's have made some things ambiguous, as to leave it up to us to figure it out, but it would have made my first 15 hours a lot easier on the PC Windows Gamepass version a lot easier.

As for mechanics in Stranded Deep, there are some frustrating moments, when exploring a ship and the waves make it difficult. The water mechanics pass through the objects, walls-etc, without any effect on the water what-so-ever. It just rises and lowers, at a variable rate.
I haven't found too many 'glitches' or 'bugs' that are majorly game breaking.
MAIN BUG FOUND - Sometimes in Multiplayer, one player becomes desync'd and we have to 'SAVE-REHOST' to get them back sync'd up.
If you have patience to learn the game and the patience for that one bug in MP, give it a go.

Overall, after spending about 15/20 hours on a different platform and almost a day on here;
I'd give this game a solid 6/7-10.

- it took 30min for me to get this game running (at least in 32 bit, 64bit still isn't working). There wasn't even an info, just an empty error, wtf? 
- Multiplayer is only for 2 people.
 - When you die, you have a 50% chance of getting launched into space without a chance to get revived.
 - You cannot load the last checkpoint, you need to restart the full hosted session from a save.
 - The loadingtime of one session is 5-10min?!
 - Graphics look like from a 2010 game.
 - The game loads ages in the beginning, there is a 1min cutscene, then you have to load this 5-10min again for the actual game.
 - Craftingstations are bugged. Like the hobostove, you cannot put food on it but the game will place some meat on a stick underneath. Then you cannot get it as the stove is above it.
 - And so on. Worst state of a game i've played for ages.

The idea and base of this game looked promising. The raftsystem is cool, the islands are hard and would be a good challenge. But the bugs are creating a not playable atmosphere.",1677099464,1677099575,False,4,0,0.467312335968017578,0,True,False,False

Plenty of long reviews on here to explain why, so I will keep it short-ISH

- Grinding with little to no reward for it
- They have added in skill levels, meaning things you need to SURVIVE are locked behind skills (which you can only gain by doing the action like cooking/crafting etc.) 
- Mechanics are still so janky i.e swimming in 2ft of water (but not all the time?), sometimes grabbing onto ladders/trees then sometimes not. Jumping is horrendous, it's an absolute chore to get over rocks or onto shipwrecks (we have arms but they are not used). 
- The shark AI is still so ***, I currently have a whale shark circling me? I think they have essentially copy/pasted the same AI for every large predator despite it being wrong for every species anyway. Great whites should stalk from a distance then attack at speed, hammer heads should be curious but ultimately interested in their usual prey (stingrays) and reef sharks should attack when you get too close or when you're hunting fish. But alas, they all want to kill you for some reason. 
- Islands are small dinky chunks of sand with similar resources and you find the more important items way too easily. Already have all the parts to build an engine and speargun after a couple of hours. 

Ultimately if they were trying to take ideas from other survival games i.e. the forest, they half***ed it and smacked a 20 dollar tag on it. Games should not feel like you're spending 5+ hours grinding for materials with little reward or achievement. For example, materials that are required in majority of items/builds should be easily obtain (LIKE trees/palms that regrow? having to island hop for STICKS is a joke. If anyone has not played the forest, you can essentially walk around your base and sticks/rocks that you previously picked up, will repawn. It sounds silly but it is not realistic to expect gamers to travel across multiple islands or land to collect materials that are required in everything) meanwhile items that SHOULD be difficult to obtain like engine parts, should be found in deeper ship wrecks or further from the starting island so it actually rewards you for going further and spending more time, risking your life a little more. 

P.S this is an updated review, my original review was too positive for what the game has NOT become over the years. Hopeless.. try out the forest, subnautica and Raft for survival games, if you just want games that involves sharks, try Maneater. Any of these games would be worth your coins over this one.",1454849573,1675432407,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good things:
+ lot's of things to explore on islands and in the water and lot's to build
+ realistic enough surroundings, with a nice variation of wild life
+ no/barely/limited UI, but a watch to keep track of your health and all other things you want to know
+ you can change the keybindings (but the hints in the game (like ""press TAB to open"") will keep saying the default keybinding instead of the one you set for it - it's confusing)

The bad things:
- no character creation (only a pick of gender)
- tutorial doesn't explain much so the learning curve is very steep (you'll end up googling stuff)
- the game won't tell you why you can't build something or how
- movement is stiff and unrealistic, your character will walk/run as if it's back is made out of a wooden plank for example. Funny, but it takes away from the attempted realistic feel of the game
- changing the tool or item in your hand is time consuming because you have to go into your inventory first and that's annoying in situations where you can't have that (scrolling through the tools would be a great way to solve that). There is a quickbar available after you crafted a couple of tool belts but as soon as you drop a tool/item or it breaks you have to add it to the quickbar again
- lot's of bugs in multiplayer that will require a reboot of the game
    * tools suddenly can't be used anymore and will be stuck in your backpack
    * SOMEbody's watch will keep beeping, but nobody knows who's it is and why it's beeping until it's too late
- the load/save option is very vague in multiplayer

You've seen this in movies and want to experience it yourself without getting your [spoiler]lazy ass[/spoiler] out of your sweet home? You got it - this is the right game for you!

Yes, it is a bit older. Yes, the graphics are not up to date. But: The idea of survival on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is really well transposed. The game has its quirks and is a bit ""clunky"" at times. That can be a bit exhausting and annoying. But you quickly come to terms with it. Collecting, crafting, base-building and traveling by raft (or gyrocopter) is intuitive and entertaining. The game-mechanics are interesting and the game-physics, apart from a few minor details, are based on reality. The fact that you can carry and throw around all sorts of objects regardless of their weight is really entertaining. The wildlife consists of a good amount of different animals and gives you the feeling of being in a lively world.

I played in single-player-mode without mods and had fun with the game. In co-op and with mods, you can certainly get a lot more out of the game. In standard-mode, however, it gets repetitive after a couple of hours of gameplay. After some hours I continued just for the grind of the Achievements.

Overall, a good game for a fair price.",1674682299,1675022204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The premise of Stranded Deep is quite generic; you’re a plane crash survivor stranded somewhere in the ocean and you have to figure out how to survive. But regardless of how generic it seemed I still went into this game pretty open minded. Honestly, maybe I was just playing the game wrong but recent steam reviews show a mixed rating so I’m clearly not alone. In my opinion for this game being $20 and only going down to around $14 minimum you shouldn’t waste your time or money on it, just go play The Forest or something.

I've only played about 3 hours of co-op due to getting disconnected.

That said, this game is so much better co-op, but the connection issues are what kills it.  I played about 5 hours solo and it's a decent survival game with a slightly different take on the whole stranded at sea thing.  The graphics are great, at least on high settings.  With a R5 3600 and a 6700 XT I get 140-200 fps.  

The inventory system is frustrating though.  I would much prefer almost anything other than the radial wheel style.  You have to drop stuff on the ground if you don't have space, where it never despawns (afaik).  So managing storage boxes and organizing the wide array of stuff you collect is very annoying.  

The only (slightly) redeeming quality about the inventory issues is that crafting materials don't have to be in your inventory, they only have to be in your field of view, meaning they can be on the ground.  Though, the materials have to be close enough to you and be pretty much right in front of you, which can also be annoying given the amount of stuff and how much space it all takes up.

Combat is also a bit wonky, the spears don't really hit where you are aiming, even when not throwing them.  There's no way to heal yourself from the boars and giant crabs you mainly fight except for filling your food and water and waiting for your health to regenerate.  Haven't made it to the bigger bosses or killed a shark yet, not sure if i'll continue on with this game though.

Bottom Line:  If you want a solo, island hopping, grindy, but great looking survival game this could be for you.  If you are looking to play co-op, it's great until it isn't, then it's extremely frustrating not being able to reconnect unless the host restarts his game then go through syncing all over again to have a shot at getting back together.

A full eight years later, and the bug where trees float into the air when you chop them still exists. And this bug happens literally every single time you chop a tree. Should provide a lot of insight into the quality of the developer.

This is not ready for release. I'm usually more forgiving with games, so I bought it despite the reviews. It seems like they just got tired of working on it and pulled the plug. Most games release 1.0 with a big capstone update, i.e. new content, completed story, etc. After 8 months of silence (from the last update), they release 1.0 with a very small handful of bugfixes. Thats it. They threw in the towel. Maybe with another two years of development, but if they stop here, then this is abandonware.

So many things wrong in just an hour of playtime, so lets start at the beginning.

-- Zero character customization outside of male or female. Everyone is a twin.
-- Starting a multiplayer game takes several minutes to sync. Ive never seen a game take that long. How could that be considered acceptable?
-- Poor/non-existent animations. Looking at my co op partner during the plane crash sequence and they are barely sitting in the chair. They are about a foot away from the back of the chair, and completely stiff. Dont allow the player to see things like that. Just hide it by putting the other players in different rows so they cant see each other. The first several times I climbed a tree there was no animation at all. You just slide up and down. Then suddenly they started working, so that was surprising. Rowing the raft is jarring, and you can see straight down your own neck.
-- Notifications are shared apparently. I was told I was bleeding while at full health. Found out later that my co op partner was dying somehow, even though we just barely started and were still trying to build our first shelter.
-- Terrible UI. Trying to move items from your backpack, that you apparently were just wearing during the plane crash for some reason, to another storage was just bizarre. Theres also no way to tell how much storage space a container has. You can also craft a toolbelt to unlock hotbar slots, but theres no way to put anything in those slots. If you have a full inventory with an item in your hand, you can drop the item and not be able to pick it back up due to a full inventory.
-- Poor design choices. You can only cook one tiny piece of meat on a fire at a time. And why exactly does a rain collector consume palm fronds to create water? It doesnt actually collect rain, because that would require rain. It just consumes fronds to generate water.
-- How exactly do you revive someone? My co op eventually died because he doesnt have a healthy fear of sharks, and his body just floats in the water, with no way to recover him and no respawn options.
-- The last straw. The watch. The sun came up, and the alarm on the watch starts screaming and never stops. After five minutes of listening to that, I gave up.",1672631695,1673353977,False,11,0,0.580593526363372803,0,True,False,False

Why is there a controller style Dpad selector (With a different sensitivity for some reason) for the crafting wheel when I have a mouse to select what I want?
Why is there a Tab to open, Click to transfer, E to pick up ... that should be one button the Interact button!
Why do I have to hold a key to open a door or activate or use?
Why when I am crafting it is unable to see all the ingredients on the floor but somethings it can see?

Online is full of trolls and it takes about 5 minutes for someone to connect to your game (and it fails 90% of the time)
People will troll and mess around in public, if they even manage to connect at all. 

If you start as an online host you can't continue your game in single player mode.
This means your forced to stay online. 

Online frequently crashes and 'disconnects' you (VERY) frequently, and randomly. 
All progress is lost after a disconnect. You can ONLY save after you craft a shelter and save manually. That means building a shelter on every island and never being too far away from one. 


Avoid this product AT ALL COSTS, if you want a good survival try Green Hell, Forest, Dark wood, anything other than this. 

The crafting is very grindy also, there's no tutorial and a very clunky character control system.
Very little inventory space will leave you constantly dropping items everywhere.

This review unfortunately is a mixed bag of some good and some rather annoying aspects to a game with potential.

SYNOPSIS:
Stranded Deep aims to deliver the setting and atmosphere similar to the movie Cast Away from 2000, where you have to survive on your own after a plane crash over the ocean on an island(s) with the known struggles that come along, while trying to find a way back home. 

PROS:
While graphically appealing to the eye, the atmosphere of surviving alone on a remote island somewhere in the ocean, or sailing on a self-made raft through the high waves of a thunderstorm while second guessing if the raft you build is up for the task and if you might end up as a happy meal for the shark that is following your raft for quite a while now probing the rafts underside from time to time together with the well-executed storm and lightning sounds really make this in parts an interesting and immersive experience. 

Due to there is no specific storyline behind the obvious, the player is also free to explore the world around and is given the freedom to focus on what’s personally important e.g. build a base, craft, explore, which will be enjoyable for some players. 

CONS:
Besides various ingame bugs that reach from being annoying (singleplayer) to unplayable (especially multiplayer) the AI mechanics in general are quite easy to beat and soon become no challenge. The game also rarely leaves the player with an urgency to address negative status effects like poisoning, bleeding starvation etc. 

All islands look very similar to each other. This is either by design -to get the player lost- or due to some generic level design which greatly breaks the otherwise good immersion. After a very short time you know what to expect when visiting the next island(s) as -flora and fauna and potential loot- are literally the same.

Especially the last part of the final cutscene probably might leave a lot of players kind of unsatisfied at the end. I won`t get into specific details, but those of you who played the game The Forest might get a little hint here. ;-)

CONCLUSION:
Stranded Deep succeeds in bringing the cast away experience, and while the game is at times fun to play, there are aspects that will most likely be annoying and reduce the chance of playing the game more than once. There are other survival games like The Forest or Green Hell which in various parts are better executed. For those of you who still want to have a shot at Stranded Deep I would recommend buying it on sale as there are also clear downsides to the current version (v1.0.17.0.) of the game.",1673016978,1673016978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Neat little survival game that offers about 30 hours of unique gameplay.
Overall 3/5 points.


Graphics: Above average
Sound/Music: Average
Stability: Above average. No game crashes here.

Gameplay:
I particularly like the survival watch for checking and managing player stats.
A few minor glitches, but no gamebreakers, for example:[list]
[*]Physics leave a bit to be desired. Sometimes stuff will clip through the terrain and disappear, or collide with objects and be hurled all over the place. Particularly wood logs when cutting palm trees. 
[*]In stormy weather with big waves, marine life will sometimes float above the water.
[/list]
Game ending is rather anticlimactic.

Mechanically, the game is.... fine. The controls are a bit janky, a bit unintuitive, but not deal breaking. The problem is that the game is just very insubstantial. I've started more than one game, so I think the map is set, but it feels randomly generated. There's just nothing to any of the locations. They all feel and look the same. Nothing interesting to discover, nothing to explore. If you're going to create a set map, why not design a more interesting environment?
The undersea graphics are nice, but if you want that, you're better off playing Subnautica. The building is OK, but there a dozens of games that do this better. If you want the survivor aesthetic, you're better off with the Forest or Green Hell.

Pros: [b]#1.[/b] Haven't found any.

Cons: [b]#1.[/b] The inventory system is terrible and your inventory is tiny. 
[b]#2.[/b] The crafting interface is terrible. Navigating between your inventory and crafting screen is obtuse and slow.
[b]#3.[/b] When you enter the water, your field of vision is artificially limited by the devs, and they make it so that you can't even see 3meters ahead of you. This makes it so that the sharks can be literally within striking distance of you and you can't even see them. It's a completely fake and artificial level of difficulty that has been added to the game.
[b]#4.[/b] Even after more than 8 years of development, the game still has bugs and glitches. Items clipping through the ground or plain just falling through the ground; trees and other objects yeeting themselves up 5meters into the air; 
[b]#5.[/b] 'Fibrous leaves' are seemingly the rarest items in the game... there's fccking leaves on ALL of the trees, yet they don't drop the 'fibrous leaves' when you chop them down.... NOPE, only 1 type of tree in the entire damn game, drops 'fibrous leaves' and yet 'fibrous leaves' are used with a HUGE amount of recipes, so it's insanely difficult to get and yet it's one of the most used resources in the entire game.
[b]#6.[/b] The entire game is just tiny, tiny islands. This entire world has no land masses or islands bigger than 100m2. It's just several dozen tiny islands on a map, and that's it... no large islands to explore or anything like that.
[b]#7.[/b] The intro of the game is stupid. It's like 2minutes and it's incredibly stupid and doesn't give you ANY information about the character or what happened to them.
[b]#8.[/b] You can't activate V-sync if you set an fps cap, this results in MASSIVE screen tearing... I'm talking about GIGA CHAD screen tearing.
[b]#9.[/b] The tutorial is absolutely useless and doesn't teach you even 10% of the things you need to be taught.
[b]#10.[/b] Literally the ONLY source of water for the first few hours of the game, coconuts, can poison you, which results in you losing all your hydration.

The sound design is also top-notch, with realistic sound effects that really bring the game to life. The survival gameplay is also challenging, as you must explore other islands and forage underwater to keep yourself alive and create new equipment. 

However, during my experience playing with friends, I encountered two bugs. The first one was that my character did not appear on my friend's monitor (or vice versa). The second bug was that we experienced a lot of disconnected problems and were unable to join the same room, resulting in us having to create a new room every time one of us was disconnected. 

Despite these issues, the game is still a lot of fun and offers a unique and exciting experience. Each player has their own seed map, resulting in a dynamic and ever-changing game world. This adds an element of surprise and discovery to the game, as you never know what you might encounter on your next journey between islands and foraging underwater. Additionally, you have to rely on a compass to navigate, as there is no detailed map available. This adds an element of uncertainty and exploration to the game, similar to the feeling of discovering new areas in Minecraft without the use of coordinates. 

Overall, if you're a fan of games that offer heart-pumping action and survival gameplay, this game is an excellent choice. Just be aware of the bugs that I encountered when playing with friends.",1672197327,1672197327,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The amount of building you can do in this game was precisely shown in the trailer : you can build walls,roof,floor and a handful of furniture items.  Needless to say,this was a huge dissapointment.

[b] EXPLORE TOGETHER   [/b]

It takes around 5 to 10 minutes to reach a nearest island you can see; however as you get closer all the excitement evaporates completely : it is usually a tiny rock with 1-2 hostile boars 2-3 giant crabs and a tiny bit of resources. Searching the sunken ships is just boring : I usually got a 100th rocket flare or compass. But this isnt because i was simply being unlucky : there are not that many variations of resources or items in this game either.

[b] SURVIVE TOGETHER [/b]

This part was fun for few couple of hours.Then my friend accidentaly discovered a bug that allowed us to have unlimited coconuts and improved axes.You might think that this is a minor thing but it isnt : most of the time i spent in this game i was searching for water and chopping wood.After discovering this I mowed down every single tree on home and surrounding islands and we still didnt have enough wood to construct a simple bungalo.

[b]  ESCAPE TOGETHER    [/b]

Not going to happen for me because (besides the reasons stated above) I went insane of the constant inventory management. The crates can only hold 5 items and the stacks are so tiny that i had my entire base floor and shelves filled with boxes (half of which stored useless stuff,like the endless copies of compass or rocket flares that i talked about earlier).",1672153885,1672153885,False,3,0,0.526143789291381836,0,True,False,False

The graphics are beautiful but the crafting and inventory system/menus are HORRIBLE. After playing games like 7 days to Die, Minecraft, the long dark, and many others, this game is unplayable. For example, why not just allow players to harvest yucca with a click of the mouse? Instead you need to hack at the leaves as if you are cutting it down, then the leaves (which are tied with string??) fall on the ground. It's then very difficult to see where they are, you need to find the white outlines. Very bad. When picking something up it goes into your hands not into your inventory. When dropping something it automatically puts the next item in your inventory into your hands, like a tarp....WHY!? The game makes decisions for us when we play. When entering the crafting menu, you are left with a shopping list that goes off the screen with multiple lists, no tabs, and no search option. 2/3 of the crafting menu shows the background which is useless.  The more difficult a game is, the less likely people will play it. This game can have so much more potential, I hope the Dev's learn from other games that have a large following.

Since then, it seems like the game really hasn't received much attention by the developers. Little updates have been made and even less bugs have been patched. Originally, we both played singleplayer as there was no online multiplayer and we had a blast. While the game is difficult and can be very tedious, it is fairly well thought-out and can easily provide hours of fun if you're into it. Despite this, I feel as if the developers simply do not care about their game, which (in my opinion) was on track to being a polished and fully playable game. 

Since the beginning, the graphics have not changed at all. While the landscape and waves generally look pretty good, the player models are of low quality and many item models / icons clearly are not finished (like the placeholder seagull icon that is present in the game).

The main problems I encountered are to do with the co-op mode. Recently, we decided to revisit the game after hearing there has been a co-op mode for ~5 years that we were not aware of. We jump in but die quickly on our first run. After restarting, we spent our lashings on water collectors immediately and were able to survive more easily. Throughout our second playthrough, we have encountered many game-breaking bugs that forced us to save and restart the game. This was a major inconvenience, but we were still keen to play. 

Recently, we encountered a bug that would simply kick us to the menu without warning. The error code ""Timeout: StayAlive"" was present on the screen without any other explanation. We lost ~35 minutes of progress and farming to this.

Frankly, as much as I love this game, I cannot say it is deserving of the $30 AUD price tag. The developers seem to not care about the game's state, adding updates or patching bugs, and the co-op is a buggy mess and a huge waste of time. I am disappointed we couldn't come back to a more refined game after almost 6 years.",1670832130,1670832130,False,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Overall good survival game and a good concept but that's about it. The only real complaint I have is that the co-op is basically trash and low functioning.

Really just need multiplayer and being able to have 4-6 players on the map would be much better than this garbage called co-op.

Crafting was my major issue in this game, and a lot of it was just no information given in what can be done and cannot be done it was like this, you had to save every step you can and test it until you learned these steps and Note if you get a world you like it will re spawn if you have it set at the start of the game.  Here is how to craft in this game.  Step one The Raft: needs to be six block at least to float and stay level, with this said.  Note Crafting tip the base level of the raft has to be done in the water but you do not have to do it all at once.  Big tip if you find enough good items to do a two block raft it will work to go get the others.  You can destroy a section but lose a lot of Material,  just to do a good base you like build it and later you can add to it.  This to me was super confusing due to i was told by most videos it had to be built in the water and not one just posted a good guide to this simple information.
Getting past this was most what angered me for years about this game was the lack of good information on building a raft anyways. After all of this i still love the game idea.  Great game maybe i will write a good guide to this if anyone wants one.

I will update my review soon when updates occur. The things for me are how if you die with things on you like the paddle your friend can't obtain it. Or the lack of fibre to create bandages. No kill option to respawn when you do die.  There's no tutorial so it takes time to learn the basics anyway.

The most annoying bugs involve the inventory. If the inventory is full, I cannot even switch to anything in the inventory as it gives me an error message that the inventory is full. Then sometimes it doesn't stack items, like fibrous leaves - just uses two different item slots. I then need to drop all of them and pick them back up to fix the issue. Also the inventory is comically small, you can carry 10 different items at maximum, and that includes all the tools. Even when you unlock the tool belt - you'd think that you can then move tools from the backpack to the tool belt, but no, this is just for hotkeys, the tools stay in your inventory and take up space! Wasted opportunity to make life a little easier for the player. So I have to carry only one tool at a time, and drop all the other tools (and there are many, they would take up the entire inventory) on the floor. The hotkeys feature thus is pointless since you lose the binding when dropping a tool - arrgh.

Also the game is german when you start it up, for some reason, and then switches to english (which is what's configured) in the menu. This is not a problem, but just shows how lazy or unskilled the developers are.

Unfortunately I checked out some mods on nexusmods to try to fix the inventory woes, but they are all broken. Seems this game has been abandoned by both the developers and the mod community. Not worth playing!",1670149151,1670149261,False,4,1,0.505856513977050781,0,True,False,False

There are still a few bugs, especially with animals/birds movement, a few wooden crates stuck here and there underwater, a couple more but nothing game breaking or exploitable. Not as far as I know.

I would've loved to see a few more added items/recipes. But the game's good as is.

Summary: Bad UI, too little content, boring and easy. Still feels like early access.

Already when playing it the first time, the UI was pretty bad and it didn't improve. Inventory management is a pain, crafting toolbelts for tools is useless because the tool will still take away a spot in your backpack. Strangely, my backpack can store more itms than the big wooden storage boxes I find, which leads to the floor around my basic shelter being littered with stuff, which becomes very annoying and it's easy to miss things.
The crafting menu is very unclear. There's something like tabs, but it's not apparent, so you'll miss whole categories of items until you figured that out. There's like 6 categories, and you can only see 3 on top. But even those 3 are so unremarkable, that it's very easy to miss that you can (and should) actually click there or hit the ""crafting"" hotkey several times to cicle through them. (The subcategories are also not very clearly recognizable, but still better than the categories for me.) An explanation in the tutorial might have helped a little, even though it's still not the best design.

I like that you can play on randomly generated maps. However, even then the islands are tiny and every single one seems to include everything you could need to survive. This makes the whole thing pretty easy and boring. Sure, it's nice if the starting island contains everything for survival, but the ones further away could be a bit more special. Exploring is done fast, because there's not a lot to explore. I wish there were more different plants and animals to make things more interesting and make me actually want to explore new islands.
Also, the game gives me no reason to build a base. You can construct houses, farm, etc., but you don't need it for anything. There are storms, but the only thing they do is filling the water still faster and making the ocean water dark, so I can barely see anything when diving. Would be nice if I'd get sick when out in the storm all the time for example. Which would then also provide a reason to actually build at least a small hut.

One thing I find a bit weird (spoiler): [spoiler]I haven't fought any of the bosses yet, so I can't say much about them, but I find the concept of bosses in a survival game (that otherwise seems mostly realistic) weird. Hunger, thirst etc., survival itself should be the bosses here. But that's maybe just me.[/spoiler]

To me the game still feels like early access, with quite some room for improvement and little content. I'll probably try again in another year or 2, but for now it's just boring.",1669923567,1669929362,False,5,0,0.553178548812866211,0,True,False,False

The inventory system is a pain, for starters I am playing on a PC with a mouse and keyboard and your inventory and quick crafts are radial menus, why? Your items will split into random stacks when you take something into your hands, lets say you have 1 open slot and you have a stack of 4 sticks, when you take one of those sticks into your hand you now have no empty slots, but you really wanna pick up that crab you just skinned. So, you drop the stick thinking it will free a slot, NOPE another stick is in your hand so you drop that as well as the 3 others your still holding. At least you have your crab now.  Sometimes when you make an item, even if it uses all the items in your hand, you will have to place it on the ground to then pick it back up because the game doesn't account for all the items you will be using.  Want to put something in a box? hope you're ready to go through an unintuitive multiple menu system to do so. 

I can't be bothered to put more time in when there are so many other survival games out there that are actually user friendly out of the box.

It's Cast Away meets the Bermuda Triangle's Dumping grounds. Your airliner crashes, and lucky you, you are less than mercifully dumped into an island cluster in the Pacific, left to scavenge and survive on your nearby islands' resources. While you start with nature's resources and the few survival items you have (your raft, your trusty watch that monitors all your vitals), you relearn stone age and basic survival techniques to Stay Alive long enough to start exploring all the man-made underwater wrecks that have run aground or fallen from the sky, that might hold more valuable items to help you survive, and perhaps maybe even escape, if you wish.

Or you can find and create your own island paradise, living off of the land and harvesting the bounty of the sea, and watch the beauty of the sun rise and the sun set as you realize you could live here forever.


While Stranded Deep will not be the most faithful survival simulator one could wish for, and surely not entirely realistic ([spoiler]the overall setting requires some suspension of disbelief, when you find the X-teenth island with yet another few abandoned boat wrecks, that only a conspiracy theory can explain away; and the ending, well, will only leave you .... Stranded Deep with more questions and fewer answers about what you know about reality and of your sanity.[/spoiler]), and despite my reservations during its early access about what I perceived as flaws in feeling that it's not stranding you deep enough in its Pacific environmental and survival setting; it is, in the end in its completed state, a fun, beautiful, and overall a relaxing and enjoyable game.

It has good implemented physics with a great atmo which makes this game very enjoyable.

Levels are procedually generated and can even be created using a level editor tool (included).

Hud and inventory mechanics are intuitive and inventory is easy to manage.

This game has had quite a few updates which include a lot of stuff to be constructed and seen and more things are added to it every few weeks. Cooking, diving, exploring, fighting is what you can expect to be able to do in this game as for now.

Structure building requires to add items to the construction one by one and the fact that you don't really have an inventory as usual in most survival games, in my opinion, gives the game an even more survival edge since it essencially makes the process a bit harder, but in general it's an easy, quite enjoyable game i would totally recommend to any of you who likes deserted islands or survival games.

The whole idea of surviving on a deserted and remote island has always appealed to me. Despite the praise, the game, as a survival one, has a handful of drawbacks. 

Upsides: 
[list][*]Appealing concept: a tropical island, an ocean, the sun, solitude, no humans
[*]Serene and soothing atmosphere which calms you and improves your mood when in distress
[*]Moderate difficulty which actually makes you chill rather than suffer, unlike other 'hardcore' survival games[/list]
Downsides:
[list][*]Islands are too tiny and often empty, which forces you to hop between other islands is search of supplies. However, the idea of island hopping seems ludicrous and may ruin the unique atmosphere of being stranded on an remote island
[*]Broken achievements which do not unlock upon completion
[*]Levelled crafting system. In order to create a simple tool you need to craft a dozen of identical rubbish items first
[*]Tool degradation system. Looks like artificial difficulty. A stone tool falls apart if you cut too many leaves with it
[*]Fruit spoil system. Even when left on a tree, a fruit will still spoil within a short period of time, just like a picked up one[/list]

In my view, Stranded Deep undoubtedly isn't the best survival game out there, but if you like such a setting as being stranded on a tropical island, you should definitely give this game a go. 

The concept of the game is great. You just immerse yourself in it and soak up this solitary tropical atmosphere.",1475612915,1669181169,True,4,0,0.581484675407409668,0,True,False,False

I've bought this game on January [b]25th 2015[/b]. Twice. One copy for me, one for a good friend.
The game had just come out a few days prior and seemed challenging and interesting enough to check it out.
15€ invested and we started.

A few almost fading keyboard notes reached my headphones. A waving Stranded Deep logo appeared on my screen. [i]Minimalistic, quiet, peaceful. Wow.[/i]

As I sat out to start my new game I was crushed by how amazing it looked. It was 2015 and those fucking sun shafts and shaders still haunt me until this day.
The game looked amazing and it felt amazing. 
Yes, [b]YES[/b], the intro, I know. The Forest came out sometime in 2014 and this intro was basically a one point copy. But everything after the intro. [b]Not[/b].

You are flying to a unknown destination in your plane, private jet I guess, when you suddently crash. Stranded with only the emergency boat and your clothes, you arrive on a nearby island. A small, coconut rich island. From here on out, [i]the world is yours[/i].

[b]Pro's:[/b]
✓ Incredible visuals since 2015
✓ (Used to) Minimalistic design
✓ Easy crafting system (Now bound with a skill system)
✓ Fairly simple to get into and progress
✓ Generated islands with different sizes and stuff
✓ Sharks & other fish you can hunt & hunt you
✓ Now with animals on the islands you can hunt
✓ Old, rusty ruins of ships and other sunken buildings to explore
✓ Swimming and diving mechanics are really nice

[b]Con's:[/b]
✗ [b]I miss the old intro music! [/b]
✗ The new skill system breaks immersion for me
✗ Sometimes necessary things (Like a hammer) are hard to find
✗ Your items break [b]way too early[/b]
✗ [b]The new version makes everything so confusing...[/b]

I loved this game. I could always start it up and simply roam around my island with so much to do and so many more things to explore; every update. New gadgets, new animals, new weapons, more stuff to craft.
I used to put coconuts or just scrap I didn't need at the place I left my island, swam a straight line to the next island, planted stones and looked for loot. That way I could always find my way back.
[i]Sadly, that is not possible anymore. [/i]

In the last few updates the game has changed [b]dramatically[/b]. That's not always a bad thing.
The minimalistic swimming, diving and surviving game I once knew and loved has been replaced by a game that tries too hard to reach The Forest's state.
Don't, [i]please do not[/i] ruin this masterpiece. 

The menu has been massacred and the lovely tune of keyboard notes has vanished. 
Where did the minimalistic game from 2015 go? [i]What happened? [/i]

Don't get me wrong, the game is still incredible fun to play. But it's just not the same anymore. 
Back then I was able to play hours and hours, swim around islands, explore sunken ships and fight sharks. Now I have to skill up for ages before being able to build a base. That's not...no. That's not what we wanted.

I like the fact that you have to stumble onto things and that the game never really pushes you in any direction. Which means that there's a lot to do and no real rush to complete anything, you can focus on just exploration and then choose when you want to start finishing the objectives to finish the game. 

There are some issues though one of them being is that this game has been in early access for years and the development progress is very slow and clunky. There are also some bugs and glitches that have been there for sometime (1-2 years) and have yet to be removed. There is also the issue of if you place an item down you either have to like it or else destroy it and loose half of the resources used to make it. This can cause particular issues when it comes to crafting on the raft since placing objects on the raft has to be perfectly timed to have it in the correct position due to the current of the waves. Also the aiming system in the game is very hit or miss since an animal could be right in-front of you but somehow your unable to hit it due to the hit box being finicky. 

Another thing to add is that the game itself is visually stunning and quite relaxing. However, even with the graphics settings on normal my pc still heats up a lot so I wouldn't really recommend this game to someone that has a low-end pc. 

I wish there was a neutral option because I would recommend this game since I've enjoyed it quite a bit however there are quite a few problems with it that really affect the game play and overall experience so I would think about that before deciding whether to buy it or not. 

tdrl;
It's an enjoyable game but it has it's issues.

Update: 
I've finished the game and the ending pretty much wants me to change my review from recommended to not recommended but I still recommend the game just don't ever finish it. Enjoy the exploration and leave it at that. 

I explain it below but please note that it contains spoilers:
[spoiler]I hate the ending and I mean HATE the ending. It makes everything that you've worked for in the game feel pretty much pointless. The ending has affected my opinion of the game so much that even after finishing the main story I was planning on going back to continue exploring but now I just no longer want to play the game any more. I would rather the game have no ending then the ending it chooses to have in game. Pretty much instead of flying away and successfully escaping, you end up in a fricken plane crash so the game ends the same way it started. What does that mean for you the person that has spent countless hours playing the game? It means that all the time, work and effort to defeat the bosses collect all the resources, SURVIVE since it is a survival game and it's in the title actually mean nothing, all of that was futile since the game decides to kill you off in the end/start a stupid timeloop again(according to some theories). It made me very upset and completely ruined the entire experience I've had. [spoiler]",1652468833,1668273890,True,27,3,0.738325059413909912,0,True,False,False

We're thinking we have to go to other islands to find pigs etc because we need leather for some items but we've seen plenty sharks in the water, in fact, one bit my buttox. How do we get a map even, we don't know. We survived day one and got off for the night because we are traumatised lol! Episode 2 of Stranded Deep for youtube will have to wait. Very tense gameplay but also extremely entertaining. Looking forward to working out how this game works. So far for sure, I can recommend this game, very realistic.

The game has all the elements you'd expect from any survival game just without the PVP or raiding bases.
You are standard in an area of small tropical Islands and you go from Island to Island scavenging for supplies and materials to build rafts, bases and the means to get food and water.

And that's about it...........no really that's it.
[Edit 9/11/22] Since writing this review the game has been updated to include an end game and a way to escape.

The game is visually very well done and feels pretty polished but it falls completely flat when you quickly realise there is no end goal, story or aim to any of it.
You can build a base using the same mechanics you'd see from any crafting game like Rust , Ark or Conan but why build a base at all? there is no point in it.
You grow food and hunt animals just to keep going as your hunger drops pretty quickly in the game but other than keeping yourself well fed and keeping your thirst down there isn't much you have to do so what happens is you end up going from Island to Island on a raft you've built to build up supplies to build a base you don't need just because there isn't anything else to do except maybe try to fight a shark or something.

While the lack of any real story or content lets the game down you can still gain a fair amount of fun from it just by being creative, build yourself the tropical Island paradise you've always wanted. make yourself a small pier from which you can chill on and do a spot of fishing as the afternoon sun sets. Make a hut on the beach and barbecue some fish or make yourself a huge Island hotel.

Item management is very well done, all the items drop on the ground as they are, other games you may drop a stack of 10 wood on the ground where's in Stranded deep you literally drop 10 wood sticks on the ground which will each stack up and interact with eachother so a fair amount of game time will be finding areas to keep all your stuff and stacking it together and trying to keep it all neat. It is very well done mechanic.

Worth picking up when cheap or on sale.

Pros
Very nice graphics
Very well done item management mechanic
Well done building mechanics.
Relaxing survival game.
Instant Immersion.
Good time killer.

The biggest problems are the navigation, theres not many great ways to mark locations you've visited. Hunkering down on a single island is not the best strategy since venturing to other islands to discover more resources is a necessity, so building a large base requires many resources and they take quite a while to gather. Lumber, and metal scrap is used to make bases, but also required to build other crucial components so building an enormous base seems wasteful, it makes more sense to just make a small shack, since traveling between islands is vital. My final complaint is the combat tends to be very wonky, especially land combat, getting attacked usually bounces you back like 3ft so getting a counter hit becomes a nightmare to pull off, so just craft throwing weapons only, or just run away. Minus my complaints, the gameplay is enjoyable despite getting repetitive quicker than other survival games I've played, its fun for a few hours solo or with a friend.",1667942519,1667942646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The compass is on the raft, USE THE COMPASS! Your tiny island doesn't have enough resources so you will have to go scavenging and you WILL get lost very easily.

2. The UI is not intuitive, for example, when making leather or planks you stand next to the crafting station and then go into your crafting menu rather than selecting the crafting station. I find this annoying to say the least because you have to scroll through EVERYTHING to find the one thing you want to craft instead of selecting the crafting station and just getting that ONE THING you want to craft. Spend some time watching vids so you can figure this out before jumping into the game, it'll save you a lot of frustration.

3. EVERYTHING WANTS TO KILL YOU. The first island I went to, I died in like 3 seconds because I had 2 crabs and a boar thingy gang up on me. Also, the sharks are d*cks.

4. Use the wooden crates and keep them in your inventory, they each expand your carrying capacity by 5. DO NOT attempt to throw things into the raft, it's not going to work out the way you would like.

5. Craft, craft, craft, craft, and craft some more. Your skills only increase when you use them and you need the higher level stuff simply to survive.

6. Water and food are your first priority, yes you can get water from coconuts but you will run out fast and its a pain to get enough of them to keep up with your thirst. A simple spear will get you small crabs, but fish is the sustainable option longer term.

Despite the bugs (boar falling from the sky, fish swimming above the water, etc) this game is enjoyable. I've been waiting for a while before purchasing it because I wasn't sure it was worth it but I'm happy I got it. Some people have compared this game to Raft, I have Raft, and no they aren't the same thing. This game is more gritty and realistic, although both games are very unrealistic when it comes to the wildlife attacking you. I like this game because it's almost realistic enough to simulate an actual survival situation, more so than any other game I've seen out there.",1666985217,1666985217,True,19,1,0.704514265060424805,0,True,False,False

For starter, I swam across the ocean without any lovebites given by the shark. On this new island I found a cool metal hammer, great for building with, since I had no other tool to build with.
I managed to gather a huge amount of resources, then swam back all the way to the first island, no lovebites given during the trip this time either 😒

Once back, I started building my first few platforms. I checked my watch and all my needs were fully met, so I continued.
Out of the sudden, my character falls to the ground for no reason. I couldn't move... This was bad... I tried swinging my hammer but saw no animation-effect, yet heard a wooshing sound that the hammer makes...

SINGLEPLAYER: It is good, it's fun and it does take up time. There is no way you can complete everything in one or two days, it takes weeks! personally it took me about a month to get everything and defeat the bosses + Escape. in general it is really fun and it's something relaxing yet challenging at the same time.

MULTIPLAYER: okay.. this is where things get sloppy. I get it Devs, We all been pestering you to release multiplayer for years now. but you all blindly made it multiplayer then released it. There is no effort in fixing bugs as simple as loading in. My friend had to disconnect and reconnect over 7 times within 2 hours!! over little things like Me being invisible, or there are flying sharks. If you are trying to buy this for multiplayer DO NOT until there is some sort of Bug fix update or something. I would love to play this game with my friend but we grew so frustrated it was a uninstall immediately after 2 hours of none stop restarting. NTM the load time is HORRENDOUS! Both my friend and I Have decent gaming computers and it takes literal 5-8 minutes of loading in, just for it to bug out within 10 minutes sometimes sooner.

OVERALL: It's a good singleplayer game. since it's been singleplayer for years. Multiplayer just released this year..So if it takes the Devs over 4 years to release multiplayer I can only imagine it's going to take 4 - 4+ Years to even release a bug fix. The Devs didn't give to turds about us having a good Multiplayer experience, they just wanted us to stop asking for it.

Followed immediately by, ""Hey, which one of those islands was my home-base?""  Learning to make a map of my immediate are and using the compass are key to answering those two questions by the way.  LOL!!!  Things aren't immediately intuitive but once you get the hang of how the crafting menus and production of materials works, the game has been entertaining and quite a bit of fun.  Thus far, I haven't ran into any of the bugs or glitches that the other reviewers have been complaining about although I have seen an underwater swimming pig and a few flying crabs.  If that is the worst thing I can find to complain about, then I don't really have anything to complain about.  All in all, it's been a pretty good game so far.  I'll need to edit this review later.

""flying"" fish in rough water
Combat is simple and broken
Sharks pose 0 risk. They don't tip your boat
Storms pose 0 risk. They don't tip your boat
Only 1 material (bouys) is worth building with
Building structures is worthless and a waste of time
lack of story
1 strange ending with no base in reality
invisible walls in the ocean like the Truman Show

I used to play it solo, prior to multiplayer being an option (I believe I quit playing just prior to the MP patch). I'd come back, get to maybe day 3, then quit again. Mostly, I'd get frustrated with building my raft due to lack of materials or finicky placement.

I started a multiplayer last night with my niece, she was hosting. It is also important to note that we live maybe 20 minutes apart, in a major metro US city.

Dear gods, the disconnections. The first time I got kicked (timed out / staying alive), I thought it was because she had died from thirst. Nope. It took about 6 attempts/restarts before I was able to rejoin. Just tonight, I have 6 different invite codes from her. We wound up having to move from US-West, to Auto, to Canada. In Canada is where I stopped getting kicked. She also started saving every time we got notice of another day of survival.

Desyncing is an issue, too. We were out at the Big Boat, and while she's looking around upstairs, I'm watching her flit all over the water like a dragonfly on drugs. Then I tried to build a small shelter. Got the foundation down, got one wall down. Next wall just never gives me an outline. So I decide to go put a flooring on the raft.

Boy did that bounce into the water. Somehow, I had managed to sink that second wall halfway into the raft, perpendicular, making it stand on end. I, of course, couldn't see this. She had to break it down. Repeatedly. I had her build the second wall, and it went up fine. I couldn't see it. I could jump through it. Third wall, I saw it go up. Roof? Nah.

By this point, we were streaming to one another. This helped her to understand that the random wooden wall outline, on the beach, was not something I could see. Nor explain. I have 2 sticks in my inventory I could not hold, could not drop, could not do anything with.

I've been poisoned by nothing, I've been bitten by nothing. It's exciting when your health is sitting at less than 50% of the first block, due to being negatived by...nothing. At all.

Also, we had a reload where I revived her underwater, and she proceeded to be stuck inside of a rock. I couldn't pull her out, nor do much of anything except, ""might as well just reload the save.""

I remember I enjoyed this, despite the frustrations, in the solo mode. ""I gotta come back to that,"" I kept saying. Then she and I watched Neebs & Appsro (Neebs Gaming) do their playthrough. So we jumped into this.

What an exercise in frustration tonight.",1665493104,1665493104,False,3,1,0.559808611869812012,0,True,False,False

Having been a fan of Cast Away, this game hit home. And indeed, it was the game that got me into the survival sim genre. I finally got it on Steam and started playing in ernest. It was nice to return to it and experience all the new stuff. I like the slow and silent mood of this game, even though the timescale is obviously accelerated.

A year or so into my buying the game, and the only significant update was the multiplayer and the island editor,  I think. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have custom islands and to play with your friends, and I get that the game is effectively being developed by just one guy (or a very small group of people, I'm not sure), but I just feel like there should have been more. 

The game needs optimization, there are framrate drops and meshes sometimes become grainy, or ""pourous"", after playing the game for too long. As others have mentioned, there's little reason to craft tier 2+ stuff, and the vanilla island layouts are very limited. Add to this that the game's been in development for around seven - if not more! - years now, and the endgame is still not implemented: you're supposed to find and fix an abandoned airplane, and fly back to civilization; or contact some passing ship\ plane and be rescued.

As of right now, it's all just an endless survival sandbox. Has been for years now, it seems. It's fun and good as one, but if you advertise your game as something more, then be kind and deliver, is what I think. At least fix the bugs and optimize everything.

I can't say anything about the multiplayer or local co-op, since I've not played them, but there are plenty of other reviews talking about that.

So, is it a good game? Yes and no. 
Yes, because it does what it's supposed to, mostly.
No, because it's bugged and unfinished.

Do I recommend it? It can be fun, and if you want a slow and quite experience hopping tropical island and hunting sharks, it's definitely good. But, as mentioned, there are bugs, there's no endgame, and it feels as though the dev(s) abandoned it.

If you want to get it, do so when it's on sale, and possibly leave a negative review, maybe that'll motivate the dev(s) to return, or at least say something about the game's development.

Underwater is beautifully done, it's fun to just swim around and look at the fishys. Though in such a game there is never enough improvement with the level of detail so there can always be more. A few bugs did happen here and there but that's okay. The devs are obviously working on the game and doing a good job imo. There are a couple of things that sometimes annoy me if I pay too much attention; for example the footstep sounds are archaic, and obnoxiously loud. In fact most sound effects are very bad, that's something that the devs apparently don't care much about but it's an important factor in terms of immersiveness for me. Ambience is nice, the sound of the waves etc but it's everything else from the sound of axe hitting wood to sound of fruit being picked, just sounds like it's an early 2000's game.

It just doesnt matter about a few little bugs, they've created an epic game, and you would enjoy it.
When you play; IF you have saved recently, I highly recommend taking on any animal, see how you go.
somehow I managed to take down a shark with a noob spear in my 2nd day :P 
I've since been creating a shark cemetery on my beach :)

few little bugs;
items can disappear randomly. (not relating to durability or misplacement)
and sometimes you have to redo your fire to access whats cooking..

While Stranded Deep undoubtedly has a lot of potential, its current state of development simply keeps it from fully tapping it.

The different islands are not exactly that - different and you soon find yourself in a loop of having to do the same things over and over gain.

It had a good amount of glitches like freezing up while sailing to another island, whish caused you to lose stuff you were carrying or making you fall off the boat and it sailing away. I got into saving it right when i arrived to a new island and right before I left a island. sometimes I would save in between doing significant things as well. The major downside was the game would error out ( A LOT), and pretty much only when you save the game then the save doesnt go through and your at the last save point when you restart the game. I always send  the crash reports but it hasnt helped. I would love to get a playstation update to get all the features that the computer version has. So far only 9 hours into the MAC-steam version of the game. I like it a lot more, has a ton of new items and features like the map editing where you can create islands from scratch item by item. The playstation version you just select what stuff you want on the map and size and it generats one for you, not a lot of customization there. The computer version hasnt crashed while saving but it did freeze once while building a wood wall and I had to reset the game for it to work again. My macbook is exactly what the minimum requirements list but I did have to change the graphical all to the lowest options to get a smooth playing experience. I had to order a full wireless controller for me to play the game easily on the computer, it wasnt a requirement but it was a lot easier than trying to remember the keyboard shortcut letters to do different things. It also has the creative mode feature on the computer so you are invincible which is pretty neat to learn the game without dying constantly. Overall I love the game, the computer version has a lot more to it than the playstation and it doesn't crash like the playstation.

The things that made the game good are still good. The game play is solid and not too much in terms of bugs to mention, after release.

The modding and the custom mode seem to be what we have to settle for, from here on. 
And that COULD be a good thing. 

The game´s main problem is, that the game-play loop is just not that interesting. The mechanics are solid and functional, but you end up not bothering with much of it. Here is an example:
Its easier and better to keep your primitive sail, instead of having to set up a Fuel Still to feed the engine, if you make that for the Raft. So you end up not bothering with late game items.

The base building is not good enough to carry the rest. And the ""story"", is not really a story. Its a series of boss fights, that mostly remind me of how games played in 2004. And badly so. Hitboxes, AI and animations of the Boss fights are hilariously bad, in some cases. Which is a huge anticlimactic moment, in general.

If you look for a game thats cozy and has a good Tamaguchi-effect, this game is fine and I enjoyed the general feel of the game. 

But if you look for survival games with substance and quality of content, good level-design and a solid story, youre better off playing Raft, imo. 

But not a bad indie-title and there should be at least 40-50 hours in it, just to learn the mechanics and drifting around the pacific on tropical Islands, that are all the same, somehow.

good things about the game:
-great graphics
-good music
-great idea/story for what led to the situation
-fun to play for a short period of time when you arent experiencing any bugs.

bad things about the game that NEEDS improvement (*):
-i cant see what a friend builds*
-they cant see what i build*
-items float mid air
-crafting benches dont work most of the time (the plank maker)*
-certain items end up missing*
-trees are launched into the stratosphere*
-the UI system regarding chests + inventory is poorly designed (IMO)
-random crashing out of nowhere*
-when building a shelter/house itll bug out and glow red, you're unable to back out of the UI, unable to cancel, or do anything except alt+F4*
-spear fishing, some fish wont turn up in your inventory despite killing it, collecting it, with a clean + clear inventory.*
-prone to getting stuck in small crevices of rocks*
-jumping is also buggy, sometimes it wont respond to the jump command
-the predators (sharks) can attack you but when they do they basically cause you to get thrown 50 ft away from them in the water
-you can only play 2 player online**

hopping from a tiny island to another nearly identical tiny island time and time again is not much fun. Even less when those islands are positioned in some rigid grid system. Next island? look west, north east or south, you ll see it. If you dont see an island, you re probably already on the edge of the small grid. because of this there is absolutely no feeling of exploration. The building system is pretty basic but completely irrelevant anyway (there really is no reason to build any structure). Killing shark after shark is not really fun either. Only thing you really can do is go after some mythical bosses with your self built copter, which breaks the poor immersion completely. 

 At the release  the dev promised there would be no zombies, dinos or monsters in this game  and their moderators, when asked about this change in the forums flat out lies about the dev  promising there would be no monsters, blaming the customer for buying the game in the first place.

I mean, look at the sales, They probably made more than enough money to hire a team (they are 2 guys), but the only new team member i know of is a pr guy. They should get a game designer who explains them what makes a game fun.

Crashed in an area of many small islands called 'PACIFICA', you travel from island to island gathering resources to survive, raiding other shipwrecks and planes crashes for specialty items, or craft what you need as you go....
there are only a couple of downsides for me personally...
1. when playing co-op online, there is no chat function, either in voice or in text, to communicate with your partner.
2. there was no mention of any goal other than surviving and the hope of rescue.....i mean, you find flare guns and once i heard a plane and tried to signal but nothing......but later through looking online, i found out that there are bosses to beat and a plane to find and repair, but i had to look for that info to find it, otherwise i might have been stranded for eternity!

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

This one adds the inability to eat more than two coconuts without vomiting (This is not a thing.) and more sharks in the archipelago than probably exist in the entire Atlantic Ocean.

On the other hand, you don't have worms start erupting from your flesh if you eat without washing your hands. So that's nice. 

Overall, it's one of the better games I've played. The survival mechanics aren't too ridiculous and the environment is gorgeous. It really feels like you're on the ocean during a storm or diving in shipwrecks while sharks prowl around. I'd probably list it as my second favorite survival game under Green Hell.

Some ideas that I wrote down after playing for 398 hours (142 on Steam, 256 on Playstation)....

- Ability to sit in chair; Sitting in chairs could heal broken bones a little faster, it could restore stamina a little faster, it could temporarily help fight exhaustion. As of now, the chairs have 100% no use, you can't even sit on them.
- Shelf: Allow 1 container to attach (Similar to container shelves that hold 3 containers)
- Ability to add hook to sail post so you can hang a lamp.
- Ability to check watch and compass while on rutter
- Hold flashlight or lamp in left hand and weapon in right hand.
- Add ""low"" and ""medium"" settings to SPF meter (UV), as of now it's either ""none"" or ""high""",1659043607,1663697551,False,93,7,0.76230311393737793,0,True,False,True

There is a subset out there that'd enjoy this game, but it strays a bit too far from what I like in a survival game for me to personally enjoy it.

Fair Warning: I did not complete the game, I know for a fact I only got partway through it but what I did play didn't feel like it justified the extra time I'd have to put in to make more progress. I bought this game years ago when it was first announced and it showed a LOT of promise, the fact that the early~mid game hasn't improved and is still buggy is upsetting and a letdown.

While it has, and seems to encourage, the building of some kind of a base/shelter doing so can end up feeling like a detriment more than a benefit. Yes, you will have a place to store your things and grow your crops but you then have to permanently strip away the resources of multiple nearby islands just to make yourself semi-self sufficient. You cannot regrow trees, so any logs/planks you need to use are permanently used and only one of the native plants naturally regrows requiring farming to reproduce anything of value. 

Your personal inventory is extremely limited as well, you can craft extra belt slots but those just turn into hotkeys and not extra inventory space. Also, when holding something in your hands that can stack more often than not you will not be able to swap out to a new item with hotkeys since it considers the item in your hand separate from the stack in your inventory as you grab one item at a time from it and your character is too dumb to put it back in the same slot without manual input. Considering we magically know how to make an antidote from a random plant and an empty coconut I find it surprising we don't know how to make a backpack or understand the concept of organization.

Then on the performance side of things, placing the game on ultra high causes a strange ghosting effect with every action that the player takes, this may be because of frame limitations and Vsync but those are both necessary as this is one of the games that will cause mid~high end graphics cards to burn themselves out without limiting their framerate/enabling Vsync. My RTX 3070 hit 100% usage and started hitting high heat the instant I turned off Vsync. Playing on high with Vsync/capped framerate removes the ghosting issue.

Again, I wish I could recommend this game, but it seems to have an identity crisis of what it wants to do. It allows and incentivizes building a farm and crafting stations but it also wants you to island hop great distances with a very limited storage capacity even after building storage containers on a raft.",1663616330,1663616330,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Yes)  Initially you may be impressed by the graphics.  It is beautifully made and the environment is very realistic, down to the ocean breeze and sound of waves softly washing up on the beach.  So next you look around your first Island getting some basic materials to craft some tools and such.  Building isn't complex, but it's neither intuitive or well thought out.  Build yourself a little shelter, then hop on your raft and check out a nearby Island for more materials.  Very fun and gives you high hopes at first.

No)  You quickly realize there is no content in the game, content is almost never added, and the feeling that you wasted your money on yet another EARLY RELEASE money scam.  Where is the game as of today (October 12th, 2016?)  About 2 updates away from where it was Oct 12th, 2015).  This is the stranded ocean version of DayZ... but with even less content and more bugs.

Edit:  Feb 28th, 2019.  Where is the game now?

Well I did my review almost 2 and a half years ago, so for an early access game, much should have been done to get it rolling to release, if not released already.  The sad truth is the developer completely lost it and couldn't stick to anything, and after 5 years in development, is less fun, more buggy and further away from completion due to so many changes that just keep messing things up and requiring more and more delays.  If this game ever leaves Early Access, it won't be because it's in a state to be released.  It'll be shoved out because... f*uck it.

This developer had a great idea... and no plan.  Stranded Deep is the result of that, and as it's name implies, is stranded deep in Early Access, never to be rescued or seen again.

Edit:  September, 2022.

So I decided to give the game another go after another 3 years.  Total 7 years in development now, so this should be a very finished and polished game by now.  There's a squid, a helicopter, some more building features, a multiplayer that barely works, and... yes... the bugs are still plentiful and sometimes game breaking.  Still looks beautiful, but at this point that doesn't even matter.

It's the first time I've been as disapointed with a video game. It is purely a scam to call this kind of product a ""release"" level game. 

TLDR: Game is broken. Run away while you can.

Some of the problems encountered in about 7h of coop gameplay:
- collision bug dragging a barrel, ended up flying away with my dead body stuck on the invisible sky roof, forced to relaunch game
- attacked by shark, got bump in the air flying over 5-6 islands, my brother spent half and hour searching my body floating in the middle of nowhere, forced to relaunch game
- impossible to reconnect to mate game (really often wished for, as a last hope to fix various bugs)
- impossible to open inventory, cannot be fixed with containers or raft, forced to relaunch game
- loading times when creating the game are reallyyyyy long (>5min, both computers are under 2 years old, 16gb ram or more, 4 cores or more, and both over fiber connections)
- ressources are sparse, as you would expect for a survival, but you cannot move/dismantle/unbuild some things like raft base, etc, it is often a real problem when for example a raft rudder is only in one direction but your sails are already built in another direction on the raft...
- when dead, character 3d models lose their hands and feet or get weirdly distorted, what is that?!
- french translation is a joke, inverted words, barely enough to understand items
- no setting to change language in game, randomly switched from french to english
- setting to set watch alarm (bipping non-stop with no control over it) sound level called ""UI sound""??? did anyone try to name things properly?!
- crafting using close items on the ground work absolutely randomly, sometines detecting everything, sometime not detecting the cloth item you are basically standing on
- randomly stuck save because ""someone was driving a vehicule"" whereas the 2 players present in the game were in front of the shelter...
- putting objects in the raft completely breaks all physics, making floating ressource gathering a real nightmare when you try to recover a floating tire in the middle of the sea for example
- growing the raft base is almost impossible without a mate orienting the existing base upward to avoid clipping in the ground (I bet this must be really funny on single player games)

I'm sure I have forgotten quite a lot of bugs and problems we had but these are some of the kind you will encounter playing.

So we decided to simply stop playing, not even because of frustration, but because we cannot play more than a few minutes before encountering a game breaking bug stopping us from playing and requiring a whole game relaunch and rejoin, taking several minutes.
I guess that now we have spent some time playing, giving every excuses to the game we cannot get a refund because we tried more than 2 hours.

Purely a scam.

Prefer playing to Raft if you are searching for a fun raft coop adventure game, it's not perfect but at least it's playable.

This game in it's earlier stages was absolutely mezmorising for me. I was so excited to get out there and play the game and watch it develop. Turns out the developing would come to ruin my experience. The game has a time limit unlike before, due to it's lack of regenerating resources. Subsequently, this game lost the majority of its content. So sad, I cry.  


2020

*HOLY MEGAFRICKIN EDIT*
2020 yall, my old review is unfathomably cringey, I mean I spelt mesmerising wrong n stuff Started playing this game again during quarantine and its BETTER THAN ITS EVER BEEN. They had an awkward dark period, but they've made some great improvements and the game is playable for hours on hours. Beautiful atmosphere, easy survival controls with varying difficulties for different leveled gamers. A map editor and a whole bunch of other stuff I haven't even gotten to. Needless to say I was VERY wrong about this game. Im so happy to see where it is today.

2022...

Aaaaaand they lost me again. Haven't really fixed or improved the quality of anything in this game. Been in an update drought for months, and worst of all the Developers are acting like they've done everything that needs to be done for this game. Its sad as hell because this game was the centre of my world for years, I practically grew up playing this game, and it just never reached the potential I thought it would. Thankfully Green Hell exists and has been filling the void in my heart, but I will never not be sad about what stranded deep could have been. All I can say is its just a very pretty, plateaued time waster now.

I won't even say the game is bad, it's just really annoying to play.
The content and the concept are fine, but the execution is sub par.

1. Terrible inventory management system
You can only hold about 8 unique items (maximum stacks of 4 of an item), which seems alright, except the basic items you need to take with you at all times add up to over half of that space, leaving you only being able to hold a few extra items while you're out exploring to find new resources. Normally you would want to find somewhere to dump all of the extra things you come across to make room for more, but for some reason a large crate holds less than half as much as your ""backpack"" and your pockets do. I say backpack like that because your character doesn't even appear to have an actual backpack. This also leads you to having many of these boxes thrown around your campsite because of how few items they hold. Also you should keep in mind that you found these boxes, you didn't craft them because of how tedious it is to find enough items to craft the ingredients required to craft whatever it is you need.

Also the user interface for your inventory in general just kind of sucks

2. ZERO indication on what some controls are
Want to figure out how to drop an item? You've got to guess. Want to figure out how to bind a tool to a hotbar slot? Figure it out yourself (yes, I ended up having to search the internet to figure that one out). In most games there's a small UI in some corner of your display that shows your options for what you can do with an item in hand, but this game has nothing. The input controls menu in the settings doesn't help either.

3. Frequent crashes
The game just doesn't want to keep running for some reason. I'll be a mile away from home on my life raft collecting items about to head back, and the game just gives up and freezes. And before anyone reading this assumes that I'm using a poor-spec system, I'll list them off for you:

CPU: AMD R7 3700x (clocked at 4.4 GHz, liquid cooled)
MB: Asus Strix x570-e
Memory: 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4 @ 3600MHz
GPU: Asus Strix 3070 8G OC
Storage: Samsung 980 Pro 1TB

The game runs smoothly, but it just randomly stops working. Kind of sucks because you can't just save your progress anywhere.

4. Sense of direction, but no indication of how to get there
Obviously, as you've been stranded on an island (or several of them), your goal is to get off of them. The thing is, though, the game kind of just leaves you hanging after you've finished the very basic and unhelpful tutorial. Eventually if you wander enough you'll come across the aircraft carrier, which has a plane on it. The plane is broken, though, and you know you need parts to repair it, but if you get easily bored of slowly paddling a life raft for miles between islands, good luck finding those parts. All I see is more little islands with a few shipwrecks around them, all holding the same basic materials.


I've given the game several chances to impress me or at least have me coming back to it, but I can't seem to enjoy it at all. I usually REALLY enjoy playing open world survival crafting games. I am a huge fan of Valheim, I have played Rust casually over several years, and I just finished The Forest (and LOVED it), which is why I came to this game. It had been sitting in my Steam library for about three or four years and I was looking for more in this genre after completing The Forest.

Update: I decided to give them another look after the August update.  And it's almost playable.. but the bugs and lack of common sense functionality is so frustrating.  For example, you can build a raft made of buoys and place it in the water... It will actually drift with the current which is neat, but the common sense ability to push it in the water doesn't exist.  In fact the ability for the character to interact with anything is completely missing.  Because of this, the game leaves you ""Stranded Deep"" In Frustration!
.......................................................................
It's a great start, but it lacks so many features and common sense that so many other similar games have already mastered.  I couldn't even call these needed bug fixes because it's just poor design.  I could list a hundred common sense repairs to this game.. just to make it playable.  Dev Team: if you need a list, just go to your competitors like Rust, Valheim, ARK, 7 Days, & DayZ to name a few...

The game, while showing some potential, is more than flawed. The combat is unresponsive and unfair, gameplay is barebones, lacks fun milestones or ways of significantly changing what you do(Throughout the game you gather the same resources, loot the same places and craft the same stuff, without real improvements or changes to the gameplay loop).
Crafting, while present, is no fun. New structures do not advance your progress by any meaningful degree, you can't customize your raft and there is no incentive to progress to the ""higher tiers"" of buildings.
The fact that you can't build any of the production stations on your vessel, yet the game requires constant island-hopping to gather new resources feels just wrong. The islands lack variation and seem to be always based on one of two blueprints you quickly learn to identify. The fact that you can tell what the resources, enemies and layout of every island is gonna be, before even setting a foot on shore kills any fun exploration might bring. 
The ""story"" adds 3 bosses but in combination with the unbelievably flawed combat system makes you dread every single encounter. 

And for every technical problem that the game has, the multiplayer makes it 10 times worse. It has everything: Absurd long loading times on high end systems, random disconnects, bugs, synchronization issues.

The game needs work. At times you can see the potential: General Gameplay idea, Nice graphic effects, the water behavior, atmosphere during thunderstorms, yet all of that pales in comparison to the issues.

I'll be honest... it doesn't *feel* like a 1.0 release, and I think it's a bit over-rated. There's some basic things that need some work: movement controls are semi-intuitive (toggle sprint by default isn't my favorite) but clunky (jumping is horribly implemented and doesn't trigger every time you hit the spacebar, climbing has no separate animation, pathing issues for the player moving from land to foundation), items in the hand are held at painful angles sometimes (especially the Torch), and... this is probably the most annoying... the inventory is both too large and too small.

Expounding on the inventory issue a bit: it's too large to feel realistic (even ignoring the issue of ""where'd you get that backpack?""), but so small it's annoying. It suffers from the Pokemon inventory meme of ""I can't fit 1 small Item, but because I have this other large item, I can fit three more"". Huge issue there. Now, you can craft items to wear that increase your hotbar, which is interesting, but I'm not really a fan. There's also no weight mechanic implemented, so you can just fill your inventory with logs no problem. Given the size of the logs... yeah... honestly probably not happening.

From a design perspective, it's not the worst progression... but it's also not good. There's some high-tier goals, and some low-tier goals, and it feels like a decent pacing. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of mid-game content. You get the basics handled, then it's grinding for the high-end stuff. And when you get there you avoid probably the best mechanic in the game: ocean travel.

This is actually something I had a lot of fun with. I need things my home island doesn't provide, so I go to another island to search for them. Early game, this is the life raft. Mid game, this is a custom raft (about the only mid-game goal you can have), and end-game, this is either a motorboat or a gyrocopter. What was fun was needing to travel with the wind, planning my direction based on that, as well as the waves (legitimately a worry) and avoiding storms. Night literally becomes a good time to travel to stay out of the sun (before installing a canopy). Also, watch out for sharks! The end-game item being a gyrocopter both largely invalidates your previous mid-game juggernaut of a good-sized ship. I'll grant that the motorboat is actually a legit end-game goal in its own right, so kudos there.

The sad part is that the gameplay loop is... better than most, but ultimately very simple. Go to new island, scavenge everything, take home. Cut trees, build fire, eat fish caught within 5' of the shore with tier 1 tool in less than 5 minutes. Not a whole lot of incentives to do... honestly, anything else, and the loot table is so small and the threat of drowning and sharks so real (that's fine, no issues with that being a thing) that except for the grind for engine parts... it's not worth the risk to dive.

If you're into pure exploration, and crazy danger, and a more relaxed survival game, this might be for you. It's beautiful, the ocean feels alive (could use a few more types of fish down there), and legitimately a solid game.

But ""solid"" doesn't mean ""good"". I love this type of game, but this one just doesn't capture my attention. My rating is a C+ at best. Doesn't fail in any particular area, but honestly... there's other games out there that scratch the same itch, and probably do it better.",1662941137,1662941137,False,2,2,0.513777256011962891,0,True,False,False

Be prepared to be reminded about that quite often. :-)

Graphics and atmosphere are really good! Gameplay, controls etc. not so much. 
The game just doesn't feel like a 1.0 released game. Seems to me like a rushed release somehow. Wasted potential. Could have been much more regarding gameplay and QoL features.
Crafting frustrates me most of the time. Many things feel unintuitive and/or more tedious than they should be.
It's disappointing, because the graphics and atmosphere in the game is so good! I really wanted to like it.
(And no, I don't need to play a game for 20+ hours to be able to review it. I played it years ago and returned to it now after the so called 1.0 release. There is not enough improvement to call this a ready and released game in my opinion.)",1662656542,1662656542,False,2,1,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

Couldn't pick things up, operate rafts, clipped though structures. The entire save was trashed.

Fast forward while and 1.0 comes out. We were hopeful until we read the patch notes. It saddened us to realize that even after several months, the multiplayer issues were still present and they acknowledged them but released anyway. I am not willing to put more time in the game knowing it could at any moment break and ruin a save.

2nd Hopeful Update: A buddy of mine convinced me to reinstall after the co-op update came out and I'm happy to say that a large majority of the issues have been fixed. 

Some of the problems that still exist are mostly minor but can cause problems if you don't save often. Beware of spaces in wrecks that look just big enough to squeeze in, you will most likely get stuck in the ground and drown and not be able to be revived because your body isn't actually where it appears to be. Desync with structures and rafts when each player is far apart is minor issue that can cause some odd things to happen but it's usually fixed when you rejoin the game.

All in all they have made some great progress and with a few tweaks will have an even better game than they do now.


Original Negative Review: Decided to give it another try after several years to see if things were more polished and to my disappointment, they were not. I would even go as far as to say they are worse. Within 20 min of starting the game I was dead. Not because of doing anything stupid or getting eaten by a shark but because my raft flipped over because a shark rammed it and while trying to right it, I tried to ""operate"" it to see if that might help and got stuck (wasn't able to stop ""operating"" the raft), upside down, under water, and drowned. To add to that, there were ""frozen"" sharks and other sea creatures and I feel like the object collision has become much worse.

Devs are barely supporting the game and has been in development for over 5 years. While technically there, there are bugs, and frustrating mechanics.

This game is hard to recommend, and suffers many problems. It's not terrible, but it needs some serious work, and frankly I have very high doubts that it will achieve a good game status.

The game play loop is as you would expect for a survival game. Gather resources, further your survival and take on harder challenges to make life easier. However, problems start to arise almost as soon as you start. Your ""core"" resources, the ones that are needed for almost all crafting recipes, are scarce and half of them are not even renewable. These resources are so scarce, that you will run out of stuff on the second day and are clueless as to what to do now. The goal then is to go to other islands to get more resources, but this starts to have problems as well and it has to do with your inventory.

The inventory of this game is the biggest offender. Your character's inventory is small and unintuitive. It's frustrating to manage, often making you drop things on the ground so you can pick up a different thing to put in your backpack and then picking up the thing you dropped because the game is not programmed to swap things in hand. But probably the most frustrating thing is storage. You can't make storage for some reason, despite being able to make a gyrocopter just from intuition. The only thing you can make is a container shelf. Keep in mind that the container shelf is not the same as a regular shelf. The container shelf can hold containers that you can find from shipwrecks. This is the only way to store things in this game, and the container has incredibly limited storage, only being able to hold 3 stacks of items. Your character can hold 8 + 1 items, the one being your hand. How is a container only able to hold 1/3 of what you can carry?

Certain things that look like they can store stuff are not what they appear. For example, you can craft a toolbelt. You might think, ""cool, i can store my tools on this to free up my inventory,"" but that isn't the case. No, the toolbelt only unlocks a certain amount of hotkey slots to assign your tools. How the hell does that even make sense? It is not worth making this.

So because inventory is a major problem, it starts to affect the entire experience. You need to go to other islands to get resources, but you can only carry so many and it can take a while to get back to your home island. You can build a raft however, and you can place container shelves on the raft so you can take less trips, but even that leads into another issue.

On top of being starved for resources, building things in this game is very expensive. Making a building is barely worth your time, and it eats up resources for breakfast. Again, half of these resources are not even renewable. The only things that are renewable are palm saplings, used to get fibrous leaves to make rope, and certain food plants. That's it. Rocks to make tools? Nope. Wood? Nope. There are enough here to get through the game, but it becomes a tiring grind to keep going to different islands just to get that one stick or plank you needed.

Technically speaking, it works, at least for me. I have read reports on the game outright not running on other systems but at the time it works for my system. There are various bugs, at one point my character somehow clipped into the floor of a sunken ship and prevented me from being able to resurface, and subsequently drowned. The graphics in this game are passable, rough around the edges but it works.

I have little patience for games that are released into early access only to be seemingly forgotten or not cared for. This game has been out for over 5 years now and has gone nowhere. Updates come out very slowly and don't seem to push the game forward. The last update only increased the world size and made the islands no longer placed on a grid.

All-in-all, you have a rather disappointing game that is thick with problems. I refuse to give this game any slack, as over 5 years of development should have smoothed out these problems by now, but it appears like the devs just don't care. Maybe they do, but until they show that I stand by what I say. I would not recommend this game.

(Edit) After keeping tabs on the game and seeing that it is now ""feature complete"", I decided to take another look to see if anything was addressed and tried replaying it. I can safely say that virtually nothing has changed and is still miserable to play. The only way they addressed storage was making item piles on the ground, but this solved nothing as you could already do that anyway.

Online multiplayer was added, which is a nice addition but I wouldn't want to play this game with friends anyway. I also read reports that it is buggy even after the update, but I cannot confirm that. 

Aside from that, keeping an eye on the updates shows that they were largely pointless, as most if not all updates did almost nothing except address a few bugs per update. It shocks me that it would take several months to address a few bugs, but I guess when you don't really care for your game it can take a while to get around to do it.

I still would not suggest this game. You're money is better spent elsewhere.",1599088122,1662061669,False,4,0,0.528834521770477295,0,True,False,True

Sure. I know, this is not the final version. And, since it is NOT a real life survival situation, i think a little map should be nice.

And of course, right now, i don't even want to start all over. And don't get me started on reality check. Pacific ocean and no ships or planes ??? Seriously, is it 1700s in the game? I guess not, with the private jet intro.

1.The idea - 10/10
2.Graphics - 9/10 (needs some tuning, so it doesn't look that shiny, as of right now it looks like DOOM 3.
3.Playability - sorry 5/10

Overall: requires a lot to work. Right now it is not entertaining, just a ""bunch of situations where i can kill myself"".

P.S. With some work you can get this game very good. And, i recomend the game, because i believe in developers of this game.

i dont normally write reviews,and im not going to stress about grammer or whatever,but thats besides the point

what the ever loving fuck is this?

 THIS is your 1.0? why,no actually WHY,there are MANY people trying their absolute hardest to try and explain or defend whatever kind of shitshow or excuse this is but they are either delusional,or stuck in some wierd fairytail,theres absolutely no need to prove this,any gamer whos worth anything knows this,theres SOOOOO many titles that either had the same,or worse conditions than this and made it out MUCH better,and this list continues to grow with many more games in EA RIGHT NOW,this is just sad

this is my take on it,its entirely opinionated so skip past this segment if you dont care,when it was made,it was pretty cool,didnt have it myself but i watched youtubers play it when it was very early on and they milked it DRY,grasping at straws for content,heres an example of this,paulsoarsjr,fuckin awsome guy and he has came back to it recently too and this game is still just basic lack luster,you go to an island,get annoyed by the stupid crafting system,wonder wtf do the toolbelts do if it just *hotkeys* the item,brush past that farm forever untill you have a mobile raft pretty much,sucks you cant put things like smokers on it so it just turns into row or steer simulator untill you get to kill the bosses,witch is the most easiest thing in the world,then go to the boat and the end,thats all she wrote,the most exilerating thing was less than 5% of the game and i LOOOVE survival games,in my eyes its the best genre,fight me,but this is just boring

there is an UNGODLY amount of game breaking bugs,VERY small amount of content,and thats if i ignored all other games like this,if i didnt,this looks like a shitpost game,or an impressive gamejam game,please PLEASE dont lie to us,or yourself by calling this 1.0,and just say you gave up,there would be more honor,more reasons and the true fanbase who do love this game would support you if there was something truly in your way,witch reminds me,hand this dead horse to the modding team,they are some talented fuckers who can revive piles of shit into true art peices like the steaming pile of 7 days to die,witch is another stile of game so its not apples to apples but tbh even they did more,and they redesigned their game like 5 times,remember this is THE 1.0,a small games BIGGEST achivement,this is THEIR completion,THIS MUCH EXITEMENT...for like 7 bugfixes..cmon man.. this is getting a bit long,and i feel like im doing what TFP did to their game and beat it like a dead horse,so 


if you take nothing from this,take this:  JUST SAY YOU GAVE UP

EDIT/UPDATE:
Nexus Mods has some promising mods for this game that may or may not work as intended.

Definitely still not as refined as some other survival games but it's still lots of fun with beautiful scenery both on land and under water - beautiful underwater wrecks! What I mean by ""as refined""; there are some features missing, like quickly changing between 1st and 3rd person view, (you have to use the menu for that) some effect sounds are missing, such as no sound when you turn on/off a flashlight and movement feels abit 'clanky' or clumsy esp. in 3rd person mode but it's not a game breaker at all. It's also completely missing  a mechanic for climbing over obstacles which, again is not a game breaker but leaves something to be desired. There seems to be quite alot of content with many things to craft and explore while trying to survive... In fact, there's lots of work to be done in the game but if you like this survival stuff, it's not a terrible grind that gets old and boring, not for me anyway and there are different modes to play with that let you explore freely, free of all dangers that is and a map editor which is particularily satisfying.",1660675732,1661596525,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It constantly goes off leaving you very little time to do anything other then figure out WHY your dying AGAIN! once your fed up with the beeping and switch to creative (passive) mode you will start to notice the other issues fairly quickly. so let me start by listing them off - 

1. saved games - its hard to figure out where and if your game has even saved as it doesnt show it. trying to simply load a saved game becomes a challenge fairly quickly. 

2. co-op anything - if you want just a local game best be sure you have controllers and that they are assigned (never actually explaining HOW to do this mind you). once you figure out you have to give the code to your friends then it becomes an issue trying to get them into the game (where a simple game invite would help a great deal!) 

3. trying to construct basic things - would or should be simple but alas in this game not so much. And trying to figure out how to craft a better raft will make you want to throw your computer!

I saw lots of videos when it was just released onto steam in Early Access. I was actually really hyped about it - I think it was released some time after The Forest came out in EA. The idea was really cool - obviously it looked like The Forest in water, but still. I haven't played much yet, but I can already tell you that the UI (especially the crafting one) sucks, so does the inventory and all of that. It's not really intuitive. There are skills, wchich I have no clue what they give - the game does not say anything about it - only in the store description of the game you can read that ""it gives you maximum efficiency"" - whatever that means... But still - I haven't read the desc on the store cuz why would I. 

The only good thing I can think of is the integration of the workshop. (For the developers, of course [but for the players too. at least kind of]) 
Money, money, money... Must be funny when you don't give a frick about content and just let the players add it for ya. Makes the game less likely to be abandoned by players so quickly. 

Also - I loled at the 1.0 release so badly. I can't tell wheter Beam Team was running out of money and they needed attention (""hey look, Stranded Deep was just released"", being on Steam Store frontpage defo gives some players [me, for example lol], even hates gives you attention [looking at the comment section under 1.0 release post]) or they are just tired of this project or they wanted to abandon it. 

Obviously this game is also just old. Don't be fooled by ""Date of release"" this game has been in Early Access for seven years, probably even more in development or even in the designing stage. The core of the game itself is a bit rotten. Some games can survive in Early Access for many, many years and still be good. (Software Inc. as an example, it just left the alpha stage [it was in it for 7 years]) But this type of genre, is not it. The video game scene has been developing really rapidly - new GTX, RTX and all that stuff. You constantly have to up not only your graphics to meet the today's standards, but also mechanics, new features, now content. But being a small studio, publishing a game on your own - does not give you many options...

I couldn't actually decide wheter I should give it a positive or a negative review... But I'm leaning more towards the second one. Maybe... just maybe I'll play it some more, maybe it'll hook me up with something... interesting. Or idk, anything actually. I'm not gonna refund it for now - But if you want to still buy it I'd actually advise you to at least wait for a sale (like 40%, maybe)",1661277551,1661277551,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

There's no objectives to start off with, and the game does not even show you a tutorial or anything in regards to your controls or how to do things. You have to either figure it out yourself, or dig through their ridiculous settings. And when we were finally able to understand how to even play and build, we couldn't even use half the items, let alone what the raft had. 

My friend got poked by a shark, and upon his death his character glitched and flew up in the air, and then t-posed. Even with the bandage from the raft, I couldn't even bring him back, even though it gave me the indication on his character that I would be able to. I had to quite literally go inside his character JUST to revive. And on-top of all this, when the watch started beeping, it did not stop. Ever. Even when we got all our stats halfway/almost full, the watch. Still. Kept. Beeping. Non stop. 

Overall, the idea that the creators had for this game was great. You're stranded on an island with only a raft that has a couple basic supplies, then you have to try and survive the island. It's a great and fun idea, IF IT WAS EVEN DONE RIGHT! There's so many bugs/glitches in this game, and it took so long to even be able to invite my friend to the lobby, let alone even get anywhere in the raft because, surprise, it glitched and almost didn't move.

The first time, I spawned onto a freight car and couldn't get my raft off. The second attempt, no crabs were spawning and I couldn't complete the tutorial missions. The third time I was spawned onto an island with hostile pigs that killed me almost immediately.

This game isn't conducive to building. You can only place 1 item at a time before have to go back and select that same item again. Basebuilding takes 3x as long because of bad UI. You have to hammer a whole bunch just to build anything decent. EVERY SINGLE item.

The supply chain is too extreme. Rope is needed for a lot of things, but leaves/fibers to make the item are far and few between. It takes 4 leaves to make 1 rope. The yucca tree drops 5 leaves. Yet, the big trees don't drop leaves? That makes no sense.

So what happens? Well, I killed the boss.

Did I enjoy the fight? Hell nope..
Do I want to fight another bosses? Nope, thanks.
Do I want to finish game after this crap? Not really.
Do I want a refund? Would be nice, but I played too long, preparing for bosses, mindlessly collecting resources and building raft.. too long.

And more about boss fight itself:

Some flickering model under the buoy, constantly changing direction, without clear attack pattern or anything. It just pull me from raft as soon as I get climbed on it. In-between I was shooting from speargun (top game weapon). Once I used bandage. Then boss glitches, it had 0 hp on screen while I was shooting and shooting.

During the fight storm begin. No devs had thought to make boss fight easier by preventing game freaking weather change. Oh I hate weather so much, it disrupt all my activities constantly with storm or huge waves.. it is so annoying to loose time before I can finally enjoy a bit of diving and scavenging for resources with a good sunny weather. Did I say sunny? Game has night, to make everything dark and annoy you even more... 

I was disrupted, sorry.. 

Storm begun and it become impossible to see the boss from the surface, so I went into a water, pretty sure I will be dead in no time. But no I wasn't instantly killed or anything. So I was just shooting and shooting.

Somehow it died and body immediately disappear, without letting me to recover ammo, I only saw how all arrows quickly drown. I had 48 and my hunting skill 6/7, means I should be doing quite some damage. Did I miss a lot? Not really, the boss was like hedgehog in arrows.

And after boss fight I had to sail back to my island to restock. And you know what happen? I just get lost, good thing I didn't save yet, so I can load game and enjoy boss fight again... ><

---

Everything I am doing in this game feels clunky:
- clunky combat, huge hit boxes, huge reach of enemy hits, either on the ground or under the water;
- clunky boss fights (read above);
- clunky craft, UI doesn't remember what I just crafted, after crafting 1 item I need to find it again in a huge list with many tabs;
- clunky exploration with clunky weather and clunky dangerous fishes/snakes which can hide or swim directly to you, await for you in an unexpected room of drown ship to poison you;
- clunky navigation, where game engine doesn't render game objects (e.g. a huge ship) or lights on my base, rendering either surrounding useless for navigation, all islands looks nearly the same, little, boring, with few ships around each..
- clunky survival, eat coconut 3 times and you are dead, can't even skip the night, because wake up time is freaking random;
- clunky raft building, when everything is in red color, refusing to build;
- clunky base building, you can't have a nice base, something require ugly ground;
- clunky inventory system, I doubt a worse system exists;
- clunky island generation, the stone/clay deposit may spawn inside the ship, the inpenetrateable bushes may cover valuable resource spawn;
- clunky enemies, they are buggy, flew, getting throwing into a water, run in circles, I bet any beginner gamedev would write a better AI than devs of this game did..
- clunky UI, you can't even say for sure what level your skill..

And more:

- no vitals on screen, to check HP you need to hold some button and switch to a proper tab out of 3;
- lots of bugs;
- building doesn't return resources, they don't even have sound associated, nor show their health, simply disappear after hitting few times with an axe;
- fish can swim on island;
- boar can swim on the bottom of the sea;
- shark can go through stone and sand on a shallow water;

I stop here. DO NOT buy this game. DO NOT support devs, who out of sudden release 1.0 without polishing their game first.

For one, co-op mode is buggy. Several times we had to log out and log back in because he could see me but he was invisible to me. This was made even more inconvenient because the time it takes to sync back up to each other after logging back in is insane. 

As far as bugs go, solo or co-op, they're annoying to say the least. The raft will randomly flip you out and send you flying, or the raft itself will go flying 100's of feet away from you. Sometimes objects don't spawn until your right next to them. 

And the poorly thought out game play. There are many ways to desalinize water, but this game allows only one. You can build a gyro-copter, but you can't figure out any way to get fresh water other than a cloth and some dead leaves? The game mechanics themselves are rough and annoying. Jumping works, sometimes. Or sometimes not at all. 

And on top of all that, the visuals aren't that great either. The water is nice. Character animations are wonky. Just hard to get any immersion.

Once the co-op is fixed, it would be great to be able to have at least 4 players instead of just 2, as it is now. More options for building rafts and bases would be greatly appreciated as well. (and some reason to actually build a base, as of now there isn't one, you just travel in  your raft from island to island gathering resourses to build a better raft).Like I said, it's fun with a friend, but it could be so much better with some tweaks here and there. Improve inventory system, add some avatar personalizaition options so that we are not clones. As it stands now it's eiher man or female with only 1 model each. Also, more story elements. I've been playing for 40 hours and have yet to find anything regarding the story. The survival is good, but it needs more events, A MAP! Or at least a map that you can ""complete/discover"" as you go. As of now, there only is a compass and you have to map the isles on paper yourself. Add objecives, fix that the ""tutorial"" doesn't work on co-op, so if you start playing with a friend, you have to figure everything out on your own. Some things are not very intuitive/user friendly. Some things you can craft by interacting with the object but others (like planks and cloth) have to be crafted from within the crafting menu while being next to the device that allows you to craft it (Plank maker thing and the loom).

If you love collecting loot to craft, then this is the game for you. Surviving depends on crafting. All sorts can kill you in this game, animals, poison, and more. The game has storms as well. There are limited resources, so this keeps you exploring. Build a raft and head out to sea but make sure to pack essentials for the trip. Everything so far has been so enjoyable. 

This game could be better in terms of building houses. There doesn't seem to be much point other than to keep you from getting sunburnt (but you can go under a shady tree or under boat canopy to prevent this). Also if you disassemble a building, you won't get your materials back. It would be better if you could reuse some resources. Or even a function where you can move built structures would also be ideal. 

Other than that, this is a super fun game when you feel like something light- but also keeps you on the edge of your seat to keep your character surviving. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games.

As other reviews mention, rafts get caught up on stuff pretty easily, but that is actually believable. Running aground is a real threat and isn't easily fixed IRL, so that is more of a feature than a bug to me.

We need a way to obtain more rocks long term. I understand why they're limited, but being a finite resource that can prevent long term play from being viable. Maybe have deep underwater nodes that respawn while the stuff on islands doesn't?

He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.

I find myself drawn to it over and over because I very much enjoy survival crafting games. I've given it a no, however, because despite being considered fully released (at the time of writing) it still feels like an early access title. There are bugs, especially with the creatures. They float, they disappear into the earth, they can be seen standing in the air in the distance. There is a lot of polishing this game STILL needs, which makes me sad. I can't say anything regarding the story, as I've not gotten far enough to truly give feedback on it. 

I know this is a weird gripe to have, but the shark ai bothers the hell out of me. I understand it's a game and realism isn't exactly the focus, but these heat-seeking tooth torpedo's always draw me out of my immersion. They're just too aggressive and I never really care for fear-mongering animals that don't really deserve it. That being said, they are well modeled and animated and it does feel rewarding to take one down, especially as someone who is terrified to go in the ocean. 

The Raft buoyancy thing drives me up the wall. Maybe I just don't completely understand it, but it feels wildly inconsistent. Maybe it's just the weight of the items/animals that are off, but it feels like you absolutely HAVE to have a large, unwieldy raft in order to cart any of the larger items. Which sucks because they feel necessary. My raft is 6x4 with some storage on it, but it can't carry a single barrel without sinking a little? My raft base is made up of 24 barrels, how is it not supporting the one? I can understand a large shark weighing the rafts down, they're heavier than you'd expect, but barrels and tires shouldn't be this difficult. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to transport the big metal storage panels, if not downright impossible. I get wanting things to be challenging, I really do. Challenging can absolutely be fun, but in this case it is more irritating than anything. The physics with the raft is wonky still too. Things jitter as the raft moves, sometimes an item you have placed on the raft won't sink it, but you'll lose all control of your raft until you get rid of it. I feel that this in particular is unacceptable for a game that claims to be fully released. The rafts are such a key feature of the game, they NEED to work. Moving items from island to island in order to survive is so important and you can't even do it properly.

Overall I say consider it heavily before you buy. If you really enjoy survival/crafting games then by all means pick it up. It's come a long way and can be worth the money and time you invest into it. It just needs some fixing. Once it's had some patches, assuming they are still working on the game, I'll consider giving it a thumb's up.",1660600276,1660663197,False,3,1,0.547885239124298096,0,True,False,False

I was an early adopter of the game back in 2015 when it was very buggy at release...years later not much has changed I see. After about 10 hours of playing this ""full release"" 1.0 version, I was bitten by a shark that was missing a hitbox, it then flipped my big raft that was already sinking because there were boxes on it (because ""physics""), I was bleeding and was not able to craft a bandage despite having the materials, so I reloaded a save...which was promptly corrupted/deleted. So thanks for that 'beam team'!

Though the game has interesting concepts, and makes the 'grind' a little less 'grindy'. The entire thing is ruined by poor execution, bad bugs that make the game almost unplayable: hit boxes are the worst I've seen in a game in 20 years, shadows and reflection mapping is terrible, screen tearing is awful, save game system is pretty craptastic, island creation mode is unusable, last but not least object manipulation...oh its hot GARBAGE!! By ""hot garbage"" I mean like manipulating-a-pile-of poop-with-a-backhoe-wearing-oven-mits bad! Its somewhat of a joke that the developer has opted for a full release of this game when it has so many obvious issues...its certainly a ""full release"" of something. 

If you want a great survival style game with better mechanics, try anything but this. Like 'DayZ' or 'Green Hell' or 'The Long Dark' or 'SubNautica' or 'The Forest'.  heck these guys basically copied the intro from 'The Forest' anyway, so you might as well play a good game after experiencing the same intro anyway.

In its finished form, Stranded Deep is interesting on the surface, but ultimately empty. There is little to do here, sadly, because I don't have a lot of the same complaints that others do. The inventory, while clunky to manage, is not a nightmare. It works. The building works. The rafts work. At first, exploring wrecks and hauling up boxes of mystery loot is exciting, but after your fifth or sixth wreck, when you get the same stuff AGAIN, you will realize there isn't anything more to the game.

After 30 hours I have done everything there is to do, and then did it again. And again. And again. I kept wanting there to be more, but there just isn't.

this game has many flaws. and game mechanics could have been much better.

there are only 2 types of islands. the smaller starter Islands and the one with a big rock in the middel. there is NO variety. The islands look all the same and the majority of downloadable custom islands are loaded with resources. that takes away all the challenge.

survival mechanics are extremly poorly developed. 
there are only 3 needs. Water, Food and Sun exposure.
you can sleep in this game but its completly irrelevant. you can go on for ever without sleep and there is no punishment for that. more sofisticated survival mechanics would have been very welcomed. 

the base building is very clunky. one of the worst compared to other base building survival games.

raft building is very basic. It would have been so cool to build a more personalized raft.
the whole Idea of building your own raft is such a cool concept.
But you dont have many options and putting tons of shelfs on the raft (which is quite a nesessity) makes them so ugly.

The whole base game has a great foundation.
But the game development could have been executed much better.

I dont belief one second that the Devs are happy with what the game has become. I dont belief that they are really that disconnected to their own game and to the community. the devs dont communicate openly with the community.
now they say the game is complete its version 1.0.  but there are still so many flaws and buggs to fix and certainly there are allot of thinks to improve.",1660341491,1660341491,False,3,1,0.534451723098754883,0,True,False,False

Wanna make a tool? You better have sticks. You better have lashing. You know how you get lashing? Repeatedly chopping down saplings and yucca trees which take TWO DAYS to respond, and you can plant them, but be prepared to make another construction tool that doesn't do anything else besides unlock a different crafting menu and waste space in your tiny inventory of only eight items, when the game expects you to be carrying an axe, knife, and weapon at all times. Crafting skill is also a rather irritating addition from the stable release (as far as I could tell), and while more realistic, it makes the game less enjoyable. Imagine if in Minecraft, you couldn't make an iron pickaxe until you made 7 stone pickaxes, on top of only having your hotbar for your inventory. That's how it feels to make and carry items in Stranded Deep. It's *awful*.

Oftentimes, you might come across certain conditions you can't really do anything about because they're only cured by certain things, and you have to travel between islands to get them (mind you, if you want to do that in a way that doesn't take forever, you have to build a raft, which is incredibly cumbersome and costly if you use anything besides default sticks as materials). The game revels in realism, yet it's the worst part of the game. Animals worth hunting cost immense resources to even kill, and you can only replenish your health by having full hunger and thirst. The only time you might use those bandages you get at the start of the game is if you're using them to revive dead players in multiplayer, and that's if anyone would want to waste their time on this for multiple hours on end.

Nothing in Stranded Deep is particularly fun, because you work so hard for so little. The game is time-consuming, to a fault, and only feels rewarding due to the immense effort required in obtaining even basic necessities such as food, water, tools, and better travel across water and islands to acquire more resources in which the player is always in desperate need of, such as rocks and leather for crafting more than basic tools.

It's been 7 years since I first watched a YouTube video on Stranded Deep and fell in love, then I played it on my first account back when you would make martinis in the plane. This is the one game that I have followed since it's beginning, and now it's finally released. Every update, every hiccup, and every announcement has led to this. And I have to say, as a core follower, I have mixed feelings. On one hand I am amazed that a team of two developers made something as big as this, and made their dream come true. On the other, I wish they had done things a bit differently. Since it became more popular, there has always been 2 large issues. 1) A lack of communication and compromise with the community, and 2) A lack of priority balance between bug-fixing, content creation, and timely updates. I know it's unfair to just complain about issues without explanation, so I propose some ideas that may help with future endeavors. The greatest detriment to the development of Stranded Deep was communication. In the future, more community posts detailing progress and plans will make the community feel like it hasn't been abandoned. Also, while it is important to put your dream into the world, if you want anyone to play it you need to compromise and let the community have input. Another complaint I've seen a lot is the very large number of bugs that have been around a long time remaining unfixed while content is being pushed. I would've recommended taking time to make the game stable before expanding it. I don't want to come off as a hater because as I said in the beginning, I've loved this game since it was created. But these are just some friendly critiques that I feel may help in your hopefully long and prosperous future. As far as a recommendation? If you're new, absolutely, give it a try. If you're a veteran like myself and you're thinking of giving it another go to see what has come of it, I don't think it's a good idea. To grow up with the game, and then see the potential and spark in the game's eye fade is rather heartbreaking.

[h1]My full review: [/h1]
Honestly, this game was fun for a bit. Playing with some friends is a blast for a while but that's all I could say about this game. This game had a surprising amount of potential with its awesome graphics and premise, the sheer amount and was the game that really popularise the raft survival genre for years to come. It was so popular that youtubers like Markiplier, jacksepticeye and even PewDiePie was playing this back in 2015. 

I bought this game back when this game shortly after close this game was first put up on steam back in 2015 and it was fun for about 6-7 hours. At the time, it was understandable that the game was bare bones but after playing it again after 7 years out of curiosity of the state of the game, I was surprised on how the game still felt the same bare bones feel to it but I was curious enough to play multiplayer with a friend and it was fun for a bit until me and my friend drop this game out of disinterest. This game looked awesome but didn't had the engaging content to continue playing and had a lot of bugs to the point where it was ridiculous like a shark colliding into our starting raft that it was sent flying to the stratosphere on our first day or frames dropping in for the second player whenever your massive raft is being dragged by a player. 

And when I saw news that 1.0 came out, I looked at the patch notes and it looked like they didn't even update a lot of things to warrant a complete product like building is just meaningless due to there still being no reason as animals and monsters are still buggy and just go through walls if they felt like it, there isn't a way that I know of to locate the direction of the 3 bosses needed to complete the game and monsters are somewhat buggy especially the wild boar where it tends to just get stuck sometimes or even just levitate and when you kill it with spears it tends to just spazzes out. 

The game probably came out of early access probably because a better survival raft game called 'Raft' came out nearly 2 months ago to great success, it felt like the devs didn't want to update this game which is more evident by the slow update pace back when it was in early access. I mean fair enough but it's a bit of a shame really. All I hope now is that if Beam Team makes a new game, it wouldn't repeat the same development process as this game both game wise and developers' feeling wise.",1660278063,1660278063,False,11,0,0.585015296936035156,0,True,False,False

However one of the major issues I have with this game is a lack of content that is interesting outside of searching the same like 10-20 (if I'm being nice) copy pasted shipwrecks over and over again to find resources that are hard to get and some that can't even be crafted. The other issue I have is that there is a series of levels that prevent you from building certain items or tools because you don't have the right level, it really discourages you from getting a crop plot built so you can plant more food. Along with these problems is how the inventory works, it is terrible, you have 5, 6 slots, maybe, to put things in, you get a lot of things you need to carry with you, axe, knife, food, water, etc. on top of that you also need to have enough inventory to be able to carry whatever you find said shipwrecks which leads to you needing to drop everything so you can pick up almost everything of value from them.

In general this game could've been really good if it had more time to be fine tuned and if the devs added more content to explore and do, but alas it was not to be, but for that, I wouldn't recommend buying this game, as looks can't save something that is hollow at its core.",1660257411,1660257411,False,3,0,0.526462376117706299,0,True,False,False

The survival elements on normal difficulty are very casual and combat elements are limited to hunting and fighting sharks. Just make sure to build a raft before you build a base; the good resources are all finite, and building costs can be pretty steep.

There's no practical application to building bases, but you can build some nice looking buildings to spruce up your home island. Raft building is absolutely barebones, so don't go into this expecting it to be like Raft. While there are a few different types of raft bases, there are only a handful of things that can be built above deck: motor, rudder, sail, anchor, canopy, storage container shelf, light post. No genuine customization of any kind.

The real selling point is the environment. The map is gorgeous and fun to explore, and the light survival elements keep you engaged enough for it to be immersive. That said, after 80+ hours, I'm starting to wonder what my end-goal is (the boss fights just look tedious, so I'm not going to bother). Unfortunately, it all starts to lose its charm once you've explored a few islands and realized they're all essentially the same. There's very little variability of animals, so hunting is limited to 2-5 aggressive land animals and 0-2 passive land animals per island. After exploring ~20 islands, I've found that most just have the two giant crabs, which sucks because I really enjoy the challenge of hunting snakes.

I wouldn't say that it's worth the full $15. You may want to wait for it to go on sale, since I don't see it having much replay value.

UPDATE:
Changing my review to a thumbs-down after the devs had the nerve to call the most recent update ""1.0"". The game is still suffering the same bugs it has been for years, and devs have completely given up on fleshing out the game. Adding co-op managed to break a ton of game features, even in solo, and that has yet to have been resolved. Once they started porting the game to consoles (opening a new market of unsuspecting chumps), they stopped putting any real effort into fixing the PC version.

Game is mediocre, and devs are trash. If you do buy this, make sure to get it on sale. It isn't worth more than $5, and it is not going to be getting better.",1634942607,1660256959,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who has dived in both Southeast Asia and Australia however, I can tell you that the developers put very little realism or attention to detail in this game. Sharks have been very demonised in this game. I have swam with sharks before and the only way to get attacked by sharks as often as you do in this game would be to wear a wet suit made from freshly caught fish meat. 

Other inconsistencies are:
   - Wild pigs may be aggressive if you approach them by surprise but they would not track a human all over an island to attack them.
   - Giant crabs don't spend a lot of time on land and when they are on land, they cannot run due to the weight of their shells.
   - In this game you can make a raft base out of tyres. TYRES?? They don't float. Their inner tubes might but the tyres don't.
   - Light from the sun can penetrate much deeper into clear Pacific waters than it does in this game. 

The developers have also released this game as the finished project but there are still some very noticeable glitches in it.

There is no official mod support for the workshop, they force you to use a third party program just to share maps you made on the workshop, and that is all there is on the workshop is player made maps.

________________________________________________

UPDATE 17/12/2019
Despite me saying I wouldn't come back to this game I got really bored so I decided I was going to see what was different. I'll credit the devs with not giving up on this game but in all honesty this game still lacks purpose and I yet again got bored after surviving just 6 days (which is a few hours of gameplay... maybe 5 or so?)

Like there are things in this game that just feel simply pointless like building a base... why bother? you cant save in it, you cant even use items in it, you can build a shelf but that shelf doesnt even store objects on it... The storage and inventory management is still atrocious having about 20 boxes in your base that hold 3 items in each meaning you have stacks of them that are taller than small palm trees and bushes. You still cant carry a lot of them on your raft without it wigging the hell out and going berserk. Barrels and bouys etc and pretty much anything other than these storage boxes cant go on the raft either cos that will still cause it to go absolutely nuts.

I honestly couldn't tell you what the end game is or if there even is one because I loose interest in it way too damn quickly to work it out. Why is this important? because well at this stage this game is probably never going to get finished in a way that does it justice.

I know this is very negative and I really wish it didn't have to be, but being a lover of sharks this game caught my attention as soon as it popped into early access. It's made me sad to see that a game that was supposed to be out of early access in 2015 (the same year it went into early access) is still almost the same game 4 years later and like I said I will give credit to the devs for sticking with it. THE DEVS ARE NOT INCOMPETENT and a credit to them and the studio for sticking with this game. Who knows in a few more years maybe it will be the game that I was hoping for but for now its still the same old uncomplete stranded deep.

UPDATE 23/01/2018
To start off with this game has had so many damn ""hotfix"" updates its just ridiculous. It kinda sets off a big WARNING sign just by looking at the newsfeed for this game. Every ""major"" *Cough* update has about 4 hotfixes after it just to fix the problems with the update. this happens EVERY time... like... come on.

So it has been a year since I last played this game and I am content with saying that this game is done and dead for me. There are barely any noticeable changes to the game, the gameplay itself is just boring and after you play the first few hours you're just like... I am gonna go drown myself or jump into the water and see how many sharks I can kill before I die. I am not kidding. Seriously. It gets VERY boring VERY quickly. It feels like the game isn't even in the same direction anymore. I would have hoped for a wider playable area by now but NOPE still tiny AF, some more wildlife perhaps? nope. Still the same. Don't bother wasting your money. This game is going nowhere REAAAAAALLY slowly. The development is like its own survival story. 

I find it hard to really say anything positive about the game at this point so I am not going to even try. Sorry.

UPDATE 27/12/2016
after 6 months of not playing i decided to give the latest build a try.  I did notice some visual improvements specifically related to the player model and the islands. I also noticed the addition of a new inventory UI (which is pretty great) and the more pointless change of the crafting UI.  Tbh It seems like a lot of time is going into a lot of pointless changes in this game that should NOT sacrifice time from making the overal game experience. You barely see any other types of sharks or any real marine life. The sharks behave pretty much the same as they used to but dont get stuck in the ground.  Even a 3 man team should have had all of these ""updates"" done within a year.... not 2. 

So look. this game is worth getting if you get it on a steam sale, even if its just to play around with it for a few hours. BUT DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO EVER LEAVE EARLY ACCESS AS A COMPLETE GAME THAT CONTATINS DAYS OF FUN!

UPDATE 22/06/2016
SOOOOOOO the latest adition to the game came out.... saw some pretty bad gameplay of it.... havn't bothered to even try them out..... that says something about the ""update""....



UPDATE 26/01/2016
IMPROVEMENTS! FINALLY. With the latest addition of custom rafts and storage containers on them (coming soon) I CAN FINALLY SAY THAT THE DEVS HAVE LISTENING, and also raised the bar. Multiple changes from different construction types and larger islands have made this game umbundant with fun.

You also don't see sharks every time you jump into the water..... which is nice.



UPDATE 30/09/2015
I still think this game is a gem... however because you cannot store things in your raft, that gem has stopped the raft from moving, flipped it upside down, fallen all the way down in the deep water biome never to be seen again. 

Developers. Seriously. What happened? The changes you have made are barely noticeable you would swear that this game was just released for pre-alpha
.

ORIGINAL THOUGHTS

This game is great for a pre-alpha just released.

I personally do not find it similar to ""the forest"" and I have seen the development of that game since the game was first available on steam. This game has A  HECK OF A LOT OF POTENTIAL!!!! the crafiting system is AWESOME and going in the water at night..... well... let's just say FUCK THAT.

Stranded Deep is... well, interesting. I don't necessarily mean that in the conventional sense, as in terms of features, it's pretty basic and barren compared to many survival games. Still, it is... unique? I hesitate to call it that, as many similar titles do exist, but in fairness, a lot of them draw inspiration from this game. As such, I wouldn't call it unimaginative, just... well, unfinished, which I realize is an odd comment to make considering that it just saw its 1.0 release.

Sure, people have made some very legitimate criticisms of the developers, what with unmet goals, not listening to the community, and a number of other things. Honestly, I feel a bit uncomfortable bringing it up, as I haven't really been paying attention, but it's still worth mentioning.

Now then, content. The area that many people say this game is lacking in, and I would be inclined to agree. Many older games are still fun to play and conventionally good by modern standards because they make up for their aging appearances with diverse and varied gameplay that never truly gets old. Stranded Deep is sort of the opposite. Its beautiful visuals do their best to cover up that, at its core, the game is somewhat lacking in features. It's immersive to a point, don't get me wrong, but not necessarily all that engaging. 

Still, I feel that there's something here, and I haven't heard enough people bring it up. If you want a beautifully polished survival game with a decent story, go play Subnautica or The Forest. I have yet to try out Subnautica, but from what I've seen and heard, it speaks for itself. In that department, Stranded Deep doesn't hold a candle to other survival games.

Where it shines is the relaxing element. Video games don't all have to be super engaging. When I'm stressed out, I like to play games that take away some of my attention, but still allow me to decompress as opposed to switching all of my focus from one thing to another. The Forest, for instance, is an absolute masterpiece, and one that I highly recommend, but it certainly isn't relaxing. Stranded Deep just is, and while that might not be for everyone, I enjoy it.

To sum it up, a large number of the criticisms people make of this game are entirely justified. It's light on features, the devs have made a number of promises that they haven't kept, and the story is, to say the least, lacking. I certainly wouldn't call it a terrible game, but it's not an award winner either. At the end of the day, though, it's fifteen dollars, and considering all of the enjoyment I've gotten from it, I can't not recommend it.",1660195178,1660195178,True,93,3,0.800191223621368408,1,True,False,False

There's a good base game here but so many mechanics need the code to be scoured for bugs and or adjustment. For instance, sleeping should always awaken you at dawn not when it's still the evening hours (you can't sleep again so soon).

And I've had so many items just vanish/drop from my inventory even when I haven't dropped anything unintentionally at all like axes, lost my compass a few times and countless knives.

Inventory needs a lot of love, there's just no space even the items that stack you can't carry more than a few in each given slot.  And Traveling on the life raft an hour after creating a character because there wasn't more than 4-5 rocks on the starting island is bad.

In addition you can build massive rafts which is very cool and does give you something to aim for but you cannot build walls, half walls, or any building structures on your massive raft. Even something so obvious as a bed, or in this games case a shelter cannot be placed on the surface of a raft.

Even the design here is just bad, for example: you can make a raft and expand it, but if you missclick and build the raft base next to the existing raft, it cannot be combined to it afterwards. You don't even get to deconstruct it so you just lose the resources.

Fun concept. Raft is the same but with no bugs, more fun, infinite (this game is not infinite and most resources just deplete) and more content. Only thing this has got is better graphics.

The overall feel of play-style sways towards simplicity, relying on resource shortage and brutal forward planning in order to hold up the game play mechanic. The world doesn't really feel like it wants to open up to the player, instead opting for a feeling of helplessness and an inevitable grind towards success.

Crafting is, at best, basic and, at its worst, frustrating. Creating a raft (your primary item of choice if you wish to survive) is simple, but also tricky to undertake because of physics collisions, weight distribution problems (placing a single vehicle tyre onto your raft can have the entire construction spinning out of control, or cause it to drown) and space restrictions. It's meant to be realistic, but the execution of it is glitchy and immersion-breaking, often adding frustration to your task. On top of that, there is very little you are allowed to add to the raft as a vehicle, ending up with your final creation being uninspiring and boring. Want to build a little sleep area that's enclosed, with maybe something to cook on - Nope! You can construct a shelf system for your crates, a sail, a rudder, a simple stone anchor and, if you're really feeling fancy, you can build an outboard engine. The latter of which requires a contrived, painfully slow process of farming potatoes (from limited resources) in order to distill them into fuel. It all feels a bit over-the-top., while also being incredibly underwhelming.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2839474907
Crafting on land is marginally more involved, with basic structures that you'd expect from a castaway survival situation. It's not terrible, but it's not particularly inspiring either. With resources being cruelly sparse, requiring plenty of island hopping to support any form of player home settlement, it soon becomes tiring to have to travel vast distances just to get some sticks or enough fiber for crafting [i]and[/i] water production. Some might enjoy the challenge - indeed I did at first - but it soon becomes a grind, taking away the thrill of exploration and discovery and replacing it with necessity. Not really good for anything but die-hard survivalist wannabe's.

As for the story - I honestly haven't come across anything so far that gives me a clue of what I am supposed to do to get home. It might be something added on final release, but as yet it's a big mystery to me. I see hints of what I can craft from the story (4 items) but there's no connection to them in any form so far in my 21 hours of this play-through (Day 32) that I am attempting in July of 2022. Hopefully that will change. People shouldn't have to look up spoiler guides and sift through forums just to find out what they should be doing. Short of that you will likely just float aimlessly around the game world until you bump into something, which could take little time for the bold explorer, or tens of hours for the cautious gamer.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840476978
Now to the bugs; There's plenty! Physics causing catapulting of trees when cutting them down, physics glitches with your raft, instability issues and (for me) a flickering shadows problem that has existed for 7 years, with no progress made by the developers to fix it. I am not alone with this glitch. It's apparently quite common, especially the further you explore and on the larger islands. It's not the end of the World, but it breaks immersion considerably and is extremely uncomfortable on the eyes,

Visually (aside from technical bugs), the game is very pretty to look at. The water elements are quite beautiful and there's plenty of wildlife to make it feel alive and atmospheric. Colour use is decent, giving a truly tropical feel to the environment. Indeed, graphically it is a great showcase of what modern game engine technology can produce. Especially when it's designed by a fairly small team.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840476961
My gripes: 
1) [b]Graphical glitches need to be prioritized by the developers.[/b] It's not good to have a screen output that's uncomfortable to look at or that ruins all the hard work that's gone into creating this beautiful environment.
2) [b]The islands are all far too small.[/b] There's too much emphasis on forcing players to island-hop for resources. Encouraging the player to explore can still be achieved without brute force. The island sizes never offer enough space for a player to get comfortable in the game and create something special as a home. It feels like the developers are keen for the player to simply keep moving until the end of the, erm... story?!?
3) [b]The story is too well hidden.[/b] I want at least some direction when I play games. It doesn't need to hold my hand, but zero information just makes it aimless and uncertain. Not a good way to design a story. This needs significant work.
4) [b]The grind - there's too much of it![/b] Making a player hop islands (taking up significant time, depending on distance) just to get a few logs to make planks, or resupply an island of wooden sticks for cooking and crafting, because there's nothing left to cut down on the island the player has decided to settle on, is contrived, boring and grindy. There's no need for this. Look at Green Hell or Subnautica for reference. There's an abundance of resources everywhere (for the most part) but it doesn't lock the player into position. Instead it makes preparation for exploration more enjoyable - heightening the excitement of discovering new places.
5) [b]Challenging survival frustrations.[/b] Staying alive is what this game is all about, but the grind added to make it fit into this genre is bordering on lazy design instead of thoughtful complexity. This is a tricky aspect that I also cover in my likes as well, but needs to be mentioned.
6) [b]Painfully slow game development for what is ultimately a very small game.[/b]

My likes:
1) [b]Gorgeous environmental effort.[/b] The world looks beautiful and the water is realistic feeling and immersive. The developers have done a great job with the overall visual and dynamic environment.
2) [b]Decent sound design.[/b] It sounds nice and there's plenty of atmosphere created around the player from the various audio elements.
3) [b]Fantastic colours.[/b] A truly tropical vibe. A lovely water pallet and a vibrant and inviting overall feel for the world space.
4) [b]Wonderful looking wildlife.[/b] With the exception of over-sized crabs, the overall look and feel of the wildlife is so good you'll likely want to spend time (especially under water) just drinking it in and experiencing the flora and fauna of a tropical dream holiday. It's not at all safe, but it's incredibly immersive. Enough that you don't really need a story if there was more space to explore on land and more emphasis on taking in the wonders of the tropics. Very nice indeed.
5) [b]Enough building for the simple craftsman.[/b] There's quite a selection of things to build, even if the game doesn't balance it well or give it purpose. It's not enough for impressive creativity, but it lends to the game enough to warrant a mention.
6) [b]Challenging survival.[/b] Staying alive is tough. You need to look where you are going and pay attention to your needs. it's what the game centers around and it, almost, works. I prefer thoughtful survival mechanics over brute force, lazy design. It's a bit of ""love it and hate it"" as far as this aspect goes.

However this game is much worse than the competition for the following reasons: No multiplayer, No story and no land-based threats. Nothing washes up on shore to add anything interesting to this game and its one you cannot complete, as guess what; you don't have a story! 
The time has come... this Early access train has to stop, you can't just put up some half done product and get people to pay full whack, then take forever to release it as complete (I don't think this will ever leave early access) and for that I cannot reccommend this...3/10",1454794384,1658700584,False,9,0,0.486501187086105347,0,True,False,True

When this game first came out, there were some pretty frustrating bugs. But the only bugs I've run into since the 01/2022 update is that the guest will sometimes be unable to see the host, or unable to see the smoker/grill. A simple relog will fix this. Riding on a raft is MUCH improved since launch, the one not-driving no longer has to battle the inertia of the raft, and can more or less AFK the ride without fear of falling off. 

Most audio bugs (so far) have been fixed. The one specifically I'm thinking of is that the game would enter a state when your partner would get low on food or water, but your watch would keep beeping long after the hunger/thirst was addressed. That hasn't happened yet, and fingers crossed it doesn't. 

OH! And plant fiber is much more abundant and seems to respawn while you're still on the island. Rocks seem to be the rare/limited resource now, so plan accordingly.",1658697906,1658697906,True,1,0,0.485106378793716431,0,True,False,True

Hints:
1) Shark repellent is god.
2) Thrown refined spears ftw.
3) When you first load up, loot your first island of everything and then move to the next BIG island (with a battleship), with all that loot and setup base, because, you still have a bunch of stuff locally untouched.
4) Build platforms over purple jellyfish to prevent getting poisoned by them.
5) Distill water ASAP from game start, food is easy, water is hard.

You are f... kidding me!!! I browsed through my games and found this one here...

8 years of programming already? 8 year in ""early access""? My daughter is already in school by now!

Definitely do not buy!

If somebody initially tells you that they want to be done developing by end of 2015 and four years later they are at version 0.53 than that is ridiculous. So another 4 years to get to 1.0? Releases lately take 2-4 months with minor adjustments only!

I've ignored the absurd amount of bugs me and my friend encountered while playing the game untill the game killed us while flipping our raft and basically,ending our run.

Just to name a few of the thousand bugs this game has:
1-Sometimes you drop something and it clipps in the ground and you lose it forever.
2-Sometimes a hammerhead shark can instakill you and send your body flying out of the world,meaning you cant be revived and you have to wait like 30-60 minutes to die.
3-940238523 different physics bugs.
4-Sometimes the game will do this: one of the players will get the annoying warning of a friend being dead (its like an alarm that never stops) while the friend is in fact,alive. And after 2-5 min that ally will simply die out of nowhere,and once you revive him,he will be 100% hp(my friend died 8 times because of this bug).
5-Rafts can literally flip themselves out of nowhere.
6-Character models break once you die.
7-Dead pigs are still shaking their heads non stop.
8-Some items will ""duplicate"" for no reason,but they are not 2 separate items,more like this: my friend has a hammer,I see the hammer on the ground,I can pick and I can try to use It,but It looks invisible to me while my friend can see and use It normally(this happened to us more than 10 times I believe).
9-I haven't played enough singleplayer to be 100% sure but seems like a huge amount of these bugs are from the coop play.

And now lets talk about flaws:
1-Trees respawn and wood consumption are badly balanced.
2-Seems like there's no way to stop ground animals from respawning in your base.
3-Some plants are useless and some of them are way too important (like Pipi,since 3 different animals can inflict poison on you).
4-Don't even bother building a bow,seriously.
5-Combat feels extremely clunky (except for the speargun).
6-5 years of development and there's a serious lack of content. A great amount of the content is building a huge raft,your base,etc,and that brings me to the 7th flaw.
7-Building is unintuitive and clunky,doesn't feel great.
8-Meat rottens way too fast,and becomes ""unrottable"" once you smoke it. A little bit unbalanced imo.
9-Campfires tend to bug your small meat (only if the meat is small and you put it in the stick slot) no letting you picking it up,and since the game doesn't let you destroy the campfire while there's something attached to it...you're fucked.
10-For some reason,your inventory has 10 slots,chests use the same inventory design,but they have only 5 slots and there's no way to expand neither their capacity nor yours.
11-Trying to control the raft without an engine or sails is quite peepo clown.

There are still more flaws/issues with the game but Im tired at this point,you get the idea. I hope this game improves A LOT in the future because It has potential and I actually liked it in many ways,but right now I feel that anyone who recommends this game is simply scamming people.",1656092723,1656395505,False,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,True

While I have played through I would say 80% of the game.  The game optimization is horrible.  Frankly, almost unbearable.  So when folks on YouTube go to custom maps and it lags out for them I can see why.

This game was suppose to be out in 2015.  Its still sitting in early access.  I’m not going to flame the creator because I was the moron that purchased another early access sitting for million years barely touched.  As we went along multiplayer experienced issues a lot.  Remote is a horrible idea for the game, burr.

I love the concept.  A lot!  However, you are going to spend more time dealing with stupid stuff than actually playing so you get into time management.  Try not to get sun burnt, keep hydrated, keep fed all while exploring islands, gathering materials.  We did kill Meg fairly easily.  The main protagonist in this game is time.

Crafting is pretty simple and straightforward but is horrible on a fresh save file. It's aggrivating to need to level up in order to craft something. Not exactly a bad idea but is something that should be able to be turned off in world creation settings.

The music is much more light hearted than it used to be. taking alot of inspiration from the castaway OST. It's pretty nice music but should not be played every 2 minutes. (Take the piano music from the old version for example. It wasnt constant and played occasionally when you actually need the comfort of music)

The graphics are pretty good but i cant be the only one that thinks that certain aspects have been downgraded such as the reflections almost being non existant.

Speaking of downgrades i do feel like there are parts of the old version (0.04.h2) that are better than the final version. 

The Tone
I feel that the tone of the old and final version are drastically different from eachother. The final version is more light hearted and filled with hope (even the shark music was made more light hearted) and the colors and music reflect this. However, the old original version from 2015 was grittier and hopeless feeling. The occasional music that played (which was really one piano piece unlike the final version's bigger variety of soundtracks.) was depressing (and matched the hopeless feeling of being stranded in the middle of the sea where you would likely die in) and was the only real comfort you would get. The colors were sort of bright as well but in a more realistic sense. The shark music had some bits kept in the final version but was much more different and scarier and included a slow reverb and background beat that made it feel like somthing out of a horror movie/game. 

World generation
While the final version had a big variety of structures and island types. The old version basically had the same feeling islands everytime as well as the ships. The only thing about the world generation that the old version does better is the fact that its infinite. What would improve the final version's world generation is if it you gave an option to turn on infinite islands. Although an upside to having limited islands is that your resources are actually limited which can make things harder later in the game and encouraging you to explore the islands more carefully rather than just loot real quick and find the next island.


In other words i still recommend buying this. The old version and final versions have aspects that are a bit better than eachother and both worth playing. I would definitely go for the final version because theres alot more content and polish to it plus the mod support. Hope to see this game improve more in the future.",1655964440,1655964440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So is the music. And it's still early access so there's a world of possibilities to improve the game.

But... Well, did I mention the game is really really fun? It surely is. Until it isn't. The game has many game breaking bugs right now. Crates that misteriously disappear when you drop them, even in single player mode. So carry a bed with you and save often. Coop is a desync and disconnect mess and takes a lot of time for the client to rejoin and sometimes the client can't for some reason. This game still can be the best lost-at-sea survival game out there if they manage to clear the game breaking bugs.

Stranded Deep begins with the player sitting on a plane, minding their own business, when all of a sudden the plane begins plummeting out of the sky. After falling unconscious, players come to just to realize that they are trapped on the airplane as it descends underwater. The very first challenge of Stranded Deep is to swim through the carcass of the sinking plane and discover a way to the surface.

I want to say that this game is awesome. 
I want to tell you how much fun me and my son had playing this together (he's 5 and loves building games).
I want to tell you that it was worth the money. 

Unfortunately for the 20 or so hours that I've played this game, I've been either attempting to repair damage to save games via the admin console due to bugs, roaming around endlessly looking for that last rock I needed to make something (before getting eaten by a shark trying to swim to another island to get a rock...) or finding out that forgetting to hit save (in 2022..) before logging off after a 2 hour play session results in an unhappy 5 year old co-gamer.

On the face of it, the game is absolutely beautiful. The utmost effort has gone into making this game a visual masterpiece. The designers have attempted to make a somewhat seemless interface in order to promote immersion and to a point it does work. It breaks down when you need to do something complex like being able to switch items in your hand... because your inventory is inexplicably full (when it isn't) and the game doesn't offer any clues as to ""why"" it thinks it's full... so you just end up having to throw shit on the ground to make room.

The amount of actual content in the game is lacklustre at best, one island is the same as another and once you've succeeded in building your raft and arriving at pacific island number 473 there really isn't anything else to do. An argument could be made saying that it's a sandbox game where you build your own content but in that case, the ""building blocks"" you have access to are few and difficult to place in the world. The silhoutte of the block, be it the start of a raft or a building will turn inexplicably red and refuse to be placed, without any indication as to why. 

Instead of carefully crafting the start of your long range cruising raft with inbuilt storage, living quarters and fishing hole, you end up trying to figure out how to make something larger than 3 barrels and some string because nothing else can be attached if you don't jack up your boat so it's floating in the air...

The environment is gorgeous, you're surrounded by intricately detailed models of trees and rocks, cliffs, beautiful shorelines etc the VAST majority of which you can't interact with. You can be sorely in need of wood, surrounded by 100 ft trees, ship wrecks and the ruined huts of other lowly marooned mariners long dead and apparently... out of wood... 

You can be sorely in need of stone rocks, standing beside a 30 ft high stone cliff with an actual pick axe in your hand and yet unable to harvest any stone...


Bottom line? 

It's a beautiful game, but it's lazily done. 

It's like the devs said ""eh.. it's good enough"" and then wandered off to do something else. It's 2022, autosave is a thing and should be available at the very least as an option. 
Resources not respawning or in anyway size or form renewable? If you're unlucky you can ""literally"" end up in a situation where you lack the resources to build a shelter to save your game...

If you want a slow paced game with a low difficulty and simple but clunky inteface, this will suit you. If you want a game with some depth (see what I did there), look elsewhere.",1655066259,1655066259,False,98,7,0.805601239204406738,0,True,False,True

I have always been a big console gamer only. Sadly I never had the pleasure with owning a gaming PC of my own. The game was suggested to me, and I actually found it on my Switch but I was greatly disappointed with how it handled on that particular device. I loved the concept of the game, so my husband downloaded it on his system to see if it was any different. Needless to say I loved it so much that he built me a gaming computer of my own. After spending 62.1 hours last two weeks/ 204.2 hours on record I felt it was time to leave my review for the game.

If you're looking for a laid back, peaceful, single player game then this is the game for you! I enjoyed everything about it. You can craft, swim, fish, hunt and there are new islands (as well as the body of water around them) to explore. The graphics are amazing and I haven't found any bugs in the game so far. This game lets you have the option to use a controller (Which I prefer since I am quite slow playing the game using the keyboard). If you prefer using the keyboard to play, they do offer this option as well. I have to say the most fun I have been having on the game is building my place and raft (which is larger then the raft you begin the game with) and it allows me to bring more supplies back to my island. I do enjoy when it turns night fall, on the game, as much as it is when it is daylight. Unexpected storms roll in and really make the game feel realistic. You can play the game on a more difficult level but I enjoy playing the lighter version of this game personally, it just depends how much of a survivalist you want to be. As you can tell, I really enjoyed this game and everything it has to offer. If you haven't played it yet, and you like what I have described about the game, then I encourage you to take the time and try it out. Adventure is out there!

I wish there was a neutral option instead of recommending a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"".

The truth about this game is that it is a great way to kill time, however, it has some massive drawbacks. You'll find yourself not enjoying the heinous grinding needed to even craft simple things once you get the tutorial and basic items out of the way. Traveling to other islands will more than likely get you killed or lost never to find your home again.

I've come across glitches that leave me unable to interact with items (including the bed / save system) forcing me to force quit and lose loads of progress to fix the bug.

The storyline is simple. You're stuck in the middle of the ocean after a plane crash with small islands around being your only hope of salvation. Left to your own devices and resourcefulness to escape the ocean.

The crafting is simple yet tedious and annoying at the same time. You don't need much to craft your items, but once your island is diminished of resources you might want to strap in and get ready to attempt to deplete every other island of their resources too just to craft a simple farming plot.

In short, buy this game if you're looking for a way to kill time for a little bit and explore a series of islands for a bit. Build a hut and hunt some fish or sharks.

I have hopes in my heart for this game to see full release and not be stuck in ""Early Access Purgatory"" but as it's going, that might be what it will be forever. It would be a fantastic game if the bugs and glitches were polished out and more content was added to the game.

EDIT :
I would not recommend running this game on any lower-end system as even higher-end systems struggle to have fun with this game. 



! ! ! SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! !

The ending of the game is a cheesy cop-out and a classic cliche trope among cheaply made movies with no other source of an ending. Once you defeat all three legendary monsters of the sea, you gain the ability to craft the parts necessary to fix the airplane on the aircraft carrier and escape. As the end cut scene rolls, you crash into the plane you were on in the beginning and the beginning cut scene begins to play again, insinuating it was all a dream.

After seeing the mostly positive reviews and checking that it has fairly consistent updates for a 7 year old early access game we gave it a go. 
My friend lasted 20 minutes. He can't see the watch where all the stats like drinking level and the like are displayed, making the game unplayable since you can't check when to eat, drink etc. Its a bug the developers are aware of for over a year now related to the Mac M1 chip clashing with Unity, apparently.

Not having that issue, I soldiered on until I encountered a boss that makes Dark Souls a kids game.

[u] A f*****g ladder. [/u]

 At first I thought I was doing something wrong, but after some testing I realized the concept of climbing down is something completely foreign to this game. 
Climb a palm tree to grab that precious coconut? No problem. 
Climbing down? Not possible. You just fall down and break a leg. 
Climb that shipwreck watchtower? Of course, get a good view of your surroundings and maybe even find some good stuff in a container. Alright, lets head back with our loot and build that thing you have been harvesting for. 
Nope.
Fall down, drop to 1/4 health, slowly try to make it to shore just to get eaten by a shark.

For a game that's been in Early Access since 2015, I understand that there will be bugs, but 7 years is more than enough time to fix getting down a ladder, but if it hasn't been fixed by now, it probably never will.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Good game, but at this stage it is not worth the price, if you are thinking of buying this, I reccommend on waiting for more months till there is more content because you can get everything (finish) in few hours and then you get bored.
Good games, updates come slow but at least the devs are trying.

Game's got progressively worse and more bloated over time. Systems like crafting were once super simple and intuitive, but were eventually replaced with an inferior version. Graphics looked solid in 2015, they no longer do.

You start with a fairly decent cut-scene and the graphics are actually good. The game looks pretty when you jump in. But then you meet the mechanics...

Swimming feels incredibly clunky. There's no ""dive"" button or anything, so you just have to look a direction and swim there, so swimming straight-forward feels wrong (which isn't always a bad thing, just my opinion), and when you try to jump on to something from the water, it only actually lets you when it feels like it, so you're probably just going to get eaten by a shark.

Next is the inventory management, and my god... it's bad. Each time you do a specific skill set, whether it be fishing, crafting, running etc.. your character levels up. But it never told me what my level was or what it even affected. And since your crafting is levelling up, you have to wait an odd amount of time to progress when starting off. So you're just left crafting things you don't need in order to progress, wasting materials and your inventory is VERY small. Sometimes things will stack, sometimes they won't. Sometimes it will let you pick up an item from your inventory, but sometimes it won't because your inventory is full. Makes sense, right? Not to mention your form of chests is a wooden box that most items aren't even allowed to go into, so I just ended up throwing everything onto the ground. I swear most of my play-through was just me hearing an ""error"" noise, telling me I'm putting things in the wrong place. It makes the entire Survival-craft portion of it (the entire game...?) feel like a constant inconsistent chore.

Bugs are also a big problem. I didn't go 10 minutes without seeing a tree lose most of its textures.

Apparently this game has been in development for at least 7 years, the PC and Console versions of the game are different and it feels like this game has been practically abandoned.

If the game was 5 bucks, I wouldn't have bothered for a refund. But since it was almost 20, I felt robbed.",1652227621,1652227621,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game has way to harsh of a grind to get any kind of decent setup going and im not talking about a simple fire pit/hut. In order to build the better stuff like plank structures or anything better you have to find the things required to make it and that is not always an easy thing to do. I personally feel like there is way to high of a shark re spawn, what i mean is the moment you get in any water that is deep enough for a shark to be in BAM! there is a shark that just spawns right near you with in seconds, and it is not always just 1 shark either another can spawn too, i had like 3 sharks spawn in the water when i was trying to search a ship wreck and i did not have much to defend myself with yet just a crappy spear. I honestly feel like there should be a way to turn off shark re spawns this way there will still be sharks around but once you kill one it is gone for good and wont come back. I feel this would help make the waters feel less shark infested to the point you do not even want to attempt to make a short swim anywhere. ( yes im aware you can turn off wild life spawn but as far as im aware this removes sharks completely from the game and that's not what i want) Another thing i can not wrap my head around is how long this game has been in early access for! and still this game is lacking as far as content goes, i mean if you build furniture in this game you can not even interact with it, i mean whats the point of chairs if you can not sit in them, also why have shelves if there is no true way to store stuff on them. the game does have really cool things in it that you can build but some of it either has no function or is broken and wont work the right way, like the hobo stove, i made one put meat in it then when it was cooked i could not take the meet out the option never appeared for me, i ended up having to break the stove to get the cooked meat. I also feel the story to this game is very lacking the only story content is survive and find a way home, i mean they could have added in cool stuff you could find like maybe notes from other people who may have been stranded on the same islands/area as you, some notes could even get you cords to hidden stashes that these people left before they died or escaped. Over all for a game that has been out as long as this one has and still feels like it is in its first stages is just sad to me and makes me feel like the devs who made this have lost interest in their product.

(early access review)

The Setting:
Your plane crashes and you end up on island chain somewhere in the tropics. Now you must find a way to survive. You will be traveling from island to island on your raft to get resources. You will also be diving in the ocean to get extra resources. I don't really want to say too much more than that and give away the plot.

My Take:
I enjoyed this quite a bit. I also played through co-op mode. I really want to give it a higher rating because it definitely has a lot going for it, but it is held back by bugs and also the crashes in co-op mode. I also felt like there should be a bit more to do. It is early access still and I do feel the price is justified for what you currently get.

Pro:
++ Atmosphere : Absolutely nailed that one. Very relaxing at times for a survival game, but then interchanged with more stressful moments.
+ UI design : Inventory and crafting work well for the most part. Accessing containers feels a bit clunky at times though.
+ Environment : Different animals, different weather conditions, exploring under water, exploring on water
+ Graphics get the job done with some exceptions

Cons:
-- co-op is a hot mess. Frequent crashes and animals just leaping up into the air. Save often is what I would recommend. We got through it and I still enjoyed it, but I think many people will not have the same patience as I have :P
- Finding what you need for the end game can be bit frustrating
- I just wish there was a little bit more to do. It starts to feel repetitive rather quickly.
- Building shelters felt like huge waste of time.
- Low res texture popins
- Buggy animal behaviour
- Stuttering in co-op

There are probably a number of reasons Stranded Deep is still in Early Access, 7 years later, but at least it has recently been updated. Hopefully they will continue to update this game in the near future, because it definitely needs fixes.

If you enjoy survival games or have never played a survival game, I highly recommend this game. This is my favorite survival game out of several. I enjoyed The Forest, (looking forward to Sons of the Forest), I enjoy playing Green Hell, and so far I enjoy Night of the Dead, which is also an Early Access game. Stranded Deep is at the top for me because I love the ocean, swimming, aquatic life, and long walks on the beach........ :D
*crickets* 
No? Ok. I'll just get my coat, but before I do that, let me explain this game a bit more. Think of the movie Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. No iceskate and several islands to explore.

While playing Stranded Deep, it is not as difficult as Green Hell, in my opinion. Stranded Deep does not require as much from the player, as Green Hell does. Originally Stranded Deep required the player to sleep, in the first days upon its release, if I'm not mistaken. The developers removed the Sleep requirement and left the following Vitals: Health, Hunger, Thirst and Sunlight (SPF). The player will build their Hunting, Cooking, Harvesting, Physical, and Craftsmanship skills, throughout the game.

The player will be able to hunt on the different islands, as well as go swimming, and hunt aquatic life. There are flora and fauna on the islands and in the ocean, with Sharks being the main threat while swimming or traveling. Oh yes, you will be fighting off sharks! If you have a fear of the ocean, wide open bodies of water, or sharks, this game will test your fears. It is a good way to overcome them though. You just have to jump in and face the threats sometimes. As long as you are smart about how you do that, you can survive. After a while, it will be nothing for you to jump into the deep blue that is the ocean, and all you'll need to do is figure out how to not drown with the giant set of weights hanging between your legs.

One of the many fun parts about this game is the player can build their home about as much as they like, as long as they keep up with their health and resources. I have been pretty creative with the homes I have built on the islands. The player can also fish with a fishing rod or go spear fishing, in every sense of the activity. They can build tools, weapons, and other items to help hunt, fight off aggressive animals, and even provide shelters. The player can even create gardens on islands, and grow their own food or plants like Aloe, which can help with protection from the sun. The player can build rafts too, and dare I say, maybe even a flying machine. ;)

Another cool feature is the day and night cycle, and the storms that players can encounter while on islands, or even out on the ocean or while swimming. I just wish the day/night cycle could be manually adjusted, or at least make the daytime a bit longer. It always seemed like the nighttime in the game was longer.

The best part about this game is that players can now game online together (2 player cooperative). Originally the game was singleplayer or shared co-op, where two players could play split screen co-op. Last fall, the developers added online cooperative capability. My friend and I played through the game on co-op, and were able to complete the game. There is an ending in singleplayer and cooperative. Both modes' endings are the same, however, there are downsides to this. First, upon completion of the game in co-op mode, only the host will receive the achievement(s)/trophies for completing the game, as well as for not using the compasses throughout the entire game. I was the host and my friend was the co-op partner. He could not initiate the game ending, but I could. After I initiated the ending sequence, I was the only one out of both of us who received the achievements for completion of the game, and for not using compasses. However, I accidentally held one in my hand during movement of supplies, and we both used the Gyrocopter which also has a compass on it. I am uncertain if the 'Magnets, how do they work?' achievement/trophy is working properly or not. So, be aware that if you are the co-op partner who joined a game with a host, you may not get either of those two achievements/trophies. Hopefully the developers at Beam Team Games, as well as the Beam Team Publisher, will fix the listed issues soon enough.

The only real negative experience my friend and I encountered while playing co-op, was he would be disconnected quite often. I believe that the co-op partner is subject to client disconnection issues, regardless of where they are located, their PC or console, and internet connection. If you decide to watch any of my livestreams of our co-op adventures on Stranded Deep, you will see that he was disconnected more often than not. This was very irritating not only for him, but for me too, as this wasted a lot of time. Sometimes we would have to exit the game entirely and attempt joining again. DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR GAMES IF YOU ARE THE HOST. It is safe for both people to save their games, but the host especially needs to save the games. The disconnection issues were random. There did not appear to be any particular reason that would explain why he was disconnected. This issue is apparently quite common, as I have seen other people encounter it, while watching their gaming videos as well. So just be aware of the above issues. Singleplayer did not appear to have any online connection issues like that. Only while playing cooperative.

Even with the irritating co-op partner connection issues, I still recommend this survival game before others. I am still playing it to this day, but we will probably wait until the developers create a fix for the connection issues, before we play co-op on Stranded Deep again.

Also, if you like the music in the game, you can either purchase it through Steam, or get the soundtrack from Amazon Music. The music is fitting for the setting and I really enjoyed it. It has that sense of danger when sharks are around, but also adds a sense of happiness when fishing, swimming or building. It even has a sense of loneliness when it's dark outside, when you're alone, etc. but in a good way, as the music adds to the overall emotion of the game.

Overall, Stranded Deep is amazing and the price of $15.00 U.S. is worth it for what you receive, along with its Early Access issues. It's still an Early Access game, so give the developers credit and the benefit of the doubt. I understand making video games is no easy task, but if they're still updating it like they did back in January, we just need to be patient with them. I will not spoil anything but the ending was interesting. I am curious to know what made the developers go the direction they went with this game, and whether or not a Stranded Deep 2 will be in the works. Obviously they still have a lot of work to do to resolve bugs and glitches with this game, but I am not opposed to a sequel. :)
Buy this game and play it in singleplayer for a while, and then determine whether you enjoy it or not. I believe anyone would enjoy this game, if they give it a chance. I am glad I saw my friend had it on his wishlist, and that it was co-op. That is what made me purchase the game, even though at the time it was only shared/split screen co-op. This game is amazing and has a lot of potential to still be even better. Play it and record the issues you encounter, then report them to the developers. We can all work together to help make Stranded Deep even more awesome and adventurous. Lastly, don't forget your swimsuit.

I go back to it maybe once every 10-12 months because it's pretty and easy to spend some time in, but I haven't found any real goal to work towards. I'd like to explore the world more, but I spend most of my time worrying about thirst and hunger. Also, traveling between islands is very time consuming. My 2019 session ended today because the life raft flipped over and the game wouldn't let me stop sitting in it, so I drowned. I'd say it's definitely worth it for fans of the genre, but don't expect something close to a finished product.

2022 Update: I'm pretty good at this game nowadays. I've made significant progress several times in the past few years before abandoning my save and waiting for the next update. Not today, though. Just after the notification that I'd reached my tenth day of survival, I decided to explore the shipwrecks around my newest island. Once I collected all the first ship had to offer, I attempted to exit through the ship's hatch with about 60% of my oxygen remaining. Unfortunately, the doorway that had granted me access to this ships scraps had somehow been sealed with an invisible forcefield. No matter what angle I tried to swim through the wide open door, there would be no egress. My poor stranded survivor ran out of air and ragdolled into the ceiling of the sunken ship, suddenly incredibly buoyant in death. I was then told I had actually only survived for four days, despite being very sure I had just seen the notification for day 10. I'm bad at saving often, so I'm guessing it was using the in game day of my most recent save, even though that seems stupid. Anyway, I kinda wanna change my recommendation due to the long development and insane jank, but I've still had way too many cool moments in this game to say you shouldn't play it.",1561963752,1651564332,True,7,0,0.582586050033569336,0,True,False,True

decided to install it again for a change and god damn, that was a mistake.
oh it's all easy peasy on normal mode on the island i spawned at with plenty of wrecks to explore and an handy little tutorial to show me the new crafting interface and stuff i could make.
my mistake was leaving that island i search of palm saplings.
with a new day i decided to venture off to the closest island spotting a whale on the way and wondering what you could do with it. just after that the skys darkened and it started getting stormy but that's ok i thought i'm at the island. no sooner had i pulled the raft onto sand i was attacked by a giant crab which was fine because i had a spear. it took a little health but i wasn't too worried except the was another crab behind that then a wild boar. while i was running away from the boar getting low on the health i was bitten by no less than 2 snakes. that's ok i thought surly there's a cure. i gathered some leaves and made my way back to my island with one bar of health left finding i needed some water so i cracked open a few coconuts but found that if you drink to many you crap out all of your water, yay.
no problem, checking the wiki page i found the cure for poison except i couldn't make it because that's for level 3 big boys. i made the water still but didn't make enough water in time dying next to my shelter as the sun went down on day 2.

I remember when Subnautica was released in early access near the same time this game started being played on YouTube. Back then it looked fun, building a base on an island, getting better gear through exploration of shipwrecks and survival was manageable, and it could be given the benefit of the doubt by it being quite new (note I did not play in the early stages but I watched quite a bit of gameplay of the early stages years ago). But it's around 7 years old, still in early access, and playing it's just monotonous, and i'll list some problems I had with the game here. You don't need a base, storage space is laughably small for containers, so many little status effects that just serve to slowly kill you overtime with zero direction on how to actually cure them, basically no enemies on the starting island but most of the surrounding islands have giant crabs which are basically invincible at that point in the game and boars that take away most of your health before you can kill them, no direction on where to actually go to progress, no sense of a tense survival situation whatsoever, if you do choose to build a base out of anything than just wood sticks the resources are incredibly hard to find large enough amounts of, and upgraded building materials are pointless for protection as nothing really attacks your base, especially on the starting island where your base is likely going to be, travelling is incredibly boring, as there are no real threats that can kill you (even sharks just bump the side of your raft without doing anything if you're operating it), good food sources are hard to come by (only really rations are good throughout the game, but can only be found in small supply at the start and in shipwrecks), game just takes too long to and doesn't feel worth it, and finally exploring wrecks would be fun if they weren't the same wreck copy pasted. Eventually had to just turn on the console and cheat to have any semblance of fun in this supposed 'survival' game, and there is no pushing force that compels you to even bother doing really anything.",1650354152,1650354152,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game has a great idea and it is good for single player but the multiplayer isn't really that great. While reading these comments, I feel like they're only for hating the game. I love this game and it is fun time spending and isn't that hard to learn and if you do not understand something, you can use the Wiki or if you have a problem, you can ask the Discord. I do recommend the game if you like surviving games but the bad side is that you are ALWAY hungry or thirsty and food or water is really hard to get, since it takes sometime for fish to cook and eating more than 2 coconut's will make you have diarrhea. Strongly suggest this game if you like that kind of game.",1650035779,1650035779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The ONLY thing I dislike, the trees do not regrow. No matter how long you wait, they will not come back. I find this to be a huge dislike to me, because I'd like to be able to visit an island across the map, use what I need, leave and come back say a few hours later real time and it be somewhat regrown. But this just isn't so. Once a tree is cut, you'll never get that back. You can't even replant them. It's a shame.

i will say Stranded deep is a very crafty & Complex game a what if in a way that's how well made it is. 

Though when it first released it took years to get it right it felt more like an alpha at release that's how bad it was my only complaint to the devs is their needs to be mountains & bigger islands volcanos their's so much focus it could be brought back to it. if you like this i would recommend another game called the forest another unreal game with pretty much the same mechanics.",1648597331,1648597809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Graphics: 

The game is beautiful; however, if you purchase the game, be prepared for graphics related glitches that have been a feature of the game since it was first released. 

2. Game Play: 

If you enjoy base-building survival games, this one is nice. It becomes repetitive after a while, and once you have seen the two types of islands, you have seen them all. That said, I personally enjoy the farming aspect of this type of game so the repetitive nature of it isn't an issue for me. If you're into that, this game will be enjoyable. If you want a new experience around every corner, you won't find that in this game. 

3. Creativity: 

If you're into artistic/creative play, this may be one of the best games out there for that. The Cartographer feature allows you to create your own islands from ""the ground up,"" and you don't have to be a mod creator to use it. That feature alone is worth several hundred hours of game play if you're into that. 

With a word of caution, I do recommend the game (7/10).",1595676772,1648552978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Would I recommend Stranded Deep? It is the most awesome, the most outstanding and my number 1 ultimate survival game I have ever played. The immersion in regards to the concept from the movie ""Cast Away"" (if you ever saw that one) for solely survival purposes is unbeatable! The scenery and the outstanding view in the landscape is capturing something which I personally never thought was possible to experience in a game. My brain is ALMOST tricked in to believing some of these sunsets/sunrise's are real. It should tell you a whole lot. I have played many different survival games but nothing beats the feeling I get from Stranded Deep. 

Positive: 
- Challenging if you want it to be. 
- Realism.
- Ultimate Survival & Great Crafting System, user friendly compared to other survival games out there. I do think if you are new to survival game, Stranded Deep is probably the one I would recommend. 
- The Graphics & the scenery, how much the environment feels like second nature is one of a million. From how some may even get sick from travelling at seas in your raft on stormy weather. It is the only game I feel deserves a 10 of 10.
- The tempo and the game flow is very well done. 
- The satisfying feeling this game gives you after you have been grinding for hours and finally got a new paradise to dock-in to with your raft.. 
- Multiplayer
- Custom Island (Steam Workshop)

Negative:
- Lack of complexity in the metabolic/metabolism system. The nature should have way greater impact on the player, and lack of different types of vitamins and such should enforce bigger impact in form of a wider range of penalty. Dehydration is no joke!   
- There should be more risks & danger when you decide to take your raft overseas. ESPECIALLY EARLY ON  there should be risks in taking your primal & extremely vulnerable raft overseas. It should be so that there are huge risks with this at least you have those bigger fleets. That would make an significant impact on the survival elements of the game and actually a new level of realism would be born in to this game. 


I absolutely love everything about Stranded Deep. It's an ultimate survival game with a diverse range of ways to enjoy it. Either you're here for building and hard grind, or just simply for the arcade story; I do think either way this game has become to be a very special adventure. I would imagine that it could be great family entertainment, and there is lots of stuff to learn for kids. To me this game is as close to perfection as possible. Overall: 9 of 10. I would love to see the Developers at BEAMTEAM working with more dangers overseas though. That would likely make this game perfect.",1581294241,1648412600,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's nothing surprising, other than a relatively low amount of resources on the starter island.  They don't want you to get too comfortable on the starter;  you have to move away to survive.  No enemies on the starter island for a nice, easy start.

The game came out in 2015, and has had consistent updates and fixes.  That said, my bug report went unanswered, and there are many unanswered posts on the Steam Forums.  There are a few recurring topics that players are repeatedly bringing up with no response or clear roadmap.  I have not tried multiplayer, but it seems there are issues.   

So, this is another EA project that plays more like crowdfunding; Your financial support is appreciated,  but there is no real interaction between players and the developers.  No worries, but every single EA game promises rich interaction on the Forums, but then retreats to social media sites like Discord, where the Dev can entertain some light conversation while never having to get too deep :)  or address specific questions and ideas.

Overall. the game plays well.  Buy it if you like the look and feel of the game, and you like to support projects without having to get involved.

Nope. 

I closed it after 10 minutes. Here is why:

1. The bushes are solid. Solid. Try cut down a palm tree that is stuck in one these ""forever"" bushes, watch it glitch through the universe. 

2. The graphics are outdated. The environment FX are great (lighting, water) but the actual landscape meshes are crap. The tree trunks are not round, the bushes are just a mish-mash of double-sided planes with some crappy texture.... it looks like the devs borrowed assets from My Summer Car (great game that)! Oh, and I play with my settings maxed out - same shit, different frame rate.

3. The UI? Omfg the pain! If you went outside your house, grabbed a stick and drew some boxes in the sand it would still be a better crafting UI than Stranded Deep's!

It has about 10 hours worth of solid content and then probably another 10 until you've exhausted every possibility worth pursuing. 

Eventually you'll get sick of the game for its flaws, mainly the speed of transportation and how long it takes to make something that used to be given to you in the first 30 minutes: fuel. Combat is also atrociously difficult and unfair with literally every enemy encounter in the game easily resulting in your death if unprepared or just damn unlucky. 

Crafting starts off really fun and will keep you engaged for many hours, but after a while it becomes a chore.

The graphics are GOTY material, easily top 5 best water graphics on the market, but the art direction kind of sucks for some of the in-game time such as dusk and dawn, where the water turns red. 

It's a really cool atmosphere all throughout and has huge Cast Away vibes.

[b]If playing alone I'd rate it a 7/10 experience that will last for 2-3 hours[/b], so maybe not worth the asking price unless you got money to splurge.

[b]If playing co-op I'd rate it a 10/10 experience that will last upwards of 15 hours[/b]. 

I've come to the point in the game now where I don't see myself picking it up again for another 2 years, as really not much has changed since I first started playing it 6+ years ago and most of the craft-able things are useless.

You can squeeze another 2-3 hours of gameplay out of it with cheats and hacks.

Another big bonus is the couch split screen, though I don't see it working well on anything smaller than a 32"" screen as it still feels tight at 48"". 

Wishlist for future:

[list]
    [*]Much much better crafting explanations
    [*]Drinking rain water, makes zero sense that you don't right now
    [*]Better combat, either just having stronger weapons or nerfing enemies especially pigs
    [*]Ability to sleep through day, this is literally a 3 second fix for the dev
    [*]Readily available fuel found in ships
    [*]More variations to islands, there are currently only 2. That's kind of pathetic for a 7 year old game. The only thing currently separating those 2 into a further 5-ish is the placement of ships around the islands. 
    [*]Faster transportation, either through multiplying sails, larger sails, more powered engines or just having 2 people paddle at once. In the beginning its fun how slow it takes to sail to another island but after 5-10 trips you just want to stop playing because it can take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes to reach more land which more than half the time you've already been on.
    [*]Let bandages work on yourself, this is another 3 second fix for the dev
    [*]More underwater parts needed, but not too deep because this game is terrifying in those sections.
[/list]

I still think its a 10/10 despite those flaws mainly because of its co-op atmosphere that so far no other game has come even close to matching or beating. So there's definitely something special about this game and it will be a Steam classic.",1647948954,1647949623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Within 30 minutes span I got kicked out of her game 4 times, and had to rejoin with multiple times the game hanging either on my side or my wife's side while attempting to rejoin the game.
While we spent another hour and a half without issues, when we got to the home island, we dropped all the boxes with loot and gathered materials on the ground and guess what - the game froze. Since we were away from home island we weren't able to save the game. So literally, dropped the crates took 2 steps towards the shelter in order to save - BAM - the game crashes again and we decided that we are not going to waste any more time playing this game. First, the PC version is behind with the updates in comparison to console because BeamTeam is greedy, now we get a ""finished"" release of the game that can't even work properly with it's fundamental functionality.

I will skip to the part that the synchronisation of the game state is about 7 feet underground and pretty much doesn't exist - we are talking here about stuff like:
My Wife                                         Me
Fire on                                            Fire Off
Food cooked                                  Food Raw
Paddle in raft                                 Paddle missing in raft
Paddling with no item in hand      Paddling with actual paddle in hand
Spawning inside the raft               Spawning in the middle of the ocean being chomped on by a hammer shark
Pig running on the ground            Pig flying to the moon like an astronaut to hit me in the head seconds later
Resource state - exploited            Resource state - unexploited (like yukka trees or coconuts on the palm trees)
Deployed sea anchor                    No sea anchor deployed and the boat floats off to Jamaica because why the hell not

Hell, try to pick up the crate at the same time as the other player and most likely you will get two of them.

literally a buggy mess this game is. Multiplayer experience described above, however:
Single player when you deploy an anchor the game doesn't often register it and send your boat flying to oblivion (happened more than once)
Dissappearing stuff from chests happens occasionally on pickup
Game crashes for no reason on multiple pc's I tested it on, all with updated graphics drivers etc (3 different machines) - the screen freezes and what is visible looks similar to ""deep fried"" meme format.

Absolutely disgusting. If you are looking for a smooth multiplayer experience, try another game, like The Forest even. Less sea, more land, but doesn't crash as often and has a lot less issues than this piece of garbage.

I've not found anything specifically unique about the game that I like or something that makes it stand out above other survival games I've played yet.  Again, I haven't had much time to get anywhere to see how high up I can build a house, or if I can place  a foundation at the top of a rock cliff.  Crazy things I like to do in a game.

One thing I've noticed that I'm not too excited about and that are the multiple small islands.  This sort of thing splits up valuable resources and forces you to either do a lot of sailing back and forth, or building/rebuilding the same items to harvest food and water on every island you go to.

If there was a main thriving island where you can have your main base at with the option of ""satellite bases"" on other islands you explore, I would be fine with that.  The beginner island is limited and so far by what I've read only some items will re-spawn, and not all items have seedlings you could plant and re-grow.

This theory (that may be fact) already stunts my desire to do much more on the beginner island.  However, if you decide to advance to another island too soon in the game, you will not last long for animals/creatures on the other islands pack a larger punch and if you don't have the best weapon in hand you won't last but a few minutes before you ""kick the bucket"".

This will be a challenge and I'm still debating on continuing to invest more time into this game while others capture my attention.",1647485718,1647485718,True,7,0,0.591850042343139648,0,True,False,True

It definitely still needs work. Some of the bugs can be SUPER annoying, but some are harmless, sometimes helpful, or just outrageously funny! For example: One moment you could be dropping items and an item just freezes in the air, and its not even the item you were supposed to be dropping. I've lost a few tools this way. Then there is one where, if you get a specific island that has a ship wreck in the perfect spot, you can lure sharks in between the island and the boat and they will bug out and just spin in circles providing you with simple and easy food that can restore a ton of your food bar. Then you have the funny bugs, like a random boar floating above the ocean or running around on a ship wreck under water, also had a funny one where the shark started to swim inside the island. It actually scared the shiz out of me sitting there and a shark just attacks me from under the sand. I'm now terrified of sand sharks xD But all together this is a fantastic survival game and i would completely recommend it! Just a little rough around the edges, but the principal and idea behind the game is just awesome! i love the water and fish physics this game has, other than a few bugs, the physics are almost spot on to real life! Great game to play with a buddy! so glad they added multiplayer co-op! Even though it's only up to 2 players, it's definitely a fun late night game with a buddy! Worth the purchase for sure!

There is no hostile environment as such, no cannibals, no zombies, no dinosaurs, not even the weather is particularly dangerous.The sharks are easily avoided or killed and the other hostile wildlife are simply a pain, but ultimately harmless.  There is no reason to tech up and build a better raft or elaborate base, and hence no reason to explore or gather resources. It's pushing it to call this a survival game.

The cons that I struggle with are because I play on a macbook (M1 Pro chip) and no matter your settings, you cannot see your watch to know what sort of stats you have.  The workaround for me is that if you hold a spear, you can refresh your watch and kinda see it if you look just the right way, but only the 'water, food, SPF, and health' bars.  I can't read if you are poisoned or not.  Also, I have a mac mouse and as far as I can tell, there is no way to use your weapons at range because the apple mouse will only click right or left, you can't alternate or change it quickly.

I played about an hour with a friend before deciding we should use the cartographer to create an island before we got too invested with the current save.

I tried reinstalling the game, deleting its folder on my PC, deleting every file Beam Team had on my computer and reinstalling. the best it would do was reset the graphics settings and remove the cartographer map. The game still would and will not load.

the crafting system is nice and there's quite alot to make in this game.
diving to loot sunken shipwrecks knowing a shark could attack you any seconds is exiting and a ""little"" scary.

you can choose to go for an escape as soon as possible or just try to survive on these beautiful islands.
after you've escaped? you can also look into custom islands.
you can go though alot of island made by the community or just make your own island to your liking and build a nice little (or big) base or even village if you want.

also it has multiplayer which imo always makes survival games more fun.

definitly would recommend this game.

So I jumped back in this game after like 1.5 year. On the surface not much really changed. I tried to get into it more but after the initial start the game just feels like a grind. To build a good sizeable boat and base you need to hop from island to island so much and so many times. Each island has too little resources and your inventory is also pretty lacking. I get it that in the sense of being a survival game and all that you cannot have too big of an inventory, but at least make the island more resourcefull. 

Besides, all the island look the same. Why not make differences between small, medium and large islands? Now they are all small with nothing to do on it. 

Combat with animals is still piss poor. Most of the times you dont even hear the pig or crab charging at you. They hit when they have their backs to you and the whole combat just exists of hitting the mouse button till they are dead. Then you need to wait some time to get the health back (if you are well fed and hydrated, otherwise you wont heal at all)

So now with seven hours into my new game I am just facing a grind in increasing my skills, building up my base and boat till I have the tools and resources to fight the three bosses.

It is a shame though because I do really dig the Robinson Crusoe vibe this game gives. The music is good and atmosphere is great as well. Just the gameplay loop and the combat are bothering me.

====================================
The game is oke at best. Only played five hours but it already feels I have seen most of the things though. Will continue playing it and if I feel that my opinion changes, I will adjust the review.

Pros
- Game looks pretty
- The exploration is fun in the beginning
- Have not encountered any serious bugs, crashes or other issues

Neutral / pet peeves
- Animations and such feel a bit cheap from time to time. But then again, this is an indie game made by a small studio for a low price
- The controls of managing the inventory feel awkward
- Little inventory space makes managing the stuff you carry annoying. Mind you I was only carrying the bare essentials

Cons
- The combat against land animals is poor. They seem to hit from a bit too far and you get the feeling you do not even touch them. Also after throwing three spears into a boar it still was running like crazy
- The islands start to feel repetitive and dull after a while
- After a while you wonder what you should do. You just hop from island to island. All looking the same with also the same loot. There is some sort of endgame but so far I am just seeing copy paste islands

To be honest, I would recommend buying it if u want to have some fun with your friend, because the game isn't very expensive. But i\ve played stranded deep for 62 hours now, and I am not very pleased about this game. 

First of all, there are A LOT of bugs in this game. The animation of your game characters is terrible. Holding a flashlight makes it look like your shoulder was involved in a car accident. And to climb up to boats, you have to hold down the SPACE-key, instead of just simply pressing it. Altough it\s not a bug, I think The game should give a hint or something, so I didn`t have to spam SPACE one hundred times to get up.

Also, it`s not possible to play this game for ever. Palms, rocks and sticks do not respawn, so after you`ve spent up all your wood, you`ll have to move to another island. Many people may think that you can survive without such materials. Believe me, it`s impossible. If you want fresh water, you`ll have to use the Water still, which is powered by sticks. Great. Now you'll die of thirst if you don't move. 

The reason I stopped playing this game, was because of the ending of the game. Not the ending sequel, but how to finish the game. To escape the pasific, you'll need to kill three bosses hidden in the middle of the ocean. Me and my friend were scouting for them, but returned home with no luck. The bosses used to be on small islands with huge iron-towers. Now their'e just on some random sunken boats, which are very hard to find because of the size. It could have been a bit easier, with for example a compass that pointed in the direction of the bosses, but no. Didn't finish the game.

I recently decided to pick up this game again, after leaving it on the shelf for a few years, and while there's been a little improvement here and there I'm sorry to say that there are quite a bit of flaws still with the game.

First, I'm happy to say that Multiplayer has finally been added to the game.  That said, they've basically done it in a co-op format so it's limited to 2 players only.  I really don't get this, since there are other games that use the same story intro mechanic (like The Forest) and allow many more players.  One theory I have is that adding more than one additional player would make the game virtually impossible, due to...

Secondly, they still haven't resolved the most common player complaint. That being, major resources don't respawn.  I certainly understand that when you pick up a rock another rock shouldn't just pop into existence at that spot.  That said, coconuts don't regrow on trees?  You can't plant and regrow trees?  I mean, come on...  These are crops, and in the real world they're certainly renewable crops.  With each player required to craft the same objects to unlock more recipes, having these resources limited is quite a large problem, especially early game.

Third, the health system is still completely broken.  You can stand in complete shade and still be overheating and getting UV stroke.  You have to move around until you find one tiny little spot, sometimes not even in the shade, where the UV meter shows you're in the ""shade"".  You can step on an urchin and get poisoned, but it's a roll of the dice if you can even drink the antidote you craft from the rare flower you had to find, because sometimes it goes buggy and can't actually be drunk.  You're given a limited quantity of coconuts, as mentioned before they don't respawn.  That said, if you drink more than one within a certain amount of time you get sick from it.  Oh, and you'd probably still get more ""hydration"" by drinking sea water or beach sand.  Coconuts, in this game, are practically useless as a drink.

The inventory system is still fairly odd.  You get a limited number of slots, but what you can put in those slots sometimes doesn't make sense.  Some things stack, other things don't.  Thankfully some objects can be placed in ""piles"" now, however instead of the game just doing it you have to go through the crafting system to tell it you want to create a pile.  It's far from intuitive, and if you didn't already know you could do this you're not likely to realise you can.  In addition, piles are only for major resources and somewhat useless because, as said before, major resources are extremely limited and don't regenerate.  In this game, if you actually need to ""pile"" a major resource, you aren't working on survival.  It almost would have been better to give us a larger storage chest option.

All in all, this game is still missing pretty much everything that I'd require to give it my recommendation.  It needs regenerative resources, even if those resources take a long time to regenerate (10-20 days) and can be toggled on/off by the host.  It needs multiplayer that's more than just a 2 player co-op existence.  The survival and inventory systems also still need some fixes, because right now they feel broken.  I'm not saying make the game stupid easy, because survival shouldn't be that way, but at least make things follow some form of common sense.

[b]Original Review[/b]
[hr][/hr]

I purchased this game early, back before there was even a half-decent crafting system.  Normally I write up well thought out reviews, but I simply can't here.  This game is so horrible.  

[list]
    [*]Inventory space makes absolutely no sense
    [*]There are practically no hit-boxes on anything you place down
    [*]No regrowth on major resources
    [*]You can stand in fire and not get burned yet sunburn in less than an hour
    [*]Apparently the juice of a coconut has the same amount of hydration as beach sand.
    [*]Can't catch a fish with a knife, even if you're swinging right through it.
    [*]Islands are so small and spread apart that building a home is absolutely pointless.
    [*]""skinned"" a manta and it went flying off into the wild blue yonder.
    [*]No multiplayer.
    [*]Ripped off the ""ending"" from Subnautica, and it makes no sense here.
[/list]

This could be an excellent game, but there's just so much wrong with it that I simply can't recommend it.  It's a complete patchwork of ideas originating from other games.  That said, the ideas have been mashed together and executed so badly that it's not worth playing.

[code]
Note:

Yes, I know the gyroscope was put in Stranded Deep before Subnautica had the rocket ending.  That said, the rocket in Subnautica was available, through admin commands, a LONG time before the same ending appeared in Stranded Deep.

Seeing the development overtime honestly was like stepping on lego, falling onto a nice soft pillow and then realising the pillow had long nails under it.

For a large period of time the game was kindof just stuck in a place of the devs adding stuff then removing it the next update and replacing it with something new.

Is that too big of an issue? Not really if the updates didn't bring 100 new bugs into the game.
I could prolly write a guide of every bug, but it would be so long I might aswell just write a damn book about it.

Besides planning is quite important and for a period of time it fellt like there wasn't much planning on the updates. More just like ""Add this and see if it fits then change it later maybe""

They even removed ocean life. For a game where 90% of the map is ocean you would think they would add allot of ocean life, but no. They had quite allot of fish, but over time they just kept slowly removing them making the ocean quite less interesting.

Wouldn't be surprised if theres just as much birds and land creatures as there is aquatic creatures. I mean for land you got snakes, a very interesting looking hog, a boar, bats, seagulls and two types of crabs. Why am i counting the crabs as land and not aquatic? Because they are never underwater.

In the ocean? Sardine, Lionfish, Cod, Archer, Discus, Giant Grouper, Marlin, Tiger Shark, Hammerhead, Great white, Whale sharks and Goblin sharks.
Offcourse there are other sea creatures, but they are simply there for looks. You can't damage them or do anything to them.

There is a sea snake. It can kill you, but you can't kill it. Stingrays exists which you used to be able to kill and then for some reason they just made them invincible. Pilchards and around 4-5 other fish also used to exist, but got yeeted. Blacktip sharks and clownfish again just kinda exist, but not really.

The bosses, oh dear god. Ok two of them are alright, but my god do not get me started on the bootleg megalodon. When I first saw this boss man my expectations where high and what attacks me? Literally a great white shark. Not scaled up in size even slightly. It is just a generic great white shark with the name Megalodon.

Online Multiplayer for a long time was not added. I personally did not care too much about multiplayer, but still I find it funny that after so long with the community begging for online multiplayer. They added multiplayer in the name of ""Couch-Coop"" boii was that not a good idea.

Game does have online multiplayer now. It is very unstable, but it exists and I guess good job to the game for that.

Oh the game also has an ending-ish and holy moly I did not know it was possible to make such a horrible ending to a game. It made literally no sense and was just such a poor choice of an ending. They could have gone so creative with the ending and made it look so nice. Instead we get this bottom of the dumpster ending. Might aswell not have an ending.

I had high hopes for the game and man was I dissapointed.
I feel the game could have gone a different direction, had the devs not made such poor choices throughout its development.",1520103594,1644918782,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game gets off to a rough start: the unskippable starting cut-scene. Fine for the first time, but when you're playing a SURVIVAL game, odds are you're going to die at least once or twice. Sometimes the starting island screws you over (more on that in a bit) and you need to reset back up, or maybe you're a permadeath player. Either way, sitting there waiting for the rather loud cut-scene to finish is tedious at best. 

Okay fine, you make it past that. The game has a straightforward tutorial that teaches you how the survival mechanics work-like any good game of this genre-but as I mentioned above, you could have a short lived attempt depending on your starting island. More than a few occasions did I have to restart the game simply because I didn't have enough vital resources to survive the time it takes for said resources to respawn. That alone is why I quit playing when I first got the game. 

When some friends brought the game up again, I figured I'd give it another shot. Imagine our surprise to discover a game this old still had a two player cap, despite the community clearly hoping for more. We decided no big deal and I attempted to play solo again for the first time in years.

Y'all, this is where I honestly can't even attempt to enjoy this game anymore. The physics are HORRIBLE! In a game where that surviving is the POINT OF THE GAME you'd think they would have refined this to be actually playable! Alas, it is not. From crafted rafts refusing to follow the laws of physics, to trees shooting off into the sea, to the annoyance of not being able to simply jump in a reasonable manner (once again, to SURVIVE and avoid danger), this alone is enough of a reason for me to uninstall, hide, and try my best to forget this game even exists. 

Thanks for reading if you stuck around! Even if this game was free I'd STRONGLY recommend against it.",1644890047,1644890047,False,80,14,0.705471515655517578,1,True,False,True

In a survival game the whole point is to survive and try not to die right? Well, once you repair the plane and launch, 3 hours later the guy crashes into another plane, making for an extremely lazy and stupid ending and just a copy of the beginning cutscene. They have also screwed over a Youtuber by the name ""Madd Vladd"", otherwise known as ""The Outer Middle Show"", who was a Youtuber that got some of the most views on his LetsPlay of this game and didn't even put his name in the credits. Stranded Deep may have a good survival aspect to it, but it isn't worth 15 dollars. DO NOT BUY THIS.

Unlike most other survival games where you're fighting zombies the enemy here is your own mistakes and poor planning. Left your island and don't remember how to get back? Looks like you're starting over. Left your island with a storm on the way and lost your raft? Shark food. Forget to refill your water stills and used up all your leaves and palms for other things? The long slow death of dehydration. I've never died from anything in this game other than my own poor planning and small mistakes that compounded into large problems and that's what I love about this game, the enemy is mother nature and you're own ability. 

Graphics are good, though the textures could be higher resolution. 

Music and sound design fit the setting and add to the immersion

Game play can become repetitive but it is what you make of it. If you aren't into games that don't give you hard line directions on what to do or where to go then this might not be for you.

I haven't played the online multiplayer, (I would love if they could make it cross platform) but I have done the split screen co-op with steams remote play and it was a blast being able to play with friends in this game.

There are player made islands you can download online and there is an in game island editor if those thing tickle your fancy. I enjoy making my own islands, but I find the island editor can be a bit wonky at times. While you can drop your custom islands into your map you cannot earn achievements while on those islands so it is strictly for your enjoyment. (That being said there is a way to inject your islands into the game files so that the game can't tell the difference, but then its up to RNG as to whether or not you have that island appear on your map).

The devs are pretty consistent on keeping the game updated and fresh. The gameplay difference between when I bought the game and now is night and day. Bugs will pop up every now and then but I have never had anything game breaking, and the devs seem to try to get any bugs that may be game breaking ironed out fairly quickly.

(1) You can only save at tent/beds. This might be one of the worst ideas I've ever heard considering that this is a game about island hopping with slow navigation. You obviously can't save at sea cuz you need a bed, and if you wanna save when you reach a new island, you have to craft one. Not very well thought out.

(2) No map. In a game like this where exploration is the game, not having a map to start is fine, However, this game has no map at all. This makes it near impossible to keep note of what islands you've explored. It would be much better to have a blank map to start that reveals itself as you travel.

(3) Level based crafting. This is by far the game's biggest flaw. You have to be at a certain level to make specific items even if you have the ingredients to craft them This is especially bad considering that you can be poisoned rather easily in this game and you need to be level 3 to make the antidote to cure yourself. So, if you're poisoned in the early game, you may as well just start a new save.

(4) There's really no reason to play. There's no driving force behind your actions in this game. The main goal is sort of like The Long Dark (just to see how long you can last/survive). However, The Long Dark does this better because it's much more challenging. In Stranded Deep, I managed to survive on one island just by crafting a water still and fishing for several days, so, in theory, I could have just done that forever without issue. It also only took  me about half an hour to figure out how to do that.

Overall, it's not terrible for $15, it's not a ripoff. You can in theory make your own fun in Stranded Deep. But there are better survival games out there for that price or less.",1644026466,1644026577,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,True

I played on hard and loves challenges, but when the most basic and most used resource is extremly limited and the raft is horrible to steer, it's too much. Also the inventory system is really wonky.

Dev's put out scarce updates. Building is a mess. For the longest time we didn't even have an endgame. Still in early access after YEARS. Dev's obviously want money, they don't really care about the playerbase. I have a gut feeling that after this game dies the dev's will just run with the money, while they leave the game rot with the playerbase pleading for updates.

It's shame this game ended up like this, because it's actually a decent game. It looks good, and besides some bugs (which I dont think will ever be patched) it plays well. In terms of gameplay, it's difficult to get the hang of things. In way of a tutorial, you dont have much. You learn as you go along, which means many restarts. It's $17 now, but it was much more expensive when I bought it. Pretty much wraps up the state of the game.

They've added a ton of stuff, made tweaks, done a lot. Even added a goal of getting free by plane... but what hasn't changed is the gameplay loop. 

You're able to make shelter, and in a few different materials, but there is no reason to. You spend your time on a raft, going island to island, trying not to lose stuff as you bring it to a central point to gather up the resources to leave. Making a  home bigger than maybe 1 or 2 foundations is pointless, and making it out of higher grade materials is also pointless. 

Fighting sharks is laughable still, as they are damage sponges, as are most creatures you find. Resources are finite and it forces you to explore, which is fine, but the inventory space is so limited, or clunky if you're hauling boxes around, that you just get bored of dealing with the loop instead of excited for the next island.

In the end, this game was a neat idea that Subnautica came along and did better somehow. 

I'll end on a positive note, though. This game does screw with you hard if you have a fear of the deep. Really good at inducing a sense of paranoia and dread while deep down.",1643836120,1643836120,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

TL;DR No guide - you're on your own + badly balanced --> lots of waiting and cursing as to ""wtf do I do now?""

First, the ""tutorial mode"" doesn't work at all. There's no intro or in-game guide on how to do things. I had no idea how to kill crabs or build anything. After smashing random button, I discovered that C is for crafting, Q drops items, holding a number puts stuff in your quick slot, F shows health and can be navigated with left+right click,, etc.
The items have no description as to why one would build it and what they are for.

The game also introduces a system of ""levels"" which seem arbitrary. One can see everything one can build, but has to level up and there's no indication as to how: just craft more stuff (TM).

There's a LOT of waiting because it's not balanced. Nearly everything you have to build requires these forsaken lashings, which require fibrous leaves, which are only available from 2 plants of which there are not nearly enough.

Unique, challenging, and with it's own set of bugs and learning curves, it definitely places top in my list of Alpha/Beta open world survival games. You need patience to get through poisoning, and there is a huge lack of direction when it  comes to how to do things, or possibilities within the game. For instance, I just discovered potatoes, and I just realized you don't need to ""Clear"" the farm plot every-time you harvest a plant from it. It also appears you don't actually need to water the farm plots.. they just fill up on their own over time? I have only made metal corrugated and plank farm plots. I don't know how to use ""Container Walls"" to build houses.. there's no explanation, and holding a hammer and trying to build one on a wood foundation doesn't seem to work. If you can get through these challenges, which I have, and focus on the food and water game, and not losing your island as you sail away, you can enjoy the game. I have yet to plunge into the deep ocean to fight anything bigger than a hammer head and a great white.. although I have seen whale sharks, and blue whales and Goblin sharks, which are all terrifying. I do wish trees would regrow on the island, perhaps if you don't pick the Palm sprouts, in 3-5 days they grow into small palm trees, which if left alone, will grow over the course of another week to full size 4 log palm trees... or give the ability to plant wood bearing trees.. because once you deforest an island... you are dependent on gathering wood from other islands. Since there is no way to build any work stations, or shelter on a raft, you start trying to figure out where you actually settle down. Knowing an island has a finite amount of resources (except for fibrous leaves) makes it challenging to spend any resources there. At this point, on day 34, I have decided I will pillage all the surrounding islands for my island's sake.. but after I get through the hundred or so trees, amounting to about 400-500 wood, I will be out.. and I will have to completely relocate, wasting all the resources I spent building a shelter, farm plots, water stills, etc. Also, the only reason to build a house is as a landmark, at this point. There doesn't seem to be any other reason to. Nothing blows away, and you can leave it in piles on the ground, or neat piles on the ground. In fact the only benefit, is being able to place storage chest shelves on a floor so the boxes are more organized.. but it should offer more than just that. Again, unless I'm missing something because it wasn't explained, and I haven't been able to find any good videos walking through the most recent updates (closest I can find is like 2018/2019)  it's been all hit or miss. Again though, it's a fun game to generate the most efficient food and water, and the fishing is fun. Smoking fish/meat keeps them forever - that was a game changer to find out. Bringing corpses onto the beach, or leaving them in a pile also ensures you have a fresh supply of meat, as they do not deteriorate, so harvest as you need. Or just smoke everything, which is what I do. Food levels are super easy to maintain, but water levels are contrastly way harder. You can only use palm branches to generate the water in a still, and that is a very limited resource on an island. You will run out of water if you don't go get more palm branches.. which means that I will have to be travelling so far to get palm branches to survive, that I will just need to leave my island permanently. There will be no reason to stay. If there was more ways to put things on the raft, it would make the game better, and if trees regrew over short/long periods of time, it would make the game better. Those are the two major issues I am finding; but I definitely recommend and think it's a fun game to play overall!",1643051070,1643051070,True,9,1,0.551127195358276367,0,True,False,True

I was looking for something to play with my daughter, I was a bit hesistant since I tried it a little bit before I got it for her, since I thought that the crafting would be a bit to abstract, turns out I was wrong.
She's been playing a fair bit of minecraft and a bit of Valheim, so most things came more or less natural.

We haven't played that much yet, but the few hours with laughs with my kid has definately been worth the 2x $10-ish I've paid.

Ingredients

For the base

150g/5½ oz digestive biscuits (about 10)
75g/2¾oz butter
For the toffee filling
75g/2¾oz butter
75g/2¾oz light muscovado sugar
1 x 397g/14oz full-fat condensed milk (see tip)
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the topping
300ml/10fl oz double cream
3 small just-ripe bananas, sliced
50g/1¾oz dark chocolate, melted or cocoa powder

Method

Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.

To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form.

Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top or dust with cocoa powder.",1625014968,1642782857,True,1,0,0.50205761194229126,0,True,False,True

The UI is pretty bad. Compared to many other games in the genre, I really felt the cluckiness of the UI more than others. At many times, it's just not very intuitive.

The gameplay is ok, but gets repetitive super fast. It makes the annoying things that are in the gameplay seem that much worse because of this. The lack of any real story also makes it get old very quickly.

All in all, it just falls short of other games in the genre.",1642691530,1642691530,False,2,0,0.529616773128509521,0,True,False,True

Gardening Hoe- Get rid of it, having to craft, and manage another tool in a game that has abysmal storage is ridiculous, you don't even have to have it equipped to make farm plots, and it has no VFX tied to it

Allow players to craft Storage shelves to put storage crates on ON THEIR FUCKING RAFT, you can't do anything with the rafts besides slowly move from island to island, let us do SOMETHING to Rafts. 
Barrel Scrap, Tyre Scrap- Make them carry-able, there is a reason a vast majority of your player base uses buoy balls, take note, and yes, you can right click drag them, but only 1 at a time.

My wife screamed 'get out of the water!!' my level of self preservation was zero as I'm an awful swimmer to begin with, but I recall everyone clearing off the beach at that point.  It was then that I saw it, a shadow deeply concealed in the depths of the cascading ocean - A man eater, a seadog, the king of the sea, nearly three meters long! - it swam very casually toward me and spoke thus 'you're a long way from home land dweller, and you smell like Alberta.' With that it turned about and swam back into the depths.  I resurfaced, spewing seawater with my exhalation, and immediately realized that I had been taken away some distance by the tide.  My wife was screaming all the while from the distant shoreline, and panic struck me as firmly as an iron ballast.  I swam back to the beach like a lead weight, always with the sensation that something was nipping at my feet.  Panic only encouraged my entire submersion beneath the saline, choking and gasping as I paddled my way through the choppy water.  No sooner did I reach the shore that I slipped upon an outgrowth of coral and split open my shin.  I would later learn that this bled profusely, but at that moment, a giant killer whale sprang out of the ocean and pounced upon my man-eating assailant, spattering my wife and I with ocean water and blood in its descent back into the murky depths.  10/10, would vacation again.",1642327878,1642327878,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,True

What here is decently fleshed out, the game hand holds you for the first couple of steps but then you're left to your own devices. The tech tree isn't complicated and it doesnt take terribly long to get going. After about three hours I had pretty much exhausted my starting island of resources and had reliable food and water supplies. Fish seem to be endless and are easy to catch.. so I just brought what I could on my raft and moved on.. there are various little wrecks and POIs you can inspect that have plenty of loot and crafting materials.

The actual survival mechanics in play here are pretty light, your food and water doesn't go down very quickly and any ailments you come across are easily taken care of.. 

Its a neat little game and if you enjoy the genre you will like this one for a bit, it lacks alot of the needed depth to keep most folks attention beyond about 20 hours or so I'd guess. I've put in about 5 and did some research and can see that im not really missing out on much by stopping at this point.

The days are far too short (20 mins per day and night), the hunger and thirst drains far too quickly and you might run out of resources on your island gimping the game and requiring a restart. Gathering resources is a pain and the only way to store enough of each is just to start dropping them in piles on the beach. The game is just not fun because of all the busy work and constantly micro-managing everything. I think the developers have forgotten that games are supposed to be fun!

I like the idea of a stranded on an desert island survival game but the fact that only 10% of players have only survived 10 days plus (see achievements) speaks volumes. Also, this game was released in 2015 and been in early access since so what on earth are the developers doing?

PROS:
- the water in this game looks awesome, all the vibrant colors and coral really pop like real tropical waters.
- pretty sun rays inbetween foliage.
- lots of crafting capabilities. 
- the environmental sounds like wildlife, the tide, or storms is pretty immersive.
- you can play with friends.
- whales!

CONS:
- for me, and others, shadow flickering and lighting issues have been prevalent, as well as a very short draw distance even on max making things like trees and shipwrecks look pixelated. 
- the islands and shipwrecks get repetitive
- if you dont want to beat the game and just wanna play, you can run out of stuff to do.

This is one of my favorite games in my library right now. I mostly play it on Xbox, but sometimes on PC also. The games are different enough on each system that its worth mentioning (specifically how the inventory systems work). It's a decent game from a small team, the graphics and game play is good (especially for how small the dev team is). This is a game where there's a tiny bit of grind at the beginning (stats boost pretty fast) but you don't really notice it because your stats unlock things at pretty much exactly the time you need them. My favorite part of this game is gathering up my resources and building my base and my raft(s) so I don't pay the story much attention and treat it more like a sandbox. There is a story, bosses, and an ending too, but I just have more fun playing around instead. You aren't forced to do any of that and can just sail around to your hearts content if you want. I haven't tried it yet, but Co-op has also been added (not cross platform though, unfortunately). Overall, really good game for a fairly low price.

Sure, they added multi-player but they still have not fixed some of the OLDEST annoying bugs! 7 years of EARLY ACCESS, it has become very apparent that this game was never meant to see it's completion! The STEAM requirements for Early Access is far less restrictive towards the developers, which is WHY they've kept it in this state.

They have completely destroyed the build mechanics now, to the point where even the work-arounds no longer work. It took me 30 attempts, 2 broken legs and a stuck gyro-copter trying to get the roof of my building finished... I gave up! Too much BS to do a simple thing. It use to be you could just close yourself in the door and it would put you on the roof, but they destroyed that glitch too... Why is it games restrict a players ""Playability""? Like allowing them to build ""right there"" or ""like that"" breaks some international game building law!!?? The point (and goal) of any good developer is to provide an escape for the player, through immersion mechanics, and flexibility. Letting the player play the way they like and enjoy. Satisfactory is a great example of this mindset! They have even lifted some functional constraints because users couldn't do the things they wanted... In short, they made the PLAYER their baseline. But not this developer. Money has been theirs from day one, while users get little content and a bag of excuses. Which is why they chose to port to console even before THIS version was functioning good. 

They're in it for the cash and nothing more.. they have done just enough to keep sales coming... and once this game no longer generates the revenue they crave, it will die a long miserable death... Which may be why all the very old bugs, poor mechanics, and 7 year Early Access state are still around.

This game has been in development so long, you'd think it was Star Citizen. So, I will uninstall it for the last time and relinquish this title back to Steam. It's NEVER going to be finished, fixed, or playable for any length of time. I'll wait until another game studio comes along and blows this game out of existence with a GOOD ocean survival game (hopefully done in UE5!).

One will die of thrust very quickly and if you manage to work through that you will shortly after die of hunger and the food you do gets gives very little on your health bar when consuming so you need a lot of food but there isn't much food to be found and when you do work you lose your health very quickly and find yourself in a losing cycle of all you do is try to find food and water that isn't available and doesn't Respawn. You can find a few crabs along the beaches but it seems after you kill, skin and consume them they never respawn and that food source is gone and your left with coconuts which do respawn but take many many days and your dead by then.

You need endless palm leaves from the palm trees to add to the water still and get very little water in return. There are not many trees on the small island and the trees don't grow back so if you cut them down you lose the food from the coconuts and if you don't you can't make water, so your screwed no matter what you do and there is no other way to get water.

I have tried a play through on normal settings at least a dozen times going into it with an open mind and it's always the same results. You scramble to make a few tools and a water still and get some food all of which depletes quick and all your energy is water trying to find more food and water which doesn't exist and you eventually die.

The mechanics of the raft are so screwed up I can never get off the island even to the sunken boat which is only like 50 feet off shore. I walked out to the sunken boat and there is no way to get in or on it you need to use the raft. You need the raft to get on the boat yet i can't get off the island because when I pull the raft off shore away from the beach and swim all around it i can't get in the raft, all i see is text that says Life Raft but no indicator that allow me to hit the E button and get inside the raft. The raft just quickly gets pushed back to shore. If i get in the raft near shore the game is so stupid it always puts me sitting in the raft facing the shore and when I try to paddle and turn to go out it will only allow me to go straight towards the shore which means you go no where, the raft should turn yet it doesn't. I tried grabbing the raft and turning it around based on where is was sitting when it faced me towards the shore, got back in and sat down and I am still facing the shore, the raft simply sucks.

After gathering the few items I found on the beach like stones and wood and small saplings for making rope the only thing that repawned was the saplings. I only found 1 blue tarp to make the water still and nothing else. Many bad storms came yet nothing new ever washed up on shore. I needed stone and there was large rocks i could have broken up yet i could not craft a pick due to the way the crafting is set up. You get access to new tools and for the most part anything you can craft as you craft items, crafting more opens new items yet you need to manage your resources because you have next to no resources and you need to save them to craft only the items you absolutely need. yet the game is wanting you to craft multiple items to open new recipes, this system causes you to die and every survival game I have played gives you the basics or at least the recipes to craft the basics like a knife, pick and ax, this system sucks.

So for example there are many different plants you can get and plant in a farm crop box and you would want to do that very quickly so you had a source of food. I see the crop plot in crafting but can't make it due to not having access to it because I didn't craft X amount of stuff, so I starve and die. Instead the game is instructing me and fourcing me into making stuff I really don't need like foundations. I do not really need to make foundations because I have already made a shelter where i can take cover, sleep and save. I should be focused on water and food and making that crop plot first thing should be priority seeing I already have shelter yet the developers have me wasting matts, time, water and food to build something I don't need at this point of the game, so I starve. It's a survival game and I should be able to craft what I feel I need based on my situation yet the developer is forcing my hand to do other things I feel I should not be focused on. 

I think the whole leveling structure and access to recipes and how it works in this game sucks for the fact that your stuck on this tiny tiny island with next to no resources and 99.5% of it doesn't respawn and or wash up on shore, it's not like having access to these recipes would allow me to just craft everything because you would never have enough matts to craft much of anything. It's not like ARK Survival where you have endless forest and resources available which has the same leveling structure but it's understandable due to the access and amount of resources readily available and the fact that you can be killed at any point. So you have a leveling system that slowly gives you the blueprints to craft items.

The game is very frustrating, you start out and spend all your energy and time trying to get water and food and don't have much time for anything else and just end up dying rather quickly. I would not suggest purchasing this game unless you like this type of endless death and struggle game play, it's not fun.",1508447225,1641942833,False,0,0,0.549271881580352783,0,True,False,True

- Slow paced survival
- Great fun co-op
- Fun crafting system
- Great Visuals
- Island editor is an awesome inclusion
- Story? Im not to keen, just prefer sandbox games.

Cons
- Can get stuck on rocks, steps, vegitation hitboxes.
- Slow pickup, detection & animation delay not allowing for fast precise looting like other games.
- Crafting menus mixed with with in game crafting not very intuitive.
- inventory controls need uniformity & QoL tweaks.
- In game items can knock each others hitboxes sending your loot far far away....
- Gamemode for survival with passive animals would be great.

Coming from Rust & Minecraft the controls feel janky & unpolished but similar.

Just trying to get to a weapon to use while being attacked will get me killed. Having to constantly hit TAB and select items multiple times just to do something simple, like light a fire and cook some meat, is so irritating. The small inventory also means I need to drop and pick up items constantly to do anything...... Please! if I shouldn't do something, like eat uncooked meat, Don't let me do it!!!! Just say something like ""You don't want to eat uncooked meat!"" and not do it! It's so easy to do it by accident with these controls.
Then I need to find guides just to know basic things like how health is regained. Maybe someday I'll even find out how to put an item in the hotbar opened by the tool belt, so my weapon isn't constantly put away every time I need another item, and not automatically or easily re-equipped.
 I kept trying to get on the low end of a ship in water by using space bar... it worked on another ship before, but it just kept doing the opposite and dunking me under the water..... There was no indication on how I should climb up on the boat, and all trying to do it repeatably got me was an attack from a shark.... Very frustrating when you are trying to figure out how to do things.
This might be a good game eventually, but I doubt I'll be able to deal with the clunky basics long enough to find out.",1616532006,1641782943,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I think Early Access should last a maximum of 9-12 months. After that either you release full game or it gets removed (and people get refunded).

- When you drop items on the ground they may float in the air like magic
- Unable to craft any items until you relog multiple times
- Randomly disconnected because why not
- Tools in your inventory aren't useable but still take up space and can't be dropped

“We don't want to work on Stranded Deep forever. If all goes well, we're hoping to have it completed by the end of 2015.""

Coming back after a year since I played, I'm a little disappointed to see it is still EA, as this game has a huge potential. 
There is a lot to improve, and the devs are certainly taking their time, or simply have given up on the game. 
What the game could improve on:

- Bigger, more interesting islands. For instance it would be cool with a beach cove or small caves (with clay deposits). Volcano islands or underwater volcanoes. 

- More wildlife. Could be simple thing as poisonous spiders, scorpions, chameleons, mosquito swarms - or bigger ones like iguanas. Including underwater life like whale sharks, groups of dolphins spotted in the distance etc. 

- Less coconuts - More varied sources of food. Bananas. Berries (including poisonous ones), papayas, other exotic fruits etc. In its current state it is too easy going from island to island and replenish on food and water from coconuts.

- Different sound effects. Example: Hacking trees or paddling in the life raft should have 3 or 4 sound effects each. Yeah, it does actually make a difference when you do it a whole day.

- Cutting out the cheesy voice lines saying ""Eww, gross"" when skinning a crab and trying to survive. Add more random dialogue that could occur from time to time, like how he's hoping he will be rescued soon, how he's curious about the new island he's arriving on, how he hopes there are no sharks around when he goes for that shipwreck etc.

- Random drops; Traces of previous ancestors, history relics, ancient ruins, message in a bottle etc. Maybe some personal belongings from the people on the plane. 

- Less frequent shark encounters. So that you actually have the guts to take a swim but will get more freaked out when you meet a shark. Not having them swimming around your island constantly. 

- More objectives/ quests: Would be awesome finding a treasure map / key belonging to another island (in the same island group) that you have to seek out. Maybe a bigger island, having to fight a panther boss or something.



They have indeed made a few new improvements, like adding storms with huge waves. But all in all the process is too slow. I'm sure if they pick up the pace and make some new features and more varied content, this will be a 50+ hour game (add multiplayer on top and it's 150+), rather than its current state where you get more or less bored after 10 hours. 

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game, and with great graphics. I'm just disappointed seeing the progress with just a couple new features since I last played, over a year ago. For me personally, there was no replay value, which I usually have with most games. If it was a FULL release when buying, it would be something different. But I bought it in EA, thinking a lot more content would come. 

I'm not at all expecting them to make all the ideas above, but it's just some suggestions to make the game less repetitive. I hope they continue in the right direction and will be more than happy to change this review later on. Like mentioned this game has potential, and could possibly be among the best games in 2018 if done right!

Review December 2021 />

They have done some things since I last played this four years ago! More wildlife, more objects to make, I can recommend this now. Though they could work on the audio and turn down the shark frequency (constantly being followed by my new pet, hammerhead fella :)

What they really need to do is get inspired by Raft; as you can only stay on an island a certain amount of time before it depletes, you should be able to build more stuff on the raft. Also you need like 10 shots of the harpoon to kill a shark, which is too much. You should either reduce it or give the ability to make leather armour for extra protection.",1512724276,1641482047,True,0,0,0.919159591197967529,16,True,False,True

Its such are good concept & I do recommend it, for those with patience.
But!... yes there is a but, there's quiet a few bugs, a fair bit of lag at times.  Granted I don't have the strongest internet speed, but if I can play games like Battlefield V or Rust, I can't really blame my ISP.  The game can get boring, but so much more immersive and fun with co-op, would be even better if there could be up to 4 players. 
I do hope the developers keep updating and fixing stuff, because it really is a good idea.  Perhaps the crafting interface and the general interaction with the environment could be more fluid. But hey, I'm not a gaming programmer and I have no understanding of the difficulties of programming such suggestions, but perhaps others can identify and articulate constructive advice much better than me.
I like the game, it just needs some of those things I mentioned addressed. I will also add the cross platform play, which is confusing ""Can you crossplay or can't you?"" Its not very clear, can I play with my friend whose on PS4, while I'm on PC? not certain, also perhaps a deeper storyline for those of us that play solo from time to time might be a good idea.

I originally got this as a free game on PSN, and it gave me some really fun hours of entertainment. When i seen it appear here on steam with the option to play multiplayer, the purchase was a no brainer, i knew exactly what i was getting and its easily worth the price.

The exploration part is just so fun, with the risk/reward element just so satisfying. Its not a game you can spend years on like ARK. But for a couple of fun filled days with friends, i really do reccomend this game.

And kudos to the devs in the business practices, making this game free made me notice it, and then by noticing it i certainly wanted to contribute, i purchased this game again here and a copy for a friend, now thats business acumen and i think a lot of gaming devs thesedays ignore this marketing part.

To be fair, you have to cut the game some slack since they don't have that publishing money, and indie games that don't need that slack are all the better. I don't really know why it's still in early access since the game's complete and 6 years old. There's nothing to care about lore-wise really, but for those of you who can't afford a triple game or don't have an rtx 9020, it's a good game for you.

Now, I have not played single player so I'm just reviewing from the Co-op perspective. So If you're planning to play this game with a friend, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME!!! I have never, EVER, in my life encouter so many bugs and glitches in a single game. The game is literally unplayable for co-op! And please do not buy the game and ""hope"" that the devs will fix it...just don't...because it is a very small dev team what I've heard and the game is close to same state since 2015...

I startet playing at version 0.90.08 in Singleplayer.
The only Survivalgames i´ve played so far are Subnautica and Below Zero
On Stranded Deep I like the more realistic setting compared to the Sci-Fi Setting in Subnautica.

For me, being in the water or being surround by it is a great setting for a survival game.
On my first attempt I stepped into a poisonous plant on Day1 and died on Day2.
On my secont attempt I knew the basics, what to do, what to focus on and been playing for 8 hours until Day10 so far.

Until now it is really fun exploring the surrounding islands, crafting new stuff and organize my home.
I like that there is no map. Why should there be a map in such a setting anyway?
It kills the tension. When you leave your home island there is a litte fear and pressure to not get lost 
and to hopefully find a way back without getting cought by a storm.

I hope that there is a lot more to explore and that it stays beeing fun like it is now.

The only disturbing object I saw in the carfting menu is the helicopter.
It´s not fitting into the ""sticks and stones"" scenario at all in my opinion.

Diarrhea from eating too many coconuts too soon 2. Stepping on poisonous starfish 3. Not crafting an antidote after being poisoned 4. Leaving life raft (YOUR KEY TO SALVATION) not anchored and not pulling it up to shore so it doesn't get carried away by the tides 5. Realizing you lost said raft because you were in such a hurry searching this island for pipi plants (used for antidotes) 6. Getting poisoned AGAIN by a snake after freaking out about losing your raft 7. Crafting a seaworthy vessel made of sticks and putting a sail on it with NO RUDDER 8. Trying desperately to stay on makeshift raft that is going where where the h*** it pleases because you forgot to craft a rudder to steer the doomed vessel 9. Flipping said doomed makeshift stick vessel in shark infested waters and being eaten alive. 

If you're contemplating purchasing this horrifying island castaway adventure than you should be asking yourself ""Do I have what it takes to survive coconut-induced diarrhea, poisonous snakes, man-eating sharks, poisonous fish, angry boars, poisonous sea snakes, annoying seagulls, poisonous starfish, more man-eating sharks, poisonous sea urchins, and terrifying bats. And on top of all that you have to make sure as all humans do stay on top of water and calorie intake.",1574209287,1640391893,True,1,2,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Let me elaborate:

I spent days building a raft, going from island to island, searching desperately as daylight bled away into night. Not one single coca plant anywhere. Each moment i felt as my strength ebbed from my body, my demise coming closer and closer to me as if another survivor had washed ashore with me and unseen, began choking me in my sleep, choking me in my wake, choking me with an ever tightening grip. By day 6 i had resorted to snorting a crushed snail shell as if it would provide me with some form of relief. It did not.

By day 7 i realised that i needed real help. 
In hospital, hooked up to an iv of heightened valium, prescribed by a doctor who's name seemed to rhyme with *sshole judging by how many times i belligerently yelled it at him, i began my healing process.

I was told by another patient in the hospital that Stranded deep was a great game to escape reality with. So i bought it and tried it.

It has been exactly 62 hours since i last snorted a sweet sweet line of dried angel c*m and i regret every second of it. I need to find more coca leaves. I need the coca leaves to grow.

There are no coca leaves in Stranded deep.
There is no cocaine production in Stranded deep.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.

Notes: this game has a beautiful underwater environment and sunrise. Being in the water is always stressful and dangerous, with sea snakes, lion fish, and sharks at every turn, You can get your adrenaline pumping by exploring old abandoned ships. Its one of those games where many of the rarer resources must be found, not crafted. This game is stressful with many responsibilities for you to remember. whether it be bringing the amount of supplies with you to another island, deciding what to bring back with your limited space on your raft. navigating your way home, remembering to tend to your crops, keeping the endurance of your weapons high, especially when you are poisoned and searching frantically around the map for 2 green flowers to heal you up. When I played, I had to create a real map on a piece of paper with all the islands I traveled too, the resources they had, the directions. etc, and even with all this I was stranded on another island, far from my base, sailing the open ocean, till I eventually found my way back after like 15 hours of gameplay. Stressful game, but a good one. There isnt many building options unfortunantly, with no sets of furniture. not a very creative game, but a great survival game.",1635632464,1639360072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Here is what I feel is missing, mind you I have played 7 days to die, DayZ, Ark survival, All the fallouts, I have spent countless hours playing survival games. With all thet being said, here's my honest opinion. The graphics are SPECTACULAR, and everything I previously mentioned above BUT I got bored after the first day and here's why, pretty much every island is the same, same resources, same creatures, some islands are a bit bigger then others and some have a FEW different resources then others but not by much. The sea creatures are awesome looking but most dont do anything like the turtles have no purpose the stingrays have no purpose, the coral has no purpose, there's plenty of trees but you cant cut alot of them down for some reason, and same for the boulders/rocks they are just there...when I play split screen I feel there isn't enough resources between the 2 of us we find ourselves having to search for hours just to find stone...kinda boring...ALSO the compass does'nt quit work like i thought it would and have lost my island SO MANY TIMES and I know how to read a compass....please add a map of some sort. Also, I do think it's a cool idea that you do all this to get off the island BUT I also would like a continuous game that you can continue to play...once I found out thats the sole purpose is to just build up the plane and leave I found myself not wanting to play anymore....I haven't played since then because It's boring and wish there was SO MUCH MORE to utilize, the clay took us over a entire day (real life time) to find....kinda crazy. We do really enjoy the game but just bored with it. Kinda pointless to do all that just to leave...PLEASE ADD MORE CONTENT <3 I purchased this game on both steam and xbox cause I thought we could join eachother, come to find out I wasted money ): damn.

This game is exceptionally more entertaining than I originally thought it would be, and I loved how the tutorial didn't literally hold your hand and baby you through it. But there are some problems I'd like to see addressed.

The game never actually tells you how to throw spears for example, or how to use the toolbelt, which are both pretty vital aspects to know about. I literally looked on a wiki to find out how to use a toolbelt, and was completely shocked at how there's no way I could've guessed something so random is what bound items to the hotbar. It should either be obvious, or told in the tutorial how you do basic controls in the game, and even now I'm not sure if the container inventory system is just really awkward, or I just don't have a clue what the proper controls are. 

A HUGE issue that even ruins a lot of my enjoyment of the game is just that the toolbelt and hotbar system is the absolute worst I have ever seen. I tried using the toolbelt, by binding some tools to it, and I STILL had to have them in my inventory, and on top of that, if I dropped the tool, it got unbound! This is absolutely unacceptable and would take off at least 4 out of 10 points on this game instantly, if I were rating it 1-10.

I am genuinely extremely angry and frustrated about just how bad the hotbar system is. If you're gonna have me have to rebind an item EVERY TIME I drop it, then you have to make it be STORED in the hotbar slot, and not wasting my precious inventory slots! And if you're gonna have it the other way around, where it isn't stored in my hotbar, then don't make it EVER get unbound unless I PERSONALLY unbind it or bind something else to that slot. You can't have it be literally BOTH of the negatives of each side, it completely ruins almost every part of the gameplay and any chance of being efficient without jumping through so many hoops. 
This mega issue is literally something I would talk to a friend about like ""imagine if the developers made it like this, that would be so stupid"", and laugh about, so the fact that it's actually done like this is almost too painful for me to even put into words. Until this absolute roadblock of horrifying pain is fixed, I won't enjoy this game even a third as much as I would if it was done correctly, and will mostly avoid using the hotbar (or toolbelt) at all.

So then the other thing I just now noticed that seriously needs to be addressed for obvious reasons, is that multiplayer needs to have chat. I get if you want a game to have the kind of multiplayer where you are in a call with a friend or something, but you can't just not have a proper form of chat in the public multiplayer gameplay. 

I do recommend trying this game's singleplayer, but the multiplayer should be limited to playing with people via a discord call for example, or you get quite the risk of who you're playing with getting upset at you because there's literally no communication and misunderstandings are born easily. 

This is less of a gameplay review and more of a critical review. I do very much enjoy this game and there's a lot to love about it, but I'm not much good at writing reviews about the things that are already good in a game. So I'll just say it's pretty dang good for the most part, but needs a touch up on the tutorial, a total overhaul on the hotbar system, and chat for public multiplayer games.",1637455089,1638992382,True,13,4,0.613720178604125977,3,True,False,True

Needs some major work.  

For a game that has been in early access for over 5 years, there is a lot that needs to be adjusted /added.

Its still a good game(passing in my opinion, and since it is still in early access.  I'll keep my hopes up)

Ya, when you find the aircraft carrier you find parts to make a gyrocopter, but other than that, you can basically build everything from the get-go. There just isn't enough to keep you interested. The limited plot isn't even hinted to - I had to look it up online. There is no purpose in building a house, there is no workstation or unlocking better equipment. The game just...is?

In it's current state however, i can not recommend it. There are tons of flaws with the game: from little imperfections, over questionable game design choices, to crippling bugs.

This is a full-length review. You can heavily shorten the read by stopping after the personal gameplay story i put at the top, as it should be enough to deliver the message. If you are still interrested, you can afterwards read up on the other topics making this game unenjoyable to play, which cant be delivered in such a story.

[b]Gameplay Introduction[/b]:
The game starts with your plane crashing. You end up in the ocean with nothing more but a rubber raft. You paddle your way to the next island and start foraging for ressources. You can pick up ressources, craft tools to harvest some more, and build workbenches to help you cook, collect water, or craft more [i]complex[/i] items, like wooden planks. Most ressources are finite per island, so you eventually have to build a raft and move on. So what went wrong with the game?

[b]A true Story about Space Travel[/b]:
One true story is all it takes to perfectly summarize what it feels like to play this game. 
We headed out to another island. Well prepared with a raft, food, water, tools, crates and all. We found a large ship with quite a few rooms underwater. Drowning in this game starts once your O2 bar depleates, at which point your screen slowly turns black, giving you some more time. I lost orientation underwater and drowned. Happens. My mate set out to rescue me. Shortly before arriving at my position, he died. He had still half of his O2. He did not drown, he simply died. There was also no wildlife. As both of us were dead, we had to reload.
Same journey again. This time we build a shelter on the island and frequently saved. Similar to the above, while exploring an empy underwater corridor, i suddenly got poisoned. As antidote was one of the only things we did not bring, i was now flagged for eventual death. That takes some time tho, so we continued. 
Eventually we collected all the crates from all the ships. We saved. I farmed trees, while my mate sorted crates to create some additional space. As we were just done with all of that, the game crashed. Half an island of chopped trees and 10 sorted chests, gone. We loaded back in and.. another crash while still loading. Third time is the charm. We chopped wood, sorted crates, saved and were finally ready to sail back to our main island. 

This is not where the story ends. This is where it begins.
As we load up the raft, i eventually die to the poison. We were prepared for that, so my mate already carried a bandage to help me back up. While getting revived, my body launched into the raft, instantly killing me again and flipping the raft upside down. The crate with clothes and ropes was in my inventory, so we had no good way to revive me again. Cant really plan for [b]that[/b] to happen, right? Furthermore, there is no good way to flip a raft. He eventually managed using a log from our chests. He then sailed back to our main island, got a bandage, and sailed all the way back to me. Meanwhile, ironically, a shark started circling my lifeless body, making the rescue a bit harder than usual. Once done, you guessed it, my body launched into his player model, ricochet into the raft, which flipped again, and then flew off into space. I literally saw the border of the world.. or rather the end of my maxed view distance. We would have still attempted to resolve this without reloading, if the game did not suddenly decide that something was not right, freezing my character in place. Which meant i was stuck in space, without any hope for a rescue operation. 

[b]This[/b] is [b]the[/b] Stranded Deep experience.

[b]Inventory Management[/b]:
Your inventory has 10 slots. Since there is an empty-hand slot and a current-item slot, make that 8. Crates have 3 slots. A slot can take a stack of one item. Some items, like logs, take a full slot, most items can be stacked to 4, and then there are some exceptions. It is worth mentioning that the current-item slot holds one item only, not a stack. This causes problems, but more on that later. 
Besides items you might want to carry a spear, axe, pick, light, knife, air tank, or many other things with you, depending on the situation. This further limits your free space by a lot. Some crafts also take huge amounts of items. A raft base made of sticks, for example, takes 14 sticks and a rope. That is half your inventory for one crafted item. Carrying around, sorting, and generally managing items thus makes an uncomfortably large part of the game. As for storage, you can attempt to store most things in chests. Chests are rather expensive to craft, but plenty are found in shipwrecks. You will however likely be tempted to skip the inventory management and just drop piles of items on the ground. Which is fine, but tells you a lot about the alternative.

[b]Game Design Flaws[/b]:
A lot of little things quickly add up here. The Coop lobby menu works by sharing a generated code. Closing the steam overlay with escape then also closes the lobby menu tho, making you do it all over again. 
The UI is pretty horrid. You do not see both inventories when transfering items. Instead you see your usual inventory item wheel, except the other inventory is added as another slot with a backpack/crate symbol you can click on. This was confusing at first and is also inconsistant to how the other slots behave. 
To interact with items in the world, you need to get them highlighted. Which doesnt work well. You can literally stand on top of a chopped palm tree and not hit its leaves with your axe sometimes. Combat works the same, meaning badly. There is also little feedback for hitting stuff, or how the fight is going in general.
The crafting menu is a nightmare. There is categories inside categories. The inner ones are easily identifiable using icons. The outer ones are accessed by clicking the text above the crafting menu, which took us some time to even notice. 
When you craft an item, the menu closes itself. You want another one, you gotta reopen it again. If you hold a hammer, it tries to be smart and directly opens the building category. Except you also use the hammer for vehicle stuff. Making it less smart and more detrimental.
You dont interact with workbenches to see what they can craft. Instead the distance to them is like an item requirement, enabling you to use recipes from your usual crafting menu. Not only does this unnecessarily clutter the menu, it also causes problems since the whole thing works increadibly poorly. You can sometimes stand on top of workbenches or items, with them not registering for the recipe. 
Remember the current-item inventory slot which can only hold one item? Makes sense on paper, but causes a ton of problems in practice. Imagine you hold an axe there and fill your inventory with sticks. Now you want to drop your sticks on a pile. You cant do that. Why? Because that would require you to put your axe into a free inventory slot, but taking a stick out of it does not free up a whole slot. So despite already carrying all those items, you get the ""inventory full"" message and are forced to first drop your tool. 

There is so many inconvenient or badly designed things in the game that playing it becomes a chore. Reinventing the wheel is usually a bad idea. Especially so, if the result does not roll anymore. 

[b]Bugs, Performance, Other[/b]:
Whenever someone joins, the world needs to be synchronized. This takes quite some time, but that's to be expected as Coop was an afterthought. The real problem is that clients commonly disconnect (~2h). Even i as the host once did.. from my own lobby.
Rejoining means everybody is stuck in the sync world screen again. The game also likes to crash sometimes. Same story.",1638642393,1638643190,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

I bought this game almost 7 years ago and it still feels pretty much the same as back then. Progress is extremely slow.
Every few years I reinstall the game hoping it has changed, but it is minimal.

It is interesting at first, but quickly becomes boring as survival gets super easy.
Now it has coop which is a great addition. My GF got this so we could play it together, but it does not work. 
Items fly away if picked up, stuff disappearing, items appear at different places on each of our screens etc...
She ended up refunding the game, sadly I can't. Maybe it is worth another try in a few years.

+Nice setting
+coop
+some good ideas on the crafting/survival part
-gets a bit repetitive,
-a lot of Bugs and glitches that will frustrate the hell out of you

The longer version:
As a fan of survival/crafting games that are coop-enabled, I really like the concept of the game. Who doesn't love an island setting anyway? Playing with a friend makes it even better.

The game does many things quite well, but it fails in a few places and is extremely unpolished:
- Island hopping is exciting in the beginning, but after maybe your 3rd or 4th island, the gameplay gets extremely repetitive. After a very hours of playing, you quickly start doing the same things over and over again, which gets even more tedious due to the fact that most islands and shipwrecks are almost exactly the same. Only a few layouts that are copy pasted
- No real story, just a way to ""escape"" the place. That would be ok, but I guess most players would never find that this exists, because of the very rough way of navigating and keeping track of where you are, except if they look at online hints about that escape. This also means that if you do like the feeling of having some kind of plot like in ""the Forest"" or ""green Hell"", you're going to be disappointed
- It has so many bugs and glitches that it hurts. This is ultimately the reason why I cannot recommend this game. It starts with minor to medium annoyances (raft and environment clipping errors, keyboard keys stop working until you reload the game, random disconnects that reset you to your last save point, item placement glitches, and stuff like this). Those you could live with. But what is really annoying is the fact, that BAAD stuff tends to happen to your Raft. For example: Sometimes it gets flipped over for no reason or flies through the air as if thrown by catapult because of weird physics. This is absurd. But the worst thing that happened to us (after about 30-40 hours of gameplay) was that our large raft completely disappeared all of sudden, along with all of our stuff, even as it was parked right next to the island beach. And the game does not keep backup saves! Because we did not immediately notice the raft was gone (was on other side of the island), we accidentally saved this corrupted state and were stuck like this. We lost so many hours of gameplay because of this now corrupted save, that we quit playing the game altogether, even with only one more ""boss"" remaining. It was just so frustrating. Putting all the stuff and Raft together again would literally take many hours. After searching the forums, this seems to be a very common bug.

So, if you decide to play this game: Always keep a manual backup savegame in case you end up with a corrupt state. 

Very sad that I cannot give a recommendation because of such game-breaking bugs.",1638219748,1638219748,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ok i cant craft the tire foundation, but cant craft the barrel foundation?. And what the difference between them? 3 barrels with rope crafting is more difficult than 2 tires with rope? NO! SO why its locked? Total stupid system.

The whole interface too. Very difficult to operate. Developers must learn first how to do friendly interface for players. Even ""Raft"" Game interface and controls is much more friendly than here. Seems they try to do a game for gamepad. BUT PLAYERS ON PC USE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD! ITS NOT A CONSOLE!
Remove this and go back to the previous verson. it was more playable

Mechanic in the game become also stupid:
You can grow potato in 2 days. you can grow Yuka plant in 1 day.
But you can't grow palms at all. And they don't re-spawn.
the rocks not re-spawn, and even if you collect and dig all rocks from all islands, chopped all trees for logs on all islands - you will run of trees soon. You will not have most wanted resources such as [LOGS], [ROCKS], [STICKS], [PALM LEAVES]. Because there is no re-spawn system of this.
It means there is no point to build a base or house from any materials because they will run out if you try.

Developers don't care about their players even in discussions. If you don't believe you can go and see to ""Discussions"" how they speak with their players. The answers to questions, proposals and real advice from players they answer like ""if you don't like - don't play"".

Just one example: Want to pick up a rock into your backpack? You pick it up and it ends up as the active item in your hands like a tool--even though you can't really use it like a tool--*then* you have to go into your backpack and select your *empty hands*(!) (from within your backpack!?) to actually put the rock away into your backpack and give you your hands back. Yes really. Also, radial menus.

Another example?: If you pick a coconut off a tree, you have to drop it on the ground and attack it with your knife to shuck it, then you can pick it back up to drink it--but then to harvest/eat it you drop it back on the ground and attack it again to open it, then pick it up and eat it. (Grab off tree -> drop -> attack -> pick up -> drink -> drop again -> attack -> pick up -> eat. Congrats you have fully consumed a single coconut, and it only took you 9[!] actions.) Ok, but then does a picked up crab at least work the same way for consistency?--of course not. You drop it on the ground, but then instead of attacking it (like the coconut) you hold *pickup* on it--but only if you have your knife selected--to harvest the meat from it. Yep. I couldn't make this sh1t up.

Also, if you see a hotbar in any screenshots (like every other survival-crafting game in history), you have to craft/unlock *every spot on your hotbar one at a time*--and they don't give you any extra inventory/carrying capacity, you're just crafting/unlocking each slot solely for the privilege to be able to use number keys to switch weapons/tools and avoid the god-forsaken radial menus.

Flying pigs, spinning around, seriously, it's that bad. I love the concept and the crafting, but I expected after a year or 2 hiatus, they would have FIXED some things, but they BROKE more things. It's just too frustrating to play without getting angry, I'm not going into it, but it was worth changing my vote and adding this complaint. What a let down. It could have been GREAT. It's just not.Here's my old review for reference, I liked it more then.The things they added is extra BS, and before it was endearing almost.

Old review:

I thoroughly enjoyed it for about 75 hours! I think it's definitely worth $15. So realistic. You actually feel like the crafting makes sense. My favorite survival game so far. Reminds me of Don't Starve but realistic, no fantasy here. If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to be stranded on a deserted island, this is the best representation of that.

I was expecting an ""infinitely procedural generated"" world, like the devs promised, but it's not even that cool. You spawn into a random world, but that's it, there's 16 -25 islands and they are all tiny and not THAT different. If you go outside the boundaries, you reach a fishing net bobber-line, with NOTHING outside of it (Don't bother looking lol). There are a few cool surprises though. I really enjoyed trying to make a map for myself, based on the features of the islands. Sharks are always terrifying!

After 75 hours it got super boring, as there's really not much to do, other than survive. They added an ""end game"" update recently, and fixed seagulls (I guess?) a couple little things like that, but I'm already over it and that's not enough to bring me back in.

Way better on PC (I originally bought on Xbox One, it's okay, but they really need to update that version, it runs super choppy). 

Here's what updates I'd like to see, if anyone is paying attention:

A larger, way more dangerous island in the middle, with more creature types and items, or a ""mainland"" to try to get to, that you have to save up food and water to reach, and then the hard part begins? Perhaps more than one way to ""beat"" the game? Like getting rescued, or travelling far enough?! Perhaps procedural generation of extra islands, if you go outside the boundaries...?

 So much potential, if you would just FINISH what you started here, it sort of feels abandoned and unfinished. I still really enjoyed it!",1589222493,1638132729,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's very similar to games like Raft and Ark that I have enjoyed a lot more, and it looks really good, but it does everything in a way that is just constantly irritating. I've never played a game with a more aggravating inventory system. It's difficult to switch between items and you frequently end up having to drop items from your inventory just to switch between objects already in your inventory. The crafting system is also incredibly annoying to use, more so than almost any crafting system I've dealt with. Even Fallout 4's crafting wasn't more annoying. 

The game constantly forces you to go through tedious and repetitive steps to do simple tasks, mostly involving popping in and out of the menus multiple times to perform simple things like cooking a fish. Steering the raft is one of the most unresponsive and frustrating things I've done in a video game. Having to constantly rebuild structures on new islands because they can't be moved or built on the raft is just a needless annoyance. All survival games have a degree of busywork involved in just staying alive, but the busywork in this game is more aggravating to figure out and more aggravating to repeat than in most.

I love that it is tough however, I do not like that you run out of resources and things do not re spawn/regrow such as coconuts. Trees. These NEVER grow back people.  You run out of items quickly when each island only has for instance, roughly 15 stones on it, or 30 pieces of wood and it runs out. Forever. 

 The other flaw is that I want to build everything on boat but it will not allow for that. Most games reward you for your efforts whereas this one punishes you because you will run out of items and cannot place items which you need to live on your raft/houseboat. I wanted to put my fire on my raft, I built the floor with corrugated steel yet when I tried to put the wood for the fire on top of it, the game doesn't let you do that. So you would eventually be forced to island hop and keep rebuilding fires, water filter systems just to live and there is nothing able to re spawn there. Please please let some wood regrow and let us build sustainable boats?? Island hopping only to have to build the same things over and over are less fun. 

The game feels like it kinda cheats ya, by not growing normal things and not allowing you to place items on your raft.

The other issue was that I keep killing sardines for food when I can see mussels and clams on the ocean floor, and turtles swim by and the game will not allow me to kill or harvest these other food sources...I lived off sardines 99.9.% of my life...PLEASE add variation and other skills would be fun too, like salting food so we can preserve it longer or make jerky or something.",1637774490,1637774490,True,2,0,0.531126081943511963,0,True,False,True

I do wish the game was a bit more full. There are some obvious crafting solutions that would make this game even more enjoyable. Such as:

- Coconuts float. They should should be considered as a raft building material. 
- I want to build structures on rafts. The fun of this game is going from island to island looking for resources. That fun is lost when you have to leave a well established fort on an island (the risk of getting lost, not being able to find your favorite island again). I want a mobile home raft. A house boat. 
- More edibles/recipes. Soups, salads, burritos. The game has enough depth to allow for pack-able meals for long trips. 
- Better tools. 
- Salvageable boat wrecks. 
- Generators/Solar Panels: Electric lighting. 
- 4 player co-op.

23 Jan, 2015

6.4.2021 - still in EA. I think I don't need to add more to this.

Update: 19.11.2021

I remember the time, where you actually had to throw coconut up in the air to get the juice out of it. It was so unique aproach. This is not an option anymore. Reither with unique aproach they decided to copy/paste from other survivals so you need to hit the coconut with your knife  ....

What happened to the game? What happened to the promises they made? It's simple. They grab your money. They make promises (some of them might even get into game). They put some fanboi for forum moderator so all the negative comments get deleted (specially Steam forums), so he keeps the negative comments filtered. And here we are. Today. Unfinished product after 6 years. And it's more bugged than ever.

For all the people watching screenshots on this site . They are photoshoped for sure. Game is far from what you see on the pictures. Steam should ban this kinda money grabbing companies like this and yet here we are.

Do I recommend? Hell no, It's drinking/eating simulator (most of the time you'll do only that), no options to somehow balance that issue. Every other survival game i've played is better than this one. Not to mention GUI since it's 6 yrs kids work.",1451667868,1637316362,False,2,1,0.507692337036132813,0,True,False,True

Potential and theme are really good however after 6 years of ""Early Access"" there is still only about 15 hours of game play at best. Most features are either pointless or poorly utilised.

For example they implemented a base building element that is not only completely pointless (weather/shelter is not a threat) but it sucks at limited resources (not everything re-spawns) 
They implement a RAFT feature (good feature in similar game) yet you can't build/store/sleep/cook...live? on it... it's just another form of transport.

But everyone has been craving muliplayer for years now, a ""no we're not doing that, we are sticking to singleplayer"" would have been fine because then thats that, id be reviewing a singleplayer game. But this is what you dont do, you dont tease multiplayer and release a half-assed splitscreen. Console split screen works wonders, not on pc. The ""its early access"" card is weakened to the point of failure by this point. So im landing on a negative untill we get basic multiplayer.
