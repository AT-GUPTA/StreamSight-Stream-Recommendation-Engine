Red Alert 3 continues the over-the-top acting of previous games and ramps it up to eleven. It has a fantastic cast that just make all the cheesy and hammy lines amazing. Gameplay-wise, while it is more cartoonish than previous games, it can make for surprisingly hard missions as you progress.


[b]Music: [/b] 6/10

Outside of VA, and some sound effects, there is nothing remarkable here. The intro music perhaps is really intense, but that‚Äôs about it.

[b]Visuals: [/b] 7/10

Effects look good, and that‚Äôs about it to be honest. I prefer a more washed down serious tone regarding this aspect like Red Alert 2; colors are too bright here, units are a bit too cartoonish for my taste, and the battlefield is just there.

[b]Gameplay: [/b] 7.5/10
 
At the start, I didn‚Äôt enjoy the gameplay much because of how ridiculous it was looking, but after a while, you get to embrace it. Units are varied, however, there are certain combinations (depending on the army) that are simply broken or too powerful. While every unit having a secondary mode is interesting, it was also tedious since it could lead to too much micromanaging if you really want to enjoy every aspect.

[b]Story: [/b] 6/10

A simple story that works fine for this setting. I would have enjoyed more lore (like it‚Äôs counterpart, Tiberium War), however, I guess that is asking too much.

It is an experience unlike any other as it pertains to any and everyone, as the art of war does not discriminate. Command and Conquer 3 has three different campaigns as you explore war through the eyes of the Allies, Soviets, and the Empire of the Rising Sun while dominating your foes and watching those around you become corrupt with power. Command and Conquer‚Äôs campaign has elite pacing contrary to other RTS games, as Command and Conquer 3 does not overwhelm the player with everything the game has to offer from the beginning. As the campaign develops, they slowly unravel the more advanced concepts as the player develops the skills needed to conquer their foes, making it beginner-friendly. Additionally, all the new developments do not feel out of place, as they fit well within the story, as the more advanced forms of combat only show up in the late game. Each country has unique tech and concepts tailored to its beliefs and culture, making each campaign dramatically different and forces the player to think on their feet as combat ensues. Outside the campaign, you can enjoy the skirmish mode where you can hone your skills and master the art of war, as Command and Conquer 3 gives you all the tools to make each skirmish tailored to the player's needs. This allows for an infinite amount of possibilities, making it a game you can come back to time and time again and always find something new to enjoy. I would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS games or is looking to get into the RTS genre, as it has something for both veterans and rookies.",1708896572,1708896572,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The enemy macro is impossible to deal with with certain enemies, such as if you allow your opponent the time to build aircraft carriers. They use EMP missiles to shut down any of your defenses, then use hydrofoils to neutralize anything that can destroy them. Your units will also stand still while they're getting attacked if the enemy attacking them is out of their range or they are unable to fight back.

Red Alert 3 is fun gameplay, models, actors you'll say 'Hey, I recognise them!' and metal af in general. 

I'm going to start with things I didn't like so I can end the ""review"" on a high note, because you AND the game deserve it!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things I didn't like:
- It's dated: Not just technology-wise. It's 2017 now. No male models in the game (other than George Takei). Definitely a weakness here. Would have been hilarious to have some jacked, half-dressed dudes just towering over desks, giving you a briefing with their innuendo-filled dialogue. Definitely a testament to how anything catered towards us fucking nerd gamers in the early 2000s amounted to nothing more than scantily-clad women, explosions and awkward dialogue. Don't get me wrong, I think this shit is funny. The sad part is people still seriously eat this shit up. It doesn't matter if their poster girls where invented by another man, they blame whatever their definition of 'a woke' is when they don't get this elsewhere. It's a bit toxic. 

- Skirmish options: Not enough customisation of the options in skirmish. I recall only being able to change starting currency amount, starting positions and all the factions/teams/colours stuff you'd expect from an RTS game. Having played so many other strategy games, it would have been nice to have the option to customise the experience more. 

- After hours of playing, it's a little TOO simple: Like I said, very accessable to new players of the genre/series, but after a while it gets old. Build power buildings, get money, build units and attack. That's the extent of it. Whereas, popular RTS game Age of Empires 1 over here, you have to get MULTIPLE resources and you have to upgrade individual troops and climb eras/tech trees etc. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things I like: 
+ Art style: The artwork for this game looks really cool. I'm a fan of the bright colours and how they instantly start defining each faction by making them visibly unique, which is also shown through in game with their units and abilities being completely diferent from each other. 

+ 'Bad' live action cutscene acting: 'bad' because it doesn't take itself seriously! One scene showed a Russian general and a Russian Intelligence officer giving you a briefing on the situation by video call. One of the lines was something like ""The Imperial Japanese army will thrust themselves into the soft tender regions of the USSR"" or something like that and the Intelligence officer, her eyes just widen as if to say 'Did he just actually say that?'

+ The music: Something that has been decent since the first Command and Conquer. The main theme itself over the years acts like a time capsule for that era of video games and like the games, evolves over the years getting more and more modern. Here it's more heavy metal. As a fan of Mastodon, I approve. 

+ The clear and embarrassing use of models: It's like they said 'Hey, what do gamers love?' and some other guy said 'World Wars. Heavy metal. And hot female models.' I like that this is such a clear cliche, like from a movie, because it's over the top and just hilarious. And I hope they knew that. 

+ Gameplay: The game itself is simple enough for anyone to start playing. Power runs buildings, buildings can get money and produce units. But it can get difficult pretty quickly. I play on medium difficulty and some campaign missions I just barely complete, which is quite exciting to see your last two units, low health and all, at the end of a battle when the victory theme plays. One massive exhale and your onto the next entertaining cutscene. The inclusion of skirmish is great too! Plent of maps here, and all 3 factions are playable AND they have a spectator mode where you can just watch a match between the AI play out. Useful for people wanting to record some background footage or sounds, or just take a look at what they do and what everything looks like. Lots of unique units and special abilities for each faction which is essential for a game like this. 

+ Abilities: Every unit has a special ability or unique mode which can make it even more effective in situations. Like the telsa troopers can either electrocute enemies or completly stun vehicles. There are also abilities that you can get depending on your faction, in a similar way that Company of Heroes does. Your bar fills up as you play, you get a point, you can spend that point on an ability, like the space magnet which pulls enemy vehicles into space for them never to be seen again. ""Ground control to Major Tom..."" 

+ It's fun!

+ Graphics aren't bad either!

Same as the precursors, the story takes place in a world where WW2 did not happen like it should but rather Soviets against Allies. Seeing the country in crysis, the Soviet leaders travel back in time to kill Albert Einstein, making them more powerful but with the Imperial Japan attacking them. There are 3 stories, where you play as a faction. Just like EA thought about it, it's so nonsense and goofy that is awesome: from the Soviets using bears and electric armors, the Allies using tanks that cloak every unit near them and dolphins to the Japanese using mechas and a waifu to fight. 

If you are used to Age of Empires or Starcraft, let me say this game is kind of different to play, and more depending on which faction you play with. The Soviets can spawn buildings across an area marked by the main centers (or Sputniks), the Allies build a structure and then spawn it in an area marked by their main center (or prospector), and the Japanese can create bots that can merge into buildings wherever they want. And of course, each unit in game is different. Finally, there are commandos that help you win the battle: Natasha, Tanya and Yuriko, each one with a different gameplay. 

Despite being a game from 2008, it aged visually very well. The units, buildings and scenarios are well detailed. 

Do you know that joke of ""Doom music goes with everything""? Well, Red Alert's soundtrack too. It's just powerful and motivational. The sound effects are cool too, but maybe the dialogues of the commanders and cutscenes are kind of cheesy. Still, they made a great job with it.

The full price for the game is 20‚Ç¨, which years ago I'd say it was worth it. Sadly the multiplayer mode was shut down, so after finishing the 3 campaigns there is not much to do. During sales it can cost just 5‚Ç¨, or even 2‚Ç¨ at the historical low. I'd recommend you not to pay full price for it.

If I had to add a game to the list of ""games that aged like wine"", Red Alert 3 takes a spot there. If you love strategy games, this might be the greatest option for you",1705339494,1705339494,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It's great! I recommend it. Netcode is good. 

It's NOT a good Command & Conquer but it IS a good RTS, which is why I am rating this positively.

Whoever worked on this had good ideas in mind and made an RTS the way they think it should have been done. Resource collection has been VERY simplified and every unit having special abilities, which for the latter isn't quite what I like and NOT AT ALL what I want to see in a CnC game, but still despite my personal opinion it is well implemented and it works if you see it as its own thing. The same goes for the resource collection except that I don't mind it being less micro-y.

Pathfinding is good most of the times, then other times its complete garbage. BUT it doesn't drop the game to 1 FPS like it did in Command & Conquer Generals from 2003.

There is a chance of it crashing randomly in multiplayer (had it happen in 1 of 3 games, all of which had AI players in them).

It's all about building bases, making armies, and outsmarting your opponents. The game's set in an alternate reality with cool factions, like the Soviets, Allies, and the Empire of the Rising Sun.

[i]One awesome thing about Red Alert 3 is the variety in gameplay. Each faction has its unique units and strategies, which keeps things exciting. You'll find yourself using different tactics and trying out various units to see what works best.

The game's graphics are pretty cool, considering it's an older title. The design and animations are nice, making the battles look epic. The storyline has that classic cheesy charm, making it enjoyable to follow along.

Now, this game isn't all sunshine and rainbows. The learning curve might be a bit steep for new players. There's a lot going on, and it might take some time to get used to the strategies and mechanics. But once you get the hang of it, it's addictive![/i]

Overall, Red Alert 3 is a classic real-time strategy game that's great for both casual and hardcore gamers. It's got cool factions, engaging gameplay, and plenty of strategy. If you're into strategy games or want to experience some classic RTS action, this game is worth checking out.[/b]",1702557222,1702557222,True,8,0,0.611914336681365967,4,True,False,False

Such a detailed good tutorial about the gameplay and the factions I had wished in other strategy games (especially new ones), too.

Solid Soundtrack (mostly metal like) and 3D-Graphic and interesting (sometimes even funny) campaigns.
In campaign you can even play it in co-op mode which means with a friend or an AI Supporter you can give some special commands. I think they wanted to try something new because they made this feature for ""C&C4 Tiberium Series"", too. 

Still sometimes I've got the feeling the devs overpowered some units are a little bit too much which explains why some fans made some memes or videos about ""Kirov reporting"". (Hust)

The graphics style and the designs of the units, maps, the goofy story with purposefully overacted and exaggerated live-action cutscenes, the music - those are all great.

However, when it comes to actual gameplay, the game is basically killed off by an attempt to restrict base building in various ways (depending on faction) in a very bad attempt to make base building, of all things, more varied. These attempts don't land at all and make the whole game extremely tedious - you easily spend 50-75% time fiddling with clunky base mechanics. This game really is a perfect example on why you don't try to fix things that work.

The combat itself is pretty good, some of the units have pretty interesting abilities that allow for distinct strategies and while the game is pretty easy to pick up, it certainly has a pretty high skill ceiling. Which makes it even more of a shame that it got bogged down by bad base management.

And lastly, like many games of its era, its campaigns have forced stealth missions - and like most games of its era, they are fucking terrible and whomever thought them up should not only be banned from working in gaming industry, but banned from using any electronic devices in general, just to make sure they don't release any other digital abomination of any kind, ever.",1698006443,1698006443,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

So I'm going to list some pros and cons.
Pros.
*3D
*Easy for beginners yet can be tweaked to be hard for the veterans
*Decent acting
*Better controls then C&C games before
*Good mission briefing gives clear instructions on what to do for missions
*Co-op mode great fun with friends
*Has Kirov gunship
Cons
*Barely short campaign I wish it would be just a few missions longer
*To play Co-op or online you have to install a third-party server provider
*Soundtracks are not as good as RA2 they should have let Frank Klepacki work his magic
*No upgrades like command and conquer generals loved the upgrades in that game sad to see a system like that not implemented in this game
*The points and unlocking system is only a remnant of what the points system in Generals was. The new system yet new and somewhat good shows a clear sign that C&C has steered away from the generals point system. The system works basically the same as the one yk kill troops and level up to get new abilities. But the abilities are not as good as the old one where in generals the GLA can get stuff like ambush repair and vehicles. In RA3 you get stuff that should just be considered a super weapon they should just add buildings that do that or have a mix of abilities and upgrades. Like maybe some could be like the anti-missile rockets that pop out of the apocalypse tank but as an unlockable ability for RA3.
Summary Overall the game is great even though I had a lot of complaints I still love this game just a lot of missed potential. But that doesn't ruin the game nor make it bad of course if the missed potential was not missed it would have been a better game but I still think it's great. This game is also the best one in the series to play with friends once you get the third-party servers set up it can be a blast going through the campaigns and some friendly skirmishes here and there. After all this in conclusion great game I would recommend you to buy this hopefully some day a remaster of this and the rest of the series will be released maybe even a new RA would be good too.

However, it also has issues so fun-breaking that they make it impossible for me to recommend the game.

Every single unit here is some variation of 'it's good against this specific unit type, but practically useless against any other type.' Simple infantry can tank a dozen shots from freaking [i]rockets[/i], [i]tank shells[/i] and [i]superheated lasers[/i]. But then fortified buildings and powerful vehicles practically turn into paper when scratched by those same weapons. In addition, vehicles can one-shot infantry by running them over, and there are some specific units infamous for being too powerful (ex: terror drone, cryocopter).

Of course, meta builds also exist but here they are basically the only ways to (consistantly) win. If you don't abide by such a strategy, then at best you'll handicap yourself, and at worst be straight-up unable to win. Rushing and hyper-aggression are examples of practically being a must here. The balance, as well as superweapons and abilities, all make it feel like we're being heavily discouraged to enter the late game and build large armies. All this leaves most late game strategies underpowered and not really viable.

Then there's the AI, which just [i]blatantly[/i] cheats. They'll have more resources than you, they'll know where you are and what you're doing at all times, and they'll have no issue using all this as well as their near-instantaneous reaction speed against anything you do.

Last but not least, some rapid-fire flaws. Online play doesn't work anymore, fps is locked at 30, the game's price has doubled for no reason, and the game is also way too micro-focused. Not to mention how most effects in this game (explosions, death effects) barely sound fitting and lack any feeling of impact.",1642270144,1695647209,False,3,0,0.484662562608718872,0,True,False,False

RA3 (2008) was developed and published by EA, who would release the historically disastrous C&C4, marking a sudden and sharp end to the franchise. While EA has never had a positive reputation among the PC gaming crowd, particularly those who enjoy RTS games, anti-EA sentiment was exceptional during this period. Two years later, the company would win Consumerist‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Company in America‚Äù award twice in 2012 and 2013, and bashing EA was a popular internet past-time.

In retrospect, the complaints levelled at EA for their handling of the C&C franchise are more complicated. While C&C4 was a tragic end to the franchise and deserving of intense criticism, it did reflect the shifting tastes of mainstream consumers. Its focus on micro-management predicted the rise of the MOBA genre, with titles such as League of Legends (2009) and Dota 2 2013) later coming to define the genre from 2013 onwards. Red Alert 3‚Äôs biggest failure is being situated too closely to the fall of the traditional base-building genre, and its proximity to C&C4.

Contrary to popular belief, EA‚Äôs involvement in C&C wasn‚Äôt wholly negative. In fact, production values skyrocketed and the series‚Äô low-budget FMV cutscenes now featured cutting-edge CGI and star-studded celebrity castings. C&C3: Tiberium Wars, for instance, featured actors from Star Wars and Top Gun. Red Alert 3 continued this streak, featuring Star Trek actor George Takei, Rocky Horror Picture Show‚Äôs Tim Curry (who delivers his most iconic performance in gaming), and even David Hasselhoff.

Visually, Red Alert 3 was also impressive. To this day, it features perhaps the best water effects you‚Äôll see in an RTS game, which is emphasised by the game‚Äôs focus on naval and amphibious combat. In an effort to be the most attractive game on the market, RA3 also features a heavy dosage of late 2000s glamour models, intending to reference the pin-up models of WW2 and Vietnam. Although a slightly blunt and crass approach, it did spearhead the game‚Äôs marketing efforts through posters, desktop backgrounds and additional merchandising.

Cutting through the glitz and glamour, Red Alert 3 still holds true to the C&C formula. There‚Äôs an excellent blend of rock-paper-scissors combat, and knowledge of the battlefield and units will rightfully bring the most knowledgeable player to the top of the leaderboards. There are two main changes in RA3, the first being an additional focus on units‚Äô secondary abilities. Every unit in the game has an alternative power that can completely change the unit‚Äôs tactical use; attack dogs can stun groups of infantry with an AOE bark, Tesla Troopers can create disruption fields to halt incoming units, and Japanese aircraft can transform into ground mechs to dodge anti-air fire.

While this renewed focus on micro creates significant depth, potentially even an overwhelming amount, I‚Äôm less keen on RA3‚Äôs economic changes. In previous titles (excluding Generals), resources were harvested from large, sprawling Tiberium or Ore fields. These fields were situated in hotspots in the map, and led to intense encounters as enemies would often circle your resource fields in an attempt to pick off your harvesters and disrupt your economy. These fields would often have tactical implications as Tiberium would poison infantry, or could even be detonated as part of a chain reaction in C&C3. In Red Alert 3, resources are gathered directly from small mining outposts a few tiles large, where harvesters go directly back and forth in a very short line to pick up and drop off resources.

In function, this economic system plays much more like Dawn of War 1‚Äôs strategic points rather than C&C. On the one side, it encourages players to push forward to capture key points in the map to gain resources to ultimately win the game. However, the predictive and repetitive nature of resource gathering removes much of the game‚Äôs tension. In previous C&C titles, resource fields could creep near enemy bases or transport lines, creating tension as your harvesters edged closer towards the boundaries of available resources. Now, it‚Äôs oversimplified into a back-and-forth transaction at a singular point of contact. You‚Äôre unable to practically recruit multiple resource gathers to harvest at once, and harvester harassment is much less of a threat.

Overall, Red Alert 3 is a worthy entry in the C&C franchise. While people are hot and cold towards the game‚Äôs stylistic choices, bearing a more cartoonish and goofy approach, the series‚Äô classic gameplay mostly remains. It‚Äôs inevitably drawn into the vitriol of EA‚Äôs management, for both fair and unfair reasons, but it‚Äôs worthwhile to be open-minded and give it a shot. It might not be many people‚Äôs favourite title in the franchise, but it may be a fantastic jumping off point for new players or a refreshing change of pace for veteran C&C fans.",1693738413,1693738413,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only thing that hasn't aged are the brilliantly acted cinematics, but then again with legends like David Hasselhoff, Jonathan Pryce and JK Simmons that's not really a surprise.

That being said, I'd rather watch them all on YouTube then sit through the entire game. The gameplay really hasn't aged well and compared to Starcraft 2 (which was released only 2 years later) it's really slow and clunky. Unit pathing is just bad, units get stuck on parts of the terrain and block other units, which means babysitting and micro managing as some units are pretty much twoshotted by their counterpart.

in the end, I made it to the second mission and just couldn't be bothered. I finished this game 15 years ago and had a good time but replaying this in 2023 just isn't worth the frustration.

Also, it's been 15 years since we had another REAL Command and Conquer game. That's some sad shit.

[b] The Negatives [/b]

Don't be fooled by the simplicity of Red Alert 3, everything about this game is just a downgrade from what Red Alert series has established before. 

1) You don't have sub-factions, which was the main reason why Red Alert series set apart from Tiberium series. 

Red Alert series had sub-factions like France, Germany and etc. with unique units. But due to engine limitations, and somewhat.. they had to make compromises. But funny thing is, the Sub-fractions are possible with mods like GenEvo.

2) Red Alert 3 doesn't have Gems. In previous Red Alert games, Ore is main resource, while Gems are the secondary resource which helps double the amount, but somehow the developer removed it for competitive play.

Doesn't matter if they have tried to explained it in the lore, story or interviews. This shouldn't be the reason why the iconic secondary resource should be removed.

3) Nerfed Economy, this is not your typical C&C game where you can just chill and build a medium to large size armies. 

The economy amount you get for harvesting in Singleplayer and Multiplayer is very small. You can only build 1 unit at a time, and 1 barracks and 1 war factory. If you try to build 2 barracks or 2 war factory.. don't be surprised if the eco you have is empty.

4) You're forced to build as quick as possible and you have to keep your remaining units alive for the entire game. 

For example, if you lose 3 tanks, it's game over for you. Unlike in C&C3 you can still recover even if you lose 3 tanks. Again, tied to the economy, but also the units deal less damage.

5) The Campaign is not worth your time, in the campaign mode your economy is shared with your ally, which means if you play solo the AI will never stop spamming armies until your eco is dried. 

Story-wise is not the great, the way they explain why they have to reboot the entire Red Alert series and deleting the Red Alert 2 universe with Yuri's timeline is ridiculous.

6) Commander abilities, in Generals, you gain point abilities for the amount of damage your units dealt, but not in Red Alert 3, In RA3, even if you do nothing, you still gain points.

7) Multiplayer is not easy to get into, if you're very new to this, make sure you understand the basic ""Red Alert 3 Build Order"", unit damage and abilities for each faction before jumping into Multiplayer.

Is like StarCraft 2 but harder, where on day 1 of 1v1 Multiplayer PvP, you've prepared to counter the player's attacks.

[h1] However there are some positives I can say about Red Alert 3 [/h1]

[b] The Positives [/b]

1) The simplified resource gathering is interesting.. by concept. But sadly, it fails to satisfy solo and non-competitive players. Again the amount of resource you get is very small, GenEvo on the other hand solved this issue by increasing the amount of resource you'll get.

2) I understand the game's design focus is towards competitive, but, somehow i feel like, Red Alert 3 has a bit of Real-Time Tactics elements to it, where you can't just sacrifice too many units or even a level 1 veteran unit. (Which kinda explains why they decided to go with RTT route with C&C4).

3) I kinda appreciate that they brought back the grid-like base building that was in classic C&C games, but there is however the same problem that most 3D/HD C&C have, that is the uneven terrain that you can't build.

Most maps are very small if you look at.

4) The Campaign however as stated above, is painful to play, but you'll still have to get through it in order to understand the game's mechanics.

Thank you for reading this far. If you're still looking forward to buy, or play GenEvo, just wait for a sale.",1685032458,1692257404,False,4,0,0.490911602973937988,0,True,False,False

This game had so much potential, but yet again EA destroyed yet another game series.  Red Alert 3 had so much potential, but they just had to bring back the stupid time machine into the series.  Seriously, it was only needed the first time in order to get the universe started.  It was not needed after that.  Seriously, I came up with a better story plot within 5 minutes, and yet it somehow took years to make this game. . . This game was a major step backwards in the realm of gaming.  Red Alert 2 had better graphics and play style.  

Game positives: 
#1. Large numbers of unique and innovative units and diverse tech trees.  

#2.  This game also added the ability to build aquatic bases, which definitely adds a whole new level of tactical options.  

#4. The opportunity to play each and every mission with a friend is also a plus.  

#5. Computer players giving you static is also a fun feature.

Game negatives: 

#1. Horrible game graphics.  To tell you how bad this game's graphics were when the game came out, games a decade older had better graphics than this game.  

#2. Boring and weird campaigns.  It looks like they put the story making team on hallucinogenic mushrooms before they started coming up with story ideas for these missions.  The poor map makers had to make the best of what they were handed.  This game's campaigns are only good playing twice, once by yourself and once with a friend, if you can even find a friend to play this game with.  Even then, it is obvious that the campaigns were designed for multiplayer.  It is not that fun playing it if you are by yourself.  

#3. The computer players also cheat like no tomorrow.  Yes, I know that a lot of poor sports say that, but in this case it is rather obvious.  The computer players are able to see and target your units and structures with super weapons and support powers with such accuracy that their human counterparts can not even come close to copying short of the fog of war not existing.  Older Command and Conquer games can at least have the computer players simulate the fact that the fog of war was there.  These ones cannot no matter the difficulty level you have the computer players set to.  Also, the computer players actively are able to toggle between attack modes/secondary powers with all of their units in a ridiculously fast fashion that human players cannot even come close to copying even with using hotkeys.  Think losing an entire air force and navy within one minute because the computer player's forces are able to toggle that fast between targeting ground based and air based assets.  It literally sucked all of the fun that was in the game out of the game. 

#4. On top of that, the skirmish maps suck.  There are also not that many of them.


It is inherently obvious that EA took a ton of short cuts in every single aspect of this game.   It does make me wonder why they even bothered releasing this pathetic excuse for a strategy game.

While improving Red Alert 2‚Äôs systems, 3 manages to actually deliver an enjoyable experience that stands on its two feet.

The game has that old-school, campy, very silly vibe of a game that does not take itself very seriously. It has fleshed out campaigns for each of the factions. it has balance issues, and unfortunately a very annoying amount of micro, but it's just overall a pretty polished, well-run game. If you like RTS games it's a classic.

Really makes me wish EA hadn't thrown it all away with the gigantic pivot-failure that was C&C4. I know there isn't much appetite for RTS these days but imagine where this franchise could have gone if it wasn't league-ified. Red Alert 4 would've been something I'm sure we all loved, maybe with some sort of 4th faction---like China?

Not as good as RA2.  Soviets did more time travel and wiped out Einstein, which means they assumedly had made a time machine separately to Einstein.

RA3BattleNet not only provides multiplayer skirmish but also provides online cooperation service! It overhauls EA's native online mode and allows players to experience what it was like back in the day! Auto matching, ladder, cooperation, and even the game UI is updated!

When you select a group of units and tell them to go to point A, half of them will slowly go towards the point, while the other half will get lost and probably die because they ran into enemy static defense. That's assuming they move at all, of course. Many times I would select units, tell them to move to a place, and they would stand completely still. Other times I order a group of units to attack the turret that is slowly killing them, and they sit around for about 20 seconds, allowing the turret to kill 3 more tanks, before they actually start firing. And not all of them fire! I played a campaign game yesterday, and my ally won the game. While they were busy doing that, I was trying to figure out why my army wasn't moving.

I understand that this game is old. I understand that we didn't have the pathing technology that we do now. But this game is just really infuriating to play.

17480,123919263,76561198138812610,0,6,3322,0,2289,1686328348,"Although not the best C&C game and not as enjoyable as Red Alert 2, still an amazing and very underrated RTS game.

I believe it's very normal that this game not as enjoyable as Red Alert 2. In this game EA improved in-game graphics and tried different game formula/design. But it really doesn't matter because the game is still quite enjoyable.

Co-commander system is very good. If you have a friend that plays this game (probably no one) you can play together. I don't have any friend, but the co-commander's AI is suprisingly good and with my co-commander, I have never felt alone in any mission. It's really enjoyable.

Cutscenes are well done, mostly entertaining. Story didn't change so much but what have you expected it's an RTS game :D

Each of the 3 factions (Soviet, Allied, Empire) is fairly unique. Each of them has their own playstyle.

The soundtracks of Red Alert series have always been good and in this game, although I know literally nothing about music, I can say that the soundtracks are incredible! (For example, take a look at ""[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSepa672f0s]Rock and Awe[/url]"" which is an in-game soundtrack for Allied faction, it is stunning!)

This game is fixed at 30 FPS. Of course if it was 60 FPS, it would be better. But the game doesn't come to eyes jaggy. Maybe it effects the VFX's, but it doesn't make sense at all.

Gameplay comes slower than Red Alert 2 but I think it's very normal. Because they improved the graphics, added special ability to every unit and made the game more tactical. These things decreased the gameplay speed. For instance, In Red Alert 2 you need to train 50 GI for a purpose, but in this game 20 Peacekeeper will enough for that. Every peackeeper have special ability (shield) and their graphics are much more detailed. For these reasons game become more tactical and slower than RA2. We have much smaller but effective, tactical armies in this game. We feel the weight of the units.
The game was designed in this way. I think if they hadn't tried new things and changed the game formula, they would still be criticized. I understand that people expected something as enjoyable as RA2, but it was clear that this was not going to happen. RA2 was a revolutionary game.

They changed the ore refinery system. RA2's ore refinery system was more enjoyable. I've watched a video on youtube and the creator said they changed them because some of the game design reasons (the video: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQX1VOoBtDA]An Analysis of Red Alert 3's Economy System[/url]). Nevertheless, this ore refinery system feels empty. You intuitively understand something wrong if you have played RA2 before.

I feel like sometimes these games repeat themselves a lot, but I don't know how could they solve this. If I'm not restricted, almost every game I try the same unit formula. They have fairly balanced this game, but I think some of the units are clearly more powerful (I'm saying this for campaign missions). Kirovs in Soviet, Century Bombers in Allied and Rocket Angles in Empire. It is not that easy, but if you mass produce these units, most of the time you win easier.",1665920127,1674745517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
- fire soundtrack
- funny cut scenes
- enjoyable unit abilities and mechanics

Mixed
- Story line is cliche, though makes for good casual gaming

Cons
- Feels a bit dated
- Campaign missions can feel repetitive. Once you've beaten one faction's campaign you won't see much different in the other faction's campaigns.",1672372299,1672372299,True,4,1,0.548150777816772461,0,True,False,False

If I just bought this unknowing of how the game play then I wouldn't be as optimistic.

[b][Technical Issues][/b]
1) The game won't launch unless I block the connection to EA server via firewall. RIP CO-OP players.

2) Changing resolution crash the game and I have to edit the option.ini in the Appdata/Roaming.

3) Music sometime stop entirely on loading save during gameplay, Not much is lost because they are inferior to C&C standard.

4) Obviously EA has stop caring of updating this game and fixing these issues. 

[b][GamePlay&Story][/b]
1) 3 Factions with different way of construction is not original but nice. 

2) Story is short and jumpy with not much emotional connection.
-Einstein is dead, So why are there prism tower, mirage tank, iron curtain, and ffs the chronosphere!? even before the doctor defect.
-Apparently Soviet put their entire army on cuba as the next mission is their last stand.
-Apparently Allied send their entire army to negotiation as the next missio- wait, I already made this point.
-Nonsense plot on why premier decide to murder me, Like for what benefit?
-Soviet moral is as hard as a stone....
-The whole story is basically a stereotype of america/russia/japan 
-No intrigue like yuri in RA2 or Kane in RA1. 
-Feel like it was created to fill the void with no justification for sequel.

3) Most of the mission are pretty easy with a few difficult one.
-AI partner made the game very easy.
-Soviet campaign is by far the easiest. I was able to finish them first try even when my AI partner is dead.
-Cryocopter is a hell spawn, I hate it when I play japan's campaign.
-Japan have arguably the most of the difficulty spikes.
-The Allied's final japan mission is quite confusing one.
-Japan's final took a few tries because I didn't split my base up, But can be finished with ~6 Rocket Angels and AI.
-Allied doesn't have low-tier air transport is basically the entire difficulty of the 'Kill president' mission. Thanks cryocopter, Unironically.
-I hate abilities pretty sure I didn't use 60% of them.
-I dislike the artstyle.

I gave this game 'Positive' because I knew what I getting myself into. And it is a pretty decent game. But still disappointed as I am RA fan.",1672231929,1672232158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Soviet campaign has the strongest gameplay since the units you get each mission build nicely on one another and you don't really need all your cool units to make the dream work, you can just smash the enemy. It also has probably the weakest story.

The Allies are both a little mediocre to play, their missions frequently revolve around 'commando' work instead of RTS gameplay, and while they're not terribly boring they are a little dull. Overall, they play the most like C&C Generals and not a Red Alert faction. Their story is terribly dull.

The Japanese is at times fun to play and they have some good missions but the main issue is they aren't particularly fun to play as, and their missions can be more frustrating than anything else in the entire game, including the expansion, because there are times when it feels like you just have no idea what the game expects you to do in answer, and there's no hints forthcoming. Their story is probably the strongest however, because there are actual characters in it, George Takei in his like three minutes of screentime and assorted transmission clips puts on a sterling performance as you would expect of a career professional. It's small but the relationship he has with his son is compelling in the few brief moments you see it. In short, there was an attempt.

So disregarding online for this game in particular because it's long since dead thanks to Gamespy's demise and Uprising has no multiplayer whatsoever, I'm not going to pretend I spent a lot of time in skirmish in this game either, mostly because while all three factions are serviceable enough, they're not an incredible amount of fun to play and you never really get much joy out of any of them. The only draw is the campaign.

For new players, this is a perfectly good RTS to play through if you just want to try and play an RTS that will occupy your time well enough without any glaring flaws or problems.

For veteran C&C fans, this is not a Red Alert or Red Alert 2 sequel really because it completely resets the timeline for the sake of its own canon, sort of making the whole affair of calling it Red Alert somewhat pointless, especially because in this case the gameplay is much closer (possibly thanks to the engine) to C&C Generals, which is a perfectly good game, but I suggest you temper your expectations.

To reiterate and form a synopsis of my opinion: Red Alert 3 is perfectly fine but not exceptional. It will entertain you. Get it on the cheap maybe.

Also, it takes like 5 minutes to launch because it's trying to contact a defunct server, it still runs fine. On Linux too!",1497717373,1670327579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game-play is the same: a fast-paced RTS with base-building and lots of themed units, a single player campaign, solo skirmishes and a multiplayer function. Despite the genre, there isn't really any strategy involved here: you spam-build the best units and spam-attack them against the enemy. That's it. No pause button with which to plan your offensives, no nuanced decision-making, no utilising the different strengths and weaknesses of your arsenal.

The graphics are cartoony rather than realistic but they are okay, even today, however, what is incredibly out-dated is the depiction of women which is all rather breast-based and wrapped up in skimpy faux-military workwear. I'm a red-blooded male but even I now find it, well, embarrassing. Further, the scenes with real actors against green screens are all amatuerish without reprieve and you end up watching them with a grin and expecting to see the Brazzers logo flash up on screen. The Tanya 'performance' was the keynote speaker at this conference of cack but even the likeable Tim Curry was made to look bad.

I can recommend this game like CnC Tiberium Wars for every RTS fan out there, because this game has great gameplay a really fun to play campaign and the scenario this game is set in with all those little details where it doesn't really take itself seriously just make it a fun and nice to play experience.

This game like many other CnC games also have Mods made by the great Community and they also managed to get the Online mode to run again thanks to the guys from CnC Online.

The one Mod that i absolutely love and cant stop to play it the total conversion mod named GeneralsEvo this mod turns Red Alert 3 into the beloved Command Conquer Generals with major graphical improvements and some little extras that the community wished for, if you have Red Alert 3 i recommend you to try General Evo out its really a great mod for a great game.

In the end the only negative thing is like i said in my CnC Tiberium Wars review the behavior of EA with the CnC franchise, its just sad to see that they killed it off like that.

One of the best things tho, is the soundtrack. My god, the OST for this game is truly amazing!

I'm sure it's a decent game but in its current state, I find it unplayable. The fps can be unlocked but it will break the game, animations are going to be be wonky and sped up because the devs built the engine of the game with 30fps in mind and the only mod that allows you to play at 60fps with no issues is locked behind a patreon subscription paywall (so thanks, but no thanks). 


Will revisit and leave positive feedback when it will be possible to play at variable refresh rates.

The gameplay is not up to par with modern RTS standards and in some cases almost unplayable, You cant shift+click to add a single unit to a group, you cant multi select units holding down shift, you cant customize your keys as you want and the control is very limited, you cant number buildings or select multiples and many many many other gripes in gameplay and control.
The campaign is also extremely overtuned and in some missions even impossible to do on normal difficulty. RA2 has a special place in all old school RTS players‚Äô hearts, RA3 only satisfies 10% of the nostalgia and the love we had for the older game.
TLDR;
Pros:
- Nice graphics
- Good Music
- Funny Cutscenes with an insanely high-profile cast
Cons:
- Boring gameplay
- Extremely poor controls

It takes real skill and care to make a performance look so carefree. To overact while still giving maintaining your composure is something a lot of actors don't know how to do well, but by golly he does it effortlessly. What a champ. His cutscenes in Red Alert 3 are the absolute highlights of the¬†campaign and his¬†involvement is absolutely what sold the game.¬†

That being said, I don't think Red Alert 3 (RA3) is a good¬†game.¬†When I press the ""don't recommend""-button it's mostly because it's a very binary choice. Usually this is because a neutral option wasn't possible, but with RA3 I have no qualms in not recommending it.

A few positive comments and asides first.

The briefing videos, as stated before, are the highlight of the game. They are brought with such panache and confidence that I couldn't help but smile all the way through. While it has a comedic tone, in its own twisted way the comedy is taken quite seriously. Every faction's (Soviets, Allies, Japanese) culture and stereotypes are taken to a ludicrous extreme and always stay that way. It's very consistent in that sense, which I really appreciated. It's taken to such a cartoony extreme that it's impossible to call it racist - how can you be racist if you laugh at everyone at¬†the same time?¬†

The cartoony look of the game has been heavily debated. I think it fits very well with the tone set by the cutscenes and the developers choosing this style isn't that much of a stretch considering Red Alert 2 was also very campy. People like to pretend RA2 isn't that campy but in that¬†game you have giant squids, time warping commando's and a man who can literally control people's minds. Everyone loved RA2, so RA3's direction is just a logical step to take. RA3 does has a brighter color scheme than RA2 and an amount of bloom that made me want to barf at times.¬†

Only the very first Red Alert was taken pretty seriously. It was World War II with mild fantasy elements. RA1's Soviet campaign literally opens with Stalin overseeing the effects of innocent civilians inhaling toxic gas.

What I'm more concerned about are the game's visuals. Video games, just like a board game (especially when we're talking about RTS games) need to be crisp, uncluttered, and visually readable. In a fraction of a second, you need to be able to tell exactly what's happening on the screen. That being said, I can conclude that RA3 is one of the least readable RTS games I've played. It's gorgeous for sure, especially for the time, but when the biggest challenge in this game is finding my mouse cursor, something has gone wrong.

Half the time I don't even know what I'm looking at, especially during combat. Everything is such a clash of colors and gunfire and particle effects that I'm not even sure what the hell I'm doing. Placing a completed structure is a puzzle all on its own, often I'll be obstructed from putting it where I want and I'll have no idea why, which wastes valuable time.¬†

Units blend in very easily with the environment, which is what the older titles avoided by virtue of having simple graphics. I've found that the only solution to this problem is to lower all of the graphics - with the exception of texture quality - to their lowest setting. But then this obviously makes it feel like you're playing an unfinished game. It's clean, but also hideous.

RA3 lacks the satisfying, ferocious combat of its predecessors. All units with the exception of end-game units feel really weak and you will spend a silly amount of time building a carefully¬†balanced army of 50 units only for them to be destroyed in half a minute when attacking a base. 

The player is much better served turtling up and building a comical amount of airbases, as air units are far more useful in nearly all situations. Trying to find your favorite units in this game is like trying to find your favorite sheet of paper in a stack of papers. This kills all creativity and makes all campaigns feel like a tedious slog of building your defenses and slowly but surely build all your units. Making money in this game is so slow you'd think your ore collectors have clinical depression. 

The pathfinding engine in this game is unfinished. Units either blatantly don't follow orders, try to move through high terrain, get stuck on terrain or form a neat little row like children getting ready for school when given a move command, providing the enemy with easy targets. This doesn't always happen but it happens way too often.

RA3 is also chock full of triggers. Not the Twitter kind, but events that happen when the player completes an objective. Sometimes stuff will happen where the player can only respond appropriately when he already knows what will happen. In other words: trial and error.¬†

The AI is a cheating SOB that can spawn reinforcements out of nowhere to completely turn the tables, and not in a clever way.¬†
- In the second mission of the game you need to kill an end-game level unit who wipes out whole armies in the blink of an eye.
- You'll need to quickly destroy a unit that can only be killed by anti-air units, and if you don't have any, you're SOL.¬†
- In some missions you need to use an unexplained ability to win. You don't know how or where to get it, and I had to look up a guide to figure out how to get it.
- Or you get a tiny portion of the field map, and suddenly it opens up to reveal more enemy bases elsewhere. RA3 does this a lot, and it annoyed me every time.¬†

You're not really encouraged to go out and have fun in this game. The difficulty of missions is like a patient's heart monitor in that it consistently flies up and down. It never feels like a fair fight: the AI always has way more money and options than you.

The tone is way lighter and more comedic than Tiberium Wars, but overall, it's the same game, just a different theme and story. As mentioned before, what makes it stand out is the co-op feature. I'm not sure why more RTS games don't provide this feature for their campaigns, but I suppose they have reason. It's what makes this experience very unique in comparison to other RTS games.

I've played and replayed this game with a buddy of mine for years now, and we'll probably be doing it again in the future.

There isn't that much going for the story. The gist of it is a time machine has altered history. Nukes were removed and Japan wasn't bombed by A-bombs, thus allowing them to thrive and become the new faction of the game called the Rising Sun. You still have your standard Allieds and Soviets and their unique styles of playing.

Like C&C3, the 30 fps can take some time getting used to, especially if you've been spoiled by higher fps like I have, but you'll get used to it. The game isn't too difficult, but there are some moments that can catch you off guard.

Definitely grab this game if you enjoy base building and ordering troops around. The different types of units all have their own special abilities which allow for more tactical gameplay.

There are a few things to point out however:

For some reason they decided to reverse the mouse controls where you have to left click to select something but right click to move it which can be confusing when most similar games like Red Alert 2 use the left click to do both these actions. Thankfully you can change the control scheme for the mouse in the options menu so that it works the same as in Red Alert 2. Just make sure to do this before adapting to the default scheme.

It's so campy, all over the place, a cast of actually great actors and super models with passable to poor acting, and every faction and unit is a stereotype. But at the same time, it's so endearing and charming. There is not a single character I dislike. Heck, the units for this game have some really good voice acting, and I never get tired of hearing them. The game play is also really fun, and every unit is interesting to use. Though I prefer the macro game play of tiberium wars and kane's wrath more, I still find the micro heavy game play very fun. The game play is very unbalanced though. It's a very rush or get rushed, and several units are a lot stronger than others (looking at you cryo copters). Despite this though, I love this game. It reminded me why I loved rts games so much as a kid, and it reignited that love now. Also, the soundtrack is banging.

It's probably one of the best RTS games ever produced and one of the best games in history. For some strange reasons it was criticized upon release by some old fans of the series. But this was done just because those people grew up on Red Alert 2, another masterpiece which was made by old Westwood Studios, and so they wanted for Red Alert 3 to be more like the previous game. But Red Alert 3 was produced by EA Los Angeles, it was different time and not the 90s anymore, a different developer team. Because of this Red Alert 3 has its own face and I grew up on this game and really loved playing it. Besides, now in 2020s when I am writing this review, we know that RTS genre is almost dead and games of such scale like Red Alert 3, which wasn't ideal for someone back in 2000s, is something which completely impossible to be made today. EA Los Angeles had a lot of dedication to create interesting and modern RTS gameplay and they invited awesome, just amazing cast for playing all the roles. I actually think its the best cast in CnC history, just look at all these names - J. K. Simmons, Tim Curry, George Takei, Peter Stormare!.. Not to mention incredible and super hot female actresses and models - Gemma Atkinson, Gina Carano, Jenny McCarthy, Vanessa Branch, Autumn Reeser, Kelly Hu!.. Oh man, I had such incredible teen years thanks to it! So, it's just difficult to speak about this game any further without praising it so much. And with so many good words already spoken and I didn't even mention it's super amazing soundtrack! Legendary Frank Klepacki along with also some other talented artists once again wrote original tracks for the soundtrack which are so great that I listen to them for more than a decade already!.. So, I want to make it clear that this is one hell of RTS experience and one hell of a game and yes, it's sad that CnC series have gone, but I'm very thankful to EA Los Angeles for what they created.

RA3 is a really solid game, with lots of options including naval/land/aero combat.

Single player is fun and can become challenging even at normal difficulty because of how many things they throw at you and you always have the AI partner which may or may not respond well.
The down side is the single player campaign is simply like an introduction to the game play and units, while the AI skirmish is quite easy.

And that is made worse because in order to play the multiplayer, you need to go through many loops and I doubt many players are left in my area to have any reasonable ping.

That being said, the game has great cast, great music, fun and interesting mechanics.

- And the most important thing is the cooperative, not only in normal battles, but also the passage of the story with a friend, who was missing in the second part, it's a pleasure to pass with friends

[b]Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3[/b] is the first entry in the [b]Red Alert[/b] series made by a different studio. In the previous expansion for [b]Red Alert 2[/b], the series introduced a bit more over the top story and units you control. This entry continues in this legacy and presents a humorous story with real actors, as well as unique and interesting units for each faction.

[h1]Single-player[/h1]
The single-player offers three campaigns for the Soviet Union, the United States of America, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. It takes about 20 hours to complete them all on the highest difficulty setting. There is no restriction, so you can start playing as any nation you want. The great addition is that you can play all three campaigns in a co-op with a friend or random player. You receive an AI partner if you choose to play alone. Other than that, you can play Skirmish against the AI on several maps.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2155298139
[h3]Story[/h3]
The Soviet Union is almost at its downfall, and only last hope remains. The Soviet Premier manages to travel in time, kills [i]Albert Einstein[/i], and returns. Without [i]Einstein[/i], the western Allies have never gotten an advantage over the Soviets. However, the happiness of the Soviet leadership will not last long, as the new threat from the East emerges. [i]The Empire of the Rising Sun[/i] (Japan) simultaneously invades both Americans and the Soviets. Without [i]Einstein‚Äôs[/i] scientific research, Japan was never bombed with nuclear weapons, as those do not exist anymore. All three factions are now in a war with everyone, and it is up to you, which one will you lead to a victory.
[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
The gameplay‚Äôs core is the same for every faction. You collect golden ore from mines which serve as money and build powerplants to keep the power going in your base. Without electricity power, most of your buildings stop working, especially the turrets for your defense. The great addition is that you can build almost every building both on the ground and on water. This allows for more diverse base-building than in previous games. You expand and build new bases anywhere you want, but the ore mines placement is always the same.

The base building is almost the same for every faction, as you always need to build powerplants, barracks, dockyards, defensive turrets, and more. They have a few noticeable gameplay differences, but you will not be completely lost when you will start playing as another nation. The main differences come with the units. There are always anti-infantry, anti-vehicle, and anti-air units. The game has four different unit branches: infantry, ground vehicles, ships, and aircraft. They all differ in each faction, and every single one has two abilities. For example, [i]Soviet Conscript[/i] has an assault rifle and an ability to throw Molotov‚Äôs cocktails. The [i]American Peacekeeper[/i] has armour, short-range shotgun, and can equip a shield. Lastly, the [i]Imperial Warrior[/i] has a rifle and sword, which increases his overall speed. The same goes for all the units in the game. Every nation has something that counters the other‚Äôs units and abilities. Nations also differ with their unique ability tree. While the Soviets can throw satellites on their foes, Americans can freeze them, and the Japanese can send their kamikaze squadrons.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2155296739
Unfortunately, the AI is not the brightest, as it is very scripted in the campaign. It does very rarely something on its own, and once you manage to damage their income or destroy their recruitment buildings, you won. In most cases, the AI will not try to repair their buildings or even build new ones. It does not even try to counter your units, so you can easily spam them with one unit type if you manage to hit them quickly and precisely. The AI is a bit better in the Skirmish, as it is trying to do something, but do not expect an enormous challenge, as you will not find it there.

Another negative is that some campaign missions, especially the ones where you mostly control just heroes, are tiresome. The strength in this game is to build what you want, and that is gone when you are restricted to play with just one or a few units.

[h1]Multi-player[/h1]
The official servers are down, but the option to play [b]Red Alert 3[/b] online, as well as other [b]Command & Conquer[/b] games is still there.

[url=https://cnc-online.net/en/][quote]All you need to do to play [b]Command & Conquer[/b] games online is to go to [b]cnc-online[/b], register yourself, download a launcher, and follow the instructions.[/quote][/url]

The multi-player offers the aforementioned Skirmish maps against real players. There are various maps from 1v1 up to 3v3. Playing against players is definitely a better option, as you have to use accordingly faction‚Äôs units and abilities. Everything else works the same as in the single-player.

[h1]Audiovisuals[/h1]
The game‚Äôs art style is something that I really adore, as it is quite unique and colourful. All three factions are very diverse with their distinctive appearance. You can easily recognize every unit by their looks and can exactly expect what they can do. Some of the visual effects look great for a game from 2008, and that especially applies to some visual effects and water.

However, [b]Command & Conquer[/b] series was always known for presenting real actors in its cutscenes. The Soviet premier is played by famous [i]Tim Curry[/i], who wants to spread Communism to the whole world and Space. Against him stands anti-communists presidents of the United States, portrayed by [i]J.K. Simmons[/i], and they are all invaded by the Japanese Emperor, played by [i]George Takei[/i]. There are, of course, way more actors and actresses, and from some from cutscenes, you can clearly see that they are trying to hold their laugh. When talking about actors, one must mention quotes of the units, as every unit has their quotes depending on the situation they are currently in. Sometimes they are really hilarious or cheesy.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2155296869
The sound effects of all the weaponry, machinery, and explosions are just great, but what really stands out is the soundtrack, which is a mix of several genres, mostly industrial metal with presented vocals. The third version of [i]Hell March[/i] is present. Every faction has their own compositions, and when you are in the middle of a chaotic battle, it all clicks together.

[h1] Performance[/h1]
The game was tested with an [b]i5 8300H, GTX 1060 6GB, and 16GB RAM[/b] running at the highest settings at [b]30[/b] frames per second, at [b]1920x1080[/b] resolution. The game is [b]locked[/b] on [b]30 FPS[/b]. If you try to unlock the framerate to 60 or more FPS, the game‚Äôs speed will increase, and most of the animations will disappear.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you accept the game for what it is, that means a light-hearted fun with unique design rather than a competitive real-time strategy game, then it presents a fair amount of entertainment. Playing all three campaigns in co-op makes it for a better experience. However, the 30 frames per second cap and other aforementioned shortcomings can definitely be a problem for many.

Within three or four minutes of starting a skirmish, you will be attacked from every angle by a constant stream of AI units. It has more money than it possibly could gather in any given time, it sees through the fog of war, and I'm fairly sure it builds faster than human players can. It will spam you incessantly until you're incapable of fighting it, or until you find the single trick that lets you beat that AI or that level. You can't surprise it, you can't beat it by guile or subtlety; you can only win by finding whatever very specific sequence of actions allows you to anticipate and out-spam the AI. By contrast, your own AI units are incredibly stupid; they ignore attacks on themselves or on nearby units unless set to aggressive, at which point they get kited to death. 

No amount of (admittedly hilarious) voice acting or fun individual units compensates for an AI that simply cheats, constantly, to win. Leave games like this in the past where they belong.

At the beginning of the game soviet general travels back in time in order to eliminate Einstein, who‚Äôs responsible for a lot of technical advancements of the West. But in doing so, he creates a new force more powerful than the enemies he sought to destroy. The game offers three campaigns, where you can play as Soviets, Alliance or a new addition to the Red Alert series ‚Äì Empire of The Rising Sun. As far as I can tell the only canon campaign is Alliance, the rest are ‚ÄúWhat If?‚Äù scenarios. Each story is pretty much what you‚Äôd expect from a strategy game, but there‚Äôs something special in the way it is told through full-motion video cutscenes and actors are doing their best to create memorable and charismatic characters.

The gameplay differs depending on the fraction you chose. It‚Äôs not just that units have different looks and balanced a bit differently, they even change such basics as base building. For example, Empire cannot create buildings directly, it creates a vehicle that can be unpacked into a building at any place on the map. Alliance and Soviets use more traditional scheme albeit with a small difference. Each unit has a set of abilities that units in other factions don‚Äôt have. It adds a lot to the variety and it‚Äôs always fun to discover new strategies and counters. In my opinion there‚Äôs only one major drawback to the game ‚Äì bland mission design. Most of the time your objective is to destroy an enemy base with no additional conditions that will make it special. I guess the reason for it is that the game was created with a co-op in mind and the AI partner you get, when playing alone, isn‚Äôt very smart.

Moving on to the visuals, it has the same 30 FPS lock as other C&C games, you can remove it using a fan made mod. The graphics themself look pretty good even by today‚Äôs standard, most of it can be attributed to the cartoonish style, that the developers have chosen. The soundtrack is awesome as is usual for [b]Red Alert[/b] series. The acting in cutscenes is great and this time there are actors, that you can recognize from TV shows and movies.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Gameplay is unique for each of the factions
+ Funny story with charismatic characters
+ Awesome soundtrack

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Bland mission design with almost no variety
- Allies AI feels stupider than enemies'

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre a fan of the series or a newcomer, you will be able to appreciate this game. Just keep in mind, that it‚Äôs probably better not to binge the entire game, because you will probably get bored soon.

Weaponized dolphins, oversimplified mechanics, and a general art style that is borderline comical. While I know the story has always been tongue-in-cheek the original was still more grounded in both visual style and gameplay. And considering it was released AFTER Command & Conquer 3 it's insanely sad how they intentionally scaled back the game design. How this is held in any high regard must be from those who where too young to have known the original when it came out.

Everything from character design to gameplay mechanics are so silly that I can't not think of this being to Red Alert 1 what Duplo is to Lego.

only gripe compared with the PS3 version is that there seems to be less map options on the base game compared to the PS3 version, I remember there being a heck of a lot more skirmish maps to play on the console version. I read somewhere that this was because of the late release on the PS3 so fair enough but still a shame the full variety is not on the base game here.

With that out of the way, let me just remind you of what you're getting into here - everything about this game is over-the-top - the story, the characters, the artstyle, the units, the actresses' cleavage. Basically, a Red Alert game like any other, maybe except for that last part.

There are three factions to choose from, the Allies, the Soviet Union, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. Don't ask. Okay, you just had to, fine. Einstein invented the time machine, erased Hitler from the timeline. Soviets got ballsy and started WWII instead of Nazi Germany which is now nonexistent. Then Allies kicked their asses twice, and at that point they invented a time machine of their own to kill Einstein. ""Wait, that would mean there is Nazi Germany now and-"" No, shut up and go defend your refinery from cryocopters.

Behind the nonsense of a story, there is a jewel of RTS design, hands down. Every unit has a secondary attack, meaning more micro options. There are air, land and sea units (every building except barracks and war factory can be built on water), some can freely switch between two or even all three. Every faction is unique to play down to the way they build their bases, each has something different to offer depending on your preferences and they're overall balanced relative to each other. People might tell you that Allies are the best faction which is kind of true but there was a time when they said the same about Empire so whatever.

You don‚Äôt play CnC for the plot, but it‚Äôs awful in RA3. Admittedly you‚Äôre expected to turn your brain off and enjoy big explosions, but you can‚Äôt do either of those things when you‚Äôre left to wonder just how Japan sneak deploys a floating fortress to the North Sea ‚Äì while the Allies and Soviets are fighting in Europe‚Ä¶  
There‚Äôs being camp and ridiculous, and there‚Äôs just dumb. RA3 starts off wacky, and then rapidly becomes plain stupid. 

To support the plot slobbered out by a studio of deranged man-children is an ensemble cast of talent that is brutally abused and subjected to dialogue that makes porn look artistic. Speaking of porn; each of the three campaigns features a female mission handler to provide fanservice for the intellectual adolescent. All which fall in love with your mute insert due to your masterful ability to manipulate the game‚Äôs broken level design or shift-click your faction‚Äôs broken unit until you win (more on that in a minute). If this is kind of thing that gets your rocks off, then you‚Äôre gonna have your mind blown by what you can see online ‚Äì on some sites they even take their clothes off! Imagine that! Don‚Äôt look while your parents are home though.

Aside from the women, I will admit that there a few enjoyable characters in the game. Watching Tim Curry and JK Simmons delivering their godawful lines while struggling not to laugh provides a little bit of solace in the shitfactory of the campaign. The Russian cast were particularly entertaining. That said, you can just look up these clips on YouTube and save yourself the agony of playing. 

Red Alert 3 is allegedly a Real-Time Strategy Game. It‚Äôs definitely Real Time (as is the time you waste playing it) but calling it strategy is generous at the least. Strategy generally indicates planning, concentration and tactical manoeuvring to outwit your opponent. In Red Alert 3, you simply find your faction‚Äôs broken unit and mash your mouse while the words ‚ÄúINSUFFICIENT FUNDS‚Äù scream in your ear. 

There isn‚Äôt a single memorable voice line, and old favourites like ‚ÄúKirov Reporting‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh speed, low drag‚Äù are butchered by a voice cast seemingly rounded up from the alleys behind the studio. Units are either useless (including 90% of the allied roster) or broken. Most units are destroyed seconds into combat are eye-wateringly expensive to replace. The AI knows this full well and takes savage synthetic delight deploying its limitless resources to flood you with OP units. 

Your camera is annoyingly close to the battlefield, even if you manage to amass a moderate army, you‚Äôll quickly lose control of it and be unable to locate it on the tiny tiny tiny minimap. Units have a habit of simply disappearing ‚Äì probably achieving self-awareness and killing themselves. The units that do remain behind all seem to be trained at the Cuckold‚Äôs Academy of Watching Your Wife Get Fucked as they will do nothing but watch enemy units steamroll your base unchecked (even while on aggressive mode). Speaking of the AI has full map vision where you don‚Äôt and will quickly send a surgical strike on a 45 waypoint plan that perfectly slips through your AA corridor to snipe your resource collectors. This gets old fast.

Speaking of resource collection, I have to take a minute to lambast the most pointless features which are resources and power. To get money you build expensive refineries which have to place in specific designated locations that are literally a foot away from mines, to send a resource collector to traverse the tiny distance. Amazingly, this process takes forever; The average American citizen could haul ore faster. For some reason, this was seen as a preferable option to just having a mine building that collected ore for you.  Then, power. The AI has more power than you from fewer reactors. It exists solely to trip you up when the enemy deploy a fourth-dimensional ambush force that cripples your base defences. You don‚Äôt have enough money as it is, and the game forces you to tediously waste it on useless buildings that may as well be pi√±atas for enemy planes.

There are three campaigns, which I did on the co-op mode because I don‚Äôt quite hate myself enough to do them alone. This required downloading third party content, messing with my windows cmd and sacrificing a three horned ram to appease the corpse of Gamespy. All the campaigns suck. Generally, attacking missions are better than defending missions. Most missions can be exploited ‚Äì assumedly because they couldn‚Äôt find enough the money required to keep play-testers in the room. Once you realise this, mercifully the game gets easier which speeds your passage toward playing another game. Half the difficulty comes from the game placing you in completely absurd positions. An example is an escort mission halfway through the Japanese campaign which literally ‚Äì and I am not exaggerating in the slightest - starts with your escort objective suicide running at the enemy. 

The soviet campaign is the most bearable by a slim margin. Once you unlock airpower the regular missions are a case of waiting for your airfields to churn out enough fliers and then you just cannot lose. It had good moments and some truly fucking awful ones. You do get to listen to the best part of the cast chewing the scenery around you and enjoy some good units. Bizarrely the most interesting one (the terror drone) turns up at the very end. Half the missions are write offs, the others have moments of practically Thatcherite brutality (ironic for the reds) following by whimpering as your kirovs get off the ground.

Then the allies. Fuck the allies. Their unit roster is built around synergy, which is perfect because you have the budget for 4 men and a dog because the rest of is spent building powerplants and researching upgrades. By the time you‚Äôre ready, your base is gone. Plus, you have to listen Jenny ‚ÄúVaccines bad‚Äù McCarthy masquerade as Tanya with insufferable voice acting. The difficulty curve is ridiculous. Building takes for ever. You could raise a child with the time it takes you to build a barracks. And when you‚Äôre finished, your units are still worse than both of the other factions. Special mention as well to the Cuba mission which implies that the United States air force is incapable of stopping a fucking. Blimp. Without your help. It has the worst levels alongside the worst units but it‚Äôs only difficult through sheer incompetent design of both the faction and the levels.

Japan isn‚Äôt quite so bad as the allies. It‚Äôs more memorable ‚Äì because for two levels you get a fucking Gundam, but still puts you in stupid situations. In the last level the game literally deletes your entire base and army and gives you 8 units to finish the game ‚Äúbecause reasons‚Äù. You could lose all the progress you made fighting through the level just to have it snatched away from you. Some levels took forever, whereas others were so laughably exploitable they were over before they began. You can also tell the man-children were creaming themselves when they designed a literal schoolgirl as the Japanese Commander unit. There is allegedly an expansion centred solely around her, so if you‚Äôve yet to lose your virginity that‚Äôs one for you. She also has a line on the game‚Äôs wiki about her underwear which tells you a lot about the calibre of people who enjoyed this title. 

No, I didn‚Äôt play the multiplayer. I don‚Äôt want to imagine that there other thinking, feeling, human beings that willingly spend time on this game. 

In short, Red Alert 3 is a textbook example of the unspeakable desecration wrought by a soulless corporate entity like EA. It was shat out to make money on the Command and Conquer name. I suffered this so that you didn‚Äôt have to. Please, do not make my mistake.

Why?

-Too streamlined (I understand that it's for new players)
-Cartoonishy colourful(to me Ra1 and Ra2 were more in line with this)
-Ore system reworked (I liked ore fields more, like in originals and C&C and Tibsun)
-No Co-Op (Ra2 had co-op campaing)
-Lacks the Red Alert feels to it, feels more than a C&C Generals Ra mod.
-You can't do massive unitspam like in Ra1 and Ra2
-Maps are forgettable. Ra1 and Ra2 are highly memorable.
-Units are forgettable, I don't remember kinda anything that units did. There was a v4 rocket launcer maybe? Opposite to Ra1 and Ra2 units, which I still remember
-No Mammoth tank
-No Rules.ini file
-Kinda lousy gameplay
-Forgettable characters in story

For the average gamer EA / Westwood did not provide enough difficulty options to make for an enjoyable game.
After finally getting this far in RA3, many years after its release, I am starting to see how Westwood phased themselves out by only focusing on a very small demographic whom were playing Beethoven underwater at age 3.

The final stab in the back that wasted fifteen hours of my life was the brain dead A.I. on my side who sit gathered watching the enemy bomb the  **** out of my construction yard or the jackass path finding of larger tanks which preferred to go right through and tear down my defense walls instead of driving a few inches to go around them.

The first being the cartoony art style compared to the rest of the 3d c&c games. Most of the units look like toys versus the more ground in reality world objects (buildings/cars/roads} so they are quite jarring. 2nd problem with the game is its economy. Resources are way too slow in generation even when you have several ore refineries going. Compared to generals and Tiberium wars/KW it takes much longer to generate quick resources. Also hate the fact that there are no resource generating buildings you can build in your base (like generals) so once you are out of ore refineries or oil refineries that's it. Also units are too pricey considering how long they take to build/slow resource generation. 3rd problem I have with the game is the unit durability. Every unit even the Kirov feels like it has the durability of a wet paper towel. Just about everything can be easily destroyed compared to the units in the earlier C&c franchises. If this was not c&c it would be a much more solid RTS comparatively. Still with all its faults Red Alert 3 is Fun and quirky just not a C&c I will go back to often like Generals or Tib wars/KW.,1625381846,1625848445,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

Graphics still stand out rather well, but keep in mind it runs at 30 FPS, but I do not think that's an issue in this genre.

This feels a bit like Starcraft where they decided the three factions would operate through different rules, but all that ends up doing on my part is making me much more comfortable playing the USSR, just because they follow the more traditional building rule set. The other ones require a bit of adjustment, and I do not see any advantage to any of it, except the allies being able to spam buildings from the various centres into one location, and the Japanese having units that switch between types.

[*] The Soviet story wise campaign is alright, unfortunately none of the twists are that great, and are rather obvious. But the overall gameplay of the maps is the most fun and consistent.
[*] The Allied story is the best of them all. It‚Äôs rather fun by twisting and even replaying historical events. However, the campaign maps are the weakest, having even unclear objectives and rules at points.

[*] Finally, the Japanese is a mix of both. The story is fine, and ties rather well with the rest, and is the happy story really.

One of my uncles introduced it to me at an internet caf√© while on holiday, before lending me a CD copy to install on my own computer. I later got a copy for myself, both a PC version and later a PlayStation 3 version before finally getting it here on Steam.

I played through a bunch of the campaigns to see how it hold up to my memories, and I have to say that it holds up great. The acting is very fun and the actors really ham it up sometimes and seems to have a lot of fun filming the scenes.
The three different factions play quite differently, and require different strategies to complete their objectives. Personally, I am a big fan of the Empire of the Rising Sun faction for their ability to place their structures wherever they want to.

The story, as far as I understand it, continues from the second game where the Allied story seems to be the canonical ending. The Russians, in a desperate bid, uses a time machine, travels back in time, and kills Albert Einstein, changing the future. This allows the Japanese Empire of the Rising Sun to take power for themselves in Asia, making a third faction. You play through three different campaigns, controlling the different factions while trying to take over the world.

I remember playing this with my cousins and having a great time with it. Because of these memories, it makes it really sad that you are unable to play online, since the servers are down.

I would still recommend trying this game, and get it on sale if possible.",1622942524,1622942524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The camp live action videos are what really sell the game for me. All the voice actors suit the role of making you feel like a commander; accomplishing objectives for the glory of your faction. 

Where the game falls flat for me is the controls.  

I don't know, maybe I need to watch a tutorial on how to play, but the units were a pain to control. The units  always want to scatter after a move command, rather than clump up. This feels unnatural considering other rts games I played, where units like to gather close as they move forward. Micromanaging these scattered units to consolidate gets tedious and annoying. Control groups aren't really going to help; you are going to have to manage the pathfinding of the units to stick together. The hard rock metal and encouragement from my allies are generally the only things that keep me sane during this painful experience. And it also helps to hear a funny comment from one of my units. 

The other issue is that because certain units are unique, its not always easy to know what the counters are for all the enemy units. You kind of have to experiment in some campaign missions, or look it up on the internet. 

I feel like there should be a tutorial section that lets you learn the hard counters for all the enemy units.
I didn't notice any help menu that would give you quick access to that information either. I've played many rts/tbs games with this kind of help menu feature, when units in a game are unfamiliar and don't have recognizable counters. 

(Yes a flack trooper/javlineer is a hard counter against air, but when you're on a water map where you can't build ground forces, and you load up the ally campaign before the soviets, its not going to be intuitive that you can build static anti-air defenses over water...-_-

Yeah technically its my fault for not completing the Soviet campaign first, but maybe some of us are partial to Ally forces, and others to the Imperial Army. We shouldn't be punished for wanting to play one faction over another. )

Anyway...

If you're looking for a camp ww2 military fantasy game where you beat back time travelling Russians, or a hyper advanced Japanese army controlled by George Takei, then this is an amazing time. Honestly, the cinematics are worth all the pain.

But I'm sorry, I wouldn't be able to tolerate multiplayer for this game. This could just be a result of my lack on knowledge on how to keep units grouped together, but it just seems like a hassle. There are better multiplayer rts games out there. Starcraft and Age of Empires being at the top of the list. Hell, idk if its nostalgia, but I think you would be better of playing RA2 or 1 for multiplayer. 

Controls just feel much better overall in those games.

Still, for the single player experience, I encourage everyone to give this game a chance. Don't get it at full price though, buy it on discount during a steam sale. EA doesn't need your money.

I always thought that the Red Alert spinoff had lots of potential for great story-telling but this game has brought it down to a new low of self-parody. The majority of the budget was spent on hiring ""hot scifi women"" to do the briefings which outright disgusted me.

Worth $5, if only to try out co-op campaign gameplay.

2021 Edit: My original review was overly harsh and neglected to mention the multiple innovations that this game either introduced or was an early-adopter of. This was one of the first command and conquers with top bar abilities and they're quite fun to learn how to use and master. Every unit also has its own innate activateable ability which adds tons of opportunity for micro. Each faction also has a very unique style of building (For example, I really like Japan's mobile construction cores).

Finally, I will say that this game is worth playing solely to see Tim Curry's performance. You can tell that Tim Curry really had fun while filming for this: ""SPAAAAACE!"".",1362012769,1621197231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bad: 30fps(SAGE engine) cap!!!fps tied to gamespeed,no ""official"" multiplayer alive,slight balance issues,obviously no more balance patches(the game got abandoned pretty quickly, it failed at becoming an esport game).Few animations such as trees falling down seem to be sub 30fps.I miss the unit upgrades which tib wars had.I find certain 1 click""free""long coldoown ablities too powerfull such as aoe frezee at lvl 3.

Neutral:
Some ppl can find it TOO cartoony, TOO silly,some ppl might find the women clothing in mission briefing cutsenses as""hot""or ""too revealing"" depending on personal values/tastes.The game is even LESS serious than previous red alert.Economy is simplified compared to last c&c.
The game wanted to be more ""esporty"".Pathfinding is okayish,better than last game but much worse compared to starcraft 2.I think economy and unit count tend to be smaller than in tib wars,and each unit has a ""special"" ability.It is also seem to slightly slower paced than previous c&c,but still kinda fast.

The good:
Graphics still hold up pretty well on max+8xaa,no unit cap,I like the traditional c&c quality cutsenes, intros.The game has npc coop commanders in the campaign,it has ""non official"" BUT active community on cncnet,ypu can play the campaigns with your friend there.Each unit has 1 ability eg.attack air mode or jam enemy weapon mode,and each of them has use,the default controls are Imo much easier compared to last c&c.

The 3 campaigns are kinda good I've completed them in about 20 hours on hard with npc coop commander.The campaings are MUCH more balanced than tib wars as the balance pathces did not screw up the single player.The naval combat is the best in the series,naval base building is viable too.

Overall,in the end I had many good laughs thanks to the campaigns corny cutsenes and I enjoyed the gameplay,wish the game got more support from EA.",1620905210,1620905210,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros - 

Base Building (More like Dawn of War or Starcraft as opposed to Company of Heroes)

CO OP CAMPAIGN - This is by far my favorite part, playing through the story with a friend is great, don't have any? That's fine too, honestly the AI is competent enough to beat medium campaign for you. 

Huge Story mode - Each side has their story told through their own campaign, its either 8-9 missions per team and with 3 each its a nice chunk of play time. 

Dual Unit mode - Each unit has a dual function, for example the terror drones can not only freeze a unit but there main weapon allows them to attack the unit. Allowing you to use one to freeze them while the other kills it unharmed. EVERY unit has  dual mode so you have a lot to work with in your unit composition. 

Cinematic - One thing i felt they always did well on was there live action cinematics, they even have a few big name actors such as George Takei and Tim Curry. The actors really did well making you feel they actually believed in there cause and the outfits were fantastic, really great over all on this part. 

Mixed - 
Cartoony units - If you enjoy the likes of Generals and its more modern appeal this might not be for you, while i personally think its great that i have bears on my team it might not be for every Command & Conquer player. 

Cons - 

Online - While it is realtivly easy to get into the online mode, if you're not very tech savy there may be some hiccups preventing online play at all. While its not needed to play the community is still pretty active so playing with others can be more enjoyable for some but this game is over ten years old. 

Unit Overlap - While the 3 sides do have a wide variety of units to work with some function all to similar or have a secondary that can feel a little lame. Example Migs just head back faster.",1620532555,1620532555,True,2,0,0.529553651809692383,0,True,False,False

It only crashed once while resetting the resolution in the options menu. Just downplay some settings if things get sluggish and restart if it crashes. Seems to work for me anyway.

As for the game itself: pure charm. The actors in the cutscenes, the voices, the designs are just marvelous. On the strategy side it's a little light (although there is a definite tit-for-tat unit balance) but the major focus is satisfying action. Big meaty vehicles, thundering gunfire, scads of troops and tons of explosions. It's just good clean fun all around and challenging if you up the difficulty. The story is great, the soundtrack is one of the best, and the graphics are bright and full of personality.
I liked C&C 4 too but that felt more like an endless war of attrition.

It's not all too serious yet not too funky, the theme works well. OST is remarkable, I mean really damn great.
Even to this day the game looks quite good.
It's a bit sad this game is locked at 30 fps, though it's not very noticeable, the game is quite smooth.
Awesome story-lines, you'd expect nothing less from a Red Alert game.
There are some mods out there that are well made and add a lot to the game though vanilla game is enough for me to have spend hundreds of hours on it (own it on steam, origin and on disc).

There's some replay-ability, campaign is fun to do every now and then and skirmish has many different kinds of ways to play. Multiplayer has been shut off THANKS EA.
Games itself aren't long and boring, it's not fast paced yet definitely not long like Civ games can be.

I will give my opinion on it as someone who is used to playing games with triple digit FPS, as it is definitely noticeable, but not to the point that the game is unplayable. With a still camera, the low FPS is not very obvious and only becomes apparent with fast moving units and the shadows they cast. However, when moving the camera, it becomes very obvious and the visuals become quite difficult to focus on. In addition, moving the mouse feels slow and inaccurate relative to other games, and the trails left behind are quite visible. While it is strange for a PC game (even an older one) to be capped at such a low framerate, I do not think it solely should drive away anyone who is otherwise interested.

Red Alert 3 is as classic as an RTS can get, from a seemingly lost era where the only way to victory was by destroying your opponent's forces. With three differing factions, hectic gameplay, base building, and a plethora of units, structures, and abilities, it checks all the boxes of defining characteristics from the golden age of RTS. A full campaign for each faction provides a variety of challenges and a skirmish mode with numerous maps offers unlimited replayability. Both feature selectable AI difficulty, with that of the former being selected on a per mission basis, allowing the player to take on a more challenging version of a mission without having to play the entire campaign at that difficulty.

Visually, the game holds up very well. Despite being an older title, it still rivals to be one of the most graphically impressive games of the genre. It supports 2560x1440 with no problems and a distinct art style makes running the game at this resolution very satisfying. The cut scenes also look fine at this resolution and it is evident that they were filmed with quality hardware. Yes, filmed, as they are live action cut scenes, something quite unique to the genre.

I will admit that I expected the live action cut scenes to be somewhat cheesy, but I was very wrong. All of the actors and actresses put on a stellar performance and the various sets are well-designed and believable. This extends to the unit voice acting as well, which is very well performed. Even after failing a mission multiple times, I would never skip a cut scene, as I enjoyed re-watching them.

While the FPS cap hinders a game that could otherwise be a flagship of the genre, it is not enough to hold back an otherwise amazing game. I will be honest, if I was aware of the FPS cap before playing this game, I would not have bothered installing it. However, that would have resulted in me missing out on a very enjoyable experience. Would the game be better without the cap? Yes. Would I have rather not played the game at all? Absolutely not.",1618348237,1618348352,True,6,0,0.593315362930297852,0,True,False,False

While the economy breaks away from it's predecessors and other games in the C&C franchise it does do a good job with it in a different way. It is quite fast pace and your units will die pretty fast compared to other RTS games so there is less camping which can be hard for new players even against AI. Although once you learn how to be aggressive and how the gameplay works it becomes a lot easier to play and not having to worry about your economy lets you focus more on your units. Speaking of every unit has it's own unique ability that lets it have more options than just to attack your opponent, this makes the game more micro heavy which is good for some people but bad for others. If you don't like the fast pace gameplay I highly recommend that you play Tiberium Wars / Kane's Wrath instead as that is a lot more of a campy game that can ease you into playing this one.",1616692698,1616692698,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Red Alert 3 is often cheap when it‚Äôs on discount; whether it‚Äôs at a full price or less, this game is well worth the money. The game has a healthy modding community. One of its most anticipated mods has been released. Grab it now and play the mod!

You should also consider patching your RA3 to take advantage of 4GB. The mod mentioned above requires it. Although, the game is still locked to 30FPS. Here‚Äôs the link:

You should also be informed that Red Alert 3‚Äôs servers have been shut down since it relied on GameSpy; however, don‚Äôt fret, online play is still here. After installation, you should install C&C Online from the Revora Creative Network. Get it up and you‚Äôll be able to play with others again.

I am not a big fan of Electronic Arts, but this is before the time they created the terrible C&C Tiberium Twilight and cancelled Generals 2. At the time, they handled Red Alert 3 pretty well and the production was spectacular. The console version was also well handled and very fun.

I‚Äôve played hundreds of hours of Red Alert 3 outside of Steam. While I consider Red Alert 2: Yuri‚Äôs Revenge to be the best Red Alert game. Red Alert 3 is a very good sequel and the Uprising expansion was a very fun campaign. The game‚Äôs scale is much smaller than RA2‚Äôs, but it introduces significant, new mechanics that leads to interesting strategies and tactics. The game introduces something like hero abilities from games like League of Legends or Warcraft 3. The game greatly improved naval combat, which I considered a bit lackluster in the predecessors. The co-op design in the game‚Äôs campaign is awesome and something I wish other RTS games implement. The AI is very competent and the game‚Äôs content is vast. The campaigns are well done and there‚Äôs diversity in the factions. Like most of the C&C games, Red Alert 3 has a healthy modding community that provides further content and fun.

After over 10 years, I did decide to write a review, for in my opinion the worst ever created RTS.
Well while its most commonly known C&C was killed with C&C4TT, the mortal wound was RA3.

RA3 is the equivalent to combine Terminator: Dark Fate, ThunderCats Roar and Star Wars: The Last Jedi
A franchise with quite a serious tone and lore, was turned into something cartoony and silly. 

The game itself starts with basically erasing the C&C timeline entirely, presents grafics/units that look like toys/cartoon instead of grim/dark realistic as it was by game just 1 year earlier. With completely broken balance as new introduced Japan faction simply can build anywhere refineries and wins by simply outnumbering its opponents. 

The game is very generic and does miss quite a lot of C&C features like gamespeed controls, shroud, select music tracks, select how many starting units, technology levels and so on. Very bad camera to zoom out to oversee the battlefield, while units are outlined with a very ugly yellow bright borders if you select them. 

The AI is very bad, while they tried to give it some personality, problem is, it did make AI very predictable as it does use same approach and tactics each match. Unlike AI in the game made just 1 year earlier Tiberium Wars, where it did mix differently units and they did attack from different directions,   RA3 AI is going to attack with exactly same units at same locations.


The only redeeming quality it has, are quite a lot of interesting mods on moddb to check out for the game.
But the base game itself, wasnt a speed bump, but a gravestone for the franchise.",1613219986,1613219986,False,4,2,0.421245217323303223,2,True,False,False

The balanced competitive gameplay, great visuals, unique concepts and wonderful game design that made this one of the top tier RTS games really have me chained to it. Hours of hours of single player and mutiplayer never were a waste of time. From a noob to a pro this game never felt less challenging. The strategies you discover can never be the ultimate method of defeating all enemies. You constantly discover new ways of winning while refreshing the old strategies, and those strategies never grow old even to AI enemies. To compliment the gameplay. A well made and immersive soundtrack was implemented differently to all three factions which dynamically changes through the course of a skirmish.

The tone (style) of this game is often criticized upon for being not serious or ""true to C&C and Red Alert"". In my humble opinion C&C: RA3 was never meant to be a realistic military strategy game. The colorful tone works well with the not so serious story (of Red Alert in general). Due to the tone being more causal compared to other RTSs, the units' and structures' designs are fitting, hilariously charming, and non-generic. All three factions share similarities but one faction never feels the same like the others (due to core gameplay being different). Thus for every factions there are very unique play styles and gameplay experiences. 

I'm writing too much then I ever intended to... If you want an RTS that's fun and challenging then get this game. It's one of the best.

While it's competently put together, and has all the hallmarks you'd expect from a game in the franchise, I think the development team of this game learned all the wrong things from it's predecessors. While the absurd unit designs, goofy voice acting, and live action cutscenes are back in force, they seem cater more to fanservice. The bad kind of fanservice. Softcore porn aside, the game feels very slow, and due to the reimplementation of a map grid system unit movement looks and feels a bit clunky.  Individual unit abilities have been added to the game as well, aping Starcraft in a way that feels slightly off due to the aformentioned slow units. While Red Alert 3 isn't bad per say, it feels like a bad parody of the previous games in its line. My advice: Go back to Red Alert 2.",1612029097,1612029097,False,0,0,0.485611528158187866,0,True,False,False

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I played this game long ago when games were still coming out on CDs!  While I don't have a lot of time on it here on Steam, I did play it a lot.  It's an over the top RTS with a great, hilarious plot and solid gameplay.  It's good for those old school RTS players.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Not much that I can remember.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I played it more than enough when I had it on CD, so I didn't really have a need to play it anymore.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!",1514688204,1612024122,True,1,0,0.51530611515045166,0,True,True,False

Pros:
- Clean, crisp visuals that look great even today (2021). Units and buildings are extremely readable, which is a must and very hard to execute properly in an RTS game.
- Unique factions with unique and varied play styles and themes.
- Solid game mechanics and somewhat balanced gameplay.
- The unit quotes and quips give personality to each unit and add an extra layer of readability to them.
- Absolutely bombastic soundtrack.
- Level design is unique and fun in each campaign mission, plus the multiplayer maps are very well thought out.
- Amphibious units and structures add an extra layer of gameplay and make sea-based warfare far less of an afterthought than in Red Alert 2.

Cons:
- Campaign/Story is short and the cinematics are way too cheesy, the oversexualization of certain female characters stood out a little too much for my taste and kind of turned me off on the story. Most of the characters are also a bit too stereotypical and one-dimensional.
- You need a third party app to play multiplayer and I ran into some issues trying to set it up and getting it to properly launch the game.
- Once you get a hang of it, the AI gets very predictable and easy to defeat.

If you're an RTS player, I highly recommend this game!",1611825312,1611826370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The moment to moment combat is exciting and creative, with all factions having their own twists on familiar gameplay tropes. It's weird to think that RA3 was panned by fans when it came out, considering it does so much well. It keeps base building, but streamlines it. There is ore collecting, but less micro intensive. Superpowers. Navel combat. It's all there!

Ten years later, I'm glad to have played the game and I would recommend it to others who like Real Time Strategy games.

The pathfinding is not working right. You send your units from A to B and the units will follow different routes, units from the same group!(think RA1 but 50% less of that, still anger inducing)
Russian missions have bonus objectives, which are actually bonus objectives.
Allies have bonus objectives that need to be done in order to win the  main objective, which not make them bonus objectives.
Bombing a target with Allied planes and then destroying it, make the leftover planes who did not drop their load, circle the dead target waiting for a command instead of flying back to their base.
Allied missions which mention to build a certain unit available now with Max Clearance upgrade, are still not available after building the Max Clearance upgrade.
Tagreting units make your units solely shoot and kill that specific unit and will not automaticly and immeadiatly attack other enemies in range.
There more bugs and weird choices but long time players of C&C know how this will make you want to eat your hat.

We have been duped once again by EA and their pretend love for a series or a genre or games in general. I have no clue how so many of you have been able to play this competitvely online(when it was still online).

Yes your eyes will hurt after a while playing this game because of all the colors and flashes.

What they did right however was getting these actors together and make fine cutscenes, but that shouldn't be what holds the game together.

I've looked into the expansion of this game and it is a standalone game which is unlike this game, not a multiplayer game. Effectively splitting 1 game into 2 back when this game was still new and popular.
EA just really doesn't like you or games. Keep this in mind, its never weird to bash EA for whatever it is. they would do the same to you, as long as they get paid.",1609869146,1609869517,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Game Review No. 6

Red Alert 3 Is a great game 

The way on how the building is a nice, orderly and neat.
The tile base build is the way of witch makes those who like mirrored base 
The music is really great to listen to as a music lover I am pleased 
Story is great and all founts to play.
It‚Äôs fun and worth a the time and is a good stress release.
Voices and cutscene are splendid 

Only thing bad can be time, if you dont have time or are not one to give time into something then that might be bad for you.

Worth the time, money and effort.

One of the main reasons for that is a different (and inferior as many of the game critics claim) system of gathering money (ore in this case) from a stationary ore mine, compared to the traditional way of building as many harvesters as possible and sending them away to increasingly dangerous ore fields. Another issue for some is the focus on unit abilities and micromanaging that can make the game much harder to play.

However, it can be argued that the changes and the experiments that the developers went for in Red Alert 3 make this game stand out not only among other C&C games, but also have a special place among all RTS in general.
While these changes are not all for the best and the game does have some issues (some abilities are way stronger than what they should be), the gameplay feels very dynamic and skill is often the deciding factor on who comes out on top in the multiplayer games. You can really get a lot from your units and the money gathering system actually makes expansions and harassment a very important and rewarding part of the gameplay, giving more options to all kind of players.

Also, the campaigns (that can all be played in Co-op) are a lot of fun and continue the traditional Red Alert theme of being slightly over the top, but being very funny at times. The game is worth buying for those alone (check out the Uprising expansion for more campaigns/challenges).

The biggest issue is that the multiplayer is no longer supported by GameSpy and you need to connect via C&C net, which is run by the very passionate community. But it is not a difficult process and there are multiple guides to help you out.

Overall, I'd say that this game is an easy recommend for me. Having played this when it came out and recently playing it on Steam, Red Alert 3 is still a lot of fun to play even 12 years after its release. The graphics hold up incredibly well and the gameplay is a ton of fun. There is only a handful of other RTS games that hold up better than this one. Stay open-minded, give it a go and you will enjoy this game quite a bit!",1606302339,1606302360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The highest setting of graphics looks great, but the game is too zoomed in to the battlefield to get a good visual picture of what is going on. I'm constantly wanting to zoom out.  The game constantly interrupts you from playing just after giving you controls and having talking heads blocking the map, the only thing keeping any sort of reference point since you are zoomed in to close to figure out what is happening. Trying to figure out how to play with units when starting out, the partner AI has a tendency to either be very dumb or destroying everything ahead of you. Depending on difficulty.  I wish I liked this game more. Repeatedly running into bugs this time with units getting stuck , unresponsive to commands, won't follow commands. getting stuck between walls and can't move or die.

It slightly changes things in that you have three factions and you also have a ""co-commander"" you're supposed to work w/. You can do this solo w/ the AI or w/ a friend. Refining ore is simpler in that there are ore mine structures you simple build a refinery in front of and your collectors will collect it, however ore can become ""depleted."" There are also usually a number of oil refineries you can capture with an engineer.  There are also some well known actors.

However, the game isn‚Äôt always without it‚Äôs issues. There are two guides here on Steam that can help you troubleshoot issues you may come across. One problem I had was getting the game to accept my resolution of 1920x1200. I read online that you can add the numbers in the launch options to force the resolution. So, in my case I had to use the launch option of ‚Äú-1920 -1200.‚Äù Then I was able to go into the game, change whatever settings I wanted and the game would accept them. Then I was able to remove the launch option, because it was no longer necessary to force the resolution. However, I think another solution I read involved editing the resolution in an .ini file for the game. If you have problems with the resolution, you should be able to find the solution with a simple web search. In my experience the game will not run in ‚Äúcompatibility mode‚Äù or as ‚Äúan administrator.‚Äù You may notice that the game takes a bit of time to load, because it is searching for servers that are no longer online. You can resolve this and make the game load quicker, by downloading the ‚ÄúRA3 Quick Loader,‚Äù which you can find simply by searching the web with that phrase. There‚Äôs even a link within the Steam community forum for it. It also gives you options, such as the ability to load mods. However, if you are using mods or Cheat Engine, you may have a problem with the game crashing after about 10 minutes of play. However, there is patch that will increase the game‚Äôs available amount of memory to 4GB. This can be found by searching the web with the term ‚ÄúRA3 4GB patch.‚Äù You want to run the executable and it will open a screen for you to select the file you wish to patch. Navigate to the game‚Äôs Data directory and select the file titled ‚Äúra3_1.12.game‚Äù and that‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs pretty simple and solved the problem for me. You may want to do the same for Uprising, the file is titled ‚Äúra3ep1_1.0.game.‚Äù

You can use a program called Cheat Engine to activate cheats in the game. Upon launching for the first time, it will ask you if you want to do the tutorial, which isn‚Äôt necessary if you‚Äôve already obtained cheat tables someone else created. Opening a table you‚Äôve downloaded and selecting what cheats you want to use is quite simple. The tutorial may help you discover cheats for your games, but I found it to be complicated and it‚Äôs just easier to look for a cheat table someone else has already created. To get cheat tables for RA3 and Uprising, you can do web search for ‚ÄúRA3 cheat engine‚Äù and you‚Äôll find (probably the second link on the list) the table in the link that says ‚ÄúRed Alert 3 ‚Äì Fearless Cheat Engine.‚Äù When you open the link, you may need to scroll down, but the fourth post has links to two files, one for RA3 titled ‚Äúra3_1.12.game.CT‚Äù and another for Uprising titled ‚Äúra3ep1_1.0.game.CT.‚Äù You may want to download these into your ‚ÄúMy Cheat Tables‚Äù directory under your ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù folder that was created by Cheat Engine. The program may look there for tables and be able to recognize the correct one for the game without you having to open the file manually. Simply open the game, get to the main menu, then Alt-Tab to the desktop, run the Cheat Engine program, click the first icon on the top left directly under ‚ÄúFile‚Äù and it will open a list of processes running on your computer. You‚Äôll want to look for the one (probably near the bottom) that looks like C&C RA3, select it then click ‚ÄúOpen.‚Äù After that click on the second icon in Cheat Engine that looks like a folder, it‚Äôs to the left of the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù icon and under ‚ÄúEdit.‚Äù You‚Äôll then need to navigate to where you stored the cheat table you downloaded and open that. However, with these tables, I found that the game would automatically detect the right tables and ask if you want to use them, so clicking on the second icon isn‚Äôt necessary if this happens. The big white box at the bottom of the program will be populated with text. Click on the box (to put a red ‚ÄúX‚Äù in it) directly under ‚ÄúActive‚Äù and it will open a list of the available cheats. Then click on the box next to whichever cheat you want to use and that‚Äôs it. Go back to the game and enjoy your cheats! I went through a lot of trouble with this game and what I was trying to do. Since I was able to resolve my issues, I thought I‚Äôd share this info so that someone else won‚Äôt have to go through the trouble of figuring out how to do all of this and make the game stable and waste time like I did.",1605245481,1605340823,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have to admit, I was tempted to buy from good looks, marketing and videos.
This game is polished, good looking and cartoonish, but somehow feels awkwardly off. It's the first time i actually requested a refund for a game and deinstalled it right away after 8 hours.

All the Command & Conquer feeling that i had from previous versions: fighting for and maintaining resources, carefully trying out different strategies, thinking ahead and executing quick attacks or crushing your enemy with a huge army etc. is simply wiped away by the urge to quick-rush your enemy - otherwise they'll crush you, your ""paper"" army and your base defenses like nothing.

Remember that satisfying feeling having secured enough resources, base defenses and units and then slowly running over the enemy?
Well, too bad. This game is pure stress + i had to turn off voice because of the constant blablabla and notifications ALL THE TIME.

Also, i don't care about micro managing that stupid co-op AI or each of my units every second just to have a chance.

No, thank you.

Pros

1. Exquisite production art. Excellent style. The posters and load screens are the best in the series so far. Similarly the game was not infected by the ""current year"" disease. All the actors/actresses are aesthetically pleasing and worthy of their own merchandise. (Id buy some of these posters)

2. The games graphics for the time were okay. It kind of hits a sweet spot between Dawn of War 1 and Starcraft II. That‚Äôs what you should expect and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to get. The color coding is good, you‚Äôll never confuse the types, or ownership of the units you see.

3. It'll be very easy for you to raise your army of 100+ units without any lag.

4. It feels like a Red Alert title. Wackey and zaney. It‚Äôs akin in attitude and spirit to an early James Bond film, Lupin the Third or an old Emma Peel Avengers episode.

5. Most of your favorite units are back. A lot of them have little caveats added to them but they are all recognizable and used in the same way. Believe it or not it‚Äôs the Ore miners that are the most changed. Your resource collectors now work in a Blizzard goldmine/mineral style. I appreciate that the mines that are harvested can be depleted, but never truly run dry and you can play as late into a game as you‚Äôd like.

6. The co Commander ai/co op with a friend gimmick is very interesting, playing this campaign in tag team mode is a unique experience in Red Alert. It makes battles a little more improvisional. This mode may very well be the future of the Red Alert franchise.

7. Tim Curry and Oh Mai Takei are awesome.

Cons
1. Virtually Every Single Level is Amphibious! Every Single One! Remember the bridges from Red Alert 2 that would give you a little leverage, give you a few opportunities to play a few levels the way you wanted to? Not here. Similarly a lot of your unit‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the swimming kind! So you'll have to painstakingly transport them from one island to another when it‚Äôs probably just more time efficient to forget them and rebuild your army via new MCV/Expansion. 

2. The Rock Paper scissors balancing feels a little off. If you play as Soviets you have such a crippling absence of Anti Air that I can‚Äôt imagine there'd be a single competitive game against them that doesn't turn into Tanks trying to outrun aircraft in 100 games out of 100 games. In RA2 anti air was their weak spot, not an Achilles heel. Similarly In an effort to speed up game play nothing is quite as tanky as it used to be and garrisoned buildings are not the strategic hard points that they used to be. 

3. Apart from the update to Hell march the soundtrack is entirely forgettable. You will never notice it. 

4. This could just be me. Unit pathing, the way units move, the way they form this weird ultra spaced out non clump, the way selections of multiple units never seem to go to the exact point where you want them to, despite individual units behaving perfectly fine, is super weird. I want to say that something feels borked about attack move. From start to finish the controls always felt like something was just a hair off.

5. The Campaigns feel monstrously short. Level Redundancy in incorporating an amphibious landing into every single map pairs harshly with the fact that you are now fighting two factions rather than just one. As soviets again, as a point of reference, you will counting the tutorial engage the Japanese Empire in four levels? Three and a half?

RA2 only had 12 level campaigns, but what a difference 3 extra levels and some more qualified map makers can make. You‚Äôre going to blaze through the campaign in a day.

 6. The Coop mode that was intended to be played with friends does not appear to function on steam. (This could definitely be a fun rumble game to play with a friend if they fixed it)

7. Epic actors aside, they don‚Äôt have interactions that are quite as clever as the ones in RA1,2 or Yuris Revenge. This is again due almost entirely to the tiny campaigns. Curry and Takei aside you just don‚Äôt spend enough time with the other characters to get a feel for them.


Verdict

This game has virtually all of the things that Red Alert needs. It just needs more girth, more volume and map makers who put more than a few weeks into the job. It only takes one branch of the development team to torpedo the entire effort and it really feels like everyone else did 99 percent of their jobs. I won‚Äôt scuttle the whole game on account of a few slackers but unfortunately the level design does bump the game from an A- to a solid C.

If they wanted to cut corners and have such tiny campaigns but made each of the campaigns interlocking. AE each campaign builds up to a bigger overall story, then at the last level let you decide which of the three factions you wanted to roll with for a unique ending, the biggest of these problems would be solved. It wouldn‚Äôt be in keeping with Red Alert /C&C Tradition but it‚Äôs certainly more desirable than having campaigns the length of a mid 90s shareware.

All things aside, if you are a Red Alert fan this game is worth 5 dollars (That‚Äôs what I paid and I don‚Äôt feel ripped off!) but when it‚Äôs all said and done you‚Äôre going to want to replay Red Alert 2 and/or Yuri‚Äôs Revenge when you‚Äôre done.

Id play a Red Alert 4 if they made one but right now I‚Äôm much more interested on the whereabouts of a Red Alert 2 Remaster!",1601937482,1601937482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Good:
+ An awesome cast that is clearly having fun! (Tim Curry, George Takei, JK Simmons, Kelly Hu, etc.)
+ The game is now based on hard counters, with the exception of maybe three units there aren't any that can shoot at both land and air at the same time. This forces you to make a mixed army instead of just rushing tanks.
+ The campaign missions are mostly really good, with a lot of expanding maps, creative objectives and the occasional backstab.
+ The water looks amazing! Even 12 years later this is the best water I've seen in an RTS and modern hardware can handle it on high without any problems.
+ The music rocks and has a fun surf rock vibe to it.
+ The addition of amphibious and transforming units gives you a lot of ways to move around and a lot of variety in how you attack.
+ Being able to build most base structures on water allows for new ways to make expansions and backup bases. You can still win even without any bases on land.
+ Each unit has a special ability or a transforming ability and they are all handled with the same hotkey. No having to memorize a ton of hotkeys for caster units. It's a near perfect amount of micro.
+ The resources are simplified and very similar to C&C Generals. It forces you to expand but still keeps your focus on the fighting.
+ You can fire bears out of a cannon, which will cause them to parachute down on to enemies! You can then order those bears into water to fight dolphins!

The Bad:
- The campaigns are pretty short at 9 missions each. I wish they were longer since the story feels pretty rushed at the end for all of them.
- No Steam Multiplayer/Co-Op Support, you have to use CNCnet
- The ""Right Click"" mode is a little weird. It has you confirm with a right click for things like attack move instead of a left click like every other RTS out there.",1597022730,1597022730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The *other* black sheep of C&C. This one is actually acknowledged to exist, but it's still... weird. The other games might have had a cheesey undertone and RA2 sort of snorted that first line, but everything outside of Yuri's Revenge and RA3 is mostly freaking dark, bordering on political horror in setting, tone and plot.

I think people forget that the first Soviet mission in RA1 literally has a conversation about nerve gas tests and has you wipe out a civilian town with efficiency that would make the Nazis blush, on the orders of Stalin himself. Even the ""good guys"" were given to war crimes here and there, right up to before this game. And that's without getting into the sheer horror and societal breakdown caused by Tiberium and what it does to wherever it grows and whoever comes into contact with it, along with the religious imagery and ideas that made it into that sub-series.

This game, however, makes you chuckle. It does not take itself seriously at all. This is C&C on drugs, for better or worse, and some of it isn't intentional: EALA was in perpetual crunch mode for 10 years, and this was their last game that was reviewed positively. The edges are a lot rougher than the *excellent* C&C3 that they made *somehow* in 9 months. The rush to get RA3 done and on shelves within a year shows, which gives it a lower budget feeling than even the developers intended, amongst the flashy graphics that still kinda hold up. You can tell that this is a development team that is tired and hate their bosses, despite still having the passion. 

They tried to make naval units more relevant, with many units being able to travel on both land and sea. You can even build most of a base on water if you want. They were trying so hard to innovate, bless them. The thing is, trying to innovate in the late 00s within the gameplay structure of Command & Conquer is never going to work right, and that's ultimately why the series... went to sleep for a bit. They couldn't turn C&C into Starcraft or Dawn of War. It was never the right series to compete with those.

*I* never completed this and I never will, but there is something about it and RA3 deserves attention from any C&C fan, because you might like it, or at least appreciate Tim Curry and George Takei enough to last a few missions like I've done three times over the last 10 years. The gameplay is good (if slightly convoluted) but it just strays too far thematically from what I personally like about C&C games. If you've just come into the series via the Remastered Collection (welcome!) you may enjoy it as well, but don't expect the dark semi-serious tone of those games.

For me, this is where the dream died. RA2 was THE game of my tweens but I could not get into this even back in 2008/9, and it wasn't even a priority launch-day play for me unlike every other game in the franchise apart from the original and C&C4. The day that I got RA2 is an incredibly happy memory for me... but they failed to hype even me, their target audience, up for this game. I was 18 and male. I should have loved this stuff, but the tone was way off. Following, there was a bit of hype for C&C4 after the teaser trailer dropped and then... well... I point you to my C&C4 ""review"". I don't think this was a case of simply growing up.

The main attraction is the campaign, which gradually increases in difficulty across 3 campaigns. My main issue with the game is that it was meant to be played online. Every single campaign mission is built around being co-op, which to me is actually downright infuriating because your co-op partner takes half your income. And because the multiplayer servers are down you have no option but to have an AI controlled partner

The problem is that the co-op AI will get steamrolled, and have next to none or even no buildings or units at all. But they still take half of all your income. So your constantly starved for income and can't mount a proper counter-offensive against the super built up enemy bases, so if the enemy AI has 2 mines that's the same income you get if you had 4 mines! This means that even if you have 4 mines you can't beat the AI economy wise, it will build more units than you and be constantly spamming against you.

Aside from that, the game itself is fine. I just wish the campaign got rid of these junk co-op commanders and let me control everything with a full income.",1595058207,1595058207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The rock paper, scissors counter system works well and every unit gots a usefull and unique second ability. You can start out the game with so many different builds and conventual of creative crazy strategies. Gameplay on water is well intergrated and basebuilding and combat on water are as vauluable as on land. The campaign is soldid with fun cutscenes with famous actors. Multiplayer is really where this game shines. you can have an intense 8 minute game or a long fought out battle that can take an hour or more. There are always great stories to be told!

Beware if you want to play this game online (which you should check out!) you need to connect to the fan made servers: https://cnc-online.net/en/
Hopefully in the future CNC will again support this game with their own servers as they are rebooting the series. 

If you want to buy the game, then buy the base game Red Alert 3 and NOT the stand alone expansion Uprising. The expansion is not multiplayer compatible and only adds some unbalanced units and a ton of commander chanllenges and some campaign. Its fun, but not as great as the base game. 

Now go and play this amazing game. See you on the battlefield Commander!

I would recommend this ONLY if you are nostalgic for RA3. 
The story is cheesy, the units are sorta balanced? It does pose the 3 factions as 'difficulty-levels' I never felt that way. You either know your units and micromanage or you don't. 

There are many sure-fire ways to defeat A.I. opponents and I haven't been playing online really.
I am here for the laughs of the cutscenes really and fill my nostalgia.
-----

Nostalgia-blinders off:
Neh, don't go into it. MAYBE if you are an old-skool RTS nerd, but the way they 'STREAMLINED' the experience will make you burn out fast. I tend to play one or two matches and bail for a few months at least. 
It didn't age too well on the UI and the shortcuts, but you can adjust them.
Then the major thing in RTS is pathing. It's as terrible as any game from this era. So you will find yourself adjusting pathing for units depending on the terrain. 

So all and all;
If you are nostalgic or want to revisit a classic because you LOVE RTS. go for it, don't pay too much tho! (I got it at like ‚Ç¨5,-)
If you are passing by and see like the name and the artwork, you are looking at an older game, with all its flaws. And as for the funny cutscenes. Say hi to YouTube or Twitch. CoverMuffin did and excellent Cutscene% run on GDQ. makes it even more funny with his laugh added to it ;)",1591127913,1593031347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

17480,66567612,76561197993023804,0,524,795,0,171,1698867739,"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#417 out of 612)... it's time for Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3.

I'll be honest: I absolutely adore Red Alert 2, but I was never quite able to get into Red Alert, and I find myself equally unable to get into Red Alert 3. It's a problem of fidelity, I think, as all three games are well-crafted real-time strategy titles with a special affection for cheesy Cold War parody. Where Red Alert was too crude to really spark my imagination, and Red Alert 2 was just right, the heightened ""high definition"" detail of Red Alert 3 is just too much‚Äîit's makes it too obvious that the FMVs are filmed on very cheap sets with very basic props and costumes.

Which is all a roundabout way of saying Red Alert 3 doesn't quite click with me for reasons I have difficulty articulating. I think a decent analogy might be video, as a large part of Red Alert's appeal is the over-the-top, exaggerated C-movie antics of the live-action FMV cut-scenes. In this framing, the difference between Red Alert 2 and Red Alert 3 is the same as the difference between VHS and Blu-Ray. Some movies look better when you can't see the details‚Äîthe lower fidelity masks the imperfections that would otherwise be laid bare in HD. And in Red Alert 3, all of those imperfections are rendered in perfect clarity.

Of course, it's also entirely possible that the game didn't click with me because of imperceptible differences in tone and style‚ÄîRed Alert 3 being developed by a different studio than the prior games. This is not a Westwood RTS!

Even so, I think Red Alert 3 is a solid game. It doesn't quite draw me in the same say its predecessor did, but I can still appreciate the absurdity of its premise and the competence of its mechanics. What can I say? It's a decent, utterly satisfactory game whose greatest flaw is that it's not the classic its predecessor was. A lesser son of a greater sire and all that.",1585986232,1591415518,True,21,1,0.71596980094909668,0,True,False,False

The only one that might be worse is C&C 4 and you can see the C&C 4 elements present in this games development. EA sucked the life out of most of the Red Alert Series. The game play is lack luster and does little to different its self from other strategy games on the market, even is 2008 it was uninspired and bland. The single player story is a let down. While the cut scene's are decent they cross over from B-Movie to terrible SyFy Channel  movie and not in the Sharknado good way but in The Room bad way. The missions are lack luster and way too focused on small team unit constrained missions versus the base building. This eliminates and feeling of scale or grandness that was present in the previous games. The Skirmish maps are based around PVP and fail miserably when you play against AI. This makes re-playability very limited. Also since the support is long gone there are no new maps coming. Overall you are far better off going back to RA2 or other RTS games.

Personally I think this game's pretty underrated, and might just have the best core gameplay out of any Command and Conquer game. The three factions are each really distinct from each other with a lot of strategies to try, with a lot of hidden depth coming from the ways the various units interact with each other. In addition despite its age and the fact that it's running on an engine that was outdated even back when it came out, the game's visuals have held up well, with some really nice visual effects and terrain, especially on maps with water. It also has a great soundtrack with music by revered C&C veteran Frank Klepacki. 

The campaigns are  very short by series standards, and the story's average at best despite the C&C trademark FMV cutscenes featuring several fairly big name actors, but the missions are fun and fast paced enough to keep you on your toes, with varied maps and objectives. The campaigns were designed to be played in co-op and as such you'll always be partnered with an AI co-commander, which can be offputting as it can sometimes feel like the AI is playing the mission for you. You get used to it though and it's not a huge problem overall, and it has the upside of allowing for some pretty massive battles across the course of the campaign. Unfortunately this was a game that used Gamespy meaning that the official servers for online multiplayer are long dead, although thanks to various third party tools it's still technically possible to play it and this game's online community isn't entirely dead. Even if you don't feel like that you can still play skirmish battles with AI bots, which can be fun enough in its own right even if it's clearly no substitute for a human player. 

Overall it has its problems but it's worth playing on the whole. For its current normal price I'd probably say its worth it, although I can definitely see why people would prefer something a bit lower. Just bear in mind that it doesn't seem to go on sale all that often.",1589656498,1589656498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot of charm just like the previous entries. Live action cut-scenes are great. Music is amazing. All around an enjoyable experience. 

I would not consider the game to be well balanced though. Empire is just a little bit too mobile compared to the other factions. Though this game has an unusual skill ceiling. It is definitely more than possible to outplay an evenly matched empire player. The unfairness mostly comes from the transforming units. To get kills on a single type of empire units you often need to make sure you have 2 other unit types to counter them. Empire just doesn't have to worry about that. 

Basically the empire player has a free retreat if the enemy does not have  the right units to counter the transforms. Empire gets free repairs at the mecha bay so this can really add up over a game. It's just a huge advantage to have in an RTS game. In situations where a soviet or allied army would be wiped, often an empire player just transforms. 

Since all of the units have unique abilities that can be activated you get a more dynamic feeling game. Compared to other RTS games, a single unit generally feels like it has more potential if used correctly. 

Now I don't mind a challenge so the balance issues are not that big of a deal for me. Any faction can devastate in the hands of a good player. I enjoy the differences in the factions enough to still recommend this game 100%. I would rather have unique and interesting factions than copy-cats to make the game appear bigger and more complex.

The 3 factions for me:
Soviets: straightforward, easy to play, all around just good
Allies: most potential out of their units, harder to use, turrets
Empire: Most maneuverable units, hit-run tactics, kind of predictable but still annoying",1588186388,1588186458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It would be an incredibly fun game to play if it wasn't for the *CONSTANT* spamming of super-weapons/abilities by the AI which means you're just being endlessly hounded by annoyances that you can't possibly keep on top of... the trouble is: the AI is able to simultaneously move and adapt it's whole army to your use of special abilities though. This ends up forcing a very tedious and boring playstyle of having to rush the enemy every single game; sometimes without even having to utilise many (if any) special abilities. Frankly... it's boring to play. 

Shame, it could have been pretty fun (the unit special abilities, for example, add a nice dynamic to the game; being able to switch from anti-air to anti-surface units on the fly is kinda cool) but it's all ruined by very boring and unimaginative AI patterns that just spam you endlessly unless you rush them, usually ending every skirmish within 5-10 minutes.",1585222559,1585222559,False,18,5,0.632317602634429932,0,True,False,False

Worth playing if you like rts games. Enjoyable compaign mode. Online is through 3rd party site only, and it works ok, so thats cool. Nastalgia is a big factor too. 9/10 for this reason.

basically to sum up my opinion:
1. I hate how EA forced Westwood the creators of red alert to to pump out the command and conquer series and after making a game that EA would accept the ratings were terrible so EA broke Westwood up and now only keep the command and conquer name so that no one else could make another command and conquer.
2. this game feels like its lacking, even though it has many more options than red alert 2 had, red alert 2 still felt more inspired with its story line and characters than any of the command and conquers excluding the tiberium wars.
3. EA refuses to sell copies of red alert 2.
4. I just don't like EA and that effects mu opinion rather greatly.
5. I do like that america has dolphins, don't know why they do as they suck but i always found that to be funny.

The third installment in the series has a lot to live up to, but it was an acceptable attempt. Fun in it's own right.

As EA used GameSpy servers (that shutdown in 2014) the in-game multiplayer matchmaking no longer works and you'll have to use third party software. These game breaking issues could be fixed with a small update and would cost EA very little. It would fix the game and make them even more money.

RA3 is not the best Command & Conquer game. The harvesters were controversially replaced with resource nodes, which detracts from hit-and-run economy strategies and favours unit spam instead. Otherwise, battles are quick, economies are low effort, and unit relationships are pretty typical post-cold war air, land and navy fare.

This game is likely the best thing EA has made, or is part of an elite group. What's not to love? Graphically, it looks great for 2008, especially the HD cutscenes. The three factions are wacky and rediculous, each made to go with a specific wacky strategy. Each campaign, one for each faction, has an introduction to each faction's units and a funny yet well thought-out story. 
Yes, there is a coop feature, but I never used it. Once, when the service was still up under EA, I tried the coop, and both sides had a unique but well-balanced start.
Back to the cutscenes, they are God's gift to video games. The three faction leaders are well-renowned actors who, luckily, are known for being able to do a not-serious role. George Takei, Tim Curry, and J.K. Simmons all make masterful performances, especially Tim Curry, who is essentially the main character of each story.
Overall, a fantastic game and one worth playing. What are you spending $20 on, Starbucks? Spend it on this.",1572535145,1572535145,True,13,0,0.669029355049133301,0,True,False,False

The biggest problem this game has - just like Command & Conquer 3 - is that the gameplay is way too hectic, and because of that, even the very first missions have pacing issues. 

In the previous titles, building an army took some time, but you had fewer units able to withstand more punishment and capable of delivering quite a punch. The game had a more ""meditative"" feel thanks to that peculiarity. 

Here you have the opposite trend: lots of units that don't do much on their own, and have a lacklustre personality partially because of that. You can spend some time building up your forces - which is still considerably less than what you'd have normally spent in the previous chapters - and when you're done, you'll often have a big army and will feel pretty sure it's enough to take on an enemy base, to only see it completely wiped out after just a couple of minutes. What a joke. 

Another strictly related issue is that I am not even at my fourth or fifth mission, and I am already assaulting naval yards, destroying tech centers, and stuff like that. Where is the more linear and slow-paced tech progression we used to have in RA2 or other C&C games? 

The addition of the possibility of playing in co-op mode is interesting, but when not playing with a human ally, you have to play alongside the CPU-controlled AI, whose performance is abysmal to say the least. I think in some missions you share resources, and that only makes it worse. The real problem here is that I just want to be left alone, goddamnit, I don't want any ally, human or not, whom I will have to even minimally assist; why shove this shit down our throats? 
And I still have difficulty understanding what the hell are the harvesters supposed to be mining; in RA2 you had very visible, yellow ore and here...I'm not even sure. 

As of this writing, I have spent around 2 hours playing the game, but I just don't feel like continuing...I probably will, but nothing about it feels particularly compelling. Sure the graphics look good even today, but its overall graphical style is different from what Red Alert 2 had to offer, and I cannot help but vastly prefer the latter. Cannot recommend (to the fans of the classic 2D games).",1569542736,1569543725,False,5,0,0.48893439769744873,0,True,False,False

LIKES: 

-Gameplay is STILL FANTASTIC 
-The design of the ALLIES is SICK AND F!!!!!G COOL 
-The maps are amazing 
-Naval combat is fun(ish) 
-Voice acting is fab 
-The acting is fab 
-Story is fab(ish) 
-GUARDIAN TANK AWAITING DEPLOYMENT
-YOU GET TO DESTROY EA!!!!!!!!!!!



DISLIKES: 
- Unit designs 
'Ok so I know that when it comes to CNC the unit designs are a mix of goofy but also epic and a sprinkle of reality. Yet it just seems the units can be TOO GOOFY. Especially when it came to the Japanese units, the Bullfrog and the Apocalypse Tank. I mainly HATE the bullfrog just for it's goofy launch cannon, somehow just launching War Bears from a cannon isn't as entertaining as playing as the Soviets invading Washington D.C. and destroying the Pentagon with JUST conscripts. The only way I could ever love thee BULLFROG is if they'd just get rid of launch cannon and just have it as a infantry vehicle with the AA cannon I would have like it yet, no. Also EA WHAT DID YOU DO THE THE APOCALYPSE TANK' 

-Lost Potential 
'In Command and Conquer RED ALERT 2 you could fight in Washington, New York, Paris, Moscow, London and THOUSANDS OF FUN AND WELL BUILT LOCATIONS. IN CAMPAIGN AND MULTIPLAYER THEY DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THAT! For instance instead of the South of France for the Second Allies mission why not launch a Operation Overlord styled invasion or fight the Soviets in Paris, a Soviet mission in London or Berlin. SO MUCH POTENTIAL YET AIN'T TAKEN' 

-EMPIRE OF THE RISING...WHY? 
'How does getting rid of Albert Einstein make Japan a technological empire? I forgot that bit in human history when the Japanese Empire DIDN'T rise because of Einstein. Don't try to back this timeline up it's just dumb. Theres NO reason for this WHAT SO EVER it's JUST A WAIST! A COMPLETE AN UTTER WASTE!' 

-New York City's gotten smaller lately? 
'What! ONCE AGAIN SO MUCH POTENTIAL LOST! AND THE LAST MISSION FOR THE SOVIET CAMPAIGN IS AS ENJOYABLE AS A FART IN THE MOUTH!' 

-The paratroopers
'Why is it only the Allies can deploy paratroopers (only in the campaign) and the Soviets (despite the first mission for the Allies where it shows that the Soviets DO clearly have paratrooper potential) and the Japanese (despite the Japanese having advanced technology) don't take advantage of para's' 

-No more snipers 
'R.I.P Allied Snipers, you shall be missed' 

-No more prism tank 
'You renamed the Prism Tower to the Spectrum Tower, so why couldn't you have just renamed the Prism Tank to the Spectrum Tank?'

So overall do I hate, or love Red Alert 3? Well it's 50/50. I do love the gameplay, some of the maps and GUARDIAN TANK AWAITING DEPLOYMENT. But I can't overlook the DISLIKES and I am sure I've left some negatives out. So if i have PLEASE tell me.",1568394402,1568394402,True,8,2,0.571460068225860596,0,True,False,False

From there, Colonel Cherdenko reveals to General Krukov of a top secret military project that he been put in charge of, introducing (him to) Dr. Zelinsky who was the mind behind the creation of said military project, it being a time-control machine. They get in and strap themselves into the machine against Zelinsky's wishes, directly having been sent to Brussels, 1927 from the coordinates that Cherdenko had given to Zelinsky, a physics conference that Einstein had attended. He'd only recently finish his speech, walking unaware to the backstage only to be met with the unlikely Colonel Cherdenko, having to shake hands which would lead to Einstein becoming disintegrated, ultimately having been removed from the space-time continuum, the reason for the world's atomic bombs to have never been created, and the technological advancement of the Allies practically lagging behind the Soviet Union if it weren't for an external company.

Yes, that is how this game's intro is, much like the first Red Alert game's intro where an influential member of our history would shake hands with one of our cast only to be removed from the timeline, erasing their mark on the world as we know that had lead to an extensive change of history. Red Alert 3 in itself is a game that I believe to be all but bountiful than its predecessor game, Red Alert 2 (Yuri's Revenge, if you'd call an expansion a predecessor game), lacking quite a lot of units that its previous iterations had, an even less serious plot and storyline, and.. well, that's about all that I can complain about. It's somewhat lackluster in content, I believe, but nonetheless, I would still deem this game as one of my favourite Real-Time Strategy games just for the sole reasons such as the game's style of art and design, dialogue, obscure jokes, moddability, and let's not forget the cast of actors like, David Hasselholf becoming the president, [i]then[/i] there's Tim Curry with wanting to go to the moon, quite a lot of questionable, yet enjoyable stuff nonetheless. The gameplay is quite simple and fun, having the majority of functions that any other standard RTS game would have, boasting a special ability system with all of its units which I believe is sort of one of its highlights along with unit pathfinding AI comparable to CoD Ghosts' Fish AI. Red Alert 3, in my opinion, excels at emphasizing on whatever humour it can dish out, most notably the Conscripts of the Soviet Union and a few other units I could care less about, then there's the cutscenes. It's the trademark for every other Command & Conquer game, but I think that Red Alert 3 does it quite well, having the best set of actors, scripts that felt like fanfictions written by cocaine addicts, and the Soviet March or OST in general. There isn't much to say about Red Alert 3 for me, atleast. It isn't all too special by itself.
It's just a cool and good game, an essential RTS, but it isn't worth its price on Steam. Better off getting it on Origin if you don't mind using a different launcher or spending a bit more.",1567869328,1567869328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

17480,54560004,76561198049255124,0,8,8314,0,2477,1688857870,"TLDR: I'll recommend, with certain reservations and qualifiers, however... 

Might touch some hardliners' nerves, but I'm just giving my honest take on it:
I'll start off by saying that this is my first C&C:RA title (And the only C&C I've bought since C&C:G/ZH); so, I don't have background on how RA is ""supposed"" to be (as in how the older games played compared to RA3). I dare say, after 5+ years since Generals, I'd expect graphics that weren't so marred looking that they give you a migraine - on every setting from min-max, on a modern display, BTW-. Generals' polygons and landscapes were crisper and less blurred looking. The water effects, however are MIND-BLOWING by 2008 standards; they nailed that, I usually don't care about how in-game water looks, but dang, it's gorgeous.

Game play-wise, the units are clunky as frig. Who was in charge of the unit mechanics; and how did that not get fixed prior to launch? (Because, you see kids, there was a time when games were actually FINISHED before they were sold to us. Ah, the long lost days of old...) You order a Dreadnought to a location, it tries its dangdest to go THROUGH land. And don't get me started on the gaggle that more than four or five tanks become when you try to mass any force. Next, units won't attack enemies in their LOS, even on aggressive, until they are within ""defensive"" range anyway. So what's the point? 

Power-wise, virtually every unit (except those blasted Mirage's and their god-like OP-as-all-crap Spectrum cannons) feels nerf'd with even specialized units barely able to destroy their respective specialty targets. In my opinion, after playing all three campaigns and several dozen skirmishes, I rank each factions' usefulness and effectiveness (overall) as follows: 

I. Soviets. They're the only one with truly-useful helicopters and have the most versatile artillery and navy; and an easy-to-expand building construction system.

II. Allies. Their leader powers are the most devastating and they do have the best heavy bombers IMO. Aircraft carriers (which are irritating to be on the receiving end of) are also useful when properly deployed. If you use them, (see below...) they do have the toughest rifle (technically, shotgun in their case) infantry.

III. Empire. Most of their units are jack-of-all-trade transforming machines. They do each job to a mediocre degree at best. The VX is the most effective IMO; the King Oni may as well not exist, most useless ""heavy"" unit"" in the game. I do like the Shogun battleships but the rest of their navy is so-so. Their saving graces are: Good blend of leader powers, most destructive hero (OP, really, but in a way that is fun to play with, or against) and a good heavy turret. The only thing that makes them worthwhile in a match is, of course, the cores' ability to build far outside the range of the con-yard without an expansion unit/building.

Pros:
*Excellent blend of selectable powers AND you can earn ALL of them if you happen to play a match long enough.
*Great water graphics and weapon/explosion effects.
*Good number of skirmish maps.
*Generally good unit active powers/abilities.

Mids:
*Building system is a gift and a curse. While you don't have to wrangle builders, being stuck waiting for one building at a time to crap its way out of the yard is downright frustrating at times. At least your opponent is stuck doing the same. (Crusher Cranes FTW)
*Simple gathering system makes it easy to set up resource collection, however,... (See Cons)
*Semi-decent campaign (with OK cutscenes, with actors you've actually heard of [How did they afford Takei?...]), though some missions are quite a grind; and not much replay value.

Cons:
* Graphics are good in the effects department, but the units and land terrain are not pleasing to the eye and look almost childish, along with being marred-looking as stated above.

* The #1, 100%, undeniable, undisputed world champion of CLUNKY unit controls. Units just bounce and bob and cluster-stuck their way to a given point, even with waypoints to guide them around terrain they should not even travel towards to being with!!!

* The screen is filled with so many ""convenient"" button clusters that it's well, VERY INCONVENIENT! Plus, you can only drag select a small group units since the cursor stops at each group of buttons! Convenient? Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't very fuzzy was he?

* No viable source of infinite resources. Oil derricks certainly don't cut it. I know, I know, you should be done before mines run out. But some of us old timers don't always do a balls out rush and actually try to enjoy a match with maxed out civs once in a while.

* Related to the above, resources come in excrutiatingly slowly with no way to speed them up. NONE! (Save the selectable one for Allies, which comes far too late in a match to be useful.) Why no tech to upgrade it? 

* Did I mention the CLUUUUUUUNNNNKKKKYY FREAKING UNIT MECHANICS!?!?!?!?

* Infantry, as always in C&C games, is largely useless (not all Barracks units, mind you, but the standard infantry themselves are a waste of time and resources). Why bother having rifle infantry at all? They can't kill a bloody dolphin! Scummy poachers kill them IRL with .22 rifles......

* Units reaction time and range needs fixing. They just sit there and die even though what's killing them is well within their LOS. 
Ensemble Studios (R.I.P. BEST RTS devs of all time) could have taught EA & Co some valuable lessons in that area.

*Standard infantry should be able to cap Gaia buildings (Nit-picky, perhaps, but $500 engineers should not be required for that.)

* And one last thing: CLUNKY UNIT MOVEMENT MECHANICS WITH SUCH AS DREADNOUGHT SHIPS TRYING TO GO THROUGH LAND AND ALWAYS GETTING STUCK IF NOT BABYSAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Overall I rate it 6/10. I'll still recommend it though, if you catch it on a good sale. It does have its good points and can be fairly fun. The campaign is a one-off, although I'll be playing it through several more times, just for gits and shiggles. I know I'm probably just stuck in the past and am also well aware that it's a different branch of the franchise, but RA3 really doesn't hold a candle to Generals/Zero Hour.

1: Red Alert 3 is the direct sequel to Red Alert 2 however In typical red alert fashion time has once again been altered. this time in such a way that imperial japan never really stopped being imperial after whatever WW2 was in the red alert universe. as such you'll be fighting two different enemy's this time around commander if you chose to fight for the allies RA's equivalent to NATO you'll be fighting the empire of the rising sun and the Soviet union. if you decided to go with the soviet union you'll be battling the Allies and the Empire with but only the most durable of armor comrade, etc.

2: Story wise it's isolated even for being a sequel and some people don't like it. personally i don't mind it i'm not a fan of it however it isn't terrible ether.

3: Gameplay wise it's C&C with a few twists. base building is different compared to RA2 with each faction having there own building style. the allies are confined to the perimeter around there construction yard without the use of prospectors or without moving the MCV, 
the soviets can expand there build radius with there structures similar to RA2 but similar to the allies although the build radius can be expanded with the use of structures or the sputnik unit it can't be altered otherwise without moving the MCV.
Japan is special when it comes to building... the japanese MCV builds ""nanocores"" a unit that unpacks into a structure on clear land or sea. nanocores aren't constricted to build areas unlike the other two factions but are vastly more vulnerable until deployed.

3.1: Unit's and faction specifics
Each unit has a special ability with the exception of transports which have the ""Special ability"" of unloading the passengers within them however simply because transports special ability's aren't unique it doesn't mean they aren't special. let's talk about the allied riptide IFV a Infantry Fighting hovercraft armed with just a light machinegun... until it's on water that is. when on water the riptide opens up a set of torpedo tubes allowing it to use explosive and higher damage weapons when traversing any body of water. the soviet bullfrog transport when unloading it's passengers does so by shooting them out of the rear mounted mancannon and para-dropping them allowing infantry to potentially bypass walls or static base defenses. lastly the empire's sudden transport although unarmed can disguise it's self as an enemy vehicle. be careful of scout unit's and the enemy players micro-ing capability's.
3.2: Now onto actual special ability's each unit as stated earlier has a special ability that can hamper enemy forces in some form or another and punish them in some form or another. the allied spy for an example can punish a player's lack of micro capability's by ether A: bribing an entire set of enemy forces and having them convert to your team at the cost of 5000 resources or B: by shutting down some form of structure in the enemy's base temporarily granting you a temporary or in some instances a permanent advantage. however on the opposite end of the spectrum there are some unit's with special ability's that encourage micro-ing like the soviet hammer tank with it's special ability being the ability to tear enemy armor and if said tank gets the kill a weapon right off of an enemy vehicle. if someone micro's said tank well enough you can potentially get a early or possibly mid game advantage.

4: Conclusion
For 20 USD i have to say that unless your a die hard C&C fan who's willing to try something a bit different but still similar to the older C&C games it's not worth it however if you can find it at 15USD or less. go for it. if not for the game it's self but the fun you can get out of it both in vanilla and modded.",1562653367,1562653367,True,2,0,0.529157578945159912,0,True,False,False

Just don't try to take it seriously and enjoy the silliness of giant samurai mechs with laser beam eyes fighting war bears while weaponized dolphins duel tesla coil-armed attack boats. And who could forget the (actually) iconic Kirov Airships or Apocalypse tanks with their meme-worthy voice lines.

The game also still looks good, due to somewhat unique, vibrant graphics that didn't even try to go for realism when the game was new. The game also has a pretty long campaign that's not just a string of tutorials for multiplayer. It also controls just as well as any modern RTS, including convenient commands such as the ever-important attack move.

Of course, don't expect any wild innovative mechanics, as you've probably seen them all already in newer games.

I personally also liked II because of the Pentagon and the destroyers and all the military stuff. The destroyers in this part are just bad. It's laudable to bring in all these Sci-Fi but for me it's not Red Alert anymore. A Fourth Red Alert should definitely be more on the I and II game because everything was much better except the controls in I maybe although it's nostalgic and requires some skill.

Skirmishes crashes as soon as someone gets a superweapon, and it didn't even run until i upgraded to a powerhouse pc. I'm no pc expert however.

The campaign however, oh boy there's some j u i c y stuff there. Assuming you haven't played the game yet, allow me to summarize the story

ok so three soviet guys be like ""we are getting o o f e d, let's time travel and not die"" they go back in time and shake einstein's hand but oOps he get zap. now america not have nuke, and soviets are winning. now in worldwar 2, remember japan? yea hiroshima and nagasaki are fine and they build a giant army and wage war on the entire world. now allies are screwed, and are dying. then jk simmons be like, ""oOps america is in the war now ha.""

That's all I'm going to say as you can play for yourself... or watch a playthrough of it.

Story: 8/10

So if you're after a not so serious game to while away a few hours then I'd say go for it. If however you're after a good modern C&C game I'd suggest playing C&C 3 instead.",1553592676,1553592676,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It all starts out with the Soviets on the brink of defeat before one of their scientists goes back in time and alters history, resulting in the new Japanese Empire of the Rising Sun who are keen on world domination. And in this new history, where every female in the military is not only gorgeous but also required to wear skimpy uniforms, you act as the commander who must lead each alliance to victory.

The story itself is not aiming to be well told or particularly memorable, but rather turning up the absurdist humour and sexiness to 11. It peaks in the mission where you must help the Japanese defend Pearl Harbour from an Allied attack because it contains Japan's largest Naval force and cultural history. 

And it would be remiss of me to not to mention the acting cast that have been pulled together contains about 7-8 very well known actors. The game is worth it for this cast alone.

The gameplay itself is decent enough, just typical C&C RTS. Each race has their own unique qualities and each unit also has a single special ability which gives you a bit more to micro. The new race, the Japanese I found to be quite annoying as they are extremely micro intensive. They have a few units which can transform into flying mode or land mode, and you need to constantly switch back and forth during the missions. 

The pathing and attack-move command is what you would expect from a game from this era. Not particularly great. You will need to micro to win battles, even with overwhelming forces. And units will never attack buildings unless specifically told. 

Another annoying aspect to the campaign is that each mission has ""bonus objectives"". Usually, completing these will give the player some benefit. For example, extra units or resources or technology. However, most of the bonus objectives are unnecessary as they have provide no benefit to the player. This is particularly disappointing in a game like Red Alert because you would expect these bonus objectives to unlock quirky cutscenes and extra humour that the franchise is known for. But really, these bonus objectives are just time wasters.

I only ran into 1-2 serious bugs, which just required reloading the last autosave.

The game has depth, probably more than you can show in a quick 3-4 hour campaign for each race. But well worth it just for the absurdist story, acting, and nostalgia of a gaming classic",1546518072,1546760793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 The ai is never prepared for you airdropping infantry from the century bomber
2 Mass kirov is really hard to stop
3 KIROV REPORTING
4.1 the ai cant keep up with superior economy at all
4.2 wanna win a skirmish, play as japan and spam out all the refineries
5 CnC4 (tiberian twilight) is a complete nightmare, 3 is the sweetspot for origeonal, red alert 3 for the red alert series
6 red alert 2 has aged very well
7 apparently CnCnet works for multiplayer online but i havent tried that yet
8 natasja is rediculous when you commandeer the enemies artillery units or steal one of their MCV's
9 if a strategy doesnt work YOU DONT HAVE ENOUGH OF THE UNITS FOR IT
10 the campaign can be really hard to outright trench warfare sometimes

the plot is good old RA kinds of rediculous but i wont spoil it here since there are poeple who still havent played this game

overall this game still is a goldmine from EA its golden age although i would have preferred if the origeonal studio wasnt bought out by EA and made this, (main reason cnc3 was a gold spot for the tiberian series was that the origeonal studios which i cant remember the name of already had made most of it)


this is a re-review by BoneTiger after a couple more years

I love how this game doesn't just focus on land, but you must focus on navy too, and if you don't, then you're screwed. I also like how every troop has its own unique ability, which can either be used to make your unit stronger, making it vonerable for a shorter period of time, or just as a last chance for your unit to survive/defend your base. I love how mcv can go into water, which gives you a chance to actually survive if the enemy dominates the land. The plot is nice, and just like in ra it shows the corruption among the soviets. I recommend this game to everyone who loves strategy games, because it just offers so much. I also like the ""research tree"" and how it works. I love how I can get some special ability without building anything, and how I gain experiance over time.

Now the part which I don't like. To me, naval gameplay feels forced, because it is in every mission, and good amount of missions you can't actually make vehnicles made for land only because at the start you are on the island. Exept that I don't have any other problems, and I know that this problem may be contradictory because I said how I love that you must build navy, which is true, but I don't like being forced to build my navy absolutely every mission I play.",1542939589,1542939589,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I played on Hard myself and even though some Soviet missions were quite tough, the game seems to get progressively harder in that order.

17480,44204175,76561198292633636,42,9,13190,0,6620,1671127727,"I think C&C Red Alert 3 is a pretty well done game.

+ The factions are quite good balanced (unlike in C&C Generals: ZH whereas the USA had a lot advantages over the other two factions). Firstly I actually thought that Japan is pretty much the strongest of the three factions due to their strong navy and land units. Not to mention their commando Yuriko Omega which is by far the best of the three commandos and is just ridiculously OP. But then I actually noticed that the Japanese are extremely vunerable to aircraft. Their aircraft isn¬¥t that bad but their counter measures against enemy aircraft are kinda...bad. With that fact I think the three factions are all in good balanced.

+ You can choose your own strategy in skirmish mode. You don¬¥t like massive tank battles? No problem! We¬¥re taking them out with our gunships and bombers. What? They¬¥re easy to destroy? Then let¬¥s attack the enemy base with our navy over the sea! You get my point. Since every map has a large sea either in the middle or around the battlefield you can play every strategy you want to. 

+ The actors are very well choosen. They all really fit into their roles considering the optical appearance. I can¬¥t say anything about their acting qualities since I¬¥m playing the German version BUT the voice acting is really great there though. Probably not very helpful for you but I still think it should be mentioned.

+ Great campaign. Sure, it is over the top and sometimes it really gets ridiculous. But I still think it¬¥s very entertaining. No matter how dark the story of a C&C game actually is there always has been a funny extent.

+ I like the skirmish messages of the commanders. This mechanic is also used in games like the Stronghold series and I already liked it there. I like this mechanic becasue it  makes you feel like you¬¥re actually playing against a person and not just an AI. E.g. in C&C Generals ZH you didn¬¥t have this mechanic. You didn¬¥t even see the general¬¥s name in skirmish mode (e.g. Not ""Dr. Thrax has been defeated."" but ""Hard has been defeated."")

+ It is not Command and Conquer 4.

+/- The micromanagement is imo actually entertaining and sometimes challenges the player as the special abilities of your units can sometimes really save your life. But it¬¥s also at some points too much to handle. Players who can¬¥t handle this very well are likely not going to like this mechanic. I mean it already starts with the building system of the Allies or the more confusing building system of the ERS.

+/- You can only get money from the mines. There are no other ways to gain money (unlike in Generals with the chinese hackers e.g.). Due to fast pacing of the game I really don¬¥t know whether do dislike or to simply ignore that fact.

- Infantry is pretty much useless. Seriously, infantry in C&C Generals was more effective against the toxin general than it is here in the entire game. They do way too little damage, are slow, can be easily crushed by tanks and can¬¥t take much damage. At least their damage they¬¥re dealing out should be higher. If you¬¥re not e.g. charging with 271 Imperial Warriors at the enemy base (like I did) then infantry actually never is a real threat. There are only a few good infantry units which include the tesla trooper (this one is actually pretty good), all tier 3 infantry and the commandos.

- I know it is meant to be a joke but at some points the sexualization of the female commanders is just ludicrous. I mean you just have to type ""C&C Red Alert 3 chicks"" at Google and you get the idea I¬¥m trying to convey. I actually have mainly a problem with the ending cutscene of the Allies and with Natasha. Who in the world would go out in hot pants and a short top at the battlefield? I mean, Tanya e.g. is at least *somewhat* dressed suitable for battlefield and the anime schoolgirl look of Yuriko is just a funny clich√©. All in all that ain¬¥t that much of a problem since it does not damage the gameplay.

- I would have liked to have better counter measures against super weapons. A well defended base can avoid every attempt to destroy the super weapon so in that case you have to build up a huge army to attack the whole base...and this takes time. Maybe too much time. Mostly your doctrine feature + your own super weapon are not enough to destroy an enemy super weapon. 

- Your army is sometimes really strange positioning. Instead of being closer to each other your units are spreading out. Not actually a good plan...usually.

I grew up with the game on the Xbox 360, and I have many more hours on the console version than I do have on the PC. Nonetheless, it is an amazing game, and one I enjoyed immensely at that. It has 3 factions: The Soviets, the Allies, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each of these factions excel at a certain battlefield: The Soviets have the best armor, the Allies have the best air force, and the Empire has the best navy. There are 27 missions, divided up into 3 campaigns. The campaign has a wide variety of characters with their own unique quirks, and they make the campaign extremely enjoyable to play through, and it makes the cutscenes worth watching. The skirmish has a wide diversity of maps, and definitely makes sure you have a new experience of every map, and the co-commanders are unique, allowing you to give specific(albeit not extremely detailed) commands to your AI ally, which can definitely either serve as support for your army, or just as a meat shield to buy time. The game has an extremely great soundtrack to top it off, and the music changes depending on how good or bad you're doing in combat against your foes, and makes it so much more satisfying from coming back from the brink of defeat to complete victory. Definitely one of my favorite RTS games of all time.",1532310940,1532796078,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

My complaint is that it has a lot of bizarre limitations on the units, and it screws up the gameplay. For example, soviet attack helicopters can only attack ground units.

Okay, aside from the decline and obvious negative changes from previous titles, this game is still one of the better strategies out there. Which is sad.

Those things are for example great voice lines that I personally enjoy the most, water just looks awesome and units design is quite interesting. 

But for me personally that is about it. I couldn't come with anything nice to say about this game. To be exact whenever someone mention this game, I start to think really negatively. The game is not entertaining at all.

As far as the story goes, It is by the worst I saw a professional company came up with. It takes a lot of stuff from previous 2 games and by far the most original is the Japanese campaign, which makes sense because this nation was never really playable in RA2 or RA1. Whole scenario don't make any sense, only enterteinment is in Soviet campaign and that's the best it will really get.

The A.I. is so unbelievably dumb that I thought of smashing my computer with hammer. The A.I. has 3 ""characters"" or 3 types of attacks they will use. That means they will go for navy, airforce or ground army. Every nation have it like this and  while it does sound good on paper, It's really dumb idea. Just get scouted, get skype call from your enemy beacuse He must tell you how superior he is and then just build Anti-Air or Anti-ground. You don't really need to care about Navy Generals because the water does not give you any signifacnt advantage over your enemy.

What can I say about balance? It is just so bad that I would cry blood. Look, I get it, Japanese are super-techy with big Laser Tanks and Samurai Robots but this is just horrific. It seems like Japanese for their mobility don't need to sacrifice anything. The counters are just so amazingly bad made, that it is unbelievable. Now you can say that anti-tank troops or cannons should have advantage over their counters (Which I definitely agree), this game takes it to a whole new level.
Anti-Infantry vehicles are getting bonus in damage and protection. It is almost impossible to takeout Javelin trooper with Hammer tank. The damage those tanks do to him is just laughable to say at least.

To end this, I don't really think you should get this game for It's full price. It's boring and badly balanced  something that games should not really be. But that is just my personal opinion you can go play whatever you want, but for me it's no.

However, by some bizarre happenstance, I never had this game until it came up for sale recently, and didn't sit down to really play it until this blizzard snowed me in.

At it's heart, it's got the C&C mechanics from RA2, and some novel ideas and expansions on the original ideas... but the good ends there.

Graphically, the game has aged poorly- it's not unplayably bad, but it definitely looks more like a fan game than an actual C&C installment. Units have these strange, almost jerky idle animations while other graphical effects like particle effects and smoke will appear and dissapear. Not a deal-breaker, but it's a far cry from Generals or some other 3D RTS games released before and since then.

Unit variety is lacking, and has some very serious ballance issues. While the units themselves are creative in their design and function (fighter jets that turn into submarines, for example), the game lacks some good bread and butter fighting units like previous titles have had to fight battles. It feels like an entire army is composed solely of ""special"" weapons, which wouldn't be too bad if some of them didn't have some rather serious shortcomings. The Japanese are at a serious disadvantage to the Soviets and Allies, and the Allies are generally outclassed by the Soviets. Once you've figured out which spam methods work best, there's no challenge.

Speaking of which, the AI is really clunky. While there are certainly worse AI's out there for a single player skirmish, the RA3 AI is hellbent on taking you out no matter the battle conditions, and it's not afraid to straight up spam you in order to win. This becomes a battle of attrition- the games I played all boiled down to setting up defenses between waves, ultimately boiling down to which faction would run out of resources first- it's not terribly exciting, despite the unit types available.

Finally, there's a lot of specialized controls from previous games that are missing from this game. Perhaps they're under different keys or something, but all the keyboard shortcuts I was hoping to use (the most useful being attack ground) were curiously absent.

All in all, RA3 isn't a bad game. I think the story campaign (or what I've played of it so far) has some merit. That they got Tim Curry and George Takei to play some of the characters is rather impressive, so it may be worth it to some of you for the cutscenes alone. However, RA3 pales in comparison to it's predecessors, and indeed to other RTS games that have come after it. On those grounds, I'd advise you to save your money, and play something more deserving of your time.",1523811430,1523811430,False,4,0,0.506240606307983398,1,True,False,False

This game plays like a less serious, slightly more sci fi version of Company of Hereos 2, it shows it's age in terms of how ""basic"" it can feel in comparison and how fairly simple the mechanics can be, along with how gameplay flows, but this is in no way a bad thing, infact it makes the game an ideal introduction to that genre of RTS gaming as it allows one to pick up the basics without too much hassle or harm. The graphics are fairly dated, but even so, quite nice to appreciate as they have a rough cartoon-aspect which means it's not exactly an eyesore like some games can be. 

The thing which sets this up as a game I will no doubt remember and (I have to admit, I already love it for this despite a few hours in) is the effort they put into the movies. The game uses realworld acting which is fairly typical of something you'd expect out of a B-Class war film, so generals with 200 medals, steorotypical characters (Americans are commie hatin' and usually using witty remarks, brits are brits, Russians speak with all the ""Comrade"" stuff and Japanese do the whole ""Honor"" / ""Bushido"" thing) and of course, whenever women are shown they're babes wearing outfits just showing their frame/boobs (Soviets having the most obvious one, Allies having women usually buttons undone on suits/shirts to show ETC). 

The actors they used aren't exactly lame either, we're talking George Takei and the likes, so pretty well known faces in this which usually get placed into these kind of steorotypical roles, so you can clearly see they're enjoying it and quite immersive in that sense. This is also something which is seen in game when they communicate with you, you'll be greeted with actual recorded footage in your minimap which shows some effort to use the fact they had the actors on hand. The greatest thing about this game is it shows how EA used to be before they got greedy, how they're games were built with love, care, attention and a modicum of silliness which is in your face, but also subtle. 

It's a shame this game no longer has officially supported multiplayer and given how EA is now I can imagine if they decided to remake this game it'd be a bastardised version of Company of Heroes 2 with a ridiculous amount of micro-transactions to ruin this wonderful idea they have.

I have high standards since I grew up playing C&C Generals/Generals ZH, which was extremely clean-cut, had plenty of options for warfare, and usually ran quite well. From the perspective of skirmishes (custom games against NPC armies with or without teams), it's not too replayable in my opinion. C&C Generals/ZH had such large maps where you could practically create cities upon cities of new bases as long as you could afford to defend them. Apart from naval units, which Generals didn't have, it just can't compete. The queueing for units and buildings with the Allies and the Japanese is just so slow once you've played Generals. Many would disagree, since similar to Soviet construction, you place buildings down and have to wait a few seconds- sure, but at least you could plan more at the same time, which is exactly what you need and can't have in this game. The AI either does poorly or completely dominates due to CPUs outperforming the player based on timing alone. On Generals, the units would gather and pace themselves just as a player would, but with RA3, you have an environment that is overtly obvious in terms of NPC strategy.
Perhaps if Generals were available on Steam, esepcially Zero Hour, people could relate- but I doubt very many people will.

   * Empire of the rising sun is a great addition for 3rd faction or replacement of yuri from 2's expansion(yuri's revenge)
cons:
   *  in skrimish there is no way to set speed of construction/building of units/buildings (2 have this feature)
   *  in skrimish picking teams are by faction instead of countries (which means less variations)
   *  tanya is awful compare to 2 specially her actor (red hair > blonde)
   *  building construction is different per faction (which means higher difficulty learning curve)
   *  soviet is awful in terms of gameplay
   *  money collection is very awful (limited in quantity, limited placement, no regen so money is finite)
   *  missing some iconic units from 2 (tesla tank, prism tank, mirage tank) (note: mirage tank and prism tank is combined in 3 as one unit with more problematic behavior compare to each of the two)",1523550099,1523550099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As an RTS, it's not a bad game. However, this is primarily NOT the classic Command & Conquer experience, as many fans/purists will tell you. Red Alert 3 came out after EA bought out Westwood Studios, the original masterminds behind C&C, and destroyed them with executive meddling. Also, RA3 came out during that awkward period of time when EA was transitioning their games from Steam over to Origin, so because of that, this is one of the games that exists on both platforms.

I would implore you to check out Red Alert 2 instead, since it's a much better game, although it can only be found on Origin. If you want both RA2 AND RA3, you can buy the C&C Ultimate Collection on Origin for less than the price of RA2/Yuri's Revenge and RA3/Uprising. This will get you both of those plus all of the other C&C games, which is a much better deal. Also keep in mind that since the GameSpy severs shut down RA3 no longer has online multiplayer (though you can still play on LAN).",1349574855,1523387001,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not confusing in a gameplay or story perspective but from the stance that I enjoyed Red Alert 2 and still sometimes play it but this is so inferior yet oddly enough I enjoy it equally if not more. The plot is odd as it involves the Soviet commanders travelling back in time and stopping Albert Enstein develop tech for the allies that lead them to crush the Soviets and basically treat them how the Soviets treated the Germans in 1945. This creates a plot hole though as in the first Red Alert, Albert Enstein travels back in time to kill Hitler in Vienna to prevent him ever coming to power which allows the Soviets to reach the penultimate position of power against the allies, this ruins time lines as it means that Hitler should now come to power but whatever, apparently not and in this world the Soviets are winning instead of losing, but with the loss of Einstein the allies lose their nuclear tech, losing their advantage in the war, but now a third faction has emerged in the form of the Empire of the Rising Sun which threatens both factions.  I enjoy this campaign incredibly so because it takes logic and reason and throws them out the window and just lets you enjoy the game. There are 3 campaigns depending on who you chose either Allied, Soviet and EotRS. All three campaigns are unique in their own respect and actually differenciate immensely and are not just reskins per mission. In terms of gameplay, the Allies are very contemporary and have tech that's more geared towards pacification and having prototype super weapons, the Soviets are more gritty and industrial and are more aggressive than the allies defensive and the EotRS is clean and futuristic but their units can be ground anti-air one second and bombers the next being very anime inspired (probably why they're my least favourite faction). This game is immensely fun and can as far as I can tell compared to the console version has no unit cap although the amount of ore you get per game is finite, so once you run out, you've got to ensure that army you've built can survive the onslaught of enemies, although you never seem to run out of resources, I've only played one game where it got to that stage, My main complaint with this game is the weird sexualization of it, like don't get me wrong, I like girls and their physical characteristics without getting too overt, but for some reason, they took a camp and vaguely parody like game series and decided to cast ex playboy models as lead actresses which goes as well as you can imagine. Still it's a very well made game, just inferior slightly to previous games and so I give it a 7/10, due to being not as complex or as deep as RA2, and the weird sexualization in the game but other than that it's absolutely fine.",1522903329,1522903329,True,13,20,0.651585876941680908,21,True,False,False

Full review:

Take this with a pinch of salt as I havent actually played red alert 2.

Broadly speaking, the game runs very well. It's smooth, easy to learn, and the factions are very different in both playstyle and asthetic. The soundtrack is simply fantastic and find myself listening to it even while not playing the game(something worth mentioning is the fact that each of the factions has a different style of music, which I will generally go over later). The fact that the developers purposefully avoid a german 'Nazi' faction has put the game in an interesting place where the Japanese faction has arose from all other imperial nations to become a rising power, and it was probably a good choice as I personally feel that a german faction would feel too much like the others in most aspects.The maps are fantastic with a good average mix, some destoyable environments and differing amounts of cover for infantry.

Onto faction specifics:

Soviets:
Construction style - Continuous, in field
Strongest unit types - Ground vehicles
Weakest unit types - Cnfantry
Music - Orchestral/vocal choir
General playstyle - Slow but hard hitting
The sovient campaign is wacky to say the least, with the final level being semi-stealth based. While not the most fun of all the campaigns, it was certainly interesting with some good level design.
Noticable actors:
-Tim Curry (The Clown from Stephen King's it! (1990))
-Ivana Miliƒçeviƒá (Valenka from Casino Royale (2006))
-Peter Stomare (Czernobog from American Gods (2017))

NATO:
Construction style - Built in base then you choose where to place afterwards
Strongest unit types - Naval units
Weakest unit types - Infantry
Music - Rock
general playstyle - Medium speed with a good, well-rounded feel
The aliies/NATO campaign is the weakest of the bunch, but that doesnt mean it isn't good. There is a clear feeling of melancholy in the first mission and it ends on a high note, but generally the other campaigns are better.
Noticable actors:
-JK Simmons (Fletcher from Whiplash(2014))
-Jonathan Pryce (High Sparrow from Game of Thrones (2015-2016))

The Empire of the Rising Sun:
Construction style - Build units that can move and set up anywhere as buildings
Strongest unit types - Infantry
Weakest unit types - Air units
Music - Oriental dubstep-electro
General playstyle - Faster but slightly flimsier
The empire's campaign is by far the most enjoyable and well-designed with a mixture of low-unit-count stealth missions to rampaging through a city as a huge ronin samurai mech, I loved every second.

Instead of a buddy joining in and controlling half your force, rather, half the army is already divided between you and an AI partner which gets in the way or bugs out on you. If for example, the game has a mission where you get a super unit, there's a good chance the AI will control it and you have to sit on your hands while it follows you around behind your force. I know there's an option to give four basic commands to the AI like 'attack here, hold this position', but the AI might wander off and draw aggro from a mob of dudes you didn't intend to pull.

Cute game, decent polish, campy as the CnC:RA usually is, but the forced 'solo AI co-op' play really hamstrings any fun you could try to have with it. Dawn of War 2 handled co-op play better where a player buddy would just take command of  pre-chosen squads, this game however, doesn't really feel right, no surprise it's at bargain bin prices wherever I look on steam and gray market sites.

Support powers add a bit interesting gameplay, along with the Threat-level bar (the higher it is, the faster your units in combat gain veterency,e.i more damage and self heal). Each unit has a special ability (some are really annoying) and switching between abilities in a timely manner is something that can mean the difference between life and death for your units. One big change from other C&C games (and one I definitely hate) is that the resource element of the game has been dum-downed to a mostly finite system, where as in other C&C games, the resources usually regrow (granted at a slow pace).

Don't be fooled by my playtime on Steam; I played the retail disc over and over.

Pro:
- Three distinct factions with distinct playstyles. Each faction receives their own campaign, which are satisfying enough.
- Naval combat is greatly expanded compared to the older RA games. Most buildings are amphibious.
- Gorgeous visual effects, especially for anything that happens over water. Modern hardware handles all the realtime lighting and reflections with aplomb and the result is a feast for the eyes.
- Very, very beautiful water indeed. 
- Co-op campaign gameplay. Sometimes the players fight side-by-side while other times they perform completely different duties.
- Each and every unit now comes with a secondary function. These functions either give the units another attack or trasnforms them into something else entirely.
- Unit countering is heavily based on the use of secondary functions, for better or for worse.
- Blatantly overpowered RA2 units return with heavy, if sometimes too heavy, nerfs. 

Con:
- Absolutely HUGE amounts of campiness. I've always thought that the campiness in RA was a side effect of its political satire (President ""Dugan"" = President Reagan); EA has proven me so, so wrong. 
- Very, VERY overly and unnecessarily sexualized women. Blatant sexual innuendo all over the place. Tanya in RA2 was hot, but a badass kind of hot. Not so in RA3. They're pin-up models. They practically squeeze their cleavage in your face.
- Factions are characters are heavily stereotypical and borderline offensive. The Soviets are pictures as inept baffoons drunk on ""World Communism"", the Allied are muscleheads screaming ""freedom"", ""justice"" and ""MURICA"", while the Empire of the Rising Sun (Japanese) are a collage of how Anime and other Japanese/Asian culture are perceived by the mainstream West, with giant walking mechas, transforming machines and soldiers wearing cone hats.
- Generally poor unit balancing. The Soviets dominate the ground, the Allies dominate the skies while the Empire dominates the sea. This does force players to use combined arms and those secondary functions more often.
- Cartoonish colour theme. All colours are bright and highly saturated. Unit and structure design is again cartoonish and stereotypical.
- VERY bad AI pathing. See my review of Tiberium Wars.",1515091252,1515091252,False,0,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

I have played  sc2  for many years and i wanted to try something else.
So far i ve only played more russian and mostly versus the ai.

There are many good things about this in comparison to sc2:

-The base building aspect feels a lot more like a base ,you can only build near you con yard 
so no cannon rush bs. You can add walls to your base even at an early game that also adds to the base concept.

-Factions have unique playstyle and with good scouting you can counter most cheese tactics.

-Feels more micro intensive with things like reverse movement for some of the units
but also because the ai is older much like sc1.

-No building upgrades.

-Units upgrade the more they fight.

-There are structures across the map where you can capture and get bonuses like
self repairing vehicles, health for troopers  etc.

-Default shortcut keys are much more meaninglefull and easy to memorize
for new players though you can customize.

-In sc2 there are ground units and air units , in ra3 there are also water units and you can even 
build structures on it.

Really regret not playing this earlier.

The game doesn't offer anything new beyond what we already saw in RA2 - but somehow, it's not as fun. From the very beginning the missions were uninspired, the only challange apparently being moving units from A to B and then clicking on enemy units to destroy them.

The story is a joke with no attempts to even pretend that it's serious, almost as if it came from a completely different franchise than RA1. Remember playing that first mission in RA1 where Stalin orders you to take out resistance in a village? The entire presentation of the game was so authentic, brutal, and instantly captivating. Instead, RA3 offers us something more akin to a Z-rated flik on the sci-fi channel.

I wish I had read the player reviews before purchasing this game (as well as the entire C&C bundle). I read critic reviews, which of course (mostly) gave glowing reviews. With their propensity to give every random trash game 4/5 stars, the critics have failed the gaming public again.

It has a decent singleplayer and skrimish mode too.

EDIT: EA being the greedy pigs they are have shut down the online servers. So no more online multiplayer. You can still play on community servers but it requires additional software. And that program doesn't always work well.

The music is epic. It really makes you feel that you are fighting a war. The music also adatps to your current situation. When you are in middle of fight a rock plays, when you do nothing major it's pop-song and when you are loosing the fight, a sad song plays.

It has a 3 factions, Allies (Americans), Soviets (Russians), Empire of the Rising Sun (Japan). Although they all have their powerfull cards, I would say that it's easiest to win with Soviets. Japs have amazing ships and strong infantry, but they require so much electricity. The amount of reactors you need to build is stupid. And once your power is down the defence turrets switch off and things get very ugly.

Allies have really good variety of airplanes and good laser based defence. The chronoshephe is also useful tech.
Although the tanks are rather weak and infantry is pathetic.

On the other hand Soviets have all around good tanks, strong defence, decent ships and planes. And those ridiculous Air-ships. (Forgot thier name) They are slow but overpowered as fuck. Once the enemy builds a handful of them (8, 16) and you don't have an uber air defence then it's GAME OVER.

This game could be even better then C&C Generals Zero:Hour because of the naval units however it has two mayor flaws.
1st: Is the grid. The grid is just a nuisance. It does nothing but takes away the fun and freedom to build the way you want. Some people say that grid helps them to place their buildings properly. Well if you can't place your buildings without a help then you must have a serious handicap.
2nd: Is the fact that you are reliant on exhaustible resources. Mining is the only way to make money in this game. And once the ore mines run out you can't build/train anymore. You can still mine but only tiny amouts which is enough just to keep yourself alive but not for fighting. Whereas in Generals you can build Black Markets or train hackers to accumulate cash. In addition it proves to be lot more effective than mining.

In the end I would recommend playing but not buying it.",1403793758,1511624034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would recommend to those who would like to get into the RTS genre, as it doesn't require too much micromanagement nor too much thought. Jump into a quick game of skirmish and have a blast for half an hour. The story is okay, as it was interesting enough for me to play through all three campaigns in two days. The soundtrack is one of the biggest selling points, as it cues in music that makes you feel like a badass when you destroy an army of mechas or tanks. The characters are people that you will recognize sometimes, and tend to make you chuckle a bit here and there. The graphics still hold up today, and the attention to the simple idle animations for the troops amazes me to this day.

This is a well rounded Triple AAA title RTS (Real Time Strategy) game with over-the-top cutscenes and missions. The story of Red Alert 3: Basically the Soviet Union was on the brink of defeat, so they developed a time machine to go back in time and assasinate Albert Einstein, the Only cause of the Allies' Technological advancements. With that, they change the future And Spawning A third enemy, The Empire of the rising Sun.




Every Faction has its own way of building factories and expanding their base. For examle,The empire uses Nano Cores that unfurl into per say, The seaport.


THE SOUNDTRACK: This has to be one of the best soundtracks Ive heard in a long time with returm of Hell's March from the older red alert games

I've seen many a review comparing this game to its predecessor, so take them for what they're worth. I haven't played RA2, so this review is purely on the merits of this game alone. 

So you like RTS games? Well, you will probably like this game.

You like being entertained? This game is probably for you too.

As a gamers game, this is not the most in depth RTS you'll ever play. 

However, as a peice of digital entertainment that you can storm through in a few days then not play again, at the price it is now, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. 

If you really end up liking the game and want to try your hand at multiplayer, then don't fear, because the community ressurected it with a new tool called CnCOnline that behaves in the same way at the old Gamespy servers. Sure, it's not perfect, but it does the job. Be warned though, due the amount of time that many of the remaining PvP-ers have been playing you might find yourself getting beaten into the ground for a while. They're all pretty good people though, and you'll find them at the gamereplays website organising a tournament (for cash, sometimes) and discussing strategies.",1324399609,1505659916,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

*I also really liked Red Alert 2 & Yuri's Revenge, and played them for years and years, offline and online.

*Moving on to Red Alert 3. This game is no where near as nice as the previous game, it has had much less effort put into it, which shows on every aspect, I will highlight a few negatives comapred to the previous games:
-The Campaign is very superficial, always the same scenario, no exiting plot-twists etc - basically the story is lame.
-The game is very simplified. For example, wtf is with the specially allocated slots for the ore-mines, and the fact that ore-mines themselves have been 'simplified'. 
-Unit diversity has also decreased, oh what fun units Yuri's Revenge had. Those Scorched Earth Iraq soldiers, and all of Yuri's mindcontrolling units.
-The comedy aspect of the game is overdone fueling the superficial feeling. The video acting is retarded. Okay, there are some big names such as J.K.Simmons and the High Sparrow from Game of Thrones, but it really is one big joke for them, you can tell.
-There is no feeling of battle, the game is like a comedy legoland game played with toys. (Previous games were much better).
-In battle, depending on difficulty, AI is either literally retarded and does nothing, or is tremendously overpowered and just steamrolls you.

*Anyway I would've wanted to have liked this game after all these years, but I don't. I think its an insult to the Red Alert name.
5/10.

It's the last command and conquer game that was actually good (because command and conquer 4 was a dissaster and I'm sure we can all agree on that). Gameplay is fun easy to learn and can get really in depth. If you like to micro manage things on an rts this is the game for you, every unit has its own ability, some of them really cool and some of them basic. The campaign is long and will take you a while to beat, they really put a lot of effort into it and the skirmishes against the AI are fun.

Multipalyer - If you want to get into this game for the multiplayer I'm not to sure about that. The servers have been shut down, but I do beleive ther is a mod out the that makes it so you can play against other people. LAN games are also a thing.

Modding - This game has mod support and there are a lot of mods out there for it.

In the end, if you're looking for multiplayer, don't buy this game (unless you dedicate yourself to LAN battles) but if you're looking for a good rts with a lot of in depth strategy, fun challenging AI, and a good campaign, this game is for you.

This game also has some pretty good music, you can tell where they put a lot of effort into the game because it always shows.

Personally I mostly preferred RA over Tiberium, but that is mostly a personal choice as there are dedicated fanbases for all three universes (Tiberium/Red Alert/Generals).
But even though I like RA2 better, I cannot deny that there are things RA3 did better, but mostly you can describe it as a number of changes, some good (special abilities for units), some bad (plastic toys and making the japanese commando wear a sailor. goddamn) and that horrible decision considering ressource gathering (changing from open ore fields to ore depots, took a lot of strategy considering harassing and economy out of the game.)
Since Steam doesn't have RA2 you probably won't get it unless you buy it on Origin (recommending the C&C complete collection, ranging from the original C&C to Red Alert 3.

17480,33349998,76561198009463101,0,28,1687,0,1290,1616969396,"What I liked:
+The three factions are quite different in both their units, and even base building nuances. For example, the Soviet buildings are present on the field while they're under construction, the Allies only place their buildings on the field when they're done, and the Rising Sun build cores that unfold into buildings, allowing multiple buildings to be constructed simultaneously with one construction yard.
+Most buildings can be constructed on water and a lot of units are amphibious.
+Nice cutscenes


What I disliked:
-Changes to resource gathering. Instead of gathering resources from the fields, the ore miners now just drive to a nearby container filled with a limited supply of ore. Aside from the fact that I find this kind of resource gathering to be boring, I also found it more annoying to manage resources. Especially when most ore containers in the single player missions are usually already occupied and/or far away.
-Poor pathfinding at times. For example, in one Allies mission, my units kept getting stuck midway because they decided that they could reach their destination through a cliff, instead of by going through the beach right next to it.
-My units frequently ignored anything that didn't pose an immediate threat (basically, enemy units and defensive structures), unless I specifically ordered them to attack something. So, they could stand in the middle of an enemy base, but won't attack structures like power plants unless I specifically tell them to do so.
-Commander abilities are mostly ineffective

What I'm neutral on:
*Co-comanders sounds like a nice idea, but AI-controlled co-commanders weren't all that helpful in some missions, while official co-op/multiplayer support has been dropped.
*Each unit having special abilities. I never really made much use of them because for some units, they wouldn't always work (especially for dogs and bears), for some units, the special ability is basically just gain a buff or something at the cost of self-inflicting damage over time, and in other cases, it was just too much trouble to micro manage them with not enough benefit to bother.

I'm honestly neutral on this game. It's a nice game on its own, but I didn't enjoy it as much as RA2. Since I'm only given a binary yes/no choice on recommendation, I have to pick that I wouldn't recommend it. The overall feeling of the game just wasn't that impressive.",1499450775,1499450775,False,10,0,0.581966042518615723,0,True,False,False

Today we go back to a classic of the RTS Genre, Command & Conquer:  Red Alert 3; a game that some call the best of the series and for the most part I agree.  However, the real question is:  Does it stand the test of time?  The short answer is, aside from a few small areas, it does!  Even today the mechanics and design holds up for the most part.  I didn‚Äôt find myself massively missing some kind of function or ability, though some of the keybindings are odd (queue commands I‚Äôm looking at you).

Commanding Satire:  The game‚Äôs story revolves around its trademark style; live action characters with silly or somewhat poorly done CG.  This is all kind of tongue in cheek with a hint of taking itself too serious in the name of satire; there are absolutely parts of cringe and I still found myself amused.  There are some scenes and some underlying ‚Äòconcerns‚Äô for some people.  Notably the endings which have the commander being invited by the female characters in some fashion; I don‚Äôt have issue with this but some with more modern issues might have.

Lost in Time:  So there are some issues with the mechanics, many of which are very much hindsight type of problems but there are the typical pathing issues that many old games have but overall not terrible.  In addition; you get some quality of life areas that could be improved upon; namely queuing up things (looking at you Rising Sun Nano-Cores) or abilities (fly here, transform, attack, transform, come back).  For the most part I‚Äôm probably just spoiled by modern games but it does need mentioning.  Another thing that annoys me is the campaigns over abundance of naval missions‚Ä¶except for the Rising Sun ones which I feel I needed more (spoiler they like their boats) but I was a big fan of the unit descriptions and the overall tutorial missions; more games need this.

Glorious History:  I feel this is a game that most people need to play if they are new to the RTS scene and want to know about where the modern games come from.  However, this being a old game there is one serious annoyance and that is co-op.  To begin with co-op doesn‚Äôt exist; even if you had a friend who wanted to play you can‚Äôt the game uses the now gone Gamespy servers and not the steam one.  To make matters worse your AI commander is daft beyond recognition; so many times he was wiped out or down to just a few small buildings and I‚Äôm still sharing resources; or even worse, he‚Äôs just building infantry for what is supposed to be a naval encounter.

Overall:  I like this game; I recommend it to anyone wanting to walk down memory lane or to show a younger player the old days.  If it is on sale; grab it but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd recommend paying full price unless you absolutely must have.  But, I waited for a sale, and I encourage you do to the same.

But how would I recommend this? I will try separating both opinions based on

1) General point of view 

2) Long time fan point of view

For general point of view:
- Worth for co-op play with friends
- 3 faction singleplayer campaigns that‚Äôs worth your time 
- Game mods (like Paradox, & Generals 2 mod for eg)
- A good return of commander abilities. 
- Fun naval combat, plus+ you can build your bases on sea

For a long time fan, RA3 is a bit of downgrade from Red Alert 2 in-terms of:
- Sub-factions that was the staple part of Red Alert series, was completely removed
- ‚ÄúGems‚Äù that was a second resource of Red Alert series, was completely removed
- Some infantry in Red Alert 3 are now less effective against vehicles, not like they used to in RA 2 & 1.

This will fuck you off in later stages where there are full enemy forces ready to engage you at the drop of a hat

Pros:
Graphics- released on 2008 and still have good details unlike previous games and last franchise of command and conquer. The game is not dark and gritty but colorful which makes managing unit quite easy. Texture and tone somewhat similar to Starcraft 2.

Gameplay-managing economy is quite easy and its fast paced. Micro and Macro is quite improved if you only just played Red alert 2. Each faction are unique style. Each faction have their own strength and weakness. 

Ai: Ai have different personalities to making them challenging.

Campaign: story and campaign isn't bad but the structure of campaign gameplay is a mess so you will caught off guard quite often. Allied campaign is the best in this game. The rest are a meh especially the newest faction in red alert franchise.

Cons:
EA abandon this product so there is no mp except you use the unofficial mp.

Gameplay: Some people will never like this fast paced gameplay. Turtling strategy isn't quite rewarding due to limited resources. Also Superweapon are easy to be built due there quite cheap.

Ai: some Ai in Skirmish are brain dead so some of them are easy like Oleg Ai doesn't build AA unit in medium difficulty. Even defense sturcture Ai will likely build a sentry gun oppose to flak cannon in medium difficuly. Higher difficulty have cheats so turtling in that mode is quite punishing.

Bugs: There are some pathfinding issue so it is much better to macro your units well.

If you like fast pace strategy game then you will like this game. Most match I have 10 mins to 20 mins against Ai.",1498979462,1498979462,True,9,0,0.587376832962036133,0,True,False,False

The allies have Tanya,a demolitions specialist that can one shot most ground infantry and can sneak inside vehicles or buildings to one shot them from the inside with C4.Tanya can also use her special belt to warp back in time to regain lost health.The Reds have Natasha,the greatest sniper in the Soviet Army,and she uses her sniper rifle to line enemies up and shoot through them all at the same time.She can also paint vehicles or buildings with a laser and have a bomber come by and one-shot them. The Empire of the Rising Sun has Yuriko Omega,a badass psychic in a schoolgirl outfit who can use her powers to instantly take a unit out of the fight permanently.She can also use her AoE attack and instantly kill units around her. Every faction has their own unique units and almost all of them are super fun to play around with. The allies have these helicopters that can each freeze one enemy unit and keep them there indefinitly stuck in cryostasis until the helicopter is destroyed.Each faction feels unique and varied and this makes the game incredibly more interesting and fun to play.

[b]FMV[/b]

In case you didn't know,before games used incredible CGI cutscences they used FMV (Full Motion Video). These were played with real actors and personally I think they look way better than the cutscenes of today but that's besides the point. The FMV scenes in RA:3 are superbly done and add so much to the atmosphere of the game,making it feel significantly more real. These scenes actually make you understand the characters and the situations better and that helps out the gameplay and the story both.

[b]General Powers[/b]
Each faction has a singleplayer-only set of general powers. These powers can sometimeseffect battles greatly. These powers include things like setting up small bombs as the allies,to calling in drone kamikaze squads as the japanese, or even making it rain satellite debris as the reds. These powers can seriously give you an advantage by ambushing units when they're least expecting it or unveiling a secret group of cloaked units.

[h1]Cons[/h1]

[b]Story[/b]
The story in this game is weird as can be. It involves Russia losing a war with the allies and then going back in time,killing Albert Einstein, and then coming back to a world where the allies are in a stalemate and a new faction of Japanese fanatics has emerged. Seems interesting but it's executed very poorly as the game could have made this work and turned it into something great but instead decided that they would make the game less serious and more funny and silly. The dialogue is so predictable sometimes and at other times the accents of some of the characters begin to fall apart and as you would expect,the game suffers greatly from it.

[b]Missions[/b]
Most of the missions in this game are actually pretty alright but there are a few,about halfway through each campaign where the game shoots up in difficulty. For example,one of the american missions puts you against the army of a rogue president whos incredibly well dug in and you're timed to break right into the middle of it to try and race him to a launch facility.Missions like this are never a good idea to put into and RTS game and much less to have both terrible missions and an insane difficulty spike.

After the defeat of the Soviet Union Alliance, the desperate leaders of the Soviet Union decided to try out his trump card ‚Äî the time machine. In the end, they fall in the past and successfully eliminate such a person as albert Einstein, thus, not allowing the Alliance to develop technically, but all of a sudden, there is another strong point ‚Äî the Empire of the Rising Sun, which is not going to take any more totalitarian barbarians side, and the democratic capitalists of the West.
Graphics:
Then a lot at a pretty decent level! Sorry, there are no weather effects (rain, snow, fog, etc.) at all locations is always the same‚Äî Sunny weather, there's no such thing as day/night, and where all of this could be used for tactical purposes. It would be much more fun.
The sounds and music:
The sounds and music of a military March with a touch of metal to the mighty anthem of the Soviet Union and the shiny pop singers. There are even a few tracks famous Frank klepacki, who has previously worked on the soundtrack of the old games of the series and showed himself only the good side. Always cheerful, uplifting spirit of the music the game has.
Monologues:
If you long click on units they give an interesting and even amusing phrase: ""Should have seen us Vladimir Ilyich!"", ""Here is the account for electricity!"", ""In turn, you sons of bitches!"", ""I'm clean I swear!"", etc. With the humor in the game no problem, everything is all comrades, Americans want power, and the Japanese are very spiritual nation. The stereotype of the absurd, and just makes you smile.

If you play C&C you are already use to the cheesy cutscenes and the cheesy in-game dialog, if not well you will be seeing a lot of it. The Campaign is pretty good, story is alright and makes sense if you have played the previous RA games. The main issue from me is that the game is very unbalanced. The Empire of the Rising Sun is a lot more powerful than the other factions, you just need a little skill. That being said Campaign is short (About 9 hours if you skip the cutscenes and such for all 3 campaigns) and the community is dead as of right now for multiplayer(Well more dead you can find the odd match but your better off playing with friends). Its a great game for its time its just that it has now aged and thus is a little more obsolete then the other RTS' on the market. Buy it but makes sure you have buddies to play it with as Multiplayer is very fun and with a bunch of friends it can get crazy and super fun.

I would give it a solid 6.5/10 and here is why it looses points.

0.5 off for the cheesy in game dialog, which is often misleading and can lead inexperienced players to ruin a campaign game
3 off for the game inbalance as The Empire is just rediculously powerful with all of its multi-units(Good against two types of units just by clicking a button) and their build and weapon power.
1 off for the lack of a strong multiplayer base and reliance on playing with friends(Not always bad but not everyone has friends who want to buy a game to only play it a few hours a week or less)",1495864117,1495864554,True,2,0,0.504950523376464844,0,True,False,False

The 3 factions don't really play much diffrently if at all, unlike 2. And the diffrences that are there are very minor. 2 was just a better game in every way.

The AI cocommanders are hugely inferior to the enemy to the point that all they are is a punching bag for the enemy AI until you get your shit together. Its a terrible and boring design that ends up making every single mission feel just about the same later in the game excluding big set peice missions.

Why did they force micro managing into this game? RTS that make me worry about every single units secondary weapon is just stupidly annoying and clumsy.

There are three factions available, all with their own unique play style, and sets of weaknesses and strengths. Compared to Red Alert 2, the differences are more stark, and it goes from units to base-building styles. In addition to that, every faction has 3 different AI's, with their own play-styles.

If you're looking for a ""serious"" RTS, I'd suggest looking elsewhere, but RA3 is quite light hearted and cheesy(in an appealing kind of way), especially when it comes to acting and outfits in the campaign videos. Overall, it creates a feeling of a B grade movie from the mid 2000's, again, in a good way.

As for issues, I would say that the balance is a little off, and the Empire gets slightly preferntial treatment, compared to the classic Soviets and Allies, but it's quite easily circumvented, as the effectiveness of your chosen faction is dictated by your own skill, and knowledge of each unit's strengths and weaknesses.

- Solid gameplay
- Not one glitch recorded, personally, since playing.
- Live action sutscenes can be cheesey, with hints of casual racism and sexism, but honestly one of the reasons C&C is a nostalgic and well remembered title.
- Campaign tiers are immediately unlocked allowing access to all three nations from the get-go.
- Although there is an unified arc to each scenario each ending is unique  meaning you dont have to complete campaigns in any order, However I would recommend starting at the Soviets if you are new to the game and its mechanics.

[h1]In conclusion,[/h1]

A nostalgic blast from almost a decade ago that still lives up well to its modern counterparts. I bought the game on sale, that being said I would buy it for the Steam RRP.

First and foremost if you looking to get nostalgic on this game, DON'T. Apart from the soundtrack and few live action this is almost entirely new game since the construction of each fatcion is different(and also most unit have ability) different types of upgrade etc. Several hours in and I felt disspointed in the level of camera zoom provided as some unit are too small and when I try to zoom in to select a unit it just wasn't close enough, To add to my dissapoint ment is the left clicking order issue( seems to deselect the unit everytime I auto left clicking too fast) and guess what? This totally ruins my expactation in my 1st campaign and the main menu is just...... too bland, just look at Ra2 main menu back when westwood is in charge of it, this look like some fresh graduate design it on flash. Other than this I have nothing to complain as I have only few minutes in.

Don't be mistaken, it is a solid game. When you carry the Command & Conquer franchise, however,  the expectations are different.

This franchise was one of the leading names in real-time strategy and held strong for a few years despite having major opponents on the market such as Total Annihilation, Age of Empires and, last but certainly not least, Starcraft. Then came Electronic Arts and their desire to expand. They wanted quality brand names quick and easy to augment their grasp on the video game world and it turned out whoever was in charge of Virgin Interactive at the time thought it would be a good idea to help them in their quest by selling them Westwood Studios, the guys who made the Command & Conquer franchise famous worldwide. Now, I wasn't part of Westwood and the same probably goes for whoever reads this, but it does seem Westwood wasn't the same as soon as it became part of EA. This would be one of the many examples of how big video game corporation somehow often find a way to destroy a great studio and/or franchise. When EA decided to effectively terminate Westwood, it had nothing to do with the Westwood of the old days. As a matter of fact, apparently, not even a single pre-EA Westwood employee was remaining.

But enough for the history lesson, let's talk about the game.

In the previous Red Alert games, the game would have you focus on collecting ressources. In this one, it rather emphasizes on unit control and practically abandons the mining dynamic. In the older games, your collectors would travel across the map in order to get the minerals. In RA3, the mines are inside your base area. That means you'll probably always collect your minerals no matter what happens on the battlefield. This downgrades the game right from the start. Because of this, there is a profound strategic element that is taken away from the game. In most RTS game, ressource collecting is crucial and therefore you have to act quickly in order to collect as much as possible. Now, you barely have to think about ressources. Even worse: collectors don't bring as much ressources as they used to. You will more than often find yourself lacking the sufficient funds needed to actually do something on the battlefield. It's obvious that this was done because the team behind RA3 thought it would be a good idea to slow down the game a little so that it would be easier for newcomers. Big mistake.

Red Alert 3 wouldn't be part of the series if not for the over-the-top units. They are relatively well-balanced in most cases. Unfortunately, since the game is built on slower ore mining, you won't be able to produce many units and send an entire platoon towards the battle unless you camp for an extended period of time. You'll often find yourself rolling your thumbs, waiting for that soldier, tank, ship or plane to come out of the building.

There are many units taken from the previous Red Alerts and you sometimes feel like the creative minds behind this third opus got lazy. If you were familiar with the franchise, you quickly notice that the whole game is even more colorful and wacky than before. Clearly, they also were told to reduce violence and to appeal to a younger audience. Turns out the game ends up being extremely cartoony even for a Red Alert game.

There's also, like all the other Command & Conquer games, a huge amount of cinematics with real actors. And there are a lot of well-known names there. You wonder how much money was spent on the game versus the casting for the cinematics!

Solo campaigns are relatively entertaining. There are scripted events which can be frustrating. For example, you will build a base according to the current enemy's location. Some time later, the map expands and another enemy pops out from an area you weren't expecting to exist. I mean, you're a commander and the fate of the world is in your hands. Can't you get your intel team to give you the bigger map right away?

The AI is not very smart. In campaigns, it will participate in scripted events by doing scripted unit movements. Other times, it will just send predictable ""squad"" attacks that you will, the vast majority of times, crush easily. Sometimes I wonder if the ""hard"" difficulty simply means that the AI gets more minerals than usual and thus can produce more units. Personally, I never saw a ""change of behavior"" from the AI besides seeing it sending more units faster. For example, they don't seem to target specific buildings in your base like a normal human player would do. If I saw a player with a lot of turrets, I'd target the power plants and so on... But the AI doesn't do that. So, yeah, the AI is dumb. Of course, the same can be said for the skirmish game mode with one or multiple AIs, but then again, the computer has never been very good at Command & Conquer and the same can be said for other RTS games anyway. It's no big deal although you'd expect that - when it was released - they would've found a way to make it more challenging and less mechanical. Too bad that the online multiplayer part of the game - where you could get real challenge - is dead, but I guess that, somewhere out there, there's a community of Red Alert fans who managed to solve that problem.

Overall, even though I've been mostly negative, the game is good. Not great. Good. It's not as satisfying as Red Alert 1 and 2, but it still, somehow, holds the flag despite being the worst of the franchise. There are worst RTS games out there, trust me.

On a side note, I've always prefered the Soviets ( I always enjoyed their dirty, in-your-face attitude, weaponry and buildings ) but I must admit that the Allies have the best girls once again... Why, God, why? Maybe I should use a time machine too to fix this issue... Or maybe I could go and shake hands with the EA CEO. ;)",1486098748,1486098994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Red Alert 3 is a decent, yet confused real time strategy game.  

Good:  
1. I love that you have proper movies in between missions, even though the acting is over the top.  It fits fantastically with the less than realistic game.  The game is worth playing just for the videos. 
2. Interesting units. Land, air and sea.
3. Good balance between factions. 

Bad: 
4. Every unit has one, and only one, special ability. It works better if some units have no special abilities and others are spell casters with lots of abilities. 
5. The game is confused.  Red Alert and Red Alert 2 were amazing old style slow strategy games.  Those games were all about careful resource management - not unit management. RA3 tries to find a middle ground to a faster pace and more focus on unit management.  As result it falls in between, succeeding at neither style. 

Ugly:
6. the psychic Japanese girl never features in any video.

One day, EA published RA3. I was so excited when I saw what it had to offer. I got the disk version and started right away. I was overwhelmed by all the new changes, like amphibious buildings and secondary abilities. It felt like I was that complete noob again.

A couple years later, I retook my master's status here and mained Empire of the Rising Sun. I then bought the Steam version recently during a sale so my Steam friends can see that I play games other than TF2. This game is so visually and auditorily amazing, and it is probably one of the most balanced RTS's I've ever played.

It's still fun, and it's different enough from other CnC games (in a good way, unlike CnC 4) to stand out on it's own. Like, there's a pretty interesting balance between naval and ground combat that doesn't make either feel like an afterthought, and the campaigns, while campy with pointless fanservice and mindnumbing writing, offer diverse scenarios.

Now, one thing I really hate, it has lots of unnecesseary micro. Not only is the game full of hard counters so you have to order around units so they wouldn't get owned by their counters while concentrating their fire onto weakest targets, pretty much every unit has it's own gimmick special, be it a special attack or alternative fire mode, so the amount of unnecesseary micro is unberable. Red Alert 2 kept it way more simple, and if unit had several firing modes you wouldn't need to switch between them, meanwhile here it's not even Starcraft or CoH levels of micro. Worst offender is the new third faction, Empire of the Rising Sun. They have probably the most of alternative modes due to sizeable chunk of their force being transformers like a machinegun mecha that switches into a fighter and such, and you can't switch back for some time like you get with, say, Starcraft 2 vikings, so it's rather annoying.",1480334653,1480334653,True,0,1,0.49751242995262146,0,True,False,False

Westwood's legendary C&C franchise hit it's high point with this one, beginning just before the climax of Red Alert 2 the Soviets rewrite history by going back in time and eliminating Einstein (oh the anvil of irony) in order to remove the Allies' technological advantage but, in the process, birth a new superpower, the Empire of the Rising Sun, and thu the War of the Three Powers begins with a japanese invasion of the USSR.

Gampelay wise this is pretty much the same Red Alert goodness but with the extra unit/superweapon powers added to C&C3. The Red Alert series has always added more emphasis on Air/Naval power so they took the next logical step and added seaborne bases as well was making a number of units amphibious (Empire probably wins on that score with the amphibious tank though) but C&C is one of the few game series that believed in ""If it ain't broke..."" (at least until they did break everything in C&C4...) and Red Alert 3, for my money is the best in the franchise. However Gameplay is largely irrelevant here, the true value in this game lies in it's story and cast. It's as cheesy and stupid as hell as the previous C&C games but that is what makes this series so damn good, especially since Red Alert's lighter tone compared to the gloomy post-apocalyptic Tiberum series allows for what can only be described as bacon-ribs levels of ham acting and it is glorious and what better way to highlight the magnificence of this than getting Tim Curry to be your villain for the evening, this man and J.K. Simmons actively compete to see who can devour the most scenery as the Soviet Premier and U.S. President respectively whilst George Takei provides a subtle but still pretty cheesy performace as the Emperor of Japan. Add to this Johnathan Pryce's slightly bewildered Supreme Allied Commander and Randy Coture and you've got yourself the best cast in C&C history. 

If you want a game thats just sheer pleasure and over-the-top fun but still retains a tried-and-true formula that worked right up until EA screwed it up to bury the franchise to concentrate on ten thousand unecessary sports titles then this is the game for you.

This combined with over the top cheesy dialogue and bad acting makes almost every moment of RA3 cringeworthy. while cheesy and bad acting is staple of the C&C series its used sparingly, the developers decided to take it a notch up and put it everywhere. pair this with bad taste (the japanese defending pearl harbour from the allies) one just cant help but question the idea behind the game.

Gameplay mechanics have been changed a bit, now instead of having harvesters going for ore, we have deposits where we can build refineries right beside it. our harvesters need only move a very short distance, which totally eliminates the old strategy of economic harassing. the game economics has moved towards something like dawn of war where its critinal to capture ""strategic points"" to ensure a large economy. 

the factions are now full of ""over the top units"", allies have helis that shrink vehicles, soviets have cannons that shoot ""cannonball men"" (paratroopers) and the japs are full of stuff copied from animes (mechas and teenage girls). to some it might feel cartoonish but it can be a matter of tastes.

the biggest drawback to the game play i guess it the ""forced"" co-op and the wildly spiking difficulty levels of the single player campaign. you must play with a computer beside you, which sometimes the ally computer player totally decimates everything on the map leaving you to attack the enemy base with 5 tanks and win. other times it cant hold its own leaving you to baby it, which spoils the game.

the spiking difficulty is also another that spoils the whole experience, while i do understand that games use cheats to provide some degree of difficulty to the player. i found this to be used too often, even in medium the AI has almost unlimited resources and almost instant production capabilities. pair this with the uneven difficulty across the campaign, you'd quickly have certain missions where its near impossible to pass and those that are almost not impossibel to lose, right after each other.

all in all, i felt that RA3 was cheap idea of generating some revenue. it has nothing about ""gaming"" to it and more on selling the brand which is RA. some might like the over the top stuff or the new revamped economics system, but i dont i heard that multiplayer is good but i have not tried it yet. for now considering what i have been through i give it a 4/10",1391258887,1472185000,False,9,1,0.579172313213348389,1,True,False,False

Then where is Stalin here and where is Kain? (Yes Kain is in RA1) where are the Leaders of the USSR, Because I know Albert Einstein, had NOTHING to do with Stalin getting power.

Also now that Albert Einstein is no longer exsists to remove Hitler from the Timeline what happens here? They ignore all of these things and also where is Yuri? This story line makes NO sense here it just throws out the all these people and events even though they are Part of WHAT MAKES Red Alert What it was and IS.

next the Units are too damn cartoon like and clunky, I mean the Allied tank is a damn destroyer that drives on land your joking...... STUPID, STUPID STUPID, What were the EA developers thinking when they made this game, or better yet what the heck were they smoking.

Oh and in skirmish mode you cant play 1 vs 1 against AI or a human player you need to go 2 vs 2 minimum this means that if there are 2 humans playing you need a bot on each side.

Now the ONLY good part of this game is the movies and even then they are not that even good (but they weren't super HQ cut scenes to begin with).

This game for Classic C&C Players is an Insult, but for new people to this series may like it, and I guess that is what EA wanted, But by making it like this and disregarding the past (IE the story) of the previous games and changing the game play the way they did was disrespectful to the story and to the fan base of this franchise.

Again just dont buy this game. this game is broken, if anyone says buy it they are trolling you, or want you to waste your hard earned money as they did by buying this garbage. For the price of this go get a GOOD GAME. like company of heros 1 or Command and conquer 3 there is one Without the Red Alert3 tag.",1470653247,1471732686,False,2,1,0.415833324193954468,6,True,False,False

Another minor issue, this game has a problem when running duel or mutiple monitors, your mouse cursor wonders off on to the inactive display, so you have to unplug your second or addtional monitors which is a pain in the rear.

Common invalid complaints about this game are: 
a) 'its too 'cartoony' but that trend was really started by RA2.

b) 'RA2 YR was better ' No it wasn't it was a laugh, but the balance in the RA2 YR was freaking awful,  it became a one faction joke of an RTS in multiplayer, Everyone just played as Allies, because Soviets were usless if you didnt rush in the first 5 mins, and playing as Yuri was just 'cheap' no strategy needed, just steal all the enermy units or boomer rush. In RA3 all 3 factions are very well balanced indeed. And you cannot spam your way to victory with only one unit type.

c) 'too much micro managment' - Basically translates as 'the game is too hard for me.'

RA3 was the last good C&C game to come out of EA LA, highly recomended if you can live without multiplayer out of the box.",1464611633,1464612007,True,5,1,0.515658974647521973,0,True,False,False

Red alert 3 oversees an interesing  transition from RA2, incorporating numerous alternations to the gameplay that allows the game to be more tense as the designs shift more to what you will see in a serios RTS-- most prominently, ore becomes a confined resource which cannot be harvested exponentially by cramming your build order with harvesters. Units can be categorized into anti-infantry and anti-armor. Main battle tanks may be terrifyingly effective against armor yet at the same time they require five to six shots to kill some of the most cheapest infanty, which indeed is hard to grasp at first. As such, attacks emphasize on the cooperation of different units spamming only one type of unit would not bring you anywere. Micromanaging becomes vital through the concept of 'crushing levels' where infantry are subject to be crushed by incoming tanks while tanks are subject to be flattened by even bigger vehicles. Several secondary abilities and attack formations of the different factions also heavily rely on micromanaging.

The single player campaign is also incredibly entertaining. I loved the cutscenes shot in real person. The humorous plot is mildly funny and worth a laugh.

Graphics:
Absolutely brilliant special effects with breathtakingly beautiful water. Personally I prefer the rather vibrant hue in RA3 instead of  other CNC games or Starcraft. Antialiasing options lags the computer more than smoothing out the edges, however the game does not suffer from antialiasing issues much even without AA turned on.

Annoying bugs:
The pathfinding system is a total mess.
Sometimes units would take a full round trip around the building it just came out of before heading anywhere else.
Units getting stuck on the road for no reason.
Highly expensive naval fleet would randomly be stuck on the shoreline, becoming virtually worthless.
Units would line up and move single-filed, slowing each other down.
Nanocores of the Empire unable to deploy and stop en-route for no reason on certain maps

EA:
The experience for the game would be much smoother if it wasn't published by EA. RA3 had great multiplayer potential as with the introduction of the competitive aspects to the game. However, the servers in charge of hosting RA3 online closed down and there has only been a community supported server ever since, and the popularty of the RA3 community has been ever plummeting since. You won't find as much players nowadays as compared to when the gamespy servers were still online, and as a result matchmaking is almost impossible due to the tiny amount of players still playing the game.

Overall, the Red Alert 3 is a great game that could be great fun to play no matter by yourself or with others. However I certainly don't think that it is worth this price due to EA's unresponsible attitude towards this game. Buy it if you have some spare money to have fun with, but it is not on the must-have list.",1464354778,1464354901,True,1,0,0.49941551685333252,0,True,False,False

+ has a similar script that Red Alert 2 had: they toned down the seriousness of the very first game and instead included some funny dialogues to help with the cheesy storyline
+ ambitious casting, perhaps the best in the entire series with Tim Curry, Peter Stormare, Jonathan Pryce and J.K. Simmons just to name a few
+ inclusion of offshore battlegrounds: almost every building can be built on water; this gives way to newer tactics
+ finally, a 3rd faction we can choose from: the Empire of the Rising Sun is an instant favourite thanks to the unit variation (plus George Takei!)

- ore fields were removed: we now have stationery ore mines that are nice but cutting of the enemy's' resources now is not as important or effective as it used to be
- campaign could have been a little longer: while there are 9 missions with each side completing the first 4-5 does not take very long
- the game desperately tries to show something new with the inclusion of the naval warfare: this is not necessarily a problem but throughout the campaign there's too much emphasis on it 
- mediocre coop integration: while playing all 27 levels with a friend is pretty cool, playing solo is pretty difficult at times due to the dumbed-down A.I. that is not always helpful

The soundtrack is awesome, for once, the allies aren't the primary faction or at least In my opinion, the Russians are.
The Japanese are really nice to use but I'd like if there could be at least 2 more factions.
The game can be pretty challenging against hardest AI though, unlike Generals Zero Hour which is easy In my opinion, but it's not as a challenging as Command & Conquer 3 which In my opinion is the hardest, of course, I'm talking of the hardest difficulty in game.

1. Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour
2. Command & Conquer: Tiberium series.
3. Command & Conquer: Red Alert series

first and second are kind of equal to me, they both got their flaws and their qualities, I love both at the same level, they both have great campaigns and a great story but totally different, I must admit that I prefer the one of Command & Conquer 3 but at the same time I prefer the units in General Zero Hour, depends, sometimes I could say I prefer one and the other time I would say the opposite, both are really great.

That's my favorite list (between them because there are others of course which are even better).
I'd suggest this game to any science fiction and real time strategy games.
If you like the Japanese a lot and/or play with one character only (Japanese campaign), I'd suggest you get Red Alert 3: Uprising which is a expansion (standalone) that is pretty great too.
I'd suggest you try every Command & Conquer except Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances which is a mmo and it is really bad, about Command & Conquer 4, you should give it a try for free before buying it.
There is also Command & Conquer: Renegade which is a fps, great game, it was one of my favorite when I was younger.
Anyway, to get back to this game, It is not the best Command & Conquer ever but it is one great strategy game.

Combining all the classic elements of its predecessors that made those games great; Red Alert 3 is an RTS done right. Among all the usual fare like Campaign and Skirmishes, there are also lots of battles to be faught online and new experiences to be had in single player with the live action cutscenes. Let's face it guys, the acting is really corny. But who needs good acting when you've got jugs? Lots of jugs. In fact, if you are a fan of jugs you will want to buy this game whether or not you're actually into RTC. 

But seriously, there's a lot of content to be experienced in this, and its expansion which can be bought separately. 

I personally really enjoy the new Empire of the Rising Sun faction, as it adds a modular twist to the usual units we're used to seeing and thus changes up the game significantly. 

Graphics wise it runs very smooth and on nearly any system these days. The art style is one of a more lighter-hearted nature. But then again, that goes hand in hand with the direction of the game and the universe. Red Alert has always been the more cheeky, sci-fi cousin of the Tiberium and Generals universes and stands alone as a unique and interesting one at that.

The units, story and cutscenes are all over-the-top ridiculous but it's highly entertaining. The gameplay is as intense as ever, and the cell-shaded graphics are beautiful, especially the crisp blue water.

The story stared when Lieutant Cherdenko, General Krukov and Dr. Zelinsky from the Soviet travel through the time to the past to become alliance with Albert Einstein to make the Allies weakened and automatically make the Soviets is the winner in this war. But instead accidentally removed Einstein from the time and from this world. And they come back in the present. From what they have done is leading to have the third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, is going to dominate this world. The battle begins between the three great powers. This war called ""The war of the three powers"".

Pros:
-Three factions have their own specific style.
-Very balance between three factions.(The things like C&C3 will never happen like hordes of Mammoth Tanks, Zone Troopers and Juggernauts are overwheilming you and you are f-u-c-k-e-d) 
-Different base building style.(Dem Japanese scatter their base around the map)
-Co-op campaign that you can play with your friend. Only in this C&C.
-Your beloved units from past games are here.(Kirov Reporting) 
-In skirmish you can choose commander for each facttions. Each commanders have their own playstyle(Bots only).

Cons:
-Short Campaign playtime compared to other games.
-In campaign your bot sometimes useless.
-No 4v4 skirmish
-Unfair tech tree levelling. Soviets only have a single super reactor/tech lab, advanced units availble for whole base in the map. Alied required hightended/max clearance for each MCVs/outposts to unlock advanced units(If your MCV is fully upgraded but if your outpost doesn't upgraded yet, production structures that outpost covered still not unlock advanced units). Empire is the worst, you need to upgrade EACH of the production structures to unlock advanced units.

Conclusion: It's a great game. Worth the money. If you want everything balance, this game is for you.

This is one of them. I'm so glad I don't care about the games framerate.

The fact is I've had so many awesome moments in this. 

People find the smallest thing to complain about. Yes, this game is ""cartoonish."" However aesthetics are completely subjective and should not be something you should have to think too hard about when deciding. Besides, there are plenty of games recorded on YouTube to help you decide if you like the art and gameplay.


If small things like framerate and art style bug you, buy this on sale.

It is, however, most definitely worth $20. 


PS: I also highly recommend Kane's Wrath. Yes, both games are ""old"" now but that's part of what makes them classics. 

Great LAN party games. 


PPS: You will be elated to know that the Steam version does NOT have the SecuROM DRM or an activation limit. 

I really, REALLY wish I had bought this game on Steam first.

Unfortunately, while playing this game, all I could think about was how much more fun the campaigns of previous installments were, particularly Red Alert 2.

The first Red Alert featured faceless pixelated troops that you'd throw en masse against your enemies. The second one took a completely different approach, with individual units being rather personalized and potentially extremely powerful (even GIs were a menace at Elite veterancy) and allowing you to wreck enemy bases with just a handful of units in the right spots (I remember being able to dismantle most bases in campaign mode with only 3 Legionnaires). The third installment seems to fit somewhere in between, but loses something to both.

First, there are some things Red Alert 3 does well. The storyline is as cheesy as it comes and that is what fans expect and love. It is also great that the game has actors like Tim Curry, George Takei and David Hasselhoff, who really seem to enjoy performing the B-movie-like storyline.

However, Red Alert 3 has many problems compared to its predecessor. The units have a cartoonish look to them and look like child's toys. Many of them look so over the top that it is just ridiculous. Also, the weapon's effects and sounds don't convey any impact, further reinforcing that impression.

The gameplay itself comes off as very hectic because units cannot take any damage, no matter the unit type. Even the biggest tanks and ships give off the impression of being made of paper. They get destroyed within seconds leaving no room for actual micromanagement. The problem is that the game wants the player to micromanage since every unit has some sort of special ability. There is not much room to use them however and I would have preferred not having them at all except the toggled abilites. The units' AI is also pretty bad. If the enemy has a slightly longer range they will refrain from retaliating and just get destroyed. Anti-air weaponry is extremely underwhelming in this game. Often building turrets don't seem to make no sense at all. Even if you have a solid turret setup there is just not much use in defending since there are so many units that can destroy your base from huge distances. If the enemy uses aircraft they will still destroy your base because there is no defense that will keep them from destroying at least one target in every run.

Red Alert 3 features a computer controlled partner in every campaign mission. This partner can be replaced by a human player and while I appreciate the idea of making the whole campaign able to be played coop it just doesn't work. The computer partner is highly unreliable in its performance. In some missions it will basically win the mission by itself with you struggling to keep up with the pace and in some missions it will be literally useless. During the last mission of the Rising Sun campaign my AI partner was actually unable to even defend its own base. When I didn't continually sent units there my partner would just be annihilated within a few minutes. All of this while I had my own problems, being hammered by airstrikes, superweapons and ground troops.

The campaign should come with a trigger warning (pun intended) because all missions are heavily built around triggers that you most of the time cannot see coming. However you need to be prepared for them because if you're not you have basically lost. There is no reaction time since the game is fast and units and buildings cannot withstand any damage. It's bad design if you can only win by being able to see into the future. If you have run your head into the wall a few times you will know the triggers and it basically becomes a minigame of avoiding those. One of the worst examples is from the Rising Sun campaign. At one point you will be confronted with a huge enemy fleet and have to hold out until your battleships arrive. When they arrive it is still not enough to destroy the enemie's base but you absolutely need to destroy all their shipyards. Why you ask? Because the AI will start producing an indefinite amount of aircraft carriers and since anti-air turrets are horribly weak you will lose.

Red Alert 3 is not a horrible game but is has so many shortcomings compared to its predecessor that I cannot recommend it at all.

P.S.: If you liked the Tanya from Red Alert 2 you will be severely disappointed.

Pros:
-Three different campaigns you can do at your own pace and difficulty
-Numerous units on sea, land and air (something that alot of RTS games don't have)
-Online Multiplayer
-After over 100 hours, I haven't found a single bug or glitch, besides occasional character movement around corners and water.
-Skrimish mode, where you can practice your strategies on AI's 
-Babes, telling you what to do in the videos as you try to impress them throughout the game. Lmao.

Cons:
-Mediocre Graphics, not nearly as fancy as the videos.
-Pretty dull story mode
-The acting in the videos isn't too great, but what can you expect, right?
-Costs alot when it comes to money (and time haha)... but it's worth it, in my true opinion.

All in all, when comparing the factors I look for in a game, the pros heavily outweigh the cons the way I see it. Again, this is only my opinion, so if you can immerse yourself in another World War 2 story-mode game, then good for you man, I'm glad you enjoy it.

After the first two in this well renowned franchise, I would have thought that they built on this with pride and style.

Simply, EA has destroyed what was once a great franchise. The units themselves are woefully balanced with some units being destroyed instantly. The difficulty of the game is quite frustrating considering that the game itself is poorly scripted, as there are multiple bugs. I've had problems with units failing to complete their movement due to poor pathing. Some units will just stop if their path is momentarily blocked. Siege units are insanely powerful while infantry and many other units are simply irrelevant. It seems that the Soviets in particular lack any sort of meaningful anti air units as the Bullfrogs and MiGs have light armor values and can be decimated by units of other regions. Flak troopers may be cheap but without any ability to traverse water, there is essentially no sufficient anti air. The Scorpion unit of RA2 was completely removed, which were some of the best anti air units that the Soviets had at their disposal.

In addition, the campaign missions seem to be poorly designed. Just recently I played a mission in which the Soviet player had to assassinate the Emperor of the Rising Sun with a single Conscript. It seemed as illogical that there were areial units flying that failed to notice the enemy Conscript. As the mission continued, my base was assaulted by a wave of enemy tanks before any sort of player could mount a resistance force. The missions are boring and uninteresting. The acting and writing is subpar. The unit AI seems almost idiotic and inconsistent with some units agressively pursuing enemy units while other times standing their ground and just letting themselves be defeated.

In sum, I was wholeheartedly dissapoointed at this game. EA has (unsurprisingly) ruined another franchise. Just play RE2, which I still do. It may be older but at least it was well made in comparision to RE3, a shit game.",1435400015,1435400015,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When the reviews came out, it was clear it wasn't the same experience as before, so I held off purchase. But when it came to sale for the low, low price of ‚Ç¨3, I couldn't resist picking it up. It can't be a bad deal for that price, right?

Wrong. The inclusion of an Allied AI commander clearly supposed to carry the single player campaign in absence of a multiplayer buddy just doesn't work. It's frustrating to have a lot of your fun depend on a dead weight ally. Single player campaign play is frustrating, and only really worth it for the FMV cutscenes. The casting choices are great, including the awesome George Takei as the Japanese Emperor. But, on that subject, the faction of Japan just doesn't feel right in Red Alert, and tries to steal the spotlight from the established factions in a way that just doesn't work. Red Alert's campy plots and cutscenes thrived on its mock Cold War feeling.

From a technical standpoint, it's a fine game. Units are diverse, mechanics are solid enough. Undoubtedly the strength of the game is in multiplayer, which I haven't tried. But it just doesn't feel like it's a proper Red Alert game. Plainly put, I wasn't having fun with this, and rarely have I been so disappointed in a purchase.",1434669964,1434669964,False,1,0,0.49773755669593811,0,True,False,False

I was wrong. This game has kept my attention enough to beat each faction's campaign at least once, if not twice, and these missions present a challenge even if you have been playing RA2 for a while. The skirmishes, however, kept me coming back and they are what I play these days.

As easy as playing through most of the campaign - the fact that they included an option for Coop the campaign mode with your friends was a very nice touch. 

For competitive RTS enthusiasts the deeper level of micro and meta gaming is there for those wanting to polish up their APM and skills and sink their teeth into the multiplayer.  Starting from the collision of units as you nimble side step a falling enemy zepplin with your infantry or position your formation in such a way for their special abilities to get the maximum effectiveness.  The difference between being able to play this game and being a master-class player would be at least a few hundred hours.

Not to say the game doesn't have it's few drawbacks - more times than pure chance units would bug out on the map - whether they got stuck inside of terrain or refuse to function like you are instructing them to - due to pathing errors etc.  The cutscenes themselves have their cheesy charm and the actresses are beautiful but some of the over-the-top acting on cheap sets might turn some people off from it inbetween missions.

[h1]NOTE:[/h1] I have played this game extensively, but not on Steam.

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game serving as the third installment of the popular Command & Conquer series.  It features a rebooted story and a brand new faction called 'The Empire of the Rising Sun'.  However, unlike its predecessors,  Electronic Arts who acquired Westwood Studios, the original developers of the game, produced Red Alert 3.  It is one of the last few remaining franchises who use live action cutscenes which the series is known for.

Players once again take the role of the unknown commander who leads either the Allied Forces, the Soviet Army, or the newly resurrected Imperial Armed Forces to ultimate victory.

Red Alert 3's story starts with the Soviet Union in complete collapse after the events of Red Alert 2.  In an effort to stop the USSR's defeat, surviving Soviet leaders use a time machine to go back in history and erase Albert Einstein in order to prevent him from developing Allied technology.  Upon returning to the Present day however, they discover that without Einstein, nuclear technology was  never developed.  With this turn of events, this meant that the US never bombed Japan and the Empire never surrendered during World War 2.  Now the Empire has risen once more and poses a new threat to both the Soviets and the Allies prompting the hilarious line by actor Peter Stormare as Dr. Gregor Zelinsky: ‚ÄúWe now have...two mortal enemies?‚Äù 

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Colorful visuals and very nice graphics with good use of Physx technology
+ New 'Empire of the Rising Sun' faction is fun to play featuring highly advanced, extremely versatile, very expensive, and unhealthily suicidal units (ex. Tsunami Tank:[i] ‚ÄúHA! Give us a good death‚Äù [/i] Imperial Warrior: [I] ‚ÄúDeath before defeat!‚Äù[/i] Shogun Battleship: [I] ‚ÄúRamming speed!‚Äù[/i] Yari Sub: [I] ‚ÄúWe're taking you with us!‚Äù [/i]
+ Fun campaign for all 3 factions
+ Hilarious, Hammy, Cheesy but overall good voice acting
+ Humorous and entertaining Tutorial
+ All units for all factions now have secondary abilities
+ Co-op campaign
+ Very nice Music and Sounds

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- The very colorful art-style that could cause headaches for some people
- Some low polygon models, low resolution shadows, and poor textures can be seen here and there
- Short campaign for each faction
- Story is shallow and uses way to many cliche elements from the previous Red Alert 2
- Occasional pathfinding problems
- Balance issues with some of the units
- Some outstanding bugs that was never fixed (for some reason, changing the graphics quality and  resolution at the same time MAY cause a crash)
- Despite EA's vast resources and use of big name actors like Peter Stormare and George Takei, I can't help but feel that they were not able to live up to the standard of Westwood.
- Broken multiplayer on Steam (No idea if it works in Origin)

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
GREAT RTS GAME.  Although it does not fully capture the magic of Red Alert 2, Red Alert 3 still delivers a great fast paced experience for RTS fans looking for a quick fix.  The campaign is fun with a story that is easy to follow but uses a lot of cliche plot elements.  The Soundtrack is excellent and the over-the-top, hammy, and cheesy voice acting are very entertaining.  Multiplayer is also fun if you're looking for a casual RTS experience since the AI does pose a challenge on higher difficulties.  In addition, new game mechanics such as the secondary abilities and the new faction spices up the action.

Now we come on whether or not I recommend this game.  If you're in this for the single player experience, sure I can RECOMMEND this game easily.  If you're in this for the multiplayer experience, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game here on Steam because for some reason the Servers are broken so you're better off purchasing this in EA's Origin Platform.

I can see a fun game in there somewhere, but one major thing really kills the gameplay for me; at least during th solo campaing, and that is the shared economy. I really hate that. Since the AI is always building stuff you can't save up money for things to build, and you are ALWAYS short of resources because of this. It is really frustrating! I was looking forward to having a full co-op campaign when I bought this game, but I was not ready for that design decision.


Otherwise I've been surprised about how well this holds up as a sequel to RA2 and YR. And it is fun that we finally get a main campaign that focuses on the Sovjet side. Sure, previous games have always had the sovjet campaign aswell, but that was not the main story. And having such a great actor-rooster adds to the experience.

The amoun of bewbs (or cleavage) this game shows can be discussed. The twelve-year old inside my 25 year old body is happy, but the game would have been just as good (perhaps better) without it.

So how does the game feel then?

Basically this game is a mixture of the previous C&C titles. You've got the familiar units, all though redesigned, from the RA-series with addition of new units. You've also got the micromanagment system from RA2, which was lacking in the Generals-series; waypoints and hold-fire and stuff like that. Then again, some controls and features from the Generals series have found its way in here. It is really odd to see units and gameplay first feeling like generals, but then also feeling like RA2. I'm not sure I'm all that fond of the mixture yet.


I'm sure my view on this game will change as time goes by. And if I manage to get online I will add that experience to this review later on. 

Will I recommend this game for new players? Well if you have RA2/Yuri's Revenge and you somehow manage to play that online then stick with that game, because it is more fluent than this. At least in my humble opinion.

If you don't have anything else, I can surley see this as a viable option. And for 5 dollars on steam it is worth it.",1419963505,1419965799,False,11,0,0.566691040992736816,0,True,False,False

This game reminds me of Dune 2000. You can tell some of the gameplay was modelled after Dune since they've not even bothered to change voice commands like `Training... Unit ready` or `Enemy unit detected`. Many of the structure units like power plants and MCVs take a liking to Dune as well. Not that that is a bad thing since Dune was an awesome game.

Nothing better than a RTS that is easy going with over the top plot and units and technologies. Comparing the three installments of this game the first one was the least over the top. It still had some seriousness from the original C&C, but had the basis for ‚Äòover-the-top-ness‚Äô with the idea of Soviet Union expanding into all of Europe. Oh, and there was time travel as well. The second RA didn‚Äôt disappoint and took a leap forward in ‚Äòover-the-top-ness‚Äô with Soviets assaulting the US and game being generally more colorful and cheerful. Now it is the other way around with Soviets eliminating key figure from the past instead of Allies as in RA 1 and events taking yet another direction with Empire of the Rising Sun coming out as a united threat.

The game is colorful, silly, over the top and most importantly much fun. This time the big new thing is a co-commander who can be a real person over the Internet or AI controlled. This is an interesting concept with sort of built in multiplayer, but I‚Äôm really glad they made the option of AI co-commander, helping me not deal with social interactions. On rare occasions AI glitched and never left its base, so all offensive had to be done by me. At least I didn‚Äôt have to worry about defenses. Overall having a co-commanders is very beneficial as they supply almost constant attacks on the enemy thus softening them up for my big armada, which is quickly reduced to almost nothing, because unit balance is made very well I think. In most cases you can‚Äôt storm in with dozens of Apocalypse tanks and win the level. Almost always you have to think about anti-air units since the enemy AI most often will use air units for defenses and offenses as well.

The best part from RA 2 is back ‚Äì unit experience. There is nothing more satisfying than one or two units maintaining the pressure on the enemy or holding off what is thrown at you only because you previously cared and repaired them each time units were near death and now they have highest possible rank and therefore added defense and firepower. For me that was the best idea Westwood had for RA 2 and it is present in RA 3 as well

Overall I think it made a great transition from 2D to 3D and I loved the game just like the previous ones.",1417756561,1417756593,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
17480,12313053,76561198011181923,0,39,2977,0,2490,1472457550,"J. Jonah Jameson was trying to blow up Moscow with a giant laser built into Theodore Roosevelt's head on Mount Rushmore, which wasn't good at all, because that would destroy my peace treaty with Doctor Frank N. Furter, whom I desperately needed on my side to help me defeat Lieutenant Sulu.

Red Alert 3 is an RTS game, set in an alternate timeline after the Soviets went back in time and rewrote history (again) by murdering Albert Einstein. It‚Äôs even more ridiculous than it sounds, and serves as a worthy sequel to my all-time favourite RTS, Red Alert 2. It‚Äôs fun, campy, and often hilarious, while still serving up slice after slice of the Command & Conquer we all know and love.

There are three campaigns to be played through: Soviet Union, Allies, and The Empire of the Rising Sun. Each campaign consists of 9 missions, and it took me about 23 hours to beat them all. When you‚Äôre done with that, there‚Äôs custom Skirmishes and the Uprising expansion to play through.

Between missions you'll be treated to good old FMV sequences starring well-known actors, including a couple of surprise cameos. These serve to convey the story, relay your mission objectives, and make you snort Pepsi out of your nose, especially when Tim Curry or J. K. Simmons is speaking.

The soundtrack is a blast, and Frank Klepacki, the musical genius behind the rocktronic compositions for the original C&C through to Renegade, returns once more for three tracks: Hell March 3, Grinder 2, and The Red Menace, which steal the show above the rest of the game's music. Pity he didn't compose the entire soundtrack.

But RA3 suffers from two flaws: Co-op, and hand-holding. These two elements work together to steal away your freedom. Each mission is designed to be played with a partner, but since EA have shut their servers down, you‚Äôre stuck with AI co-commanders. And before each mission, you‚Äôre given a step-by-step battle plan, telling you to go here and do this and move there and capture that.

Gone are the days of freedom to approach a mission in any way you see fit, which would allow for multiple replays and different experiences. Now you‚Äôre stuck with every step laid out for you, and an AI blundering alongside.

I used to find immense enjoyment in taking my time to complete a mission, as I slowly crept up the map, expanding my base, capturing all the enemy‚Äôs buildings, and then crushing him at the end. That‚Äôs no longer possible. Missions are too structured and linear, and my co-commander is always running ahead, blindly sending in troops and mucking up my strategy. 

There were moments when my co-commander completed objectives without me while I was busy elsewhere. Why even bother playing when an AI is gonna do the work whether you want it to or not?

Then there were other missions when my co-commander failed abysmally at his task, and I didn‚Äôt have time to swoop in and pick him up before failing the mission. These were the hardest of missions, and it felt nice to have to actually work to complete them, even if there were only a few.

But at the end of the day, I had so much fun playing this game that I couldn‚Äôt help but forgive it for its shortcomings. Red Alert 3 is glorious and zany in all the right ways. What it lacks in strategy and challenge, it makes up for by simply being awesome, and it‚Äôs a fantastic throwback to past Command and Conquer games.

Now if you'll excuse me, 'I am escaping to one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism‚ÄîSPHACE!'


TL;DR: Forced co-op can be a nuisance, and there‚Äôs too much hand-holding, but Red Alert 3 is great fun nonetheless.",1412169677,1417320156,True,2,0,0.48795667290687561,0,True,False,False

After amazing Red Alert 2 I was sure I wouldn't be disappointed by the part three. And I was right, many interesting and great looking buildings to build and units to fight with. The campaign could have been better, but isn't bad at all, the worst parts were actually the cinematic ones. In my opinion best strategy game to play online.

Gameplay and controlling was easy. Game storyline was very good and cutscenes was an awesome red alert classic. 
When we come to Red Alert 3 lots of people dissapointed. Because they think the game lost its old soul. But in my opinion they were wrong. All i see was improvement of old games without losing its soul. Better commanding. Better cutscenes.(With lots of beauties from mother russia, england and japan :)  ) Very nice new units and improvements to the old units from previous games.

  I was an OK fan of Red Alert 1. Then I became a HUGE fan of Red Alert 2. In fact I consider Red Alert 2 the RTS title that got me into RTS gaming.
  I had high expectations with Red Alert 3 when it released. Was I impressed initially? Honestly, no. I was a little bit disappointed with the game and really didn't like the Empire faction. I thought it was pretty damn cheesy. I mean this is coming from a game that is loaded with cheese. But really, I preferred my mind whack job faction of Yuri from Red Alert 2. At least they had some Soviet in their style. The Empire faction gives up too much cornyness with their robot units that carry samurai swords and whatnot. I understand it's the theme, but let's be realistic here. You wouldn't be winning a war with swords in Red Alert.
  For me, Red Alert 2 allowing you to choose from real world nations after picking either Allies or Soviets kept a more realistic approach to the madness and you could feel a lil more attachment to the story. Red Alert 3 is all over the place. BUT, not all is bad in the game.
  I still do love the gameplay and minor enhancements they made. The graphics looking stunning even right now with the current gen games out. The Soviets and Allies are still great looking and have some really awesome units. Who doesn't love building a mass of Dreadnoughts to rain down dozens and dozens of missles? When the damage flies, it flies.
  As I got this game on a cheap Steam sale, I figured why the hell not, and I'm happy for it. I stuck mostly with skirmish game matches where I could just have quick fun of building my base and laying waste to my opponent. 
  Where I didn't see much in this game initially upon launch, I found late in it's life thru Steam. At this point I recommend the game, but it will never be held to the standard I had with Red Alert 2.",1406321398,1406321541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game does not have an enjoyable campaign, the units are basic and boring, and it is not fun thus defeating the purpose of it being classified as a ""game"".  The campaign is flat out dull and boring, the witty cutscenes that went hand in hand with good gameplay are no longer there, EA has seen fit to simply have bad acting encompass their bad game design just so they can say ""look we remember what RA used to be too!""  

The units are boring and made out of paper, the fun general powers from C&C Generals make a return but with None of the fun or innovation that the previous title put into it.  Factional units are cut and paste from each other with only some different looking models and alternate modes being the variation.  The units in general show the worst signs of AI that I have ever seen in ANY RTS title or game that I have played PERIOD.  They are extremely near-sighted; they always fail to return fire unless you give them a direct order and will just sit there getting blown away by everything.  Speaking of alternate unit modes, this game tries to do something different and fails utterly, the only thing that these abilities do is further complicate the most BASIC C&C formula and further hamper the gameplay and fun factor of the title.  Even when you have them built with attack at will rather then defensive they will consistently neglect to defend themselves even when the enemy unit is right on top of them, it is babysitting of the highest order and a huge failing of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and its developers.  The ‚Äúfuture‚Äù has shown that any C&C title past Generals or maybe the earlier 3D C&Cs have been a complete failure as fans continue to drop the titles in favor of something less driven by greed and fake innovation.

During the campaign you can either have a coop human player, if you can keep connection with EA‚Äôs trash servers (another quality sign of EA) or you can be aided by the in game AI, which is semi competent enough however the kicker is that for an RTS game you and your coop player share ore resources, which is absolutely ridiculous and a really poorly thought-out mechanic.  On the subject of the campaign again I will clarify further that it is one of the most boring three faction story mode that I have ever played let alone failing to bring me any joy from playing it.  I have to push myself in order to go back to it and attempt to finish it that‚Äôs how I consider the story mode and the game in general, boring and a CHORE, no game should ever make the player feel that way!  I am very glad that I never got this game when it came out for the full price and even then $10 for a 2008 title I still feel ripped off and the price proves that EA will never stop being a money grubbing parasite. To add to this, Steam needs to change the description of this game since as of now the Gamespy servers have been shut down indefinitely so the online Coop and multiplayer are no longer a functioning entity of this title.

The music of C&C has always been memorable this is especially the case with the Red Alert series.  However in RA3 they have yet again gone away from being GOOD and simply moved to the most repetitious garbage that I have had to listen to repeated through the ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.  You will hear a single song for the entirety of each an every single mission within the campaign as well as the multi and skirmish section, not ONCE is the famous Red Alert song played at any point within the game short of the menu, that is yet more proof that there is no longer a Command and Conquer series of RTS games at all.  They have simply screwed up on the entire game, which amazingly enough extends to even the music score which is unbelievable.  

I am saddened that this title got such higher praises then I feel that it should have, as if the fans were so hopeful to the possibilities of the new EA Westwood titles that everyone seems to have given this game a pass regardless to how bad it truly is.  I feel sorry that the younger generations after me will never again know how good C&C titles used to be and that based on this, my last C&C title that I will buy, we will never see the good days again.",1405918359,1405922731,False,35,1,0.475163877010345459,0,True,False,False

However EA had previously hosted the online servers through Gamespy, which has since December 2013 been shut down. EA has not produced an alternate hosting solution for Red Alert 3, and it does not seem like they will as this is not a Madden game or a Battlefield game. Therefore you are stuck playing the single player campaign missions with an AI co-op partner, which sucks eggs. So like other reviewers have stated, the single player alone is not enough to carry this game, and one must engage in the multiplayer aspect to truly appreciate the new mechanics. But since EA isn't hosting the multiplayer anymore the game is no longer worth playing.

Regardless, this is a RTS game that would still remain fantastic to play in singleplayer OR co-op with a friend, as everything does work with Hamachi and if you have a disc version, Gameranger works too. The game has an extensive list of tutorials that for the most part a seasoned C&C player can entirely ignore and figure the new stuff out themselves, but as far as features go, this game is the closest thing to a Westwood C&C styled game that has come out since their demise. No squad system, extreme countering-style units, extreme diversion amongst the factions (the fast-paced allies, the turtle-heavy soviets, and the...asians), diverse base construction (finally bringing walls back) and a ton of lighthearted and extremely amusing missions and dialogue from units and the campaign with rocking music featuring Tim Wynn, James Hannigan, and of course, Frank Klepacki from the westwood titles helping to soundtrack as well. That said, the campaign is absolutely fantastic by ANY standard - FMV cutscenes that add up to somewhere around an hour in length and use top notch actors such as J.K. Simmons and George Takei.

As far as how well this game can bring in new players to the series, it's extensive campaign and the fact that 1 of the 3 campaigns (Soviet one) is almost explicitly designed to ease players into the gameplay makes this a FANTASTIC entry point for newcomers. The tutorial itself consists of 6 amusing tutorials that really don't feel tedious despite totalling about an hour in length to explain the game mechanics, and are entirely skippable for anyone who's familiar with certain aspects of C&C or basic RTS controls to either see newer features or try to figure it out themselves. And for those not particularly happy with the soviet campaign style of easing players in, the allies campaign as well as empire campaign are notably more difficult right off the starting line and clearly designed with veteran players in mind. The campaign endings are lackluster so don't expect anything amazing, but the story throughout each campaign is rather intriguing. And yes, I keep going back to the campaign - that is really where the most work went into this game, clearly. The campaign at all points in time gives you an AI partner of a certain personality, each personality having a different playstyle. If you don't want an AI partner, it's possible to have a friend play with you instead in co-op, replacing the AI partner. The AI isn't particularly bad, however, and you are capable of issuing 4 basic commands (Strike area, strike target, plan (build up and launch) attack, don't attack) to your AI companion in an attempt to order them around like you would with another player.

As far as skirmish goes, it does provide a lot of replayability as once again, you can call in these AI personalities to fight with or against you. Likewise, in multiplayer which will be limited to LAN-based hosting services or just straight up REAL LAN if anyone still uses that, other players can join you and you can still add AI or remove them at will. The limit to 6 players at maximum, however, is upsetting, and the map editor for this game does not work with the steam version as far as I can tell, but there's already plenty of community maps worth downloading and playing.

For a $20 asking price, you are more than getting your money's worth. Compared with the considerably less westwood-like C&C 3 Tiberium Wars game asking $30, you are far better off getting this game and will undoubtably have more fun with it alone or with friends and it is by far the best entry into the C&C series as a whole for new players.",1399952284,1399952284,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

Case in point, in Yuri's Revenge, there was a building that ground up troops for resources all while using slave labor.

Mind you, this was also a game where you fight dinosaurs and hollywood stars were actually commandoes, but I can also say that with the combination of frank klepacki's unapologetically metal soundtrack combined with equal amounts ridiculous and awesome units and set pieces, RA 2 worked on a level that couldn't be replicated.

That being said, RA3 is in no way the game that anyone was looking for. See, what sets RA2 above other RTS games is the idea that a gamebreaker should be countered with a gamebreaker. Just remember the chronotroops and the psychich commandos, its a game with glorious power creep that encourages you to out-do your opponent.

That being said, not only did EA make a pathetic attempt to balance this game, nothing feels as crazy or nearly as fun. Or as balanced.

A focus on naval warfare means that Rising Sun in theory should have an advatage, but with no viable anti-air until at least 2nd tier dock/factory, and to be honest I never used it. Everything feels squishy and underpowered, and nothing is as interesting as it was in RA2, and although Klepacki's soundtrack is fun, its not nearly as engrossing as it was in his other works.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Unlike past Red Alerts I only played about one skirmish as I did not find the AI as enjoyable as the predecessors. This Red Alert offers some interesting new teams and resource harvesting concepts which seem different than before. Like in the past Red Alert games the Russians and Allies are pretty much the same basic strategy type, while the third team offers a fresh new tactics. Similar to past Red Alerts to expand bases (when playing as either Allies or Soviets) you can build Mobile Construction Vehicles. But, unlike past Red alerts they have also added the ability for Prospectors (allied ore miners) to deploy into Command Centers which allow you to expand to nearby areas mitigating large costs. The USSR can build ‚ÄúSputnik‚Äù which can also deploy into a command center. Both of these units allow for cheaper base expansion. This is different for the Japanese whose buildings are built by transforming vehicles into buildings and thus are not limited to base parameters.
 
[b]Campaign:[/b]
The campaign took me about 21 hours to complete (that includes Allies, Russians, and Rising Sun missions). Interestingly the campaigns intertwine and in some instances you play the same missions but just as the opposing team, which I sort of liked. In the case of this game the missions are not exactly gripping, but that is the case with all strategy games. The campaign offers a great composition of actors which make you laugh, gasp, and reminisce in the old days when you first sat down and played Red Alert. Some of the missions are very quick and last no time at all while others can last a couple hours. 

[b]Results:[/b]
If you are expecting something just like the second Red Alert then you will be disappointed. There is only one Yuri and his revenge was an epic adventure that could only be told once. If you are interested in playing a strategy game that brings Red Alert on a new adventure then this is a game worth checking out. With an amazing intro song to boot and epic campaign cut scenes that you won't forget. Red Alert 3 really takes Westwood‚Äôs dream into action: hot babes who flirt with you throughout your entire game and keep your spirits bolstered with cheesy lines. 

Pros:
+Great campaign with fun dialogue and amazing cut scenes.
+New Empire of the Rising Sun team which brings all new tactics to the game
+Campaign missions that don't just require you to continually build a base over and over again, but rather test you through a variety of scenarios.
+Epic main menu music that just makes you want to jump right into the Russian campaign. 
+It has been 18 years and Tanya still hasn't aged over 30... a mystery? Or did someone use the chronosphere?

Cons:
-Its not Red Alert 2 (that game already existed, if you want that game you may want to go find the disk from your shelf)
-Some campaign missions can run rather long, while others last about 10 minutes. (Some missions took me up to three hours). 
-Poor movement AI can cause units to not exactly act how you want them too.",1393126660,1396317026,True,95,1,0.843373596668243408,0,True,False,False

With this IP, EA Los Angeles introduced to us (the players) one of the very best of gaming-experiences ever crafted, let alone one which one could ever have asked for. EALA gave us players lots of additional features and tools both advanced as simple that made and still makes this game from the bigger rest.

The Developers gave us the very best, with features such as the fantasticaly simplictic hosting-system of which still runs as smooth as ever and in which one didn't need to set up a entiere f*****g home-based server in-order to do so.
The RA3 Worldbuilder map-editor which was and once again still remains one of the simplest and most time-saving/conserving map-editors ever to have been introduced to the gaming community.
The Brutal smart-AI's,.. although admittedly not being the hardest nor smartest in all of gaming history, did give us quite a ride with their smart and uncountable use of tactics which they 'occasionally'' deployed with great cunning fighting alonside or versus the players.
The SuperWeapons, even if 'yes a bit anoying'' did by fact bring us that underlying sense of fear of imminent destruction and the feeling that the favors might swing to your opponents side in any number of seconds. It made for a crucial part of the RA3 playing mentality.
They gave us a truly unqiue set of factions whom opperated in very distinct ways from one another and of which employed different tactics for the various of tasks.
Lastly, they gave us the Replay, one of the first in-whole trully so good theater-modes as far as RTS-IPs' are concerned.

Now, too finish off this way too overly extensive review of mine I shall end by proclaiming in-accordance with personal opinion, that Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 most-probably am one of the very best game-IPs' to have been crafted in reccent memory.

When your about to start a mission, you will see a button that says co-op, once you click on it, you will see a list of names of players that you can invite to play with you on your mission, but the problem is that once the invite is sent, you don't get a message that says player accepted invite and there is no clear way of getting back to the mission from the lobby without hitting the back button which will just take you back to the screen on whether you want single or co-op.",1391402116,1391402116,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Command and Conquer Red Alert three is a game of great scale. You can create entire armies. Battle tons of enemies. Use technology you thought never existed. But still do it all with a simple innovative interface. Unlike many games with stupid amounts of menu's and skill sets. Use a simple bunch of tools at the click of a mouse and enjoy thousands of hours of game-play.

Red Alert 3 is a great game. The easy user interface combined with the fast action make me choose this game over Starcraft II on a nearly daily basis. The multiplayer is amazing, and the game is incredibly balanced. Unfortunately, the game does not have a massive online community. You end up running into the same people, time and time again.

The Bad:
As a fan of Red Alert 1 and 2, I found the campaign to be COMPLETELY destroyed by EA. Real actors, combined with cartoony stuff, and Tanya having blonde hair. It made me cringe. If you're looking to play the campaign, and not delve into the incredible tactics within the multiplayer... don't bother. This game is not for you.

The campaign is fun, fluid and will keep you hooked till the very end, especially if you bring a friend along for the ride. 

Visuals are highly saturated and full of color, fitting the games unique style.

Red Alert 3 is a beautiful, terrifically fun game that also does some interesting things with the RTS genre.

Long Review:

The Red Alert series has some defining aspects - alternate histories, time travel, trained animal units, psychic powers - but its most obvious trait was the cheesiness of its cutscenes.  The Red Alert developers realized that trying to do ""serious"" FMV for these games usually ended up producing something nigh-unwatchable, like Command & Conquer 2.  So they decided to just turn the cheese knob until it broke off, and Red Alert 3 continues this tradition with pride.  It combines time travel and crazy inventions and Tim Curry to make a wonderful, fun mess of a storyline.  And the best part is that the actors are into it - they understand that the scenery here is meant to be eaten.

But look past the cheese (and cheesecake) and you'll find a fun, very playable RTS.  The three sides all play differently, with the Russians being the simple bruisers, the Empire having the coolest (but most difficult to use) units and the Allies having the most useful commander powers.

Plus, the game has co-op.  The ""single player"" campaign is actually designed to be played by two people at once, each controlling a different commander.  Since co-op multiplayer is the best multiplayer, it was nice to see this finally come to the RTS genre.  And don't worry - if you don't have anyone to play with, there are nine different AI commanders to help you out, each of whom has their own play style and personality.  As the story progresses and you move to the next campaign, AI commanders that used to be your allies could become your enemies and vice-versa - an excellent touch.

The game is also beautiful, with some of the best water I've ever seen. Models are detailed, textures are rich and of good resolution and special effects are excellent.

In short, Red Alert 3 may have disappointed fans who were eagerly awaiting the next ""real"" Command & Conquer, but if you take it for what it is it's a blast.

Plus hot chicks.",1386281529,1386281529,True,5,0,0.565580666065216064,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: Gameplay is great, three different nation with different playstiles and superiorities in air, land and sea. Three unique commando's in each side.

As for the scenario, I don't want to give spoilers but let me say this: scenario is that when the Soviets started to lose the war against the Allies(US), they use time-machine and go kill Einstein so the nuclear weapons are not made. This eventually leads that Japan doesn't get hit by it too. So the Empire of Rising Sun(JAPAN) is our 3rd nation. 3 different campaign mode for 3 nations. Campaigns are well made, forces you to use different units and tactics everytime and there are bunch of unique things happen in scenario mode which are not present in the skirmish.

The mood of the game is enjoyably goofy and nowhere is this more evident than the completely gratuitous sexy women who practically cavort for your pleasure.  The game mechanics are no less entertaining with loads of odd military units like attack dolphins, armored blimps, and football talking troopers.  Unfortunately the units aren't quite so devastatingly useful as RA2 offered, -it's a rare thing when a single, properly managed unit can land the blows to win a game, and more's the pity.  Furthermore the superpowers are a little more niggly to obtain and less brutally satisfying.

The game plays out much more methodically than RA2 or C&C3 did so that you will have to spend more attention on individual unit tactics rather than massed forces.  This makes the game less friendly to ""turtle"" game tactics but grants a feeling of earned superiority when you finagle the most out of your limited resources.

Lots of fun, in short.  :)",1299538873,1299538873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
