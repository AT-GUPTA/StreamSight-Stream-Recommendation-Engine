I have a 96 pace striker but got outrun by Van Dijk, Saliba and other big physique defender. Like what is the logic? If these players are that fast, put them on 96 pace as well. Literally misleading attributes.

Special cards or icons sometimes are not that good. Whats the point having 90 rated player but is not meta, so they are useless compared to base player 88 rated or so. Again what is the logic behind it.

BUT the game kinda sucks, and idk why EA did it 
here are examples that I HATE about it:

1- the UI is a huge downgrade from the last fifa games, it just looks ugly and too basic
2- the AI on this game is GARBAGE, like sometimes they dont even follow the tactics i make for them, and sometimes they do follow them BUT AT A TIME I DIDNT WANT THEM TO DO (AND SOMETIMES ST PLAYERS, INSTEAD OF GOING IN FRONT THEY JUST GO BACK TO CM POSITIONS, WHICH I DIDNT HAVE ANY OF THIS PLANNED IN TACTICS, THEN CB PLAYERS JUST FOR SOME REASON START ATTACKING FOR NO REASON???????????????????)
3- GKs are RNG as hell, doesnt matter how good your GK is, they can get the most insane saves but cant even save a simple one shot sometimes

also people have been saying the game is ""unplayable"" because its crashing alot, or its ""poorly optimized"" on their pc, iv never had these issues at all, my pc has a ryzen 5 5600g and an rx 6500 xt (i know its garbage, im very broke) and im getting over 100+ fps at mid graphics and 1080P res, like maybe im blessed with a version that works and has no performance issues, not sure

as much as i want to like it, i cant recommend it if you have an older fifa game (like fifa 20-23), if you have a way older one, then maybe? but still, i hate what they did to it, it feels like a huge downgrade compare to the older fifa games",1708735766,1708735766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Moreover, this game still has the same annoying controller bug that FIFA23 has, i.e. sometimes you can't move between menu items and you need to use the mouse. I bought an XBox controller on purpose with the intent not to face this issue again, given that it's the only officially supported controller (which is also unacceptable for a controller-based game), but I got very disappointed.

Just a few examples listed below....

- Penalties given if you look at someone wrong
- Goalkeepers still dive backwards and miss shots they should easily save.
- 5'0 stick like players, pushing around 6'4 tanks like its nothing
- Players have forcefields and you can't get anywhere near them
- The most beefy and ""slow"" players travel at the speed of light
- The most ridiculous, unrealistic things happen in games, things far out of your control lose you the game you dominated
- Experienced players smurfing in lower ranks so they can ""enjoy"" winning
- Opposition leaving a game near the end, making the whole game a waste of time because you don't get rewarded unless you're in the lead.
- Used to feel rewarding getting high rated players in ultimate team, now there's just so many and they are given to you for free.
- There is always a ""meta"" way to play. Not learning to do so, means you just fucking lose. It's not enjoyable having to play the game a specific way in order to win. 
- The AI is just straight up stupid. They either don't move, or move way too much. They run into one another.

We need more content in Career Modes tho. 
Everyone wants Online Career Mode,... with Real Clubs ofc. 

Yeah as you've just read currently there's no Online Career Mode which honestly sucks since this is one feature that we've all wanted for years now, but EA have decided to ignore that for years now, altough judging by the leaks, they've been working on it for last 2 years, so hopefully EA FC 25's gonna have it.  

Altough they've advertised that there's gonna be more highlights on things such as Balon Dor, I'm yet to attend a Balon Dor ceremony. So EA please fix that issue, my players should have won 2 Balon Dors by now and I have no idea if they actually did or didn't, just like I don't know who won it in general...

But yeah, if you're looking for a fun football game, I'd say that this one is a great step up from EA so get it on a discount or wait for the next one to come out (September), but you should get it while it's on a big discount (during the November or December).

EDIT: ( 150 hours ) 11.02.24
I've spent 120 hours on only 1 career ( from league 2 to premier league ) and after I won 2 premier league seasons in a row and bought nice players I've decided to make a second career and to apply what I have learned from my first career. After playing a couple games and then I've decided to load up my old career everything was gone. The save was there but when I loaded it up I've started from the beginning. This is mad. Please FIX your game or hire better programmers to do you job if you can't! ( I found a reddit post that said to save the game manually and not use the auto save & quit option ). Not sure if that's going to help or not but just have that in mind.

After making a new career players did not want to accept transfer offers, doesn't matter what team it was. Offers from 30M+ etc. they just deny.
I made a second career and it happens again. The game is pure trash.
P.S: I've checked some reddit posts about this issue, some people suggest to put release clause on them and it might fix the issue ( I haven't tested that out ) because it means that I'll have to renew every single contract and sign a new and more expensive deal than the last time because their overall went up and their market value as well.

EDIT: ( 190+ hours ) 17.02.24
After accepting a job offer from a different team mid season I had just one objective and it was to win the championship title. I've made 2 team sheets, so every player can play and be satisfied. I haven't lost a game and 70% of the players on the team were at maximum happiness. But after each game I've won my manager stats was dropping and at the end of the season was on 50%. I've got an message stating that I wasn't able to complete a lot of objectives even though I had only the one for the championship title when I joined the team. SUPER ANNOYING! This also affects you future job offers from bigger teams!

EDIT: ( 200+ hours ) 18.02.24
The game started to crash every time when I try to change the team sheet.
( Found a fix online that helped me ) You'll have to delete that team sheet and create it again.

Bought Goncalo Inacio as a CB. After accumulating too many yellow cards he was suspended from 1 match. And because I wasn't able to play him after the game he was super upset about it and that I didn't even put him on the field even for a minute. A game later he played the first half and he was tired and I made a change with another CB for the second half. After the game he decided to tell me how unhappy he was and that his damaging his career, so he decided to leave by putting himself on the transfer market. GREAT GAME!

Career Mode:

If you start in League 2 and progress to Premier League you're still going to get paid 15k ( I know that this does not really matter but small details make the game much cooler ).

You have to non-stop monitor your players Sharpness and Fitness and regulate them after each game, otherwise they're going to be tired or they won't be passing the ball well or reacting fast enough. When you have a bigger pause between matches you have to stop 1 or 2 times the calendar progress just so you can regulate their Sharpness and Fitness again because if you put them on Fitness and let them train for 15 days they'll lack of Sharpness eventually. At the beginning this wasn't an issue but now it got supper annoying.

If you sign a kid it will show you what their potential is. But after you move them to the senior squad it will show you only how much they're worth and not what their overall potential is anymore. ( You can bypass that by checking the potential on real players online ).

The negotiations are super basic and their answers are always the same. Also every single time when they say that they want a contract for 2 years you can counter it with an year more. So, if they want a contract for 3 years and you offer them for 4 they'll always accept. The transfer fee is the same.

One more big minus is the fact that there's a press conference before and after each game ( you can skip it ) that boosts your player / team morale. They ask you questions and you answer them. The minus is that they don't actually speak. It's dead silent and you just watch how their mouth is moving. Pretty much it's just like watching TV on mute. You'd expect more for a came that cost 70 euros and it's made from the same company that made the rest of FIFA games. Just get some voice actors and make them record a couple sentences, they're the same anyway.

If you loan a player from another team and you don't let him play a couple matches in a row they'll send you an email that this damages his career and players stats and they might pay the fee and take the player back before the loan period ends. BUT YOU CAN'T send such emails on players that you loaned to other teams. They can put your players on Rotation/Sporadic etc. and you can't do nothing about it. I'd be nice if you could also send such emails.

There should be an option to explain a player a situation. For example I have my main players that play on important matches and I have the reserves that play on less important matches and after each game I get emails from players that haven't played and are angry or unhappy. There should be an option that explains the player that they will play only on less important matches. ( I know when you sign a player if you make his contract Rotation you won't have these issues, but trust me, before you claim to Premier League almost no one will accept Rotation as an option. Everyone wants to be at least Important ).

When you make your career mode you're given an option to select between t-shirt designs etc. I'm pretty sure you'll always find something to your liking BUT ( yeah there's a BUT as usual ), the club logos are made on paint. Absolutely 0 effort is put in them. Super basic, super simple, very ugly compared to the worst real club logo in the game these are twice as bad. Over 10 years into making FIFA and they still haven't learned what should be done with and to the game. ( Let's not forget that there's no sponsors to pick from, so no extra money from advertisement ).

Ultimate Teams:

Haven't played that much and I can't say much about it except:
1: DON'T buy packs.
2. In my opinion earning money is a bid hard ( maybe I haven't learned the right way of gathering money ).
3. The ranking system is sh**. You can play with (50-65) overall players against (80-90+).
4. It's a bit hard to navigate in the menu. ( If you spend some time you'll eventually learn everything, but for a newcomer like me it was a bit hard. )


Kick Offs:
Normal..

P.S: There's a lot more stuff that are minor or important but you get the point.
I bought the game on sale for 20 euros. All I can say is IT'S NOT WORTH IT! I regret spending money on this joke. DO NOT BUY!

The rebranding to ""FC24"" raised hopes that remain unfulfilled (even after months of patching by the developers). All I can say is ""it now basically works without major bugs"".

Playing the career mode (either manager or pro) is unbelievably frustrating as it lacks any kind of realism and has nothing to do with the sport.
Why?
- Games commonly end with way to high scores (4:5, 6:3, so on). 
If you don't have 11 half-gods on the pitch you will lose against the computer-team.

- As a manager you can sign massive players for second league clubs, you simply have to to sell a few players for way too much and there you go with the funds to buy anyone you like and they actually join. As if no other team bids for players.
-The only power you have as a ""manager"" is to buy players and set the formation. No stadium building, infrastructure like training facilities or youth centers, no staff, no sponsoring deals, no detailled training, no detailled tactics etc.
- (youth) players won't develop if they don't play 90% of the games.
 
- As a single pro the rest of your team is absolutely incapable (no matter which club you're playing for), so you are bound to carry the team and can't just act like a normal player.
-The skill tree idea is great but the limitations are strange. For example if your player is taller than 1,90m forget you will ever have a speed above 84 or if you're an offense player your tackling is completely worthless - skilling it just costs so much that all necessary skills would be underdeveloped. Still it's required in the tasks.
- forget to play in any defending position - it's impossible to get good ratings (they are mainly influenced by scoring goals or the final pass. The second final pass already earns you nearly nothing) - further your attacking players will fail you miserably (as your defending team does if you're an attacking player)

-The list could be endless but I guess the point is understood.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what players you have, what matters is that you will lose if the game decides that.

This gamefranchise from EA is sadly the only real way to scratch your itch if you are actually looking to play the game, not only manage it (Like FM). The way EA has done it has been insanely painfull to watch. I have played almost every game of FIFA (Now EAFC) since 2010 on console and now on pc and console. It has gotten worse every time, the features they add that are new and cool, they remove as fast as the next version is out. But I get ahead of myself, let me review this game.

They put all of their marbles into FUT and Volta, this is where they milk their whales and scratch the itch of football gamblers. Around 30-40% of their playerbase is supposed to be people that play careermode, a gamemode they have taken a massive dump on, since 2016.

1. The play it self is full of bugs, people glitching out, hitboxes not being in place etc.. I don't know how many times I have rewinded to see that a ball went through a leg or a bodypart because of the hitbox glitching. 

2. The AI has become seemingly worse for every game. The AI reacts to everything as the input is put in on your end, but it seems like your players aren't doing it at the exact second, it has a small delay. Making the opponent seem like they are reading your mind. 

3. The amount of scanned faces is just downright bad. A couple of days ago, started a new career, wanted to play a real manager. It is like less than 30 faces of real managers actually scanned into the game, because instead of putting people they have previously scanned into a folder at the end, they are just removed. I don't care if the small picture of my manager is his real face, when you never see that picture, but you always see the worst version of a fake model for a manager ever created. 

4. Customization on the different platforms... You make a character on Volta or Clubs (the online gamemode vs other playercreated teams), you get access to a huge number of hairstyles, features, tattoos etc.. Those are not accessable on career at all. The jerseys you have on create-a-club is horrible, they say they added sponsors and it is just the Dice logo and an EA logo.. This was something they had on Fifa06, where you chose fake companies that added both a kitsponsors and some challenges to the gameplay to get more money into your save, that feature has still only been in that game.. 

5. Kitsponsors.... For some reason, I don't know if it is licensing or whatever, but if you go online, on some teams, their sponsors disappear. I now have a save with Watford, if I am online, they have no main kitsponsor, if I go offline, they have. 

6. Goalkeepers... Okey, I only have 2 issues with goalkeepers and I will keep it short. They can't save on their nearpost 90% of the time, they just can't, if it is the animations or how they are coded in positioning. I have no clue, doesn't matter if he is 50 rated or 91 rated, can't save it. Problem number 2 with keepers is the way they move, this might be a bug, but sometimes, when you force them out of goal, they seem to pull straight out, not regarding their position at all. So run straight out and the goal being fully open because of their movement. 

7. The gameplay. Okey I will not shit on the gameplay too much, just a tiny bit. For some reason, I still don't know why, this is how EA has treated the gameplay. 2018-2020 - Pace was king. 2021-2022 - Lay the ball into the box, and you will have most chances of scoring goals. In the last games they have added this feature and I still don't know why, powershot. Powershot is seemingly vs the AI the stupidest gameplay mechanic out there, they AI are in your face long before the animation is close to trigger and if they are for some reason not. There are 8 people in your way blocking it, seemingly disregarding every single teammate you have around them, just to block your shot. If you turn handball on in rules, you will have a literal ton of freekicks and penalties, but if you keep it off, they seemingly play handball due to animations and positioning. 

It's probably a lot of stuff I have forgotten to mention but this is what is in my head atm.

Conclusion: Since there are no other good footballgame to play, sadly this is your only option. If you have played this series of games before, you know how bad it has gotten even with its newer shinier finish. I can't recommend it at full price at all. It is not worth it and if you love football, all the small things will annoy you. EA is getting worse and worse for every game they put out, so do not think the next one will be any better.

Why can I be upset about this game: I have around 10k hours in Fifagames in total, most on console. I have followed Fifa since the original Xbox and the PS1, all the way up to PS5, gaming-pc and Xbox One X. I have both played FUT, Clubs, Volta, Be-a-pro and Careermode. Fifa and now EAFC are games I come back to, because I love football and because I see it as a chill pasttime.

Hopefully this is helpful for the ones thinking about buying it. EA will never see this review or think about it, and will probably never change their ways.",1708172509,1708172509,False,6,0,0.606373012065887451,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

200g raw, peeled tiger prawns from a sustainable source
1 green Thai chilli, chopped
3 garlic cloves, 1 crushed and 2 finely sliced
1 bunch coriander, leaves and stalks separated
1 tbsp caster sugar
juice 1 lime
3 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp groundnut oil
3cm piece ginger, finely sliced, then shredded
8 spring onions, finely sliced
1 red pepper, thinly sliced
85g water chestnuts, sliced
100g beansprouts
1 tbsp soy sauce
egg or rice noodles, to serve
lime wedges, to serve

STEP 1
Put the prawns in a bowl. Put the chilli, garlic, coriander stalks (snip these up using scissors first) and caster sugar in a spice grinder or small food processor and whizz together. Add half of the lime juice and the fish sauce, then pour this over the prawns.

STEP 2
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok, add the ginger and spring onions and fry for 1 min. Add the red pepper and fry for 1 min, until the pepper starts to soften. Add the water chestnuts and bean sprouts, and toss together until the bean sprouts start to wilt. Add the soy sauce and a really good grind of black pepper, then tip the lot into a serving dish.

STEP 3
Heat the remaining oil in the wok and add the prawns, lifting them out of their juices. Toss for 1-2 mins until they turn pink, add the marinade and swirl the wok quickly, then tip the lot onto the veg. Snip over the coriander leaves and sprinkle on the remaining lime. Serves over noodles with extra lime for squeezing over.

When the game feels good, it is the best soccer game on the market hands down. However, the other 99% of the time the game is completely broken making this game not worth the pennies in your couch. The amount of times I had to close and relaunch just to play a game is more times than I want to say. My character will suddenly stop moving randomly, passes will target your teammate but the game will not switch you to who you passed it to, after every FUT Rivals game I can't see the rewards without restarting the game. The list goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Every year the game gets more complex but somehow worse. Maybe adding god knows how many animations into the same engine every year will make it unplayable but hey, i'm just one of many who has bought every FIFA title for almost 10 years now.

EA FC 24 is, in short, the accumulation of many positives and negatives of the last few years of FIFA. I grew up playing FIFA 08-17, and in this time, I truly believe the game was at its best. Though graphics and physics weren't perfect, they had this element of true-to-skill game-play. From shooting to passing to defense, it all required specifically timed inputs to perform successfully. What I have noticed about new EA Sports games is that their best way to smooth out visible glitches and errors was to switch to an animation system. I call it an animation system because the game seems to follow a loosely pre-planned course that players can, from time to time, increase their likelihood that the animations being shown to them are in their favor. 

As many players have noticed, the so-called ""bounce-back system"" is a feature that seems to allow certain players (even me, I promise I'm not just crying) to have on the ball advantages and higher rebound potential. Usually in the closing minutes of the game or right after the opposition has scored, the bounce-back system guides one squad to a goal, seemingly to create a closer and more exciting game.

Through all my years of playing sports games and hearing ""EA Sports games are scripted"" I am finally giving in and agreeing. I have truly begun to believe that the game follows a pre-determined timeline. Maybe not determining a winner before the game starts, but at least guiding the game into a direction it would previously not have gone.

To conclude, I want to say that FC 24 is, in my opinion worse than the last 3 years of FIFA. Pack luck and RGN is no longer a concern of mine as I bought this game knowing I would be disappointed by those things. Content is constantly added that keeps me coming back to the game months after release. I have no where near the amount of hours on FC 24 as I did on FIFA(s) 21-23. Good luck next year EA! :)",1707862564,1707862564,False,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Sir Licksalot‚úü

Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

‚Üí Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
‚Üí Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
‚Üí Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
‚Üí Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
‚Üí Controllers not working properly.
‚Üí Game keeps minimising on PC.
‚Üí The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
‚Üí Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
‚Üí Objectives not counting.
‚Üí Not getting XP when completing objectives.
‚Üí The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
‚Üí Stuck in half-time animation.
‚Üí Game-play stutter.
‚Üí Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
‚Üí Anti-cheat error message.
‚Üí Media questions still make 0 sense.
‚Üí Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
‚Üí Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
‚Üí Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
‚Üí If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shocking, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring back and market as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price.

Since FIFA 15 I have played these games and yet I cant bring myself to play this game alot. I just feel that the gameplay is not what gets me to buy the game much anymore. Its the presentation, the decent soundtrack, the ability to play with friends or family, and the new roster. I would much rather play a game in Pro Evolution Soccer 2021 because of its gameplay or even an older FIFA such as FIFA 17/18. This game just doesn't excite me. My issues with the gameplay is that the game has become so e-sport focus that the AI does not do simple intelligent runs, your defenders against AI or players does not step to the ball very much and just continues to give them space inside your own box. Scorelines are routinely very high because there is just no defense. The game itself slows in its improvement more and more each year and for me, the gameplay took a major regression after FIFA 17/18. 

I wish I could enjoy this game, but I just can't realistically do so. Beside the technically issues that I will routinely have with stuttering, frame-rate drops, crashing, and sometimes the game will not open past the loading screen for 3-5 minutes. I am not angry, just grinded down and exhausted. I wish anyone that loves this gameplay the best and I wish you the best in finding joy within this game series.

Coming in late to the sh*t show of a family gathering the waitress she never acknowledged me when she came to drop off the appetizers. After my niece reminded her that she had a drink order for the bar she rolled her eyes and turned abruptly and left to get the drink when she came back I asked could I order something. When she finally took my order you could blatantly see she was visibly annoyed that I had joined my family gathering to which my nieces informed me that she had been acting as if she hated having to provide the customer service she should been trained more properly to do. While she was taking my order the store manager Donna brought over the margarita that was ordered at the same time the appetizers were ordered. I asked while each team member was standing there for a glass of Apple juice in a margarita glass with a side of lime. Kilen and Donna walked a away and after several minutes Kilen returned with a regular mug glass with apple juice not even with lime on the side. When I reminded her that the glass I requested she breath very heavily rolled her eyes and snatched the glass from the table mumbling something derogatory under her breath and stated with as much attitude she could muster "" all right"" as if I was inconveniencing her with her plans for waiting on our table. So I asked another waitress to send the manager over to our table once she walked away because she was being overtly rude to us the customer. The manager comes over listens to my complaints agreeing reluctantly with what all of us were saying about her behavior. During this exchange the waitress comes in listening distance from another empty table hears a little of the conversation about what we're telling the manager and then abruptly shoved on the chairs across the floor making a loud scrapping sound and storms off huffing and puffing and starts to cry at this point as if we did something to her negatively like she didn't deserve for this inappropriate behavior to be reported. I could not believe the exchange that was taking place in basically empty restaurant. While I waited for my food to get to the table I explained again to the manager how this energy and action should not have to be exercised by the staff she seemed very unmoved by pleas for better service and stood with a blank face looking at me as if I were alien. The manager then changes gears as if it's our fault as the customer that the waitress is so upset and crying and tried to my excuses switching the focus to the waitress emotional breakdown from her own behavior. By the end of the visit this manager tells me point blank to my face that I'm in the wrong for making her staff upset after I catch her and the whole rest of the wait staff on the kitchen portion of the restaurant discussing my reaction to being treated rudely and abrasive by the waitress in this scenario. I don't know when it became the customer responsibility to make sure that the wait staff has a good experience at a restaurant. I have always thought it was the other way around. But the manager goes on to tell me I didn't handle the situation correctly because I had her staff member upset. It's like wow Chili's that how your employees are trained to treat the people that make a choice to eat in your restaurant. I am taken all the way back by the lack of compassion or customer service exhibited by the manager and waitresses in this restaurant

- I thought hackers were non-existant, no. I met then, leading 3-0, they requested for a pause, suddeny my game crashes (Such Alt+F4) and never happen before.
- the Gacha is a total BS.
- ICON Cards are all pay to win trashes, their AI work rate is better than any rare gold cards. the CB/Defender Icon cards are BS, they chase differently, act more active and so on
- SBC? More like money donation, EA = Capitalism
- UI Bugs just so annoying, you need to re-login the UT so the Objectives notification is refreshed.
- DDA? I thought it didn't exist, til i hit incositency in my passes and finishes. and my AI act differently from one game to another
- Paid games but still asking for more, glad i didn't buy this when it's in full price.

For example, you go up by two goals, then all of a sudden your players start moving like they are stuck in quick sand, your opponent (whether it be AI or a real person) will clearly be moving faster than you and they go right down the field and score as you try to click to the closest defender but suddenly the buttons you've been accurately flipping through your players with just dont work the same. You are left unable to switch onto your defender to try to prevent the goal and left to watch in horror as the AI refuses to acknowledge the threat in the box and you 100% get scored on. It is sincerely to the point where you can predict it will happen, and then it does. It specifically happens in intense moments or games (ex. online promotion match, or a cup final in career mode). I still play this game as there are many aspects i enjoy, but unless you can get over the fact that you will be trying to beat another player online while actively watching the game reduce your players abilities in an attempt to sway the game, then you will be miserable. You will watch it happen to people you play against, and it will get to the point where you feel like your wins werent earned and your losses werent deserved. I very much wish i wouldnt have purchased this game.

Edit: I forgot to mention, this is such public knowledge throughout the player base. To the point that people use lower overall players and teams in matches, in an attempt to receive less hindrance. If you are playing with a worse team then your players move smooth as butter and outrun the better players for the other team.

I will omit all the money-grab moves EA made (only briefly mentioning that the good drops rate in UT is utterly garbage compared to all the previous titles) and focus solely on the gameplay. While with the recent FIFAs some parts of the general experience were screwed (such as match fixing) I never really had any major issues with the gameplay ITSELF. In EAFC24 this is definitely not the case.

First off it is the first time that the refereeing system is completely, and I mean completely, screwed. The use of advantage is terrible - sometimes not triggering at all, sometimes triggering when the advantage is actually being played, sometimes triggering way way too late, after the attacking team has already made an unsuccessful attempt at the goal. I have both suffered and benefited from situations in which:
- a throw-in was dictated despite the ball not leaving the pitch, not even touching the by-line 
- a penalty was awarded without one player touching another
- a red card was given without an actual foul being committed 
and many others. 

Second off, the input is fucked in some way. The controller I use does not matter and they both work perfectly well in other FIFAs. Very often the player will pass/shoot in a completely different direction than you want them to and, seeing from how I am able to regain the ball in many situations, it is not only the case for me but other players as well.

Third off, the AI is ridiculously dumb and I really mean it. For instance the goalkeeper, defending a potential shot from a very acute angle, will simply move away and leave the goal open. Another instance is an AI controlled player that you intend to pass to, upon your input, will start behaving completely erratically - i.e. start backing away  and end up behind an opposition player or just stop in place when you already input a through pass. Lastly, a lot of times the players will just go completely mental (think CB ending up more forward than CAMs despite stay back instructions). It is also very often that the AI controlled players run into each other or the player you are in control of. In general a lot of matches look like they are being played on ice because someone is on the ground at all times

Last off, the online matches are scripted to a degree I have never seen before and the game will laugh at you. I have had matches when the opponent's 85 rated goalie defended like 15/20 shots on target while I've hit the crossbar the other 5 times, my xG is something ridiculous like 9.5 and I still lose 2-1 or 2-0 to an opponent who has taken 2 shots and has an xG of less than 1. Also at times the game will give an enormous boost to the losing side by making the winning side's player act mentally challenged even more than described in the paragraph above.",1707397817,1707397920,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's always been metas, there's always been sweats, there's always been toxicity. But the reality is, back in the day, I could beat those people with a silver squad just by being good. Then in later versions of the game, you could use players like 80 Pato against mega squads and still have a chance. Not here. I got the game at the beginning of Jan. I'm already div 2 in ultimate team in 5 weeks, so I'm as good as ever. But getting from div 3 to 2 was a nightmare. Because beyond that point, you're not just playing against ronaldos, messis, mbappes every game. You're playing against TOTY versions, every, game. Unless you're willing to sit doing SBCs 8 hours a day, in the hopes of enough fodder to unlock a decent SBC player, or spending thousands to just pack the players, you don't have a chance. I would say metas have always existed, but this is the most one dimensional game yet. You can predict everything your opponent is doing, because they will just run down the wing and try to cut it back, even 100 times a game, hoping just once it works, and it will, no matter how good you are, because you simply have worse players. 
I've already gotten to the point, 5 weeks in, that i've had enough. I'll keep checking in on the game in the hopes some patches help the gameplay, but at this point its pretty obvious that the poor gameplay is intentional. This game has made EA more money already, than any FIFA before it. And that's for good reason, because people get baited into buying fifa points, because they literally cannot compete in any capacity without it, unless you have seriously good pack luck and pack a decent player out of your weekly rewards, however, good luck, because pack weight is woeful. Yes you can get plenty of 86+ gold players nowadays, but they're all fodder price, you can't make coins by selling these players like you used to be able to, because unless it's a promo card, it's worthless. Well, that's if you can sell them anyway, because 99% of things you unlock will be untradeable.

I have been playing FIFA for 20 years and i dont remember ever playing such a bad football game, i mean, i dont think i have ever seen so much crap, mess, in a football game, i mean it is that bad, this game so so bad! You build up your team and they act like you mean it, you start winning they start losing their positioning on the field, they start to fall apart, like it wants you to lose the game, and the bugs... oh lord everywhere! I have had games when the opposing goal keeper would rush my striker and there is no penalties, i have seen defender almost breaking legs and fault is on the opposite side, i have seen faults for red cards and refs dont even show a card, there is times when multiple shoots go directly to your goal keepers face and they cant save it, the amount of BULL S* is insane, this game is trash, garbage, the worst FIFA, ever, how is possible that a company that copy pastes their framework every year, destroy their own product, joke's is on you EA.

Looks like this game is never consistent, the amount of inconsistency is incredible, there is times, i just watch replays too see i m not going crazy, i had times when my opponent shot, in the replay the ball went through both legs, no colisions, same happens with goal keepers, there are so many and i mean so many, hundreds of times, striker is less than a meter away from the goal keeper, there's no way he can score, it will either hit the keeper or go above, and goal keepers let the ball go in, its insane.

Only playing single player manager career and it runs OK. But from my experience i'd recommend keeping the visual settings at 'Auto', as this seems to be the only setting that runs at a stable frame-rate. 

Had it set to high at one point and the frame dips when corners were being taken were outrageous. Only playing it capped at a modest 60fps and it was dipping down to mid 10s/20s for any set piece at eye-level with the lower stands. Also any cut scenes were lagging and skipping horrendously. 

It's clearly not the best optimisation but if you're in the market to take Mansfield Town to win the treble three seasons in a row this shouldn't let you down. As for Ultimate Team/ Online, not a clue. Also don't buy it at full price, wait till its on sale.

Basically, the win formula in UT, is purchasing bunch of fast players (meaning high pace values), instructing them to stay forward and get in behind the opponent defence line and send ""through balls"" nonstop until you score enough. Everyone tries to utilize same strategy and it is truly tedious and annoying. The dribbling and ball control abilities of offensive players is a joke. Anyone who actually watched a football match understands there is no way one player can keep a ball for so long in his feet. Ball is almost glued to the feet of offensive players and it is almost impossible to tackle or intercept to win a ball. So called ""Pro gamers"" memorize certain button combinations and utilize those skills to scatter opponents, and there is no way to beat them except for wasting tremendous amount of time on mastering those ""skills"".

2. If you don't think it will run smooth on your pc, don't even think about it.
3. If you really want to buy it, wait for it to be on sale for at least 70%-80%.
4. If this is the next upgrade of all fifa's games in history, remember that the chances of destroying your amygdala always remain the same, but the chances might increase by the fact that you start thinking how old this game is and how much time it had to improve.
5. If you have a limited budget and you're thinking about choosing between this game and another one, buy the other one, don't waste your time.

This shit is only worth if you want to buy fifa in a lower price than on PlayStation Store (Which probably won't give everyone the same experience as in PS), and ofc if you're ready to destroy your brain neurons for nothing in a casual beautiful day that you're thinking about running fifa and having a good gaming time (just like you did in the old times playing fifa on PS).

As i said, i'm serious for everything, these only if you really can handle the hard times that fifa will give you while you love the game so much.

If i have to be straight to my point, you'd rather buy ludo king, it is the same game type, whoever the game itself chooses to win, that player will win, no differences with fifa",1706990224,1706991019,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a full release this has more than enough bugs and lacks alot of teams and nations from previous titles ( i'm talking about kick off and manager career ) not to mention brazil and every south american league except argentina is missing from manager career. Manager career has gotten very little new features since last releases and it seems like the devs don't even care about it since it makes them no money. ( they rather focus on ultimate team ) the commentators are somewhat annoying sometimes but its alright i guess. Also they for some reason removed the animations that played before kick off in manager career that would show lineups and other interesting stuff. I don't have a clue why they would get rid of this in manager career? Also objectives are so stupid , there should be an option to turn them off for gods sake. I'll get fired from my own created club because i didn't sign 3 asian midgets or didn't qualify for round of 16 of a cup because i lost to fucking manchester city with my one and a half star 4th league team.
Also why can't i add my own custom crowd chants or goal anthems in manager career mode? Also why can't steam workshop be supported by this game , it would make it 1000x better. Imagine something is missing from the game so you just find a mod on steam workshop and add it without any hassle. That would be perfect. But no i have to find it on the internet and start it on FIFA Mod Manager and hope it works without breaking the fucking game. and i can't even have more than 2 or 3 mods otherwise the game crashes or doesnt work.

I have not played FIFA 23 much, but from everything I have seen and heard previously, it's pretty much just a retexture of the previous one. 
Was not the biggest fan of Ultimate Team past 2017, so I can't say if it's any better or worse in that regard but the career mode is alright, I'd say. I like some of the new mechanics that were implemented, but they're nothing massive by any means. At it's core it's just classic career mode, with a few new options. The cutscenes haven't changed at all, the way transfers work is mostly the same and certain aspects are completely broken. The broken and OP things aren't too much of an issue in my opinion, seeing as you don't encounter these things 90% of the time, but if they bother you that much, you can always download a few realism and bug-fix mods, if you have the time.

The greed that is shown through this game by Electronic Arts, and the amount of times they just straight up ignore the community is astonishing. Each year they advertise the game as improved yet when you actually play it, it feels like it degraded compared to last year. Career mode got ""improved"" because of which the fun that came with it is mostly gone. Ultimate Team has constant bugs, overpowered players that you can make with said bugs, pack weight manipulation, content that often ends up bugged or just not thought through just as it was with a pick that you had around 30% chance of getting TOTY Messi in, and the list goes on.

What do I mean?

Since team of the year players came out, the game is broken. For me who isn't ready to spend a single penny on in game purchases, you are unfortunately going to fall behind. 
Weekend league rewards is mediocre at best, while purchasing packs for fifa points will give you an huge advantage.

FUT is really the definition of pay to win, and it's sad. 
Career mode or normal online play, is the only thing I can recommend.

I must say, this is hands down the worst experience I‚Äôve had playing FIFA (or EA FC in the case) ever. 
The game is filled with bugs, poor gameplay (where everyone is just playing the same formation and doing cutbacks all game long) and constant errors by EA.
Last error completely killed Ultimate Team for the majority of people. Specifically, they have released an SBC where a lot of people ended up getting TOTY Messi for practically doing NOTHING but being the first ones to complete the SBC before it was removed. 
This is a huge disappointment to those who grind every single objective, every single game mode to get a good card into their team. Now, even in lower divisions, you have to face Messi, who is debatably one of the best cards atm.

Another *** update (update 8) and I'm still forced to use my 144Hz monitor at 60Hz in this *** game.
It doesn't matter if I use fullscreen or borderless mode... The option to change the monitor Hz in-game is always blocked/grayed out at 60Hz. Alot of people asking the same on internet.... 
The gameplay/fluidity looks so weird at 60Hz having a 144Hz monitor, even if i force the FPS to 60 to match that forced 60Hz. 

Only for this, i regret have buying this game.

Ever since I bought this game I‚Äôve been so confused as to the way my players perform.  I‚Äôll watch other streamers, and albeit they have a hard time with the gameplay too, even their players seemed to move more fluidly than mine.  It was really making no sense, until I finally came and looked at the pc reviews I realized that the pc port is absolutely garbage. 

If you can actually get the game to launch properly, having to jump through a series of hurdles most times, you are faced with a horrible experience.  The gameplay on console is bad, it‚Äôs even worse on pc.  Playing online is seriously the most infuriating thing in my life.  I can barely get through a single rivals game without almost punching a hole in my drywall.  My players are constantly either skating on ice or moving through water.  Every touch is too heavy or just simply gets stuck at your feet.  Moving around on pc in this game feels absolutely atrocious.  

Skill moves simply won‚Äôt register, I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve had to input the same skill move 3 times in a row just for my player to somehow fuck it up, a simple ball roll will fail to register 95% of the time.  

I don‚Äôt know how they did it, but somehow player switching is broken.  You will constantly switch to a player that is far removed from the play, making you move that player thinking it will switch to the cdm in front of the player with the ball.  This routinely causes you to move your players out of position leaving easy scoring opportunities.  You used to be able to counter this by directly switching with left stick but somehow they made this impossible. Want to switch from your cb to your cdm with a simple flick to the right? You are now controlling your left mid.  I don‚Äôt know how they did it, but somehow they made this impossible to navigate. 

Your keepers will not work.  Half the time they make a world class save, the other half the ball phases through their hands.  This game is so full of shitty, inconsistent garbage gameplay that not even ghandi could make it through a rivals match without wanting to kill someone. 

There are a whole host of other things I could get into, like the predatory gambling casino for minors lightly facaded as packs, but I‚Äôll leave it there.  

The gameplay is shit, the content is shit, and ea are an irredeemable company, this is my last purchase of an ea game.",1706639487,1706639487,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playstyles are a core mechanic of the game which separates it from the other fifa iterations and to me it is a very fun twist on the standard fifa gameplay formula. Simply put, every player now has their specialty on the pitch, sometimes being kind of ridiculous, other times maybe being a bit unnoticeable. Ultimate team is where the game really shines and the pay-to-win aspect isnt thaaat bad.

Great graphics and presentation. They have most of the teams licences (brazil and roma are missing). The PC control mappings sometimes bug out, but you can get around that. All in all its a good game, its just that to get to the fun part of the game, you need to go through all of EAs bullshit, which include the poor optimization, the pay-to-win packs and the very random and sometimes almost unexplainable bugs. Regardless, I would still recommend it, as it is the best football game out there unfortunately and it sometimes has its bright moments.",1706620959,1706620959,True,0,0,0.498338848352432251,0,True,True,False

CONS
Possibly the worst gameplay of the FIFA franchise. Players move behind their markers consistently leading to needlessly lost possession, passes often lead to nothing, it takes an absurd amount of time to even get your FUT squad even to 86 unless you buy coins or points and any other modes besides FUT and Career Mode are akin to huffing pure carbon monoxide.

PROS
Menus look really nice, bugs aside. The redesign feels very fresh and clean, and the menus are newly optimised for lower end hardware in comparison to FIFA 23. Mods, as usual, heavily carry this game just like any other FIFA franchise game on PC. FIFER, RODE, WZRD and the eSIM projects are all worth looking into this year just like any other year and they all deliver well. The game has FAR better performance than 23 and even 22, leading to being able to run this on anything from lower mid end to the upper echelons of PC builds. Career mode feels roughly the same as 23, but that's not to discredit the mode. It still delivers (as long as you use mods) just like any other variant of it and there's lots of room for creativity. I haven't played Pro Clubs as of yet but I assume it offers much of the same as it always has, same goes for VOLTA this year.

THE VERDICT
Use the Anadius Denuvo workaround to play this game until you're 100% sure you want it, the gameplay is different enough from 23 for this to be kind of a neccessity. It runs far better than 23 but it still can have performance issues on very low end hardware. And of course, modding is the way to go as always.",1706471483,1706471483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

WHY would it be NOT possible to play online with 3 other friends a 2vs2 match ?

Seriously? It can't be a ""technical"" obstacle, because playing together with ONE friend is possible against another 2 player team.

Not implementing such a community friendly feature is certainly the decision of some super smart EA Manager who LOVES the players. I mean the Players SHOULD buy COINS

I decided to give FC24 a chance after a two-year break from their games, thinking maybe they've improved. Big mistake. This game has done wonders for my stress levels ‚Äì by which I mean it's elevated them to new heights. I should have stuck to my peaceful pastime of betting on turtle races; at least there, the unpredictability is intentional.

It's evident that EA has assembled a dream team of interns who must have learned game development through interpretive dance. I'm convinced they're using ChatGPT to code the entire mess. The gameplay is so scripted that I half-expect the players to break into a synchronized dance routine at any moment. I wont even lie when it comes to scoring goals against my opponent as I sometimes pity him and feel his distress from the shear cancer of this game.

And let's talk about the impeccable physics ‚Äì or lack thereof. Suddenly, players move like they're carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders. It's like they're auditioning for a slow-motion ballet instead of playing a football game. Passing, tackles, and rebounds? Ah, who needs logical game mechanics when you can have chaos that feels completely AI-controlled?

In conclusion, FC24 is a masterpiece if you consider ""masterpiece"" to be a synonym for disaster. Save your money, buy a bag of popcorn, and watch turtle races instead ‚Äì at least you'll get more excitement and a better return on your investment. There is no reason for you to wipe some years off of your life just to pursue the ""perfect UT team"" as if its going to make your life any better.

Same as ever. Minor, incremental and barely noticeable changes made to last year's game so that they can sell it again at AAA prices. This is the formula for these sports titles and EA FC is no different. On the plus side, the name change is just cosmetic... for all intents and purposes, this is the FIFA of old.

Judged solely on its merits, its not a bad game, UI is a bit different but plays like any old FIFA. Tons of fun to be had playing with friends and the cross-play feature is welcome in that respect. 

Ultimately, however, this game should not be published annually, rather every few years with annual updates and player packs. The ""improvements"" year on year do not justify EA selling it as a brand new game. Only worth buying if the last FIFA you played was 5+ years ago.

The discrepancy between spending money and not is so blatant and ridiculous. The expensive players are just so much better and this game has really turned ""pay-to-win"".

As you play this game in career mode, you face an obstacle that inhibits you from enjoying this game, which is difficulty. The problem is that this game does not know how to properly balance the game play. When placed on easy difficulty, all the AI opponents do not play defense and let you run through them like they are bystander. The bigger problem rises when you actually want challenge. When you go for higher difficulty, all of sudden you face dumbed down teammates, not sophisticated opponents. To watch 3 defenders practicing social distancing on 1 opponent, refusing to contain or tackle him is plain brain cancer experience that you get to witness the entirety of the game. I honestly do not understand how does EA Sports keep releasing basically same game over and over every year without putting in actual improvement to their AI opponents and teammates.

My advise to anyone who might be considering buy this game is do not waste your money on glorified 3D soccer animator. I promise you, only difference between previous Fifa game and this is updated roster.",1706224206,1706224206,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As an avid fan of the FIFA series, I can't help but express my profound disappointment with FIFA 24, a game that seems to revel in mediocrity and an astonishing lack of innovation. It's disheartening to see a franchise that once set the standard for football simulation now mired in a quagmire of stagnation.

One of the most glaring issues with FIFA 24 is the blatant lack of innovation in gameplay. It's as if the developers took a time machine back to the last decade and decided that the formula from ten years ago was still cutting-edge. The game mechanics feel tired and overused, with no real attempt to introduce fresh ideas that could breathe new life into the series. It's essentially the same game on repeat, a disheartening reality for those who were hoping for progress and excitement.

The bugs and glitches in FIFA 24 are not mere hiccups; they're game-breaking nuisances that make it clear the developers prioritized a rushed release over a polished gaming experience. From players getting stuck in animation loops to bizarre physics defying the laws of football, it's as if the QA team took an extended vacation. These issues not only disrupt the flow of the game but also highlight a lack of commitment to quality control.

What's most perplexing is the disregard for fan feedback. Over the past decade, there have been countless suggestions and requests for improvements, ranging from refined career modes to enhanced AI intelligence. However, it seems as if these pleas have fallen on deaf ears, and the developers are content to ignore the loyal community that has supported the franchise for so long.

In conclusion, FIFA 24 is a prime example of a once-revered series that has lost its way. With minimal innovation, a plethora of bugs, and a refusal to listen to the voice of its community, it's difficult to recommend this game to anyone looking for a genuinely engaging football simulation experience. Save your money and stick with an older version or explore other football titles that prioritize progress and player satisfaction over a quick cash grab.",1705922894,1705922894,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay (online multiplayer, Ultimate Team) is fast paced, often times reaching scorelines of 5+ goals, and can seem inconsistent at times in regards to the matchups with other players. The addition of in-game playstyles also adds to this inconsistency, where a specialist trait can guarantee a free kick, long power shot, or other type of goal. On a notable aspect, animations are fluid and the motion capture has been done very nicely in the new Hypermotion V segment. While some will enjoy the smooth movement, seasoned players may find left stick control lacking without the use of the close dribble playstyle.

Overall, its a football video game which most will be familiar with over other offerings, and even if ""Fifa"" isn't in the title anymore, it remains a chill (but bug filled) title that you can grind for hours, or pickup once in a while.

TLDR; Build team of players, run around with ball, put ball in net, repeat.

Like play a ball over the top of the opponent back line from any distance and just watch them jog to your attackers. It doesn't matter if you are playing Blackpool or Real Madrid. The opponent defense is terribly slow. I've changed sliders, difficulty levels, and it does not matter at all. The one saving grace about FIFA/EAFC is that the gameplay is always pretty decent. It's safe to say it's not for this one. 

Among it's many other problems for the past 8 FIFA games, one of my biggest issues is the anti-cheat. It breaks the game all too often to the point where you cannot launch the game.

I spent 300+ pln for this game and it is not worth it. There are constantly new bugs that usually arent fixed for a month. For example there was a bug where in ultimate team it would at all times show you that you had 2 objectives to claim. This bug wasn't fixed for a few months, and it wasn't just me since my friends had similar experiences. The micro transactions are getting out of hand as last year buying packs could only get you so far, but right now it seems like there is always 600k or 500k packs which give you like 100 players. While this wouldn't be unusual later in the game, packs like these have existed for a few months, even when the game was new. I went into this game excited for what they would add, but after realising it was a copy and paste of fifa 23 with women and a different ui that also had more glitches and microtransactions, I will buy ea fc 25. I have always love fifa/ea fc, but with how absoultley shite this game is, it might be the end of a beautiful era, an era where Fifa/ea fc dominated the gaming industry.

Played a few games and went through the training portion of the game. This is a view from a short playtime though a bit too long to get a refund, my mistake there.

While I enjoy football games and previous iterations of FIFA this version is very similar to all other versions played with very little in the ways of improvement. If you have an earlier FIFA game, might as well continue unless you're after the most recent transfers and such.

Sadly there are a fair few bugs on the PC/Steam version:
1. Laggy/Jumpy cutscenes/celebrations
2. Training commands keep repeating during practice sessions when they have told you several times before.
3. Running animations in character creation look terrible with skeleton issues.
4. Mouse and controller constantly fight each other on menus. Even when you move the mouse off screen when you finish a game or open a menu it resets back to the centre of the screen to begin a fight again.
5. Controller inputs on the bumpers and triggers tend to be hit an miss as to whether they get recognised.

Edit:
More bugs found after a longer play and one that makes Ultimate team completely unplayable. Unsure what causes it but whenever I skip the cutscene in ultimate team the pre-game scenes remain on pitch and players run around doing the T pose and unable to touch the ball.",1705610643,1705701001,False,3,0,0.533829689025878906,0,True,False,False

Oh well they lose the FIFA brand but not the licensing portfolio which means the game will continue to be same  ,,FIFA'' we play every year which is a good thing this time.

There's a variety of game modes we're familiar already with,personally i miss the Alex Hunter journey or something similar oh well i guess all good things comes to an end.

Playstyles makes the difference this year between players, now it spotlight stars even more and they stand out from the rest. It's a new mechanic that is implemented for those with special talent allowing them to shine and make the difference. 

Theres subtle additions to gameplay, some changes in Career mode ,Volta football but at his core the game remain the same as in previous Fifa titles.
Ultimate team of course got improvements because it's the game mode that brings the money from microtransactions. But you don't have to spend a dime ,you can earn good players from squad building or earn coins from challenges or matches which you can use to buy what you want from transfer market.

I'm glad they kept Volta football,it's a fun street football mode.

On a positive note,even with their departure from FIFA brand they didn't lose content .
And now about rivalry. Looking at you Konami,it's true your game is free but at what cost?

Hate to say it but even if it's the same game from last years ,it remains the best football game on the market.

Pros:
-PlayStyles
-Hypermotion
-Improved Career mode,Ultimate team
-Volta Football is fun

Cons:
-we won't get innovation and large improvements until next-gen consoles arrive

Story   - 7 ( career mode and other single player modes helps/ for example Efootball from Konami got 1)
Gameplay- 9
Graphics- 8

TBH I only play campaign/story mode, so the new features/updated graphics looks nice, i got it on sale for like 20$ and i would say that a twenty dollar game that came with any online mode and a halfway decent story would be a good purchase.

So compared to those i think gameplay (when it's good) is better. But, there are many faults with this game. Random connection losses not due to my internet, UT is crashing most of the time when trying to buy players in the club or SBC Club section, menus being slow and way slower than normal at times, the gameplay is very inconsistent a lot of the time with players being slow at shooting or passing the ball and some passes not hitting at all (This is a reoccurring issue from the previous installments from what I've heard 20, 21, 22 and 23). If you can get over those issues it can be a great game, but most of the time it kinda sucks the joy out of it. Would i recommend this game? Maybe, if you're trying to play the game competitively while taking it very seriously, i wouldn't recommend it, that will just end up in you breaking your equipment which is not a very good economical decision considering the game is already 70‚Ç¨ (which is kinda overpriced for what you get). For casuals? I would say you can have some joy in this game, but it has definitely lost it's shine over the years and has become more and more pay to win since last i played which was Fifa 14. I hope they redo the spaghetti code this game runs on for the coming installments in the series, if not i wouldn't say it's worth copping unless you have a pack opening addiction.",1705585857,1705586034,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are things that I absolutely love about this game. When gameplay is good, it's really fun. But, EA hasn't optimized this game for PC and it can be very jittery and unresponsive, which seems like it's occurring more and more. FYI, I play this on a ~$2000 custom built PC, so it should run VERY well and it just doesn't. 

Ping isn't respective of what actually happens in game. When you're loading in, it'll tell you that you have 20 ms ping and then once you get into the game your ping will spike to 50+. 

I love soccer (Liverpool fan), and I log onto this game everyday just to see what SBCs there are and to play a couple games.

The game has the exact bugs from Fifa 23 and even more.

The UT has 4 game modes (Division Rivals/Squad Battles/Fut Champions/FutDraft) and every game mode feels different, the players move differently, the players seem to have different stats, u have to learn 4 different games to play it.

Most of the players have fake stats that doesn't apply in game, for example, every CB with 80+ pace can easily catch a striker with 99 pace.

Every shot from outside the big area is goal, or at least 95% of the shots.

The women are overpowered, most of them have stats better then the big players that we now nowadays.

The objectives are always bugged, saying that u have completed some, and then u go redeem it still stays u have to redeem.

A lot of times the images in the player cards are bugged, and appears the card without the player, or with 2 players.

Once icons were like an achievement, something that make us feel good and powerful because it was hard to get them, now there's like 20+ SBCs of icons, most of them easy to complete and they give tons of them also in the season pass so icons now are like normal players.

There's one specific graphics definition (the one specific to the hair) that causes you to lose a lot of fps in cut scenes, like you are playing in 144+ fps and drop to 20.

The gameplay is a disgrace, with bugs every match and the AI is just terrible and stupid most of the times and make it so that you suffer goals in the most ridiculous possible way.

Basically, i play Fifa since Fifa 07, and i saw the game having his ups and downs but nothing too serious, this one is the perfect example of a bad game where u have one previous with problems and instead of fix the problems to launch a new game, u launch it with even MORE problems.

Worst ever, my first time ever losing patience and actually living review about a game. You didn't optimize anything for the PC version of this game. Proves the reason I didn't buy EAFC for the past 3 years. Usual scripted bs plays but now x2 times more, stuttering and lags and having to go trough multiple forums and videos to fix that, still doesn't work properly. I don't understand why you think that Fernando Torres and other ""LEGENDS"" were x2 times bigger and taller than players today. So much non-sense I have never seen so MANY reason to hate this game even though I first played it in 2003 with Zidane and Davids or Nedved and Davids on the cover. You guys are nincompoops and know nothing about football even though you interview them and are always around them. Text me or call me I will explain you how football works and especially how players should naturally move on the field. Explain you that just because you rated a player 87 it doesn't mean that 87- rated player will always be scared of him and pass HIM the ball instead of his teammates. You have been doing the ""I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE PRESSING ON YOUR KEYBOARD AND TRYING TO ADJUST IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO CONCEDE A GOAL"" type of bs and still do. Shm.

The only reason I have it is to play Pro Clubs with my friends. I had  been a fan of Ultimate Team for years, but it has gotten so broken and exploity that if I was an EA game developer, I'd tell people I don't have a job, because I'd be that ashamed to be anywhere near this with a ten foot pole.

Everyone runs the same high press and uses the RB button to force the AI players on their team to rush you for tackles. It is regular to see an opponent's CDM in champs end the game with 11 intercepts and no tackles; those intercepts are courtesy of double tap RB, where a player can make their team cut off the nearest passes for the opponent - this has not been fixed in patches this year. The reality is that no one controls their own players to make tackles anymore, they just get the AI to do it with double tap RB, good old fashioned RB, or the AI doing offball tackles because of the 71 team depth setting. 

Lets not even touch the fact that they release different card promo's every week for the same players that everyone uses, and they have tons of 'special' packs in the store to get better luck packing certain types of cards (depending on current promo's), which is a blatant cash grab at your wallet. 

The scripting is no longer a myth - some of the mistakes your players will make if your leading past the 60th min mark are uncontrollable, and this built into the game by EA so that games are 'exciting' and 'competitive'. 

I cant remember the last time I actually enjoyed playing ultimate team and I gave it up in the new year. Now that EA have successfully moved away from Fifa and can keep all profits for themselves, they will only continue to get more and more blatant with this. Please do not go near Ultimate Team, especially if your a teenager.

The gameplay for me at least has always been the most fluid and enjoyable out of any football game.

Career mode has its minor improvements as per usual, dead game modes like VOLTA and Clubs still exist, I only say dead because EA don't listen to the community when it comes to improving them.

Crossplay is enabled across the board with all game modes, unfortunately crossplay isn't available for the Ultimate Team market meaning we still have a pretty bad market in comparison to console.

Ultimate Team is really good, obviously pay to win but with enough grinding you can build a team of your dream players pretty easily depending on how much you play.

Honestly my one issue with this game is the fact that they made Ultimate Team have both men's and women's team, its not the fact that they are women or anything like that for me, I actually enjoy the women's sport, even if I have watched far less of it. It's more that for me, I have much more sentimental value when it comes to men's players and getting an ICON pop up only for it to be someone I have literally NEVER heard of, really sucks. In my opinion they should be put into two different game modes based on this alone but then you could argue that you are setting that mode up for failure given the fact the women's version of the sport is far more unpopular.

Put it this way, if I pack 93 Rated Ronaldinho I am waking up my entire household at 3AM, if I pack 93 Rated Mia Hamm, I'm shrugging it off because there is absolutely NO sentimental value for me.

Overall though, its an EA Sports game, you know what you are getting into, huge focus on the Ultimate Team game mode, pay to win aspects or endless grinding and a usually stable, enjoyable arcade experience.",1696991486,1704811907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will never recommend this game to anyone and I will never buy a FIFA game again. I went against myself this time by hoping something would be different but not again.

Ai is terrible, goes from godly to the most dumb possible.
There are so... many rebounds in the lastest fifas that sometimes i think i am playing nba.
Passing, shooting is so random, stats and traits help sometimes but still wth.
Game in itself has so many problems and it is kinda sad because the idea is rly good but unfortunatly is just cash grab.
Other content is same stuff of the previous years, people and i mean probably 90 percent only plays UT, you guys should create separated client/app so people who only want to play UT can, just create something separated with full focus team.
oh btw it is funny how the game feels diferent on ps5 and pc... you guys have such weird way of organizing resources.

Every game is a sweat fest with no skill gap and is so 1 dimensional that it gets incredibly repetitive and boring after 2 games. Rebounds are the worst they ever have been, mixed with OP finesse shots and running down the Bi-line to sweat across goal for an easy tap in. Everyone plays with the new 71 depth so the midfield is nonexistent most of the time. Attacking AI is absolute garbage. Playing fifa 17 again on xbox and you can see the massive difference in attacking AI and how they downgraded so hard over the last few years. In fifa 17, they actually MOVE and get into space. Wingers will actually make runs. This year, if you don't player lock, movement off the ball is virtually nonexistent. Content is garbage. EA have no idea how to balance promo teams. R1/RB dribbling far too broken. I could go on more but this should be enough lol. EA should fix the game before it dies more considering they are all about money. We will see if it improves. Save your money until something changes (if it every does)

FUT:
haven't played for a good while, personally just dont enjoy the game and it make me rage a lot so i stop playing it for the benefit of my own setup. for the short amount of time i did play it, i raged like last year so

Manager career mode:
pretty much the same as last year just more annoying, im sick of making changes i was asked to make and the same fucking week my assistant manager telling me it's not working, I change it back and they say the same thing. another thing is that im being told to change the plans of certain players because they arent playing yet they started every single match aside from a cup match against charlton.

Player career mode:
a lot better, i love how you can actually choose what team you can go to

general things:
first off I hate how glitched and unrealistic the crowd can be, like please give the option to turn off flags for teams that don't have them irl, another thing i hate is that when you create your own team and play in away kit, the fans all wear the away kit aswell which makes no sense. final thing is that half the time nearly everyone in the main stand is wearing the teams shirt which again, is really unrealistic

Good job EA! Releasing a new FUT promo every week demolished the usability and price of normal gold cards within the first two weeks of release . It is so obvious that EA are doing this because the player base has largely decreased as compared to previous FIFA titles. Yea, now that you have a new promo every week, more players will invest in your stupid store packs.

I have played almost every FIFA since FIFA 96, and it's no secret that EA do very little to change the games each year, but this year's edition really takes the price for low effort from EA. It really does feel like this is a BETA edition and we are still waiting for EA to release the finished game. EA football fans must have becomes accustomed to half finished games, otherwise there would have been an uproar. CDPR received so much negative press for their disastrous Cyberpunk 2077 release, a game they then spent a long time fixing to give the fans what they initially promised. Trust me when I say, this launch is much worse than CDPR's, and it has already been four months and no sign of EA trying to fix anything. I also find it an insult to the fans that a game released in 2023 is adapted to run on a severely outdated PS4, it shows how little effort EA have put into making it the best game possible, they just want to make money from it. 
They have as in previous versions, taken the predecessor (FIFA 23) and edited it, which should have been fine as FIFA 23 is a decent game, but the decisions they have made along the way are terrible. Everything seems like it's geared towards the features where they can make money from microtransactions, and the features that made the game so popular over the years have been neglected. Manager career mode is plagued with bugs, features that don't work, other features that instantly forces CTDs. Player career mode is really lackluster as your CPU controlled team mates act the same as players you don't control while you play the whole team, meaning the defenders sort of just run along with the attackers but don't actually try to take the ball away from them. There is no possible way either of these features passed any sort of testing phase in the EA developing office.
There are a ton of other issues as well that shouldn't have passed any testing, the pitch weather and lighting can completely change as the ball goes out for a throw-in or goal kick. Giant blocky shadows appear and disappear during game play, I've had random players freeze in place while the game still moves on and the other 21 players move just fine.
If all the issues and unfinished game play wasn't enough, there are also really odd additions. The lighting in the player creation screen now comes from the side rather than head on, so you can only clearly see half the player's face, another feature that shouldn't have passed any testing. As usual, the game is designed to simulate a TV broadcast, so why did they have the referees hand out cards in first person? You go from playing in third person to suddenly see the view from the referee's eyes. why? The game is full of these odd decisions. 
I highly recommend you stick to FIFA 23 or football games not made by EA. I would say wait until EA fix this mess but I really don't think they have any plans to. Very sad to see such a large gaming company release such an unfinished game.",1704399190,1704399190,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has quite some things to offer that would make it a good game. However, there are way too many flaws that hinder this from being a good game. At the end of the day, gamplay is the most important aspect (or should be...!) - but it seems EA is more concentrating on flooding the community with outside gameplay content, instead of working on the core issues of this game.
No. 1 and the most important for all plattforms:
Inconsistend gameplay - games where players turning luck trucks, take extra unnecessary touches, despite passing / shooting / skill move / direction change has been triggered for ages. This may all come down to lag compensation for me, as I have a stable good internet connection with about 20 ms latency to ea servers. But whatever the cause of this may be, this makes this game not enjoyable, even frustrating at times. If it is lag compensation, even worse, as this would mean people with good internet connections get punished (and put at a disadvantage) for the sake of people with lousy connections.
No 2. especially for PC users:
Awefully optimized for PC!! Same problems that constisted already in previous versions persist. Obviously EA is not interested in spending any resources into making this game decently playable on pc. I am running on a 7600X with a 6950 XT GPU and yet my graphics card is taken to to limit when just entering the menu. If you have set up 120ish fps or higher, the game runs at the same fps in the menus, let alone you unlimited the fps, which bring the FPS to 400 / 500 fps in the menus with 100% GPU utilization. Thing is, the menus are even harsher on the gpu as the actual gameplay is, which is beyond ridiculous. Then there is the mouse bug that hasn't been fixed from previous alterations, where you cant click buttons in the menu, as your mouse reappears in the middle of the screen occasionally.
No 3.: obviously blatant pay to win mechanics, nothing new here. This is only half way to blame on EA, the other half goes out to people spending money for digital content on this game. This is naturally everyone's decision, however to me this is beyond insanity.
No 4.: Bugs & Missing convenience
Just a few examples of what I mean by that:
- When you have duplicates, you can't buy players on the market via the smartphone app, ingame on the pc that is no problem.
- Simply missing obvious helpful options, such as limit player search to a certain ratio rating (e.g. 75 - 80) or
a function to select all you duplicates for a SBC, other than remembering each and everyone of them and searching and selecting them one by one. I can't understand why such easy functions are not in the game.
- Various crashes when tapping out of the game
- Game sometimes just freezes and crashes on the transfer market

This is written by a casual player, winning some games and losing some. For me it is not about just about winning and losing, but the experience in the process.

Hope this helps some people out making a decision on whether or not they should buy this game (let alone invest money for digital content).

Cheers

Edit: Completely forgot to mention the stutter occuring when the game switches from ingame to cutscences, whether you have set the cutscences to half frame rate or full frame rate.

Issues experienced in ONLY 6 hours of playtime, which makes me stop playing it:

7 CRASHES:
- 4 crashes of the anti-cheat with ""117"" error code in the middle of a Rivals match, assuming that I am suspiciously cheating when I never dare to cheat, as I've spent a lot of money, probably over ¬£1000.- on my games and skins on Steam and EA both.
- 3 random crashes without any sign or error code; the game just simply disappeared into the fog.

RANDOM CONTROLLER DISCONNECTS (HAPPENED 3 TIMES):
- While I was able to use my controllers Xbox button (the big X with the light) and inputs worked outside of the game, the game showed me a message that said my input device is disconnected and I had to restart the game to make it work properly again.

GAME IS STUCK:
- Once I was in the menu, the game did not respond to any of my input except the one that opens my friend list, the right trigger.
So, I was not able to navigate in the menu, neither with my keyboard, so I had to ALT+F4.
Sometimes, the game also stuck on start-up; FC24 image comes out, but the game would not launch at all.

STORE NOT WORKING:
- I also experienced some problems in the store.
I am not sure if it is a network issue-related problem or if it was a local issue, but I was unable to order any packs until I restarted the game.

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
- I am playing on a high-end PC (Ryzen 9 3900X, RX 7900 XTX, 48 GB RAM, bunch of m2 SSDs), and I had a lot of FPS issues and stuck/stuttering, especially when I had the cinematic after a goal, missed chance, or the referee giving a card cinematic.

I have a couple of hundred hours in FIFA/FC or whatever it is called, but what I can see now is that this game is going down a slide and getting worse and worse every year and draining funds from the players, but don't misunderstand me, I also bought the game AGAIN, even after a decision when I said I will not buy it again, so there is no lazy/get used to it company without a horde of sheep to burn their money.
My personal peak was the 21, and the 22 was alright of the latest EA football games, but it was also very annoying sometimes with the bugs and the overpowered players like Fekir, Ben Yeder, etc. However, 2007 was the one I was really in love with.

This one, the 24, has a lot of issues and these issues are the same from year to year.
I believe that most players would be happy if these problems were finally fixed, and we could play with a smooth and issue-less game. 
Maybe try to do less, but better.

I know I did not even talk about my personal experience, which was alright.
The game, on its own, is fine-ish.
Players are extremely slow in my scenario and I cannot enjoy the defending, which is barely possible most of the time as the players are running everywhere and when they have to act with a slide or step in or anything, it is really hard to control them in the right way.
The game flows well, by the way; overall mood is okay; sometimes it feels like you are playing football.

Personal best thing during game-play:
Hyper-motion stuff, nice analytics and visual invention give a lot to the game.
I like the half-time animations with those walk-in to the changing room and warm-up animations.

Personal worst thing during game-play:
Power shot Zoom in makes defence even harder.
!!!NOT A GAMEPLAY MOMENT, but I hate the new MENU.. Any another menu structure would be better than this.. too complicated and every step has a loading time, also navigation is so hard that I would rather solve a rubik's cube than starting a rivals match and I does not even have a rubik's cube at home, so I will have to go to a shop first which opens at 9am and it is 7:45am at the moment (I do not know how to solve a rubik's cube by the way)..

I would recommend buying this game because I want a better FIFA/FC again, and I know it requires a lot of funds, even more than what we've paid already with the packs and for the games. But I would not recommend buying this game because I feel like I am being robbed every year, paying for the same game again and again, and the ears of the developers and/or publisher do not hear our words. I will definitely not buy this game again, rather try my friends or simply watch a stream of it and make sure my issues are resolved before buying. I do not own the 23 for the same reason, but I had to give a chance to the 24, but I've already regretted it.",1704354615,1704354615,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Manager mode has no changes apart from a few cutscenes, the core mechanics are still the 90% same from 2015. 
Online play is a big d1ck competition of who can exploit the most glitches. Leaving the toxic community alone and the trash glitchy gameplay, EA has decided to implement lag compensation in online play, which will punishes you no matter how good your internet connection is, making already abysmal defence near impossible, resulting every match being a goal fest 'cause no one can defend. Ultimate team is gambling sim with EA rigging the pack weight shamelessly. The gameplay against AI isnt any better, the difficulty gap between World class and Legendary is absolutely massive. You can 10-0 world class but then get 10-0 by Legendary, nothing in between. So either play every game know you can score at will, making it boring or play against an AI which essentially bends the rules to score (60 rated will defend dribble and shoot like they're 90). Even the games you will win would not fulling 'cause you can feel the AI being mild for that particular game (it will still be 70-30 possession, have fun). So offline play is a coin toss between boring or incredibly unfair and frustrating. Online play is structured around a unfair gambling model, populated with toxic community on the back of terrible gameplay. 
It is shame that this is biggest product on the market for the lovers of the beautiful game. Football fans deserve better.

I'd not recommend this game to anyone on PC. The reasoning behind this due to the below issues:

- Cursor glitch: physical cursor displays on screen when using a controller. You can disconnect your mouse and it'll still appear on the screen, even  mid game play.

- Poor servers: The servers for AU players are horrendous. I am running a wired connecting from my router to PC and the game states I have 24ms ping at all times. However, this is not the case... I have used a tool on EA's own website to test my connection to the servers and the result came back at over 300ms ping. 

- Game play is one dimensional: Meta has truly ruined this game. You simply cannot enjoy the game by using non-meta players. For instance, in FIFA 13/14, you could use a silver Brazilian team and be genuinely competitive against a fairly stacked team... this is what made the game fun.

- Input delay: The game on PC experiences a heavy input delay, whether the gameplay is good or bad. I do not believe a user should have to search far and wide to find the best settings in a game to experience the game at it's full capacity. Consumers pay for a finished product, not a product that is not optimised for a PC gaming experience.

Furthermore, not to mention the scripted moments within the game. In Ultimate Team, there's dynamic difficulty adjustment, which ensures your players are performing worse than their base states would suggest. There's no need for this in a Football simulator. Not only does it frustrate all players at all levels, it also disrupts the integrity of the game (not that there is much to begin with). 

There are moments when I do enjoy the game, however, these are all enjoyed with playing against my mates.

Please avoid this game.

I've played FIFA since 2010 and ultimate team since 2013 and I can confidently say that this is the worst FIFA I have ever played. The worst game I've ever played possibly.

the gameplay has never been slower with the pay-to-win factor cranked up to 11. Goalkeepers may as well be replaced with cardboard cutouts of themselves for all the good they do. finishing that can make you hesitant to shoot inside the box, but bury every other finesse shot after passing from the corner. etc... 

the netcode is horrible and archaic which causes variable levels of sluggishness ranging from walking in pool water to walking in cement mix depending on which time of day you play.

the optimization for PC is laughable with launching the game taking ages, lagging in gameplay after cutscenes that compounds on the aforementioned problems, and the occasional cheaters.

Simply put, I would use this game to torture spies for information. If you are new, stay away. if you are a FIFA or football fan, skip this game or wait for an update.",1703960198,1703960198,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This has more issues than the user interface just outright breaking from time to time or the game deciding your controller isn't plugged in despite being able to use it in the interface and now it's time to use your KB+M in games all of a sudden. I suppose it is marginally better than the game constantly blue screening like last year. There's a lot of weird in this game, and that's before we've got to the show that is an actual match.

This game doesn't feel like football. Your defenders have a knack of just switching off and not defending. Your attackers regularly don't use their apparent stats and start running when you have opportunities to break out and just idly trot instead. Playing online and offline is a joke in and of itself. People in the community say this is just skill issues. But then again anybody who isn't using 'skill issue' ironically is not to be listened to anyway.

Shooting is all dice rolls, the game turns into a quagmire whenever anybody applies any pressure tactics. Playing online can feel okay one moment and then absolutely dreadful the next. It's like there's something trying to constantly tell you your team of icons suck and you need better players. Buy the packs. Buy the points. Roll on the pack weight that's been neutered by adding a whole bunch of other stuff and constant new promos every week of new cards. Buy it all like you want to.

Close your wallet to this and to Electronic Arts.  I will be free next year. I promise.

EDIT: To add on the game issue and crashes I get I forgot to mention. The first being DirectX errors of ""GetDeviceRemovedReason"" is bizarre as I don't have Direct X failures in any of the other games I use. And they're a lot more demanding.

There's also an issue when I go to stream on Discord or to capture some of the dumbest stuff I've seen in the game where it won't capture and the screen goes invisible. Sort it out lads.",1703803926,1703953592,False,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

GAME PLAY : it has a potential but generally it's so bad 
CONTENT : good 
FOOTBALL: it doesn't exist 
this is absolutely not a football  game, this a superpowers game, play styles ruined everything, if ur player got a strong play style then u are leading, if u have players u loved in previous editions like fifa22 u won't be able to play them if they don't have useful play style, the technical dribbling probably the worst thing i ever experienced in any other fifa game.

However, EA FC 2024 has left me utterly disappointed and questioning the direction in which the franchise is heading. Strap yourselves in for a scathing review because this game is an absolute dumpster fire.

Let's kick things off with the most glaring issue - frame drops. Yes, you heard it right. In 2024, with cutting-edge hardware at my disposal, I still find myself encountering infuriating frame drops during crucial moments, such as corners and goal celebrations. It's almost as if the game is punishing me for successfully earning a set-piece or scoring a brilliant goal. These frame drops not only ruin the immersive experience but also affect gameplay, making it impossible to time your actions correctly. Imagine trying to defend a corner or relish a well-deserved goal only to be thwarted by a sudden lag spike ‚Äì it's beyond frustrating.

But that's not all. The game mechanics feel clunkier than ever before. Player movements are sluggish, ball physics are wonky, and the once-fluid gameplay has been replaced by an awkward and disjointed mess. It's like controlling a group of players who have never seen a soccer ball in their lives. EA FC 2024 takes a step backward in terms of playability, leaving me yearning for the smooth, responsive controls of its predecessors.

The graphics, touted as a selling point, are nothing more than a facade. Sure, the players might look more realistic, but what's the point when the overall presentation is marred by graphical glitches and awkward animations? I've witnessed players contorting into unnatural positions, goalkeepers performing acrobatics that defy the laws of physics, and ball trajectories that defy logic. It's as if the developers prioritized realism in appearance over actual gameplay quality.

In conclusion, EA FC 2024 is a disappointment of epic proportions. It's a regression from previous installments, plagued by frame drops, clunky gameplay, and an overwhelming emphasis on microtransactions. If you're a true fan of the FIFA series, do yourself a favor and stick to the earlier, more enjoyable editions. EA, it's time to step up your game or risk alienating the very community that has supported you for so long.",1703796226,1703796226,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- gameplay is good i guess, if you tweak it enough so that it suits you
- menuing and everything associated and connected to it, is just an abomination created by mankind
- the most unrealistic stuff ever seen in football, just workes sometimes

and is there really more to say? - no! cuz there is not much more to this game
because again, its ""FOOTBALL"", one of the most satisfying sports in the universe!
and EA build a gaming-monopoly out of a sport! think about that!

With servers located in Narnia and EA at it's finest every day is a surpise. 
You might be able to play a decent game without de-sync and players flying around once a week.That is if you are not playing on a PC cause well... EA released the mobile version for PC apparently.. 0 optimization. Your high end PC is gonna feel like a 10 years old budget build with this game. 

It does have a nostalgia feeling tho.. If you ever played fifa 94 you gonna love it .. Its pretty much the same with different names. Bugs,garbage graphics and physics and something that looks like football but totally isn't all in one for only 70$!!!

The devs are also working extremely hard to improve the game . They are adding new cosmetics and new 50$ packs almost daily! Now that's dedication! 
Many people would call this sellout but that's just nonsense. 
It doesnt matter if the game is barely playable as long as the card backs are looking sexy and the shop is ready to empty your wallet. 

Overall a great card collecting game for gambling addicts.

Totally wouldnt recommend unless you hate someone. 2/10

Releasing the same game every year with updates that actually turn the game of soccer into an unplayable sport with different fundamentals than real soccer, is an insult to lovers of the sport. Hopefully, one day this company will realize that the short term fixes are not going to suffice and the company will have its run of making money, then die out. I hope it does. Releasing the same game every year is ROBBERY. I hope you poor excuses for game developers realize that your company handed off a diamond, and you're turning it to shit. Thank you for wasting your creativity, so other people with better skill sets can steal your job. Sincerely, this game blows harder than the devs alcoholic father taking a sobriety test.

Not to mention, somehow this shitty company was nominated for, ""best sports"" game of the year. What a joke. If that doesn't tell you the company only cares about becoming another Call of Duty type of machine company, you're lost in the sauce. Wake up, you are victim to someones greed. My recommendation? Be a human being and don't support this game. Force their hand. Stop supporting = stop buying their lies (games) til the message is sent. We are not happy with your product, you have a chance to fix that problem, be better.

This past week has reminded me the repeativeness that this game does every year. 

For anyone that used to like the old fifa UT where it wasn't so OP with packs, BS players and pay-to-win. 
Do not even think about purchasing this. 

I went off fifa for 4/5years as the dda and everything mentioned above was just absolute garbage, you genuinely thought you were only versing people that paid for packs as the game would know who pays money vs me who only paid for the game.

A mate said it wasn't as bad and showed me the new SBC's etc. I was hooked!!! actually felt like I had a chance... well it's season 3, I got to div 3 in Season1, couldn't get out div 5 last season and now I am stuck on div 7...

Ultimate Team is now even more P2W than it has been any other year. From the very start the big big packs that we wouldn't see till Toty are out in week 1. The meta from Fifa23 carried over making the first few weeks basically unplayable for those that just chill and play for fun. After that it changed to 71 depth, 424/442/4231/442(2)/4222, with pressure after possession lost. This still has not been changed even after 5 or so weeks. The new Evolutions are a great concept but have been poorly executed. Within the first batch of Evos they made 78 Ansu Fati into an 84/85 that was a very cheap replacement for Mbappe with better links. Since then the evolutions have been not so game breaking until this last one where you can make Llorente even better. The DDA still rules supreme and sways matches away from the actually good to cater towards those that are worse. In previous years it was noticeable but not all that drastic to where a game would be decided on who had DDA in their favor. Not in EAFC24 though. In 24 the DDA decides matches unless you can somehow just be that much better. The best players will feel so much worse when DDA kicks in. Mbappe will feel like 78 pace, VVD will feel like a bronze, Courtious would be better replaced with the 1 arm woman. DDA is that bad in UT.

Update from 12/5/23:
Evo's have slowed down on being meta and broken and now are just replacements for recently released cards. The meta has not changed since the first week. Well that isnt true, it has gotten a lot worse in terms of play meta or loose the game. 4231-442-424-4321-4213-433(4) are now the most used with the center of the pitch being either overly congested to the point the attacking side can not play through it. At the same time the wingers, forward, and fullbacks will press anyone on the line making it so the best you can do is pass around the back, long balls over the top, or switching the full field. 4231 is the most commonly used formation since you not only have 8/10 players in the middle but also the LCAM and RCAM will occasionally push out to pressure on the line, the 2 CDM basically act as 2 CB and are most commonly the only players most will use to defend besides an occasional fullback. DDA is worse than ever, even worse than when I first wrote this review. You can be winning 4-0 in the 75th minute and tie 4-4 or lose 4-5 or 4-6 because DDA kicked in. Finesse shot and + are broken and the thing most based their attackers off of.
Luckily with what I have read from the new patch notes for the Holiday Update, the congesting the middle will now not be a viable meta, and finesse shot and + will have its accuracy reduced.

This is very close to the last update I did on my review but with a new patch and tons more new promos it felt like a good time to post an update.
After the Holiday Patch EA said that they fixed the congested midfield, pressure on the touch line, Finesse Shot and Shot+, and 3 back LM/RM. Congested midfield is true, it isn't as bad as it was but Pros have figured out tactics to counter the patch and share it with the public. This luckily is still very open in the middle. Pressure on the touch line isn't as heavy unless against a 5 back or 424. Finesse shot and + do not seem like that took any hit by the recent patch, they are still broken and now players are seeing this and deciding to hit it from 30+ yards out. Power headers were hit too hard, now the accuracy is terrible to the point itd be better to just play a corner short. 3 backs are now almost completely useless and back to the way they used to be. So all in all EA did a good patch that has mostly made the game tolerable again and semi-playable. DDA still runs all games and decides who wins and looses before kick off. If EA were to actually read reviews and see this all I'd ask is to fix DDA in UT and don't make it a thing. It is holding good players hostage in lower divisions because it is making their players hard to play with and letting the opposition win. When in reality it shouldn't be there and players should be able to climb back up tho their real ranks so that the lower ranks are for the actually bad players.",1698897225,1703643642,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, let's talk about the fact that the game cannot even start properly. It's astonishing how a game released by a major publisher like EA can have such fundamental issues. Time and time again, I've tried to launch the game, only to be met with endless loading screens, crashes, and game-breaking bugs. It's like EA didn't bother with any quality control whatsoever. It's infuriating to spend your hard-earned money on a product that can't even perform its most basic function ‚Äì starting the game!

But it doesn't end there. EA, true to their reputation, has also managed to mess up the microtransactions in the game. You'd think they would have perfected this aspect by now, but no. The inability to purchase Points, the in-game currency necessary for any sort of progress, is laughably frustrating. I've tried multiple times to give them even more of my money in exchange for Points, but the game just won't let me. It's as if they don't want my money or care about their paying customers.

In summary, EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ 24 is a total disaster of a game. The fact that it can't even start reliably and the broken microtransactions are just the tip of the iceberg. This game is a prime example of everything that's wrong with the gaming industry ‚Äì releasing unfinished, broken products and then trying to squeeze every last dollar out of players. Save your money and your sanity and stay far away from this mess of a game. EA should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this travesty.",1703562645,1703562645,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FUT issues
1) no longer F2P. forced to pay if you want a decent team
2) levelling up is impossible unless you pay
3) too many OP teams in div 10/9 that make new starters at a huge disadvantage]

Career mode issues
1) same as fifa 22
2) unrealistic career pathways. why would KDB go to united for 80mil?

First of all my review is for the single player of the game as this is all i play but some points may pass over to multiplayer. 

Its been months since it released yet there are so many bugs in it you might as well consider this game early access. I had players play all games in the season and they submit a transfer request for not playing enough. I had a player ask me to take him off for the next game because he was tired (He was) and when i did just that he got angry and wanted to be transferred. The board objectives make no sense sometimes like they want me to raise the average age of the team but also sign young players. Also there are numerous graphical glitches and they show in every game like clipping and pixelated parts of the textures while the rest of them are fine. 

Most of the time i don't feel like i am controlling the players. I can literally feel fighting with the player i am controlling to force him to do what i need. They added thousands of new animations but i feel like now i am getting stuck in an animation for every movement i do causing lots of issues. 
Defending is horrid. All matches i play live end with outlandish scores like 5-6 or 8-6. Every time i concede a goal it feels like i am conceding the same 3 or 4 goals. I also score a lot of goals but they are the same over and over. The game no longer allows variation just grab a fast winger and score. Hat tricks all over the place and no matter what defender i use its the same. The rival team players become like gods at times making it impossible to defend them like powering through tackles and not being fazed and getting insane speed bonuses with the ball and off the ball. I had cases where a player would just get tackled multiple times without loosing the ball at all. I can hear my tackle making contact but he just clips through. Even when i score it feels like i am cheesing the game. Scoring goals is fun but when you score so much they loose their value.",1703535360,1703535360,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
