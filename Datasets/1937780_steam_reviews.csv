I mean yeah, to be honest it has some faults,but if you're looking for total war enjoyment it delivers.
I think people who write bad reviews are just expecting something that this game is not. It is not Empire 2, or Medieval War 3, or any of those. It is a game about near prehistoric times and the consequential decisions made by the rulers of the known world (at that time). The game is fun if you PLAY THE GAME, pardon the extreme emphasis. To complain about this game is to be like the idiots who complain about helldivers 2 because they don't want to play as part of a four man team, they want to be John Freedom Rambo, and then the other three people are stuck suffering at his expense.

Yeah it has a lot of flaws.CA is not a studio that thrives on simple design. They make really complex systems and then shake their heads when the ignorant masses cannot figure them out.If you just accept the setting, which is 1205 BC, which has literally almost zero paper record, just stuff that was inscribed in stone.The time period is pretty entertaining, and it covers a tactical period I personally have not explored, when chariots ruled the battlefield, and cavalry was not the dominator we know today. If you do not understand the concept of chariots, you will find them lacking.

You just have to accept that in 1205 BC, stirrups etc were not necessarily figured out yet, and you have light armored melee guys who act as your 'cavalry'. If you can wrap your head around that play style, it's fun. I enjoy using real tactics within the game system, the dev team did an incredible job at making a tactical battle simulator. It is their Bread and Butter, after all. Few games, if any, do a battlefield more justice than the Total War franchise in the most recent iteration. If you are looking for crisp, clean controls, this game has them.

I find it rewarding and entertaining to plan an assault and watch it unfold. They have made significant strides in tactical command issuing in the newest iteration. IF you don't fight the game, it actually works really well.

For example attacking a superior force is fun, and each experience is almost unique. Yet the trouble is, and this is an issue with all Total War Games, is how fast you lose interest in seeing these experiences play out in front of you.

The more you hit automate battle, the more likely you are to stop playing, because I would rather play a paradox game than total war if I am looking for grand strategy. I came here for the meat: Tactical Battles at essentially battalion level engagements.

so, I recommend the game IF you enjoy everything I wrote about, and can find it within yourself to commit to the game and accept the game rules. Which are hazy, defined by a labyrinthine encyclopedia, and arduous to read and understand. While they could use help with information presentation in the user interface department, it still works and gets the point across. It just takes a few hours to figure it out. More than Steam allows you to return for your money, at least.

Hope this helps!

I think its a little unfair though I get the whole Troy re-skin, and it being a Troy DLC, the price point, etc...valid complaints. CA did lower the price and gave A $35 credit to all who bought it at full price. This came with an official apology and a free DLC which is more than nice. 

The campaign is pretty packed with mechanics and features though not all of it is going to jive with everyone. The graphics are great, the scenery gorgeous and authentic, music is good, sound effects are great, The battles are slower paced which I like, and chariots serve as cavalry and can be clutch if used correctly. I get the compliant that some models look cartoon-ish...but I dont agree fully. The colours tend to pop which can give that Impression, the models are great otherwise with a high level of detail. 

The fire effects are quite good, along with the sand storms, foot print details, traversing through wheat, thunder storms, etc, though blood is sorely missing as always. The new outpost system is interesting with new strategies and tactics possible,  A lot of effort was put into this game to make it look great and authentic to the time, a period that is largely lost on people. I could be biased as I am a bronze age fan. Incorporating the Sea People is good, and upcoming DLC will further expand the faction and unit roster.

I love the period itself for a start, but divorcing that from the equation it is still a good Total War. It took what worked in Troy, namely the resource system, as well as the artistic direction and flavor of the three overarching release factions to great results. 

The complaints on unit variety are a little lost on me though, perhaps we were spoiled in visual distinction by Warhammer but there are a TON of units split between faction tied units and native/regionals that every faction can use after acquiring territory in the given area. However I will agree I do not like them using the same coloring for some factions as it can be a bit confusing, the unit designs differ but from the areal perspective the color similarities do matter. Even just inverting the colors would have helped. Is it a nitpick? Yes, but in one of the most quality-of-life filled Total Wars it stands out. 

Also complaints over factions such as Babylon not being present need to be addressed. Babylon in this period was in decline to the point they couldn`t even reach Egypt for proper trade relations, this breakdown of regional trade was a factor in the Collapse from our* understanding. It would be cool to have them but the challenge of repairing them to a state of comparison to our other factions would be harder than dealing with the WRE in Attila. Same goes for Mycenae although they already were pretty well done for by the time the ""waves"" of Sea People from their area begin migrating. There I could have seen CA giving us a faction of early Ionians or something but that might have stretched the timeline of history as well as development passed where they had put the release date. 

Map size is also perfectly fine, feels about as large as Three Kingdoms to me. I would have liked to see Mesopotamia and at minimum the rest of Anatolia, but I understand at least the border with the Eastern edge. 

 This entry is great in my opinion, better than Troy and I`m even having more fun here than in Warhammer 3 for reasons I can`t quite identify. If I do I may update this review. In the end, this entry has massive potential, and is already good. My only glaring problem is the pricing being 60 USD, if it was 40 there`d be no problem but as it stands I feel its worth the money just I can`t argue against it being a bit pricey.

EDIT: They dropped the price! It is absolutely worth the price of admission at its current price especially if the FLC they say they have planned comes through.

The ratings below are based on my personal assessment in comparison to previous historical Total War titles:

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2] [b]5/10[/b]
[h2]Visual:[/h2] [b]8/10[/b]
[h2]Sound:[/h2] [b]9/10[/b]

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
		I consider Pharaoh‚Äôs gameplay to be very subpar to even the less attractive Saga works by Creative Assembly. Troy was relatively entertaining, because although the gameplay was lackluster and very ‚Äòone-trick-pony‚Äô-esque, it was at least an attempt to implement some new mechanics (e.g., the economy system). Pharaoh is, in all aspects of gameplay, Troy 2.0. 
The battles are run almost entirely on health bars, ranged units are entirely broken, and mounted units are disappointing to say the least. After Creative Assembly poured so many resources into making cavalry extremely relevant via Total War: Attila, they have now created 2 historical titles in a row with limited to nigh extinct levels of cavalry units. I wish I could say this is due to Creative Assembly placing more emphasis on infantry-heavy combat, like improving animations, or maybe even adding something new to the combat system, but instead it falls to 2 blobs of infantry going at it in the middle of the desert.
[h1]Visual:[/h1]
	Visually Pharaoh is arguably the most beautiful game thus far from the Total War franchise. Boasting vibrant colors, unit variation, and pretty effects, Creative Assembly clearly put emphasis on the picturesque.
[h1]Sound:[/h1]
	Easily one of the best audio jobs Creative Assembly has ever done. The battles sound highly realistic, and voices/effects are fantastic.

[h1]Overall:[/h1]
I hope Creative Assembly takes this stumble as a lesson to return to its roots (like much of the fandom has been asking for in a historic title) and create Medieval 3 or somewhere in a time that is truly engaging and allows the team to create something‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶ Total War.

[h1]Update - Post-Sea Peoples and General Pop. Reimbursement:[/h1]
CA/SEGA made a few very rare (and very kind) goodwill gestures for its fans here. However, the moves are too little to late. The update was able to sustain me for another 2.5 hours before I felt the game slowing down again and becoming very Troy-repetitive. I really hope we see a better historical installment in the next year or so.

They've made it fit well into the structure of a total war game. (and no, minoans would not be a good idea to add imo). 
The campaign customization is very very nice to have in a game based on the premise of unstoppable ""sea peoples"" onslaught (who only Ramesses really survives irl btw). There are still things I think need improvement, and areas the game can grow into. 

- o - More factions, please 
to the west, Anatolian factions after the fall of Arzawa, some still loyal to Hattusa, some not as Kurunta tries to ""tame"" the west, then Ahhiyawa and their destruction, but also interactions with Western Anatolia and Hattusa (we have dedicated Mycenaean swords in Hattusa for goodness's sake), to the east Assyria, vassal ·∏™anigalbat, Kassite Babylon. I wish Ugarit/Alashiyah were playable too.
- o - More map, maybe. 
I guess this could be technically challenging, but opening up assyria/babylon for the Assyirans, Kassites, Elamites would be amazing. Western Anatolia and some Ahhiyawa would be amazing too, I would love to reimagine what it was like in Pylos described in these tablets: [url= https://stacitiesroper.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/seapeoples-pylostablets.pdf] Pylos Tablets[/url]

CA was/is going buck wild with their prices, and hopefully the community‚Äôs response was/is enough to shake the dollar (or pound) signs out of their eyes. 

However, saying that to say this, people need to chill on the hate they give this game. It isn‚Äôt the best TW game, but it is far from the worst. It is fair to criticize something, or even not like said something, but give the game a fair shake before you put your opinion out for everyone to see. I haven‚Äôt put much time into this game (work, family, health, taxes, etc.), but, from what time i‚Äôve spent with it, I can tell that most, if not all, complaints about the game were unfounded or presented as game breaking when they were not. Is it perfect? Nope. Should everyone play it? (yes) Nope. Let‚Äôs enter my ADHD and weed fueled thoughts on this game.

Imma get my biases out of the way first. My background is in Anthropology, specifically classical Mediterranean archaeology and literature. When they announced this title I felt like the only one who was hyped for it. The time period is and will always be fascinating to me. I also understand that this is a video game, and so I have to temper my historical knowledge in the name of practicality and fun. The game does an amazing job of immersing me in these times. The music? Tight af. The battle sounds? Tight af. Font/UI/UX/Whatever the kids call it now? Tight af. Oh, also, I enjoyed Troy. It was a great way to experience mythical conflicts found in the Illiad as close to ‚Äúhistorically accurate‚Äù as it is possible for a mythological war to get. The myth overhaul was kinda pointless, but whatever, it was/is a fun game.

Don‚Äôt let the simple unit roster fool you, the campaign is a blast to play through. Yes, there are plenty of things you can do in repeated playthroughs. The faction gameplay is different enough to make it worthwhile, but did you realize that you can become the new Akhenaten? Incestual sister-wife shenanigans aside, that's tight AF (pun maybe intended). Want to form your own Bronze Age kingdom? You can. The list of classical gods that you can dedicate your generals to is VERY varied. This allows for hyper specialization of your forces, if that is something you like to do.

As for the complaints about cheating AI or any amount of unfairness towards the player, please check out your options and read some of the details. You can toggle almost ANYTHING on or off. I don‚Äôt have youtuber time or dedication to play these games on SUPER DUPER HARD MODE, so I enjoy being able to play at my speed with my set of rules. Too many AI armies? You can easily limit the amount of units AI armies can field. Having trouble balancing your economy? Lower your own costs AND army upkeep. Heck, raise your recruitment cap so you can field a ‚Äúfuck-off large‚Äù military while you‚Äôre at it. Is giving the AI a bunch of buffs a cheap way of increasing the difficulty? Absolutely. Now, however, we can play the same game and give ourselves the same buffs. It never fails to surprise me when people play on max difficulty and complain about the difficulty. Stop playing on difficulties that are too hard for you. It‚Äôs ok, no one will see you play on a lower challenge setting. Or accept that failure is a part of the learning process, and run your head into a brick wall like every game NEEDS to have Fromsoft level of difficulty. Your choice, really. 

I could rant for pages and pages. I guess my time in college wasn‚Äôt too much of a waste of time. Let me TL;DR:

Game is really fun, if you‚Äôve paid your bills and you're confident you‚Äôll have a meal for every day of the month, give it a try. If you really hate it after some time you can refund it. No harm, no foul.

The game very similar to Troy, especially the graphic.

In term of gameplay,
The deity + the civilization pillar system not bad, conquering the culture centre to boost up the deity blessing or getting extra civilization points. However, in the late game, when max out all the civilization points or deity points, conquering culture centre without having extra benefits or special unit, it seems point-less.

The political system is something new, race to get more legitimate points to be Pharaoh. But after become Pharaoh and eventually become the strongest faction the AI seems getting less aggressive, and not even try to expand their own territory. 

The generals are boring, they all have same face, doesnt have much characteristic, like Three Kingdom do. After annex Egyptian factions, not being able to  make Tausret or Seti be my general or putting them into the court is a waste, they simply just disappear.

The trading system just like Troy, just barter system, stone exchange for food, food exchange for bronze, etc. and it is boring, frankly, it is not new. 

Maybe in near future, would it be an update where I can trade for item, for some rare weapon? 
An update which make some region that only produce some specific rare item, say Hittite Chariot or Egyptian Bow.
Amount of woods affect the ammunition amount of the archer. Making all Hittite or Cannanites become hostile towards Egyptians.
 
Overall, it feels just like an old total game series, just
without cavalry (replaced by Chariot, I guessed)
without naval battle (actually is quite a shame, Ancient Egyptian fought off Sea People thru sea and land), 
without siege weapon (Understand that siege weapon never appear in Ancient Egypt)
without spy (I know James Bond is British)

Background to preface the review:

My first entry in the Total War series was Attila back in 2015. I played a decent amount of Rome 2, Shogun 2, and Napoleon, but I was not as fond of them as with Attila or the good old Rome 1 and Medieval 2 (these two I played right after Attila). Three Kingdoms I never tried, and Troy despite getting it for free, just didn't click for me even if I was into the setting.

Pharaoh is the first Total War game one since Attila which has grabbed me the same way it did back in 2015.

-----

To the actual review:

If you are familiar with Rome 2 or Attila, the game won't on a surface level surprise you. Up front I'd say, if you can't stand either of those games you might avoid this one. This is built upon the bones of those entries (and Troy, but I didn't play that one enough to really form an opinion). The AI will cheat in the campaign by spawning a ton of (high tier) units even when they have only one region, rebels can feel very overpowered and cheap etc. The old quirks of Rome 2 and Attila.

----

Battles:

The battles are solid to me. Sure there are no cavalry, artillery or gunpowder units to bring more variety than some other entries, but I found the variety of battles to be good enough. You have the classic swordsmen, heavier melee chargers, anti-shield melee units, different ranged units with slingers (lower damage than bows, but longer range) and bowmen, deadly chariots (both ranged and melee variety), and pikemen to counter them.

You have some stances and cooldown abilities, but not many, but for me it was alright. I prefer the older Total Wars where army composition and positioning is the key. 

There is a modified weather system to give more flair to the battles with sandstorms and thunderstorms, but I usually tended to just choose the dry or clear day option which doesn't modify any battle variables.

----

Campaign:

This is where I found the most enjoyment. As a baseline it is similar to Rome 2/Attila, but you have 4 resources (food, stone, bronze, gold) instead of just gold to handle. This is apparently similar to Troy though. The city management is also similar to Rome 2/Attila, but streamlined for the better in my opinion. There is no sanitation or clearing building spots to manage for example, or whether production is from commerce or agriculture etc., you just focus on producing food, wood etc.

Aside from resources there are quite a few mechanics of note. You have the court where you can apply to different position to give you useful bonuses (for example the Viceroy of Kush will have significant boost to gold income), and whether or not you have a position, you can still try plotting to grab a court position from someone else, or just gain smaller bonuses via making requests such as granting money via embezzlement from the Treasurer. This overall feels a bit similar to the family tree of Attila, but more involved. For replayablity, you can even choose a court that is not native to you faction, which is a nice touch.

Aside from the court you have access to different gods that grant further advantages and you can devote specific generals to different gods (also you can choose foreign gods, and even create a god but mixing others with a specific Egyptian option). There are also several special nation paths you can choose (between 2-4 from what I gathered) that your nation to go towards, but you can only choose one to stick with the rest of the game. These paths can focus towards warfare, nation building, religion (such as the custom god creation with Egypt mentioned before) etc. All of these improve replayability and give meaningful choices to your campaign.

Overall the campaign is quite dynamic like Attila. The invasion of the Sea Peoples is similar to Attila's hordes in that game, and if you play as a civilized faction like Egypt, you have to ensure the cultural centers of the world are not being razed. The more destruction the Sea People (or other factions) do, the more stronger buffs they get, the less blessings you will receive, and the more disasters will happen. This gives the campaign a ticking clock element which keeps things interesting. Like some have said, the waves of Sea People attacks can feel like tower defence sometimes, but I found having to deal with an escalating threat in the late game interesting. You can always go to the campaign settings and tone it down if it feels tedious.

A smaller thing to note is the return of traits from Rome and Medieval 2. They allow generals to earn different buffs based on actions in the campaign.

----

Immersion:

I am not especially versed in bronze age history, but I found the game overall an immersive experience. The campaign mechanics support the immersion to the setting and I found the music, despite having electric guitar/metal sound in the battles, to be great. The only thing missing is the blood and gore to enhance the apocalyptic and brutal world. As a side note, playing Egypt in this game got me hyped to continue reading (Sinuhe) The Egyptian again

----

Conclusion:

If you can't stand the Warscape engine games, there is a chance you won't like it. The bones of the game still feel like modifications of Rome 2, but I prefer the overall package offered here to that game. Solid battles, interesting campaign mechanics, and overall immersion kept me hooked.

The new free DLC that was released is alright. Playing as Iolaos is super easy, but also quite cathartic after having to struggle with the invasion of the Sea Peoples in other campaign. I hope the game gets more content, and I wouldn't mind paying for quality DLC, but as the player numbers are low, I doubt that will happen which is a shame. Still what is being offered here is already fun and polished.

It feels like Warhammer Total War, except in a historical context. It has the feel of a fantasy game instead of the old school historical game plays. For example, the legendary lord perspective of the game. In a historical game, I want to build dynasties over time. This really should have been a DLC for a larger game. Also, there is the lack of depth of the units. For example, there are a lack of unit types - e.g. Hittite archers to Armored Hittite archers, or Hittite swordsmen to Armored Hittite Swordsman to Renowned Hittite Swordsman. I understand that there is clearly not much historical references for units, but this is just absolutely lazy. Not worth the money that it costs. Thrones of Britannia was probably the last good Total War Saga game produced and that should have been a DLC for a larger game too. The rest have turned into the fantasy game play. It's an interesting concept for the historical time period, but I want a true all out historical game. Give me the depth and awe inspiring game play of Rome 1 and 2, Medieval 2, Empire, and Attila. 

However, I do believe the graphics for the game are great. Outside of that, not worth it. Absolutely disappointed with what CA has turned into.

Edit: Still not worth the money or time even after the free DLC. The game play is boring and redundant. Every battle is essentially the same thing and is just lacking that thing that makes historical total war fun. If I want to play a fantasy total war I would just play Warhammer III. I commend CA for refunding at least $20 back to people who bought the game and for sticking behind the title, but this game is a bust. Can we just consider Troy and Pharaoh garbage and get back to real historical total war worthy titles? In my opinion, there is nothing you can do to make this game good.

It seems to incorporate most of the best things about my favorite total war titles, and adds some new features that are really interesting. It gets a lot of hate from other reviewers, but these days what doesn't? Never the less, I think it could have benefited from more play-testing. Many aspects of game play are rough and/or confusing. Look below for the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

The Good: (How it is like, or sometimes better than, other tactical games)
+Chariots! Unsurprisingly, Egypt's are the best. Chariots are the only apparent cavalry unit, and this was the period when they were mainly used. You can really see the strengths and weaknesses of them in battle. They can smash through most light units, but they struggle in pitched melee. Keep them moving!
+Great battle mechanics and unit balance. It is equally possible to win a battle against overwhelming odds or to loose against a seemingly weak opponent. It comes down to the general (i.e. the player) as much as the troops. Elite units are better, obviously, but you can still get a lot done with a relatively basic force.
+Battlefield weather and terrain are fun. Mud, thunderstorms, trees, burning forests, and more all combined into interesting, dynamic maps. There is a lot to exploit, many ways to approach a tactical problem, and unit abilities can really shine if deployed correctly. Love that!
+Beautiful art work and modeling. The aesthetic is very appropriate for the depicted period. It makes me feel like Gilgamesh stomping around Mount Lebanon. You can almost taste the bronze. It tastes of blood!
+Zoomed in campaign map: The areas that once contained 2 - 4 settlements in old games (eg. lower Egypt in Rome II) now contain dozens! This makes the relatively small geographic area feel reasonably big.
+Native unit recruitment: You can build a native recruitment building in each region/province, and recruit a limited roster of the local troops. Some are better than others. As Egypt I fielded many native desert armies that enjoyed bonuses in their favored terrain/regions. Very useful for securing your borders. 
+Settlement outposts: These are useful for the owner (bonuses), exploitable by the invader (sackable/raisable). I especially like the forts and warriors' refuge buildings. They help you secure your settlements without committing expensive units at full upkeep (forts cost half upkeep for the stationed units), and allow you to customize your garrisons. I have a Warriors' Refuge (up to 6 non-faction units) that has repeatedly defeated much larger armies when attacked. Don't mess with old warriors!
+Generals do not age! At least not in any way I can see. I hated in the former games where your favorite commander/faction leader would age 4 years in one turn. I know why they did it that way before; they wanted to encourage the player to get out there and do things, not just sit in their capitol clicking next turn. That said, I like being able to decide that for myself.
+Campaign customization: A handy feature that makes for improved replay-ability and tune-ability.
+++CHARIOTS!!!  (I know, I know, I said that before. I just really like chariots!)

The Bad: (Mostly campaign mechanics. Hopefully they fix these things in future updates.)
-The endless invasion of sea peoples is a bit tedious. I feel like the sea invaders come too early and too frequently, and are a bit predictable, aimless even. The inexorable tide can be broken, but there is little room for empire building, especially if you have coastal settlements to defend. After you beat back four or five waves it gets a bit boring.
-Diplomacy is not very dynamic: By default, most factions of a specific culture have the same diplomatic traits (except the playable lords). They don't seem to start many wars, not with the player or one another. They just sit there, defending their territory. This makes interacting with your neighbors pretty humdrum. Campaign customization can help, the options exist, but you have to suffer through the default state before you know what you want to change. 
-Not enough unit trait details: This is an old gripe I have with the Total War games. Many unit traits are completely hidden, or only show up if you know where to look (eg. ranged unit accuracy is hidden in the ranged damage stat, and accuracy matters!). It makes it difficult to judge what units you want to recruit, and how you want to deploy them. I understand the argument for not pulling back the curtain on some things, the player doesn't always need to know how the sausage is made, but I'm a nuts and bolts kind of guy. I like the details. And I have seen sausage being made. Then I ate the sausage. It was delicious! It is OK to let people have a peek if they are interested.
-The game is short on historical information, especially on the gods. It falls short of the (admittedly high) standard set in previous TW games. You have to dig for what details were included. I am relatively new to this period of history, and would love to know more about it. You can tell the developers did their research. Why not share with the players? I don't need a textbook of info, but would appreciate more than is currently there.

The Ugly: (not necessarily good or bad, more kind of off to the side, you know?)
*Resource management: This is what seems to get the most gripe on the negative reviews. There are five resources: Food, Stone, Wood, Bronze and Gold. Different settlements produce different resources (mostly food), some produce a mix. Unit recruitment and upkeep involves food for all units (duh!) plus bronze for mid tier units (soldiers need gear) plus gold for elite units. This can make fielding large, elite armies punishingly expensive. A player must balance their armies according to their resources. This can be challenging, but sensible budgeting, deployment and diplomacy (trade) can make up for most shortfalls. Its more to deal with, but not THAT much more.
*Rich stone deposits: At first, I thought that the displayed deposit values (default 20,000) were all the stone that was available in the region, and when it ran out that was it. So I demolished my stone producing buildings when the deposit hit zero. I was wrong. The 'Rich deposit' just gives a bonus until it runs out, at which point output drops by half. This was unclear in game, and kind of messed up my first campaign. 
*Choose your path: Player can select their campaign goal shortly after starting the game. There are many options within the two courts (Egyptian or Hittite) but only one middle road; Destruction. This makes the Canaanite factions a bit awkward to play if you want to run a cautious or defensive campaign. Could use more options there.
*Neighbors routinely trespass: This can be alarming, but they are usually just on their way to fight an army of sea peoples. It would be nice if they respected borders though. Makes me miss the 'warn trespasser' button from TW:Warhammer. 
*Many aspects of game play are under-described. Could use more adviser hints, especially for newer features. There are 'tutorial tours' for some of these aspects which can help, but they could be better and more numerous. You can figure it out, but the devs could have made it easier/clearer.
*An overall 'rushed to completion' feel. It almost plays like an early access game. Not as bad as the haters make it seem, but not great either. A little more polish could go a long way.
*Interacting with fort and refuge garrisons requires a general. You cannot dismiss the units without pulling one of your commanders off the front line or recruiting a new one. I also wish I could dismiss, assign or otherwise make changes to the garrison commander, who stays there all the time and counts as one of the stationed units. (up to 6 for warriors refuge, up to 10 for forts). Not a huge deal, but kind of clunky.

Hope this helps! And if it doesn't, well, MOLOCH TAKE YOOUU!!! RRRRAAAAGGHHHH!!!

The initial full price tag for what many regarded (rightly or wrongly) as a smaller 'saga' title did not help Pharaoh's reception, which has been mixed. This sometimes misplaced criticism is unfortunate since Pharaoh is the best TW game since WH2, and the best historical TW since Attila. And now that the price has been cut considerably and the first dlc thrown in for free, it's bargain for a fine TW war game.

The late Bronze Age collapse is a flavourful setting, tho the infantry dominated style of warfare may not be to everyone's taste. The battles are fairly polished, and faction rosters differ from each other about as much as is historically reasonable, if nothing like the wild differences between WH factions. Much of the extensive campaign mechanics revolve around holding together crumbling empires, fighting for the throne, and preparing for the invasion of the Sea Peoples. There's lots to do and the campaigns are still fairly sandboxy, with less of the railroading found in other recent TWs. As the title suggests, Egypt has the most factions, and is the most developed for play, although the Hittites, Canaanites, and Sea Peoples have plenty of content too. The game looks fantastic, much like its predecessor Troy. Art styles drawing on Egyptian art, vibrant colours, battle maps with gorgeous landscapes and interesting layouts. The battle weather system, while sometimes mechanically underwhelming, is certainly atmospheric.

The game does suffer a bit in scope, as the lack of Mesopotamia and Greece creates a somewhat narrow campaign map, and a sometimes placid experience as the Hittites, who historically were beset on all sides at this time. The developers have said they intend to continue supporting the game, and suggested that a campaign map expansion is in the works, but I suspect the game might not have been the most financially successful. However, as of now Pharaoh is a solid title, and if it gets no further content that will be disappointing, but the game is certainly not broken or incomplete.",1706838009,1706838009,True,5,0,0.542738556861877441,0,True,False,False

Rather than rate TW Pharaoh on the basis of its gameplay, many reviewers have blasted it for not being Rome 3, Medieval 3, Empire 2, etc. Folks this game is set in the Bronze Age and warfare was rather different then. OK if you can't do without the familiar infantry/cavalry/missiles combined arms tactics of later combat then maybe a Bronze Age setting is not for you, but that does not make this a bad game. As an ancient historian I've had a blast seeing Bronze Age warfare in a Total War game, so if you enjoy the time period then you should enjoy this game. Yes cavalry was not a feature of warfare during this period, but chariots are a fascinating alternative that are interesting to learn how to use effectively.

Other reviewers have made spurious claims that TW Pharaoh is a clone of the Troy Saga title. That is simply not true. I've spent a fair bit of time playing Troy myself, and I enjoyed the mythological setting (more TW Warhammer-like in troop types etc), but as a depiction of the historical Bronze Age, TW Pharaoh is the superior game. CA clearly learned a lot from making Troy, as you'd expect given it was their first Bronze Age game, and they have improved upon it in Pharaoh. Features such as economic systems, troop types, religion, cultural depictions, etc have all improved from Troy, rather than being cloned from Troy as claimed by some.

General design changes such as being able to set game options like army upkeep or campaign movement rates are also much appreciated as they save me having to use about 10 mods so I can play the game the way I like. (I wish axing the great power penalty was one of those options though, as it makes little historical sense for smaller factions of at least your own culture to hate you more as you grow more powerful, rather than gradually becoming more willing to accept your leadership as a strong faction with the capacity to unite your people. In this case I prefer historical plausibility over game balancing mechanisms, and so would appreciate that option being built-in.)

Another type of review that should be considered irrelevant is the ""let's punish them with a thumbs down because we don't like CA or its policies"" review. Yes having to buy a bunch of drip-fed DLC (or else waiting 2 years before playing the game), especially when DLC prices in previous titles started to rise not in proportion to the content provided, annoys me too, and CA made some customer relations mistakes in relation to those policies. But I'll review the game on the basis of its gameplay thanks, not on the basis of whether or not I like CA's policies. In any case, CA appears to have learned from those mistakes as reflected in its public relations apology, its repricing of TW Pharaoh to reflect the content currently available, and the recent High Tide FLC.

The only thing that worries me about the potential of TW Pharaoh is that CA may listen more to the loud complaints of the thumbs-down crew and decide it's not worth their while producing the DLC that were originally scheduled to be developed for the game. CA has said that they intend to expand the game map and add more cultures, and this is something the game really needs CA to follow through on.

There are many aspects of the historical Bronze Age that are excellently depicted in Pharaoh, and 19th Dynasty Egypt in the era of the Sea People is the perfect Bronze Age setting for TW because of its political, economic and military crises and its quick succession of pharaohs to justify the various factions. I love details such as the benefits of building monuments to yourself everywhere, which is just so Egyptian. Game features such as legacies, the royal court, historical crises, the economic system and worship of deities have all been designed to add historical flavour to the game and all of them are much appreciated for the historical immersion they provide. Also, the physical depiction of the landscape is simply beautiful.

I do have one or two historical gripes, such as restricting factions to worshipping three deities (which is not at all Egyptian ... it would be great if we could at least get the benefit of building or conquering shrine outposts or temples of other gods local to that region, even if we're restricted to worshipping three ""main"" gods as per the current system). I have one gripe about the otherwise fun royal court system in that the significant position of Vizier only gets to scheme a bit more often at court, rather than have an impact on the game directly like other courtiers do (perhaps the Vizier could speed up construction projects at a lower gold cost, or something?). And I must say, the old ""wait a minute while I just land on this island before you attack me so we don't have naval combat"" routine has always disappointed me. I long for the return of naval combat, which in the Bronze Age would have been pretty simple tactically, not unlike the land units fighting at sea style of Thrones of Britannia.

My main historical and gameplay concern about TW Pharaoh at present, however, is the limitations of the game map. Playing as the Egyptian factions works fine (though I'd like to see more of Libya where many of the invaders are from, and regions to the south-east of Egypt, notably Punt and Arabia). But at this time I won't be attempting either Hittite or Canaanite campaigns, because those civilisations in particular should be interacting not only with each other and Egypt, but also with the cultures of western Anatolia, Mycenaean Greece, and Near Eastern peoples such as the Assyrians and Babylonians. To give an example, the late Bronze Age is the period of the 'real' Trojan War, which appears to have been a conflict between the Hittite Empire and Mycenaean Greeks over control of Troy and the surrounding regions of western Anatolia, but at the moment we can't replicate this conflict in TW Pharaoh. (Going back to play TW Troy is not an option if you want to depict the 'historical' Trojan War with the Hittite Empire included.) Not to mention the problems that the Hittites faced at the same time from empires rising in the east like the Assyrians.

These are the reasons why, now High Tide has been released, that I am eagerly awaiting news of the direction of future game updates and a DLC pathway to replace the unspecified three DLC that were originally scheduled. CA has said it will be keeping its ear to the ground for feedback, so let's hope that is a positive thing for TW Pharaoh. It would be very sad for Bronze Age fans if CA decided to abandon expansion plans and move on from TW Pharaoh, because as it is currently the game would remain as a Saga-like depiction of the period with the limited game map and cultures available. My hope is that CA decides there is in fact a viable audience for expanding its journey into the Bronze Age, to turn what is a good entry in the TW series into the classic game that TW Pharaoh has the potential to be, and which fans of the time period are dearly hoping for.",1706707715,1706710006,True,9,0,0.540911972522735596,0,True,False,False

{Update. I'm going to add to this review since the new update and FreeLC were released a few days ago. Once again, CA Sofia are clearly a great studio and clearly have big ideas of what Total War needs to do to become a truly great franchise again. But Pharaoh is still stuck in the same design mire that has plagued the series since Rome 2, I doubt Total War will ever overcome this, CA central just does't seem to get it.

That said, Pharaoh is probably the best total war game since Fall of The Samurai. If you have enjoyed the historical titles offered since 2013, then I see no reason why you would not enjoy this game. It is far more polished than any other historical release in the past 10 years and it has pretty well refined campaign mechanics. The tech tree is still pretty bad even with the update, but hey. 

The FreeLC does add the two most interesting campaigns IMO, and its nice to see CA Sofia once again implement horde game play so well. 

The only other thing I would like to address is some of the criticism levelled at Pharaoh, namely unit diversity and there being no Mesopotamia. The unit diversity argument is to my mind a non-starter, if you enjoyed Shogun, this really shouldn't bother you at all. Mesopotamia, in this period, was not really part of the great contest for the Levant between Hatti and Egypt, far more important are those Civilisations to the North, West and North East of of Hatti. I think it's reasonable to confused about the bizarrely truncated state of Anatolia, it makes no sense.

A more reasonable criticism is, why the Bronze Age collapse at all? It really doesn't offer as much as say, the Bronze Age of early to mid 2nd Millennium BC.

This is far from the worst game of all time, despite what a lot of breathless fans would tell you, in fact its better that Rome 2 and it runs way better than Attila. I think what it has suffered from is A) some bad publicity from the fallout of Warhammer DLC. B) a general fatigue with rather tired Total War mechanics. C) some pretty grim pricing decisions that really couldn't be justified. D) A committed and perhaps widespread campaign to sh*t all over Pharaoh independent of its individual merits and flaws, IMO some in the TW YouTube sphere have become hysterical.

The price is now right, as is the added content and the messages being sent out by CA Sofia }


It's well presented and suggests that CA Sofia have a lot of ideas they want to implement. But that is about it.

Total War has, as a brand, run out of steam. Pharaoh is bland, repetitive, safe... boring. 
It is as wide as a stream and shallow as a puddle. This goes for both game play and setting. 

There is nothing to suspend the player's disbelief, this game lacks meaningful quality of life aspects and very little historical immersion. The setting is truly bizarre and allows for no real player RP or apparently meaningful game play engagement either. The late Bronze age conflict between Hatti and Egypt are presented here with very little reference to the greater world it occurred within, it feels so detached. Literally the only part I enjoyed was clicking ""End Turn"". 

Everything is just a rehash of the same tired old formula, but further dumbed down. 

I have played Total War games since Shogun's original day one release and have never thought about refunding one until now... But I think I'm done with the franchise, and CA now. These games aren't even fun anymore, let alone challenging. What a terrible way for a once great series to go out.",1697182391,1706517485,True,0,0,0.580832242965698242,0,True,False,False

Ive decided the real issue with Pharaoh is that the game does a horrible job explaining the new mechanics, even those that are integral to the win conditions of the game. Once you realize how the game plays, it becomes a fun and unique experience.

While TW Pharaoh is not among them I decided to post a review, because I believe that - considering its current state and price - the game is getting a lot of bad rap for CA's past sins, not because it is objectively bad.

First things first: This recommendation is based on the current state of the game (with the two additional horde factions added) and the current price point (reduced from the original after the original outcry and CA's admittedly bold decision to partially refund).

Second point: If you are someone who got to know TW through the Warhammer games, or someone who prefers those games to historical titles, then this game is probably not for you. However good any historical title might be, there is no way it will be able to encapsulate the variety and lack of constraints available to fantasy worlds. It's just not possible. 

Third point: The game may be very similar to TROY (it was developed by the same studio) but it has a lot of new mechanics and flavors, and it is actually good. I've gone through 3 playthroughs and I have enjoyed all three. You have different buildings, units, mechanics, strengths and weaknesses, different types of paths, and a flexibility that ensures that each faction feels and plays differently. Where the game could be better is the variety of factions. you only get 8 playable factions - now 10 after the update - but there are no Assyrians, no Minoans or Myceneans, etc. Also, the historical context is a bit constraining, in that the level of technological sophistication and diversification of military tactics, equipment, and tools was not all that wide.

If you can get past these issues, the game is quite enjoyable. It may not be the best of the series, but is far, far from the worst. I will be the first to admit that CA tried to do the same with it as it did with other games: sell a barebones version for a fat juicy price, using a lot of pre-existing assets, and then monetize the piecemeal DLCs to death, and for that alone, they deserved the backlash they got (and then some).

I really miss the old type of graphics and settings like Rome 2 etc ... BUT really guys this game is amazing in so many different way and I don't think it deserves all the negativity. I think most people were upset it wasn't Rome 3 or Medical 3 etc therefore they kind of dislike the game already. I do think CA needs to be brought to their knees because lately their games and engines are not up to scratch. Plus not many people find the Bronze age interesting which means players are less lightly to keep playing.

In terms of what you get in the game I'm super happy as it all a big improvement over Troy.

What I like

Better animations like units lifting there shields or crouching before another line hits them ( BRACING ) 
Arrow animations when getting shot are much better
With a few mods like ' Spacing mod ' the formations feel great
Unit Bodyguards change based on what type of weapon and armour you equip the general which is nice and dynamic
If your playing as a Horde Faction its great to see the AI trying to retake the lands you have sacked ( Sometimes other Warlords follow and take all the land you Raise and grow like crazy, quiet dynamic )
In terms of Unit variation its really not so bad and I actually quiet enjoy a lot of the unit. For a game based in the same / similar region I am very happy to see the effort put into trying to make them unique.
Battles are longer by default thank god!
Unit formations are back thankfully!
I enjoy the Sync Combat because its great to watch which to me is the point of watching the battles, but I wish that they had sync kill animations as that is the POINT of the animations ( thankfully you can use this mod called Animation_SyncKills.pack )

What I dislike or think could be improved

I found on a RTX 3070 TI ( laptop ) I cant actually play the game on full graphics like I could with TROY ( Not sure anyone else is having this issue )
The campaign map feels empty and gets a little boring after awhile ( up to your imagination to decide on goals etc )
Its hard to feel the same as you did when playing games like Rome 2 because it had so many Kingdoms with different play styles and units
I wish they would bring more Religion and Population mechanics into the game by default like they did in Rome 1
I feel that they lately have been making every Total War easier and more simple since Rome 1 and I'm not sure why

All in all I think its definitely worth a Buy :)

In other total wars, you are quite at the mercy of the design team's campaign mechanics decisions. For instance, total war warhammer 2 has a 3 unit recruitment limit, warhammer 3 has a 2 unit limit, and you can't really change it. Here, that and more.

After about 10 hours in-game, I have to say that I'm impressed. If it's the Total War Saga-type game that everyone says it is, I'm not yet convinced. It feels like it has the potential to be a full-blown Bronze-Age throwdown. From what I've experienced so far, I would recommend it. It's not remaking the wheel, but it's certainly fun in the way that Rome Total War 2 was fun.

PROs:
-A fun and engaging campaign map, I find myself looking forward to the balancing of different resources.
-Armor system means that the most elite troops aren't god-tiered mega weapons of death anymore
-Resources are used heavily, you (mostly)cant just gold spam your way to victory
-Dung Beetle wrestling mini game is a MUST play
-Chariots are very dependent on timing. I have seen reviews complaining about how weak they are, but they have to be used to work alongside your army. No chariot spam like there was in Rome 2.
-sieges are surprisingly fun, with positioning being far more important than in the past. Can't bum rush everything and just right click to victory.
-diverse enough unit roster to keep matches feeling moderately fresh for the time being
-I've yet to find a campaign ""tipping point"" after which the game becomes a steam roller simulator
-Outposts are a good addition without being OP, gotta keep them safe!
-The setting is compelling and the factionalism works to improve game-play imo. The Egyptian kingdom would have been weakened by the strife of the bronze age collapse and I feel immersed in the teetering socio-political systems presented
-beautiful graphics (on high settings)

CONs
-Historically, many characters are a bit out of place or speculative but we are all limited by the existing body of history, as were the developers.
- individual animations are rougher, don't expect cinematic first person views of your soldiers to feel compelling
- Dung beetle wrestling mini-game could have used more polish. Found myself somewhat frustrated with the controls
- Battle map glitches where soldiers get caught needs some attention
- Game feels like some cultural groups are missing (3 playable cultures is kinda weak) further cultures could make the cost feel more worth it.

Game Itself is ok. It has the same flaws other TW games suffer - like bad battle AI. Sometimes AI acts ok, mostly in field battles. Settlement battles, supposed to be harder in reality are easier (most of the time) because AI will divide forces more and you can kill units one by one. It even happen to me that AI just stood there getting shot by my longbowmen and gave me heroic victory for free.
I like campaign mechanics, especially outposts - You can now leave any troops you want there. Garrisoned troops have -50%  upkeep. Entire economy / strategy layer is completly reworked. Regions have buildings depending on resources avaliable. I like that - It makes conquest more meaningful. 

With limited bronze age roster I found pretty big problem with chariots. Chariots In this game should be useful. And they are ok, if you command all battles manually. Problem starts with auto-resolve. No matter how big Your advantage is, you loose some chariots every battle. For example 60 men units loose 1 man, 10 chariots loose 1 chariot. This problem makes chariots useless in long run. Its better to field another infantry and just not to deal with that problem.

I will say that this Bronze Age niche, especially the Sea Peoples time period was a Total war game I dreamed of years ago since the original Rome I came out. I've been a fan since then, and although the game is beautiful and the unit skins, characters and factions are great, the dynamics of the game make it unplayable. 

I'm glad that Uni gave some refund but I would rather they kept my money and fixed the damn game. This game is the exact same as Troy or Warhammer, which is a super difficult, gauntlet type of onslaught where there is no real strategy but to be able to defeat several armies with no resources available whatsoever. Even for games like the Souls genre, the phrase ""Git Good"" can't even apply cause most of us ""Got Good"" with the total war series years ago, this way of gameplay is nearly impossible and just stresses people out. 

Why have 20 different resources and have each unit take up 80% of it for replenishment or upkeep, and of course the enemies don't have to follow those rules. Why have 20 invasions of your land by factions that still have non-aggression pacts with you? How come I can only afford 1 1/2 armies and be close to debt while I'm invaded by a force stack of 20 by a faction with one ramshackle town that only has a ****ing well, tell me how the hell that's supposed to make sense. What's with the legitimacy in civil war, if you capture the capital or pharaoh shouldn't you win? Why do other culture factions band together like zealots while your own culture hates you and no one would even sign a non-aggression pact without taking a million gold?? Why is everyone always so damn unhappy in your cities!?

This game excels in 3 main areas:Mechanics,Battles, and faction diversity.


In so far as Mechanics they court system and the ancient legacy system do much to add flavor to the game beyond just battles.You can become Great king or Pharaoh through conquering enough land to have enough legitimacy or you can use the court system to steal legitimacy from others and build monuments to build your own legitimacy.



For Battles the game brings life in a time period which does not lend itself well to total war battles.There is no Calvary yet and your closest substitute are chariots which are expensive but can win a battle with the use of  clever strategies. To make battles fun the new stance system allows you to play tactically interesting battles with just infantry.There are stances like retreat and advance which allow you to essential make the battle of cannae.Furthermore not all units have very stance.If you want to use the advance or attack stance you will have to get units that actually have those abilities.


Although on the surface there are only 3 culture groups:Egyptians,Canaanites, and Hittites.Every faction is unique in its own way. Ramses brings medjay warriors and sherdden(Sea peoples in the egyptian army), Seti brings cheap levy troops that he can field huge amounts of, Tausret brings the best chariots and even has someone in her starting army, and Ammenmese has gold,gold, and even more gold.He also has the best archers in the game that can even outrange royal archers that can be recruited out of pharaoh elite unit pool.
The diversity is not limited to just battles, but also reaches to the campaign side of things. Suppiluma has building that give him food, happiness, and stronger garrisons.Irsu has building that drastically increase his production rate at the cost of happiness.


For all the good total war Pharaoh has a few problems of which 3 really stick out.
The first and least significant problem is the way armies move around.If you say want to defend your possesions at the western deserts you will either need to construct a waystation outpost in every single settlement or you will have to follow the path.After a while it feels like Total Logistics simulator.

The 2nd problem is the fact time is not on your side.
If you play as Ramses you will not be able to become pharaoh turn around and conquer most of Canaan.If your lucky you might grab the a few settlements but the big sea people invasion happens at about turn 100.You wont have time to do it all.


Finaly the largest problem is the fact that The game lack greece or mesoptamia.It does not even have western anatolia which is on the campaign map you just can get there and it has nothing in it if you look at it when removing the fog of war. This also affects the variety in your campaigns. if you ply as any of the egyptian factions, once you consolidate your hold over egypt the only thing you can do after that is invade cannan then Hatti.There isnt much variety in very late game as you have only a few more places you can conquer and by turn 150 you are probably the most powerful faction by far. Considering the games terrible sales number I would say dont expect greece or Mesopotamia.


All in all I would say get the game but don't the get the more expensive editions.

The setting of the late bronze age near east is a challenging one to implement. Many specifics or outfits just aren't available in the historical record, so some liberties were taken to flesh out some historical characters. I found it didn't interfere with the overall broad accuracy of the setting (spotted a Dendra panoply on some sea people), this includes the real time battles. 

Late bronze age means no horseback riding cavalry, no battlefield artillery, and oh yeah no freakish fantasy monsters. This means battles are less of a grandiose spectacle like Napoleon, but I still found myself fully immersed in several engaging battles. The slingers/archers ranged units and spear/sword/axe/club infantry offer enough variety to make you think about battleline order, and the chariots offer some fun micromanagment in the backline and flanks. Small settlement maps feel constricted and a bit limited tactically but that's nothing new for Total War. 

Turn based play is streamlined but not dumbed down. Outposts and waystations add a fun dimension to moving troops across the map. The royal court system can help tremendously if used correctly, but if you're doing well the game doesn't punish you for ignoring it (looking at you Thrones of Britannia). This game narrows its scope more than some seem to like, but as a casual gamer I think it pays off.

The campaign is challenging, but there are numerous customization tweaks to bring it to your enjoyment level, achievements intact. I tweaked just a few on my first playthrough as the Hittites, learned a lot, and am ready to try a default Egyptian playthrough.

Why the Hittites first?

- Break ""bronze"" down to its constituents, with copper mined in the game but tin completely dependent on trade route stability (e.g. you can buy with gold as long as Sea Peoples aren't too disruptive)

The short answer is that I recommend the game as a game, as long as you take it in isolation and I pretend other TW games don't exist. Long answer below:

Campaign

The campaign is super fun, but mostly only for playing as Egyptians, Hittites and Caananites seem to be a little half cooked but still very fun to play. It seems Sophia spent a great deal of time thinking about the Campaign mechanics of each nation and each tribe within to create reasonably diverse specialties but retain a great deal of balance - I don't think any single nation is the England of Empire or ME2 or Rome of RTW 1.

Ambitions come in at a reasonable frequency, are very frequently ALL challenging and achievable (with some creativity) and offer great rewards - they are wwell enough balanced that choosing which is appropriate feels like a real, consequential decision and I love that.

Getting a hang of the specific mechanics of the court, resource based game-play and ancient legacies is rewardingly difficult and I am very happy with how they were executed. That said, Hittites only get 2 legacies and neither of them are as fun/cool to role play or head cannon as Egyptian ones but you really can't go wrong with any of them...again, the balance is great. 

Campaign AI has been reworked and redone and is very challenging at first but exploits still exist (although I won't tell you what they are, discovering them is half the fun). 

Overall, I think the campaigns were very well made and very fun to play. But they aren't perfect. Character based nations with immortal, single entity, leaders and very small time scales (less than a single human lifespan - I believe a whole campaign can be completed in less than 50 years) lead to a situation where the game does not feel like a sandbox. There is not a great deal of ability to create narratives and stories and head cannon a ton of interesting things to keep you playing over and over. You are given a story, told to more or less follow it, and that story is inappropriately presented and it feels disconnected from the game...This must improve in the future.

Battles:

These are boring, unfortunately. I think they can be fun and that the AI has been we executed. That said, my last 200 turn campaign only saw me personally fight 5 battles and the rest (nearly 300) were auto-resolved...I didn't realize as I was playing but post-game statistics don't lie and that says something. 

The battles are beautiful but something about the game prevents me from fighting them. Personally, I think it is that auto-resolve tells me that I will win so there doesn't feel like any need exists for me to go through the effort of a 20 minute battle. Personally, I think we should be punished more for auto-resolving. Less resources, more enemies escape, more friendly casualties, and a chance to lose a favorable battle would all make me more inclined to ""not take the risk"" of simply auto-resolving my way through a campaign. 

Also, I do think there is something to be said about returning to a former state of TW graphics. Dark, grungy, dirty graphics that really showcase the dismal state of the world feel more exciting. Again, the game is absolutely beautiful...but there is something to be said about dark battle fields of mud soaked soldiers not benefiting from an atmosphere of bright and vibrant colors everywhere. 

Overall:

I recommend the game at the lowered price point. I think, if you give it a chance, you will have a lot of fun, especially with the campaigns, and I think Sophia did an exceptional job on this project. That said, CA has certainly lost it's way and needs to provide games based on the eras we've been begging for for DECADES.",1704996743,1704996743,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Most of the non-egyptian factions are so dramatically different from one another that you can't rely on similar tactics even with the same set of units, and planning out your long term goals feels like it is rewarded quite nicely. 
I liked the challenge very much for the non-egyptian factions. 
Not that the Egyptian ones were poor in any way, just that you could often use similar techniques in the economic sense regardless of faction to control the pace of the campaign.
In terms of enjoyment, I found that aiming for Major victory conditions was the sweet spot - ultimate almost always happened too far after everything had been done - somewhere around turn 241 or 242, and was just a game of patience, but the major conditions usually triggered right after a big battle win or huge political gamesmanship, and far earlier.",1704503944,1704503944,True,3,0,0.536116659641265869,0,True,False,False

Its very different and clearly sort of similar to other titles (Troy, 3 Kingdoms). I have roughly over 1100 hrs into Warhammer 3 and wanted to change up the fast pace, spell slinging single entities and try something new.  

For starters, its much slower on the campaign map. You need to plan out your diplomacy and manage resources appropriately or you'll crash your kingdom. The diplomacy is fun and i like the scheming and plotting for legacy and favors. They clearly took lessons learned from 3K and WH3 on the diplomacy side of things and streamlined it from their previous titles. Auto deals, ease of bartering and being able to filter based on things like what the target factions wants, needs or as an abundance of are very cool features. 

The battles are refreshing compared to WH3, because the little things seem to make more of an impact. The AI also makes smarter choices as well. Now, you can blitz through some settlements, but it will be costly and could leave you overextended. Sieges and settlement fights are appropriately in the defenders favor and if you make a mistake, it can cost you a unit (or several) and end up getting handed a defeat. Replenishment, morale, flanking, proper angle of missile units, hills and visibility are all incredibly important and just 1 of those factors can turn the tide of what looked like steep odds before (for them and you). 

My only real grip with this game is that its not Medieval 3 (womp).

All in all, its worth buying on sale or if you want a sort of different experience and you enjoy the Egyptian time period, 40$ USD isn't that bad.

I didn't buy it on release, partially because i have been playing other titles and partially because it immediately had terrible reviews, with the price drop and more free time over Christmas i thought ""why not?""

Its a beautiful game, visually, but the characters are so weak, theirs surprisingly very little historical input your just kind of dumped into the world with no idea what is really going on, Pharaoah choked on a grape and spouted some cryptic stuff - and off you go!
I have played a few hours with Ramesses and restarted the campaign twice, in your first game you are bombarded with ""things"" within the first 10 or so turns, choices you need to make that are permanent for the entire game with little to no explanation of what your choosing, in fact most of each turn will be spent meaningless admin on poorly designed concepts that's really just unneeded filler.
by my 8th turn on my first playthrough the Hittite civil war broke out and 2 x 20 stack armies came charging through my kingdom from the north wiping out 2 of my cities, my entire army at this point consisted of maybe 12 units and was far south anyway so the garrisons, consisting of maybe 4 units had absolutely no chance, on top of this all the un-walled city maps seem to be made the same, a hole in the ground with the attacker having the high ground advantage at all times, now i'm no Egyptian bronze age expert but i imagine this is historically accurate to shield from sandstorms, from a defensive perspective however its an absolute F*** up, regardless theirs nothing my poor peasant garrison could do 8 turns in while outnumbered roughly 5-1 with or without the attacker advantage too.

So i thought i would restart, all going great, i hash out some trade agreements for things i need and max out what troops i can raise, leaving 11 units on my northern border in a fort i build there, 15 units in my main army and 8 units in a second army, all going fine until roughly turn 15 when the Pharoah, who is also my father i believe, and who i am allied to, inexplicably declares war on me with no explanation at all other than ""I'm no coward!"" of course this leads the entire family to also declare war on me.

""F*** it"" i think, i take the opportunity to seize 2 cities from him, the first is practically undefended and falls easily, afterall its a hole in the ground remember and i am the attacker so i have the high ground and its over Annakin!
the second city however is a massive fortified metropolis but i have the numbers and i have ranged superiority by far so ill take it and consolidate my power, after all i need the food for more troops!
Unfortunately as soon as the battle starts i remember why i have hated siege battles in TW games since Empire, no matter what you do the AI will respond to your movements perfectly, so all your troops will have to fight their way up a wall, fight at a disadvantage on the wall and then the final phase of a siege battle is what i call ""the blob"" its a huge mass of melee that seems to blob together, your troops can't move to outflank anyone because their are a couple of soldiers who have become ""tangled"" up on the ladder, thus the entire unit is now practically immobile, giving you no choice but to just fight it out in mass melee with huge losses in the hope that your guys prevail, which they did but good god those losses were mad.
and that's the thing, sieges just don't work and haven't for some time, i think Warhammer was the only one that semi fixed it mainly because its fantasy and half your army can just fly over the walls anyway to outflank, units on the walls seem to have almost complete immunity to archers, my guys are literally plastering them in arrows and they are taking zero casualties, they may as well have a MK VI planetary shield around them, but as soon as they come down off the wall my guys can shoot straight up and over the wall and hit them with such precision its amazing.

so in short its like Rome 2 for tangled useless and immobile units, like Attilla for tickly archers with next to no ammunition and like Brittania for the poor feeling of depth, such a shame for a fascinating period of history",1704119492,1704119492,False,8,0,0.536830127239227295,0,True,False,False

When the game released to poor reviews and comparisons to Total War: Troy (which I did not especially enjoy, despite my excitement for a Bronze Age Total War at that time as well) I chose not to buy it. Recently, however, with the price drop having just hit the game, I chose to pick it up and am quite glad that I did. If you are also on the fence about the game, please permit me to present my (subjective, of course) reasoning and see if that helps you decide.

TL;DR: If you are actually interested in the Late Bronze Age, particularly the approach to the Bronze Age Collapse, TW: Pharaoh is loaded with atmosphere, cultural and religious tidbits, and aesthetic representations of a period that is otherwise fairly neglected in gaming. If it is not an area of interest for you, then there is probably a different Total War game for you that does not have as much jargon to learn.

Pros:

I love studying the Late Bronze Age, and this game offers an aesthetic, cultural, and religious snapshot that (while gameified, of course, as one would expect from a Total War game) feels well-researched and authentic enough to deeply immerse me. From the inclusion of various cults appropriate to the era, to court intrigue and even a period-authentic seasonal calendar (tracking the levels of the river Nile - though I do doubt whether it's appropriate to measure the Hittite faction by that same calendar) you are faced with reminders that this is *not* the post-iron age world we are used to gaming in, and I love it.

The smaller scope of the game (focusing on the Eastern Mediterranean and river Nile) is also a great advantage in my opinion. I am always more interested in more historically-focused games with a tighter scope rather than sprawling map-painting exercises - in Total War terms, for instance, I would rate Shogun II, Napoleon, Rome I: Alexander, and Britannia above, say, Empire Total War, Medieval II, or Rome II. By keeping things tightly focused on a particular historical period and the realities of a faction's aspirations and capabilities within their local sphere of influence, I find myself more immersed in the goings-on during the game. In this case, this small scope allows the game to ""zoom in"" and provide a great deal of character to the three factions that are currently present, offering many interesting choices from the reconstitution of the cult of Aten to the unification of Hatti under a Canaanite invader.

The introduction of shifting weather during a battle (the characteristics of which depend on the geography of the area being contested) is very interesting, and helps bring the battles into the ""wargame-esque"" context of condensing a day-long ancient battle into a 20 minute game in an elegant manner.

Having multiple resources to manage is complex but, in my opinion, adds a great deal of depth when deciding what regions to annex or what allies to seek. You can filter your neighbours by the resources they produce/require, allowing you to form economically beneficial arrangements to support your armies, and you will need to structure your armies around their supply of food and bronze while you seek to expand into provinces that offer the resources you lack. 

Cons:

I cannot fathom why they chose to *invent* quotes from the main characters to display on loading screens. That is pure disinformation and honestly incredibly silly.

Combat is, as usual with modern Total War games, rather unimpressive without any sign of blood or fatigue on your units. Locking away a simple feedback feature that lets you know at a glance whether your projectiles are doing damage behind a DLC that comes months after release is among the worst decisions to haunt Total War games in many years.

Apparently people have been encountering bugs throughout the game. As of right now, I haven't played much, but I haven't encountered anything serious. Your mileage may, of course, vary, though this situation is pretty typical of any modern Total War game.

Maybe a Con?

There is a lot of jargon in the game, from the measuring of dates according to the flooding of the Nile (culminating in Shemsu Hor, the procession of Horus, where all of your court intrigues come to a head) to the various demonyms and place names that are unfamiliar to most modern readers. While it is easy for most individuals to remember the identities of France, England, Rome, Gaul, and other factions in more recent Total War games, this game feels a bit like being dropped in the deep end of a New Kingdom 101 lesson. It's not insurmountable, but previous familiarity with the period or a deep desire to read wikipedia and the in-game encyclopedia are necessary to come to grips with everything that is going on. Again, if you are already interested in this period or genuinely interested in reading up on it, this is not going to be a pitfall - however, for players looking to pick up the game and immerse themselves in the world without every having read up on the period, I imagine this may be discouraging to run into unaware.

The unit roster and technology tree is also, at first glance, relatively simple compared to some more sprawling Total War games. This is, in my opinion, a logical takeaway from a period that was defined less by rapid technological advancement and more by a war of culture and survival in the face of hostile ecological factors and a collapse of civilization as they knew it. A great deal of the technology in the game revolves around shoring up your economy to prepare for the inevitable Collapse, while unit rosters remain fairly static as far as I can tell around the technologies of the time (spears, bows, and the occasional chariot), forcing you to work within the cultural and technological limitations of the region you are fighting in. These are not downsides to me, but someone looking for the immense unit rosters of Warhammer or Medieval II rather than a more regionally-specific roster (such as in Britannia or Shogun II) may be disappointed.

I hope this review helps you decide whether Total War: Pharaoh is for you or not. In my opinion, comparisons to Troy are reductive and unhelpful (I personally did not find Troy to be as historically authentic or immersive as Pharaoh) but I do think that this game may have been better suited to a Total War: Saga or other sideline title, rather than being presented as a mainline Total War game for the simple reason that its limited scope and relatively unknown historical context do not seem appealing to many of the people who were hoping for another world-sweeping epic game.",1704037198,1704037198,True,146,7,0.788094222545623779,0,True,False,False

I did not want this game. Nobody I know wanted this game. I don't think the time period works well with Total War at all. And I think your devs knew this as well. I think I can be confident in that someone high up in CA saw an easy ""lets just re-skin troy to make some quick money"" decision and taken it.

I wanted Medieval 3, Empire 2, Spanish Reconquista, pre-WW1 eras. But I bought this to try and show CA that I want more historical total wars, but just not this one. 

I really wish CA would innovate more on the campaign and battle maps. For example more unique buildings ""Build the Lighthouse of Alexandria"" ""Build Dover Castle"". I want the history of the time period to be front and center in the campaign map. Or how about making cities individual and remove provinces? I really liked that in Medieval Kingdoms 1212 AD mod in Atilla.

I honestly imagine if you get random strangers off the street right now who never been close to horses, they would ride a chariot better than the Egyptians in this game. omg-it's infuriating.

Some of the mechanics with picking different playstyles is cool while climbing a greater political ladder. So if historical Egypt themed turn based strategy game is your thing. Go for it I guess. 

But if you enjoy historical battle simulations the RTS aspect. Ultimately there are better Total War versions with everything this has but better and more expended upon unit rosters.

- slow responding units, like 10 seconds sometimes.
- Random units getting stuck on terrain
- Random units deciding they had to be behind everyone else making big pushing contests happen, pretty much stopping movement.
- I've had random models of a chariot unit just randomly run across maps to go hug a settlement wall. Like 3.4th of the unit went where I told them, the others just ignored everything else happening to see what this settlement wall thing is about.
- Units not shooting when they can, not even gunners with a straight line, no, bowmen with an arc that shoots over mountains if you tell them to.
- Units getting stuck in fights you tell them to leave, the amount of time you're telling your units ""Hey stop fighting this group it's fully fleeing"". over and over again, but no 1 or 2 models who are now 200 meters away from the rest of the group get everything to go back regardless of any input you gave, unless you spam this input.

To be fair I did not expect to like this game all that much, while I loved rome 2 as in I have more than 1000 hours in it with the addition of the dei mod which really starts to make that game what it was supposed to be. Then you have rome remastered with the new RI mod which totally makes that game what it should have been. 

Why bring two older games and their mods up? Because Pharaoh's biggest charm for me is that you can tell the developers of this game started to look at the features common between those two mods. In particular the AOR. I kept hearing about how small the map was, I personally do not feel that way at all about it. They also brought back the ""outpost"" system from empire which ironically is much more impact with this installment as the buildings have real impacts on the generals that interact with them. The style of this game is pretty neat too, I enjoy the attention to detail in particular the attention to hairstyles and skin tones that are believed to have been common in that era. 

I definitely hear the criticisms of this game however. If this was supposed to be the next big historical title from CA it should have more than three cultures.  The map should extend to greek isles in the west and to babylon in the east. It is entirely possible that they would have included these in DLC but that is not guranteed and truthfully I sort of doubt that was in the works. Whats more, now that the game has dropped in price by 20 dollars and their golden goose has turned into a bun they had to put back in the oven...theres no way you are going to see much in the way of game changing content going to be coming out for it. 

Still. I paid 40 dollars with tax for it, and I believe that is fair. Especially as everyone will receive a ""10 dollar dlc"" for free.  In the form of the sea peoples dlc...which in my opinion will likely be two or three horde factions which has always been trashy / uninteresting gameplay. 

I would recommend this game if you are a fan of the period like I am and can enjoy the style. I have been playing total war since medieval 1 and have found something to like with all of them except thrones of Britannia which I will probably never buy due to a lack of interest.

Make Empire 2 or Medieval 3 or go bankrupt. This game, even for the price of a SAGA title, is an insult. You can do better. Three Kingdoms was a masterpiece as was Troy. But this?

I am just gonna go on about how much I hate this game from here on out:

New features are a joke. Weather and fire? LOL attila had them too and better

Campaign map is bad, too small and factions too far spread accross. No naval.

Chariots behave weird.

Far too many RPG elements and far too much bloated mechanics.

Read my review below, although negative, it highlights what i enjoyed and didn't enjoy. But as a company, bravo CA. Take the thumbs up for living up to your words about caring for the fan base. 




Original (gameplay) Negative Review based on 50H Roughly playing, one minor victory w/ Ramsses:

I enjoy the game overall but agree w/ reviewers. No Assyrians on launch (Literal Paragon of the Bronze Age society), which could have made the Hittite campaign feel unique (Sea peoples to Egyptians as Assyrians to Hittites). The Canaanites and Hittites feel like a DLC added to the Egypt game, even though it is the MAIN game.  I definitely enjoy the Egyptian factions and history, it is very well made and the Nile highway/pathing is gorgeous, but I did notice a lot of simple spelling errors in the encyclopedia (if you don't have time to spell check then it truly was rushed) and the lack of variety outside Egypt has much to be desired.  I love the troop recruitment changing by region, I like the battle sounds and the effects that can occur mid battle that give the game a nice feel (similar warhammer magic effects, except you're just lighting a sweltering bush field on fire with flaming arrows if they land in the field) HOWEVER, the fire didn't really do much to the troops within it, even my own so I was wondering why add such a cool, historically accurate/probable mechanic and not have it create an impact on the battle in any way? Sort of sums up the games flavor: really sick time period but, where are the most notable factions? Why couldn't tin and copper be resources to add more strategic value to some regions? Will chariots ever work? (okay maybe a bit unfair). 

Historical titles also had its charm of being able to rewrite history, directly or indirectly. With unkillable faction leaders (can we just keep this in Warhammer? people die IN HISTORY) it just feels sort of funneled. I miss the historical titles pushing out family members and any one of them could be great, based on your actions. But the emphasis on surrounding one person (rather than their empire) is definitely something to be desired from a historical TW pov. Diplomacy also does not allow rng, you have to make a favorable proposal to have them even look at it (and accept it anyways) like WHY?? I loved a diplomat randomly convincing someone to give me land even if the demand was ridiculous (btw no agents in the game....). Does not make diplomacy feel like an opportunity but rather a scale game to balance out the asks (which by the way why would it take 8000 food per turn to get 200 stone per turn? RIDICULOUS METRICS).  

Also sieges feel...weird. Indestructible walls I can understand, maybe the tech wasn't there at the time aside from sapping. It does leave the siege feeling rather limiting in some ways, I will use my fave TW of all time as an example, Rome (original): the city was always a square, or maybe a weird shape but you surrounded it mostly, whereas here a city can be embedded within the mountains (cool, I like it, Im not favoring Rome's design) BUT most have 2 entrances/chokepoints that one unit in each could defend an entire army? it is heavily biased towards defenders and is RIDICULOUS. IMO should be more approaches to siege, can we throw carrion like the mongols causing plagues? Can we burn farms, force them to sally out? There could be a lot of historical nuance you could do before and during the siege that would be accurate for this time period (researched of course, but the mongols learned from someone right?). 

So before you give me Jester awards, I did buy the Dynasty edition. Why? It is my money and in my hopeful mind (which is becoming more jaded as time goes on) I thought if I placed my support in a direction I want the fixes/good historical content will have backing. Do I regret paying a hundo just to flex on AI with my general skin? Not really, but one thing that bothered me was NONE OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS USE THE SKIN IN THE CAMPAIGN OTHER THAN YOURSELF WTF. I wanted to see all the faction leaders dripped out but NAH. Seems like a pointless upcharge if we cant have Ramsses with his gold attire face the Anubis-looking Seti in battle. Just default Seti. UGH. 

Final Thoughts: I blame financial/marketing decisions once again (such as EAs disaster of a release of Jedi:Survivor, do you companies not learn?). Some elements feel rushed, some excluded and overall a hollow historical title. If you want to buy it hoping they do some rework or fix it in a few years, might just be worth waiting until then. I am sorry Total War, I love you so much but I cannot accept this.

What I love about Pharaoh:
- graphics and sounds are beautiful and atmospheric as always
- battles are great, absolutely no complaints from me (I've been playing Total War games since Medieval 1)
- the campaign map is bigger than expected (covering modern day Egypt, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, and parts of Syria, Jordan and T√ºrkiye)
- campaign customisation--there are so many campaign settings to play with, for me I really like random character personalities, and random faction starting locations, good for replayability.

What is OK (not great but not bad):
- the invading factions that keep invading getting harder and harder until turn 140--they're kind of annoying but I can see why they've done it (to keep you on your toes), and can't be turned off in the campaign customisation settings
- the bronze age setting--yes, it's not everyone's cup of tea but it is an intriguing time because it's so long ago (1200 BC)--also means there is no horseback units, fastest units are chariots (which are devastating if micromanaged well I should point out).

What I don't like:
- the event message UI for each turn, I wish I could click the even and be taken to its location (e.g. built a new building, I want to click to go to the location of the event)
- the court system--seems kind of pointless--could be better with real rewards like when you rank up in Three Kingdoms, or the court-like faction bonuses for the chaos dwarfs in Warhammer III (both have solid bonuses for ranks and positions).

Furthermore, this game does not include Greece or Assyria: It only has Egypt, Nubia, Canaan, and a good chunk of modern day Turkey.  On a side note, I still say the setting for this game is better than Attila.

battles: 
The Bronze Age simply can not produce the epic battles of Shogun 2 and Rome 1: The best unit type available are chariots because horses at the time were substantially smaller their modern counterpart.  Even in most of the middle Ages horses were still a way smaller than they are today.  What this boils down to is that unless you have melee chariots, you will have a hard time doing away with those pesky enemy skirmishers and it will also be difficult to flank your opponent.  That being said the AI in this game is sufficient at least. 5 out of 10.

campaign:
If the future Medieval 3 has as rich campaign mechanics it will a sure Game of the Year.  You have:
++Ancient legacies:  The egyptian legacies are what really makes this feature shine.  You can be a merchant or conqueror or other things.  It is a very well made and implemeted feature.(note: Akhenaten and the egyptians of his time were muslim through prophet Joseph peace be upon him according to islamic doctrine)
+A decent court system.
+A good campaign scoring system.
+decent diplomacy
-the campaign map itself is a bit empty
-you have annoying raiders to deal with(Libu, Phrygian, Haska) and you cant order your garrison to sally out and attack them or give them a field of battle where you would like to meet them.  Even if you have an army dedicated to dealing with them it will have to travel a lot( especially as Egypt) and this not mentioning the desert attirition which is a real killer in this game.  Often times they simply loaf around or raid rather than attacking a settlement which is another annoyance.  Be aware that the LIbu raiders will eventually attack Yebu no matter what so be prepared.
-Dealing with other raiding armies isn't all that fun.  Especially since they will often retreat when attacked by a superior force.

For the game itself:

The UI is still fairly poor.
Courts are still a micro-fest. 
The in-game encyclopedia is among the worst in TW's history. Very shoddy.
The replay value is incredibly low... 3 cultures, one of which uses the court system of the other two.



For the Community/PR side:

Gave partial refunds (a good thing!) but can't be bothered to post in anywhere on Steam. Huge, sweeping change there, and all we get is a stickied thread with a link in it and no other text. Their refusal to use Steam News or to make a bigger splash on the forums is bizarre, and the link itself has TW:WH3 news above the Pharaoh section so even the link did not lead to the easiest-to-find news.

Earlier, the whole post-then-retraction-then-apology about the Steam forum was a staggering unforced error that partially led to where we are at.

And finally, even after everything, there's been virtually no news about what to expect further content. It's great that there was a partial refund, and that some content is still coming (and some of it may be free, even, now). But aside from it appearing like we will get Sea Peoples in January, not a lot was elaborating on even over two months later from launch.



Overall, the whole thing is just a shame... the game itself has some good ideas, and the optimization and technical stability is very solid for once (it never has been for TW:WH). There is also decent balance with units, but this is mostly because there aren't that many different types of units... melee, ranged, and chariots are about all you get. Sure, there are different tiers and a few special abilities, but this is one of the most limited rosters I've seen in TW and it was always going to be this way when they picked a Bronze Age setting yet again. Troy wasn't much better, but the Mythos DLC did at least add flying units and a few large units. In Pharaoh, meanwhile, aside from the rare chariot, there are about zero other large units and hence almost no reason to build spears.

There is a good game buried under lots of rushed or semi-complete elements. But the entire experience has soured me to the point where I'll just take the partial refund and go on my way, I guess. Even though they are clearly trying to do right by their playerbase, it's a sign that Pharaoh is likely not getting a lot of content down the line anymore, and what it will get is factions already in the game (Sea Peoples already exist as a CPU faction anyways).

[h1] Unbiased [/h1]

There are some things in this game that are genuine improvements over previous entries. Notably, the fog of war being a dark and brooding cloud coverage is simply beautiful. On top of this, the lighting showing the locations of civilizations within the clouds, but covering who or what they are is just as visually stunning. They also nailed the color coverage of this game and it really fits the setting.

Unfortunately, this is about where it ends.

Battles with minor settlements still use the same assault system and, if it weren't already just a genuinely bad system, it seems as if they managed to make unit navigation non-existent in this installation. Both in and out of the settlement, units seem to simply be unable to find their way in almost any direction. This is especially notable in chariots. Sure they have never been perfect, but seem to have miraculously found a way to get worse here in this title.

The map is boring. Elevationally, they did some great things. Detail-wise? It is desolate. I am not asking for things to exist where they shouldn't but, if your primary terrain is sand, do something entertaining with it. Give some animation to the emptiness.

There is no saving grace to the UI. The menus run together, they moved buttons from previous entries that should have never been moved, and they seemed to have attempted to make what is on screen as minimally present as possible. Normally, there is a good argument for this not actually being a bad thing but, here, it goes back to the previous point of there being very little to look at. Yeah I can see more map but there is also nothing on that map worth seeing.

Lastly, I get why they put character units into detachments, but they lose ALL sense of uniquity and excitement this way. [b] A better way of implementing this would be to have them separate and vulnerable, but able to enter and leave units at will and fluidly. If they get caught by themselves without a unit nearby, they can be cut down by even a mob of peasants. [/b] This would allow the lord and hero placement to feel both mortal and important, but this is impossible with the current system.

At the end of the day, even though a Total War title should be easy to make back one a $1/hr investment scale, I hesitate to see the majority of potential customers willfully putting in 40 hours, much less 70... For a game where one campaign might last over 20 hours, that's not good. It will need the powers of the modding community to fix it and I hate to say I don't think they will hold much interest in modding this title due to its poor reception. The Starfield community is already crumbling even though the modding tools haven't been released, and the potential for that game far outweighs the potential for this one.

It has been said before, and rightfully so. This is effectively a DLC for Troy and they knew that when they made it. There is 25% of a full game here and it is worth no more than $15. You can argue that valuation but you'd be ignoring the fact they showed their cards and were made apparent they only wanted your money and not necessarily your time; because they certainly weren't willing to give theirs. For those saying the partial refund they gave was one step towards fixing things, it is clear this game is already on the back burner and was so before it came out, they were just hoping you didn't notice.",1703046473,1703046542,False,10,0,0.583410918712615967,0,True,False,False

I hope CA continues to listen to the community and improve unit diversity, gameplay, and other requested features.

-------------

The game is fine, not great, not terrible. I wasn't sure if I should give a lukewarm positive review or just leave a negative review, but ultimately am choosing to give thumbs down. CA's community management and how they treat their content creators is ultimately what influenced my final decision.

Let's start with the good. The setting is cool, and I enjoy the Bronze Age and ancient Egypt.

Now for the downsides. The game is not particularly innovative and unit diversity is low. Some of the unit stats don't make sense to me, including a 2H unit that has resistance to missile attacks (?) while shielded units of the same type do not have that buff. No cavalry units even as mercenaries. No navies. Small map. Some units seem unbalanced. No family trees. Faction leaders cannot die. The fantastic personal relations system introduced in 3K does not exist in this game. Invader/raider units seem to target the player faction's settlements over AI settlements even when it doesn't make tactical sense and despite being at war with them, and sometimes will bypass half a map's worth of unguarded AI settlements including Egyptian settlements just to target and attack a player settlement, which feels cheesy. Overall it seems like CA is leaning away from making strategy games and is trying to appeal to a larger audience by making their games more arcade-style, but I'm not sure if it's actually successful and in some ways just makes the game less interesting. The only simplification I actually enjoy is how agents have been replaced with intrigue and court politics.

The game mostly performs well, but there is a memory leak that causes the game to be unplayable after a few hours that requires a restart to fix, even on my high-end PC. 

Overall I believe it is currently overpriced. I would recommend it if it were around half the price. In terms of play style this game kind of reminds me of a mixture of Troy and Thrones of Britannia more than it reminds me of Rome, Attila, or Three Kingdoms.

I've been a Total War fan for two decades, and I've been waiting anxiously for a true Bronze Age Total War game.  Creative Assembly finally delivered one, and I love it!

This definitely can be compared to TW Troy, which I also love.  However, TW Pharaoh adds far more game mechanics that make replaying the game enjoyable.  The cultures make sense (4x factions for Egypt, 2x factions for Canaan, and 2x factions for Hatti), and the setting (Bronze Age Collapse) is immersive, tying game play actions with results (destruction of Centers of Civilization triggers the Sea People Invasion).

The main complaint I have is price.  The content that is here is great!  However, the base game should have also included the Mesopotamian culture with another 4x factions.  This is not a true Bronze Age TW until Mesopotamia is added to the game, and it would be nice to see a the Mycenaean/Anatolian factions from TW Troy get added too (since this game takes place immediately after the Trojan War...).  Most people that complain about the game do not enjoy the Bronze Age.

Ultimately, this is an 8/10 at launch.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys historical Total War games and/or the Bronze Age.  No other game immerses you into the time period like TW Pharaoh.

EDIT - 15 December 2023:
With the recent decrease of price of the base game, and partial refunds given by the developer to all players who had purchased the game before, I think that this game is now fairly priced for the content that is provided.  Before, TW Pharaoh is a really fun game, but overpriced.  This is no longer the case.  Check this game out if you haven't yet!",1697244171,1702691480,True,4,0,0.476349115371704102,0,True,False,False

I have played Total war games since total war rome and while I try not to go with the crowd I admit that I was beginning to lose faith in CA.  They have done something I have never seen a developer do in my 20 years of gaming experience.  I never expected a partial refund.  This tells me that quite honestly CA is aware of the problems they are facing and their community is important to them.  

With that out of the way I must say that this game is quite fun.  While it does have its flaws(some of which are being addressed in future updates and dlc) The core game play its self is very entertaining.  While the starting factions feels stale it is still very satisfying to build your empire and provinces.  The battles are well balanced and engaging.

All in all it is a good game.  I would not recommend it at $60 dollars but now that the price has dropped to something more reasonable I can fully recommend it.

Though I was a fan, I could recognise that the high price entry-point was a massive distraction from the game's qualities, and people's concerns over the price were entirely legitimate.

CA has now decided to reduce the price quite significantly, so that distraction is now set aside. CA Sofia are a bunch of very talented people, and they've done a lovely job bringing Ancient Egypt & the Bronze Age collapse to life. The game is mechanically very good, and the graphics are excellent. The game runs very smoothly for me with consistently high FPS.

CA has set out its plans for an FLC update in the New Year (instead of a paid DLC) and wider plans to expand the map & introduce new cultures. I hope this will translate into the ultimate Bronze Age experience in time. To historical fans who weren't keen on immortal leaders & lack of succession/family trees, CA have also indicated that they are intending to introduce these in future updates (this likely fits in quite neatly with their expansive campaign customisation options, so everyone will be happy)

To those who are considering it now that the price has been reduced, I recommend this game very highly, and I hope now that the price controversy is out of the way people will be able to experience the better qualities of this game & see the effort CA Sofia has put into it.",1702674360,1702674360,True,12,0,0.584136366844177246,0,True,False,False

I have well over 100 hours of total playtime if you include early access hours. Even at the original price of this game, I felt it was worth the money given the hours of entertainment I have received. But now even more so with the lowered price point.

Visually, Pharaoh has a lot of things in common with Troy (this is a good thing), but plays differently enough that I would recommend the game more for someone who likes TW: Attila more than someone who likes Troy. 

The campaign map can be punishing between your aggressive neighbors and the constant migrating Libyans, Sea Peoples, and other groups who raid, pillage, and raze. There is also the Civilization Collapse mechanic which makes everything harder as the game progresses. This is all very similar to TW: Attila where there is the constant threat of migrating barbarians and Huns, as well as the climate change mechanic. This, in my opinion, is the best iteration of migrating forces and an 'end game mechanic' that Total War has put out so far besides Three Kingdoms.

The battles are slowed down considerably. Light infantry feel like, heavy infantry feel very heavy. Each weapon class is so important that you can straight up lose battles if you don't have to right tools (weapons) for the job. With the slowed down pace, and new formation abilities that allow you to give ground, battles feel so much more tactical than previous Total War entries. For example, you can tell your infantry to give ground, opening up a gap that allows your javelin throwers to assault the enemy flank from BEHIND your own lines. The result is battles can often feel scrappy, desperate, or even grindy at times (this could be a pro or con depending on taste).

This time period lacks the 'cool' factor when it comes to battles. You are not going to have cannons or elephants. There is no magic or monsters like Warhammer. This is just the fact of the time period. There are chariots however. These can be a lot of fun to use and, when used correctly, can net a ton of kills. As of this review, chariots are in an 'okay' place as far as pathing and charges. Creative Assembly promises additional tweaks later. There are also mods on the workshop that further enhance chariots.

Overall I have very much enjoyed Pharaoh and look forward to future updates.

Pharaoh is a breath of fresh Nile air for the Total War series. It takes a bold step forward with:

Visually stunning battlefields: Witness the clash of chariots and the glint of swords under the Egyptian sun.

Improved AI: Your enemies will put up a more brilliant fight, keeping you on your toes and engaged.

Matched combat animations: No more awkward conga lines! Soldiers now duel like true warriors, adding a visceral thrill to every battle.

However, the sands of time haven't wholly eroded all flaws:

Limited faction variety: Compared to the array of cultures in Rome: Total War, Pharaoh's menu feels a bit...sparse. More historical rivals would add some extra spice.

Bloodshed light? While the combat is undeniably cool, some players might crave more limb-lopping action.

However, this is a saga game, not a mainline game, as evidenced by the smaller scale and the use of resources rather than funds to purchase units and buildings. I refunded the game after an hour because the small scale of the game just could not justify the price.

Plenty of challenge with room to grow through free updates and DLC, which CA has released for many of their titles. Takes Troy and extrapolates from that shell.

I hate to do this, but the final straw is NO simultaneous co-op. My friend and I were so excited to play a campaign, So unless they implement that, it's going to sit at a negative review for me

Total war Pharaoh does some things really well. For example, the campaign customization. Brilliant! I hope they keep that in future total war titles. Even add it to existing ones(warhammer 3). Dynamic disasters and events, super interesting. While personally not a big fan of the outposts, they work really well here.

The downsides: the camera controls during battles are horrendous. So sluggish moving around. Troops are also super slow to run around and perform actions. Similar feel to Throne's of Britannia.

Also, Warhammer 3 introduced the GREATEST mechanic ever: simultaneous turns. The fact the Troy, and Pharaoh do NOT have them, is mind blowing.

It's like the the higher ups(not the people who put blood sweat and tears in to it), the people in suits are like ""alright guys, our players really like some of these mechanics. But we don't need them anymore""

It's a good total war game, sure. Worth the price tag? No. Price tag is also greed on the higher ups, as well as Steam taking so much per sale.

Overall, game is a 4.5/10. if you can get it on sale for $20-$25, it would be worth the money. I personally dont see me playing this again.

Total War: PHARAOH enters the arena of historical strategy games with a promise of grandeur but delivers a mixed experience. The game, which at first glance presents itself as a full-fledged title, feels more akin to an expansion pack, especially when considering the map size and unit types.

One of the game's notable aspects was the developer's response to community feedback, evidenced by a ¬£20 refund following Steam reviews. This move shows a commendable level of responsiveness and customer care, a rare sight in today's gaming landscape.

However, the pricing strategy for PHARAOH sparks a debate. While the game's quality is undeniable, its resemblance to an add-on rather than a standalone game makes its ¬£50 price tag seem steep. In an era where digital distribution dominates, one could argue that a ceiling of ¬£30 would be more appropriate for AAA titles, especially for digital downloads.

The gameplay of PHARAOH is both its strength and its Achilles' heel. It offers a solid and engaging strategy experience, true to the Total War franchise's reputation. Yet, it comes with a level of difficulty that might not be everyone's cup of tea. This steep learning curve, while appealing to strategy veterans, could be off-putting for newcomers or casual players.

In conclusion, Total War: PHARAOH is a game that walks a tightrope between expansion and a full game. Its quality is evident, yet its identity and value for money remain questionable. It's a game that will resonate well with hardcore fans of the series or genre, but others might find it lacking in substance relative to its price. A rating of 3 stars seems fitting ‚Äì a good game for sure, but one that leaves room for improvement and reconsideration of pricing strategy.",1702590675,1702590675,True,3,0,0.503105580806732178,0,True,False,False

I have skipped some historical titles but believe I haven't missed much. I might well have spent thousands of hours into some of these titles and consider myself a veteran.

The only real downside with Pharaoh was its pricing, which has now been fixed. At ¬£30 this game is great and one of the best historical TW titles. It's not on par with the best-in-class (Rome, Medieval II, Shogun II and Attila in my view) but it's a really solid game. I agree with the consensus that the scope could have been wider and should have included Mesopotamia as well, but the game in its current form is really good, with room for improvement / fixes:

What I liked:
- Great faction variety despite having only three macro factions. Upper and lower Egypt feel very different and the addition of special units for each faction is great (medjays for Ramsesses, cheap levies for Seti, chariots for Tausret, Nubians and Kushite troops for Amenmesse... well done!)
- The kingdom / pharaoh dynamics are really great and add a substantial layer of complexity. Court plots, civil wars to become king / pharaoh, legitimacy are all really well done and structured
- Diplomacy is one of the best ever. I liked Attila more but this is a top tier diplomacy engines
- Resources are a fantastic addition and add a whole new level of complexity to the economic sphere, which was really lacking in previous historical titles
- Sea peoples and other invaders: it's great to have them from day 1, really keeps you on your toes depending on which faction you play and forces you to pay constant attention to your borders and think about troops allocation wisely
- Forts and outposts: another great addition

Now there are also a few negatives of course, and I hope the team will improve these in future patches as they are definitely solvable:
- The AI turtles a lot and apart from sea peoples you really don't see any wars. There is a constant state of peace where factions belonging to the same ethnic group are all friendly with their neighbours aside from during civil wars. That would have been okay if there was more Egypt vs. Canaan or Egypt vs. Hittites action, but this is completely lacking. Egyptians do not actually fight Hittites or Canaanites at all and everyone prefers to turtle up. This is BORING! We need to have at least more proactive and belligerant Hittite king / Egyptian pharaoh factions who are keen to expand their territories and force all subjects to join these large scale wars. It would be awesome to see all Egyptian factions fighting vs. all Hittite factions. It could be a mechanics close to crusades in Medieval II
- Forts: the AI absolutely abuses of the forts... they build forts everywhere and fill them with 10 troops and absolutely never pull out those troops to involve them in campaigns, even if forts are far away from their borders. As a result, the AI has very little active troops even on veteran difficulty since most of their troops are allocated to forts. This is also why you don't see any wars... the AI has little to no troops available! The max I have seen was 2x full stacks for the Pharaoh but they were weak and filled with militias, whilst their forts would have tier 3+ troops. Makes no sense
- Trade regions is overpowered. You can make virtually anyone your vassal just by giving them one region, even your arch-enemy
- Sea peoples' stacks bring everyone together and you always see Canaan send all their troops into Egypt (totally ignoring military access restrictions) to fight the sea peoples. Why do they do that??? They have no interest since they are not attacking their coast, they are actually attacking their sworn enemy. Canaan should rather attack Egypt benefitting from the sea peoples distraction
- Some factions do not really play to their name. Irsu should be super offensive and always keen to attack Egypt, yet I have never seen him attack anyone other than a tiny one-region Canaanite neighbour

Fix these issues, mostly around passive AI, and we might have the best TW title of the last decade (aside from the GOAT - Attila - and non-historical titles)",1702584306,1702584306,True,3,0,0.501246929168701172,0,True,False,False

The key new differences from previous games are:
-Victory isn't just take a bunch of territories, it now has a VP system where conquest, as well as missions, objectives, and buildings can contribute to earning enough victory points for a minor, major, or ultimate victory.
-When you pick a leader, you get to pick what are your key objectives, there are a few choices for each faction with the Canaanite factions getting to pick between objectives from either of the other factions.  The helps let you play how you want to play while adding variety of playing options.

Overall I enjoy this as a Total War game and am glad to have it.  It isn't as big of scope as one of the Warhammer games, but I feel it was worth the price.

I can not say I am intrigued by the AI or storyline definately has some charasteristics from Warhammer raiding armies. Although, the challange of surviving enourmous raids from the east and sea other factions hold higher level of units creating a deeper wedge between own faction and the campaign. I understand the purpose of becoming Pharaoh but it really does not make a huge difference in the effects on the battlefield or campaign. I guess my expectations were high expecting a mythical beast just like Troy to help ravage the land of Egypt. The map is huge and the elemnts sure play an advantage or disadvantage depending on scenario. The AI seriously needs an update since one turn we are forming alliances then we are seiged by the supposedly ally. The chariots are really dumb per say, they do not have the same effect of horse man like three kingdoms. Lets not start on the constant lags and freezing in a middle of a battle. Overall, I hope they will add more challenging AI and units that bring ancient myth of egypt to life. 

I will not say do not buy the game i would just say buy in a discounted price and let you be the judge, but for $60.00 I would rather save it for expansions on other Total War games.

I will say now that my purchase was a mistake (even with today's refund). In terms of value this is the Total War game with the least amount of replayability so far. 

The factions are too similar, the court system is tedious,  the Sea People harassment feels less apocalyptic and more annoying, etc. But my biggest problem is the map does not include Mesopotamia, Greece, or western Anatolia. This is supposed to be the ""definitive Bronze Age TW"", but I guess these regions are to be sold at a later date. Are you kidding me??

Also if you're going to have immortal leaders you *have to* make them diverse. Agamemnon and Hippolyta and Rhesus all have different and interesting mechanics, meaning each campaign will be played out differently. In Pharaoh there is no such thing and each ""hero"" gets small modifiers and abilities that are lazily designed. Playing Ramesses or Tausret is basically the same experience, just with different starting points. 

The combat is fun, despite the primitive unit types. The AI makes good decisions and knows how to put pressure on weaknesses, which pleasantly surprised me. Chariots turn the tide on open fields, but can also be extremely fragile in the wrong context, which makes it so much more tactically interesting to decide when to use them. The UI, the economy, music, battle maps are all well done too.

That Legacysystem was cool. Honestly i can see a lot of good ideas coming from CA Sophia. I believe they have done what they could to make a good game.

That being said i just dont see a full price historical title here. It feels like an expanded SAGA game. The Map is very small. Critical parts of the ancient bronze age world like Assyria or Elam are missing which would be necessary for a Bronze Age game. As such i can not recommend this game.

I like historic total war games but honestly i think they should have both with troy and this one embraced the Mythical Bronze Age direction and simply made it somekind of fantasy total war. Recent price Hikes and Bans are also probably not helping people feel positive about this.

Total War needs a new engine and real inovation and not try to publish a game every year. That hasnt worked out for assassins creed. Why should it work out for total war?

TW:Pharoah expects you to think about every aspect of every turn across your whole campaign. Whether it's the complex and interlocking resource based economy, the high upkeep and construction costs for units and buildings, the interlocking diplomacy and alliances (with the need for barter agreements), or the large provinces with waystations to boost movement and garrisons to provide reinforcements... If you auto-pilot any aspect of this game you will face an equivalent consequence.  

- Attack a random faction just because its adjacent to you and has something you want? enjoy 4 others declaring war.
- Build or upgrade every space available just because the option is there? expect resource exhaustion and a lopsided economy.
- Over-recruit on quality OR quantity of troops? better be ready for food shortages and desperate trade agreements to balance your budget.
- Neglect the court intrigue and politics? say goodbye to a raft of discount and recruitment options.
- Build a garrison where you should've put a waystation? good luck getting your armies to intercept those nomad raiders.

The combat is solid without being lethargic, and devoid of the Superhero General Syndrome that's dominated recent titles. 
 Regional troop variants create a surprising amount of variety both in the enemies you face and the armies you yourself will use, and the bronze bottleneck combined with the garrison system ensures lower tier troops stay relevant even into late game.

If you're looking for a Total War where you just make economy get big, build some doomstacks and attack next like a Risk algorithm, this one's going to feel like a chore.  But if you miss the days when Total War titles made you contemplate each action instead of spamming ""End Turn"" to race to your snowball/blitz, you're in for a good time.

I have really tried to enjoy Pharaoh and give it a chance, but after 30 hours (including the pre play weekend) I just have no real excitement to jump on and play it, which is a first for me with TW having owned and completed every release to date. Think that probably says it all really.

There are some minor improvements that should be continued, such as outposts, weather effects, improved battle realism (apart from blood etc which will cost even more no doubt) but that's it.  What is lacking far outweighs them though. For example, the ""music"" is basically non existent background noise, and there are quite a few features like diplomacy options, that were in WH3, but are missing in Pharaoh??  General content, value for money, and just ""soul"", sadly seem to be on the decline in priorities for many big devs like CA.

They have forgotten the customer is always right, and instead chose the short term gain over the long term.  The results being I cannot recommend TW Pharaoh, even on sale, and for the first time ever will be waiting for very positive reviews before even considering purchasing the next release in the series.

This game is just lacking at full price. Much like the desert, it feels empty and devoid of any unique features.

I love the historical (i.e. non-Warhammer) Total War games, and have put close to 2000 hrs into Shogun 2 and Three Kingdoms combined. 

Pharoah is a significant letdown in comparison.

The good:
- beautiful campaign map
- some quality of life improvements over Three Kingdoms (incremental saves, campaign customization options, etc)
- performance improved in general (well, until the game stutters to a halt after a couple hours of play)
- outposts and campaign map movement mechanic is cool and adds significant depth to the gameplay
- the barter system is awesome and makes economic management much easier if you find yourself in a resource hole financing some ill-conceived war

The bad:
- there's no content. the game feels empty and basic
- every faction feels same-y in both gameplay and in the court system, which is basically identical regardless of if you're a Hittite, Egyptian or Canaanite
- zero sense of grandeur and epic-ness
- AI makes nonsensical and suicidal decisions even on hard difficulty. the AI really feels like a massive step backwards from Three Kingdoms
- boring, repetitive units
- boring, repetitive intrigue/court/politics
- boring diplomacy
- the UI is terrible (campaign map armies only show unit count, no easy way to tell how your army will match up against another, poor battle unit banners)
- memory leak or some other performance issue that occurs after a couple hours of play where performance starts lagging out badly until the game is restarted

2023 should have been one of the better years for game releases and instead it's been one ugly cash grab after another. Greedy publishers are asking full price for half-baked, rushed games that launch without content and features, and it's gotten to be a depressing time to be a gamer.",1700011912,1701671012,False,17,0,0.558674097061157227,0,True,False,False

  Campaign dynamics are vastly improved over all other TW series.

  Generals are customizeable through earning XP to add pts to 3 stat lines.  The more stat line points you get, the more Titles you will be able to unlock for a General also (up to 3 titles).  Generally (har), these 3 stat lines improve upkeep, replenish and movement in their first column (about 5pts per column) and then more traits as you advance in to the 2nd and 3rd column of each stat lines points.  A general can also be devoted to one of the several gods you will end up worshipping which also improves them and their stack.  Finally akin to 3K, Generals can also be outfitted with armor, shield, weapon and various ancillaries that you  will acquire over time and victory to enhance their traits and abilities.

  The Economy is based on 5 resources.  Food, Stone, Lumber, Bronze and Gold.  You will need all 5 to sustain and grow.  Trade with other factions seems to factor heavily in to balancing your resources out besides solely conquering new regions.  In line with this in depth trade, Diplomacy itself as a whole seems much better than many previous titles.  Factions will make peace on more realistic terms when they are facing annihilation.  They will also not harbor hatred for you for the rest of the game once you make peace.  Or at least their fear of you keeps them in check.  And with numerous nomadic invasive factions and armies, you will be in need of some convenient peace agreements from time to time.

   Unit balance is decent across tiers from my experience so far.  Battle is fun and looks good, it's TW.

   Provinces/Regions are done pretty good.  Each Province has a capitol settlement region with up to 8 building slots, and then usually 2-3 supporting regions that still have their own settlement with 4 building slots.  Besides the settlements, each region has 2-4 map locations for building Outposts.  Outposts are fairly generic across the whole map besides a handful of unique special historical type Outpost locations. 

   Religion is cool.  You start worshipping one god and will eventually worship a few gods.  I believe you can worship gods from other cultures as well (Egyptian, Canaanite, Hittite) but I have not begun worshipping a diff culture god yet.  One of the Outpost options is a Shrine to one of your gods- sending your stack there for instance gives them the army wide benefit of the pertinent deity prayer for a few turns (i.e. increased morale or replenish etc).

   If you like most of the historical TWs, I don't see how you're not going to get some enjoyment out of this one inbetween visiting the old favs while you wait for M3 or E2..",1701128610,1701128610,True,2,4,0.455889582633972168,0,True,False,False

The Good:
 - atmosphere and immersion : game does a great job of conveying the mood of the bronze age collapse through UI, dynamic visual effects, campaign events, music and voice acting
- visuals: battles and the campaign map look great, the UI is highly detailed and inspired by ancient Egyptian art
-campaign features: resource management is difficult and requires planning; court intrigue (though tedious at times) adds to the roleplaying element and fits well with the game's focus; the inclusion of various gods and worship; threat from external enemies; random events linked to seasons and state of the world; all add an extra strategic layer
- campaign pacing: I was undecided at first as I am used to older TW titles where expansion is easier, but here campaigns require more careful planning, and individual battles are more significant
-options to undo your previous turn, as well as extensive campaign customisation that gives the option to tweak many features people have expressed frustration with (eg. turn off sea-people invasions, more resources, random starting positions etc)

The Bad:
- steep learning curve, and potential for dead-end campaigns if you don't plan ahead
- slow pace may put off some people
- campaign map covers a relatively small geographic area (although it is still deceptively large with many settlements, I like it but I understand many people don't)
- character-focused gameplay (this is just a personal preference, in TW Pharaoh you play 'as the leader' rather than 'as the country' and your leader can only be wounded, never permanently killed""

Overall, I would recommend, especially if you are interested in ancient Egypt or the time period more generally. It's fun, and great if you love a challenge.

Regional supremacy: being the head honcho in one's own country. I didn't paint the map. I unified, by diplomacy and force, a single nation out of somewhat disparate peoples.

Minor victory comes early. Really, it signifies the completion of the first stage of a game. I will go back and bring all 3 of these campaigns to major victory some day. So far, I would only consider earning a supreme victory with Irsu, of the Canaanite factions, whose play-through I have enjoyed the most so far.

Highlights: Huge unit rosters--you make armies from the places you have conquered! your armies are a reflection of your empire. This total war has the greatest unit variety of all of the historical titles. Beautiful city and battle map design! The undeniable DRIP of bronze age (aesthetic so timeless that to call it classic doesn't cut it by a half-millennium)

How is the campaign map? The outposts are not too troublesome to manage. By my third campaign I could manage them with no hassle and even a sense of enjoyment. The map seems somewhat limited becuse of the somewhat artificial borders: northern and western Anatolia are suddenly 2D. Egypt is just hanging there like a watermelon in a plastic shopping back, oddly round and cut off from the coast at the southeastern edge. It is actually and ENORMOUS map. The only problem is that the shape doesn't feel natural: it feels overly limited, arbitrarily so. Nonetheless Using the Nile to cut across a sea of sand in no-time is fairly satisfying, and the movement bonuses from outposts makes the vast expanses a lot more manageable. Nevertheless I felt somewhat hopeless plunging into Egypt and towards Nubia, and rather in a rush to quickly mop up the northwestern corner of Anatolia.

How are the battles? Honestly, the battles are pretty good, although they didn't reinvent the wheel with them. The battles are slow burners in this one, lines can stay static long enough for some delightful maneuvering at the best of times--and at the worst, tedium can set in. I found the small settlement battles to be more tactically challenging than Troy. Troy felt good because you could use a small force to dam up a tidal wave of opponents at a single choke. Pharaoh makes you defend at least 2 important points in a small settlement, meaning you have to defend a minimum of 5 to 7 chokes instead of 1.5 to 3. For reasons I can't quite explain, the siege battles are a helluva lot of fun in this one. In other titles the sieges result in lots of deaths that are due more-so to tacky mechanics than tactical errors. I feel a real sense of ownership of my victories and defeats in this game (at least with walled settlements.) The maps all benefit from that excellence of design exhibited in Troy. It's a good thing the design is good, otherwise the sandy desert colors would get drab really fast.

How are the new mechanics? Court business is actually pretty tolerable considering how repetitive it gets. Honestly, the Rome 2 system of court politics is still among the best. This has elements in common, where every turn you're engaging in non-transnational diplomacy for certain benefits. Honestly it works great to provide narrative structure for the world. Whereas in 3 kingdoms the affiliation between all of the factions is really, really complicated, in this game you can see who the major players for each country is--among whom, you are one.

Honestly, This game has brought some improvements that will only benefit future historical total wars if they are brought to spiritual fulfillment. Someday when it is a Medieval 3 or Empire 2 instead of an obscure (if delicious) historical period, there will be a bunch of great new features that will make those titles truly different from their predecessors.

tl:dr - it ain't Troy, 3 Kingdoms, and especially not Medieval 3, but it ain't bad",1701051722,1701051722,True,4,0,0.50838768482208252,0,True,False,False

The geographical scope is more like that of a Saga title, but the map is very dateiled and there is enough content to justify the price and the map looks like it allows DLCs with new areas and factions.

Slightly less short version:
- Cool new campaign mechanics with civil wars, legitimacy, court system, divine worship (better than in Troy) and state of civilisation (you can literally try to avoid the Late Bronze Age Collapse).
- Strategically interesting map: Nile acts as an east-west barrier, but a north-south highway, Canaan's coast allows for quick transportation from town to town but is vulnerable, Asia minor is mountainous with lots of bottlenecks that can be plugged with forts.
- Working diplomacy and no discernible anti-player bias of the AI.
- Challenging, but well integrated invasions.
- Large province diversity, no cookie-cutter layouts due to resource specific buildings and lots of special buildings for main settlements.
- Outpost system adds a layer to province management and smoothly implements road development (outposts along the roads refund a part of movements points on reaching them).
- Large unit variety with full Area of Recruitment system for each of the 12 realms (= Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt, Isuwa, Sinai, etc.) in the game and completely unique rosters for each of the eight major factions.
- Major factions have unique and characteristic mechanics that make for very specific and non-repetitive gameplay.
- Full campaign customisation (invasion intensity, starting positions, player handycaps or bonuses, etc.)
- Decent battle AI that flanks, concentrates forces, targets generals.
- Well balanced combat that makes for a sensible pace of battles, melee fights go on for quite a while unless you charge in the rear with chariots, and archers are useful but not overpowered due to the armour system.
- Intricate battlefields with topography (cliffs, bottlenecks), ground types (shallows, sand, mud fields, grass fields, forests) all of which hide different classes of units and/or influence fighting and movement stats differently, and weather effects (sandstorm, fog, rain, thunder storm) that can change a battle entirely.
- Beautiful graphics and very atmospheric depiction of Egypt, the Levant and Asia Minor.
- Very good performance on shiny graphics levels.
- Only some very minor bugs (like a missing description), nothing really impacting gameplay.

All of which come together to deliver an experience that's actually worth playing instead of piles of ""more"" which turns out is just the same with a different flavour of monster energy. 

For now I'll just go with a list. 
- Outposts 
--bring a lot of mobility into the game, as you can traverse your territory quickly and cheaply unlike ALLL OTHER TW games where you had to drag your high end armies through safe territory for multiple turns. 
--are additional building slots, especially useful for landmarks so they don't clutter your main settlement
--give a region more strategic depth
--make a lot of historical sense
-troy's resource system is back, not just ""Dark magic"" which is identical to money in every way apart from being purple. so you can have meaningful interactions with your economy. I'll take that over dragons every day of the week
-seasons/years matter and don't just kneecap your movement and character progression. Sure, aging characters is realistic and you can do a shitty version of crusader kings in old TW games, and attila, but it mainly limits what you do. It takes away your top generals, hinders your upstarts from grabing cool titles and limits how you move on the campaign map, because if you end up outside in winter / desert summer, you lose your army. in pharaoh that's not the case but UNLIKE warhammer, where you're just counting down to domesday, The seasonal cycle is front and centre. and it all ends and begins with Shemsu Hor when your court plots resolve and your abilities refresh. and you have to plan around that. There is also crop yield, but even I do not care that much about that. 
-Areas of recruitment, It's logical and makes armies more diverse, which is fun. you know why I never play troy on historic, because that scraps the only AoR mechanic in the game and really why even bother conquering new territory if I cant even get cool spicy troops there? 
-Actual unit stances, tbh it's not perfect, but they're back!
-victory conditions don't suck arse. you don't need to conquer rome or whatever for no goddamn reason or research longer than any sane game lasts ... you just get points for certain conquests, missions and feats and different point threshholds for different victories. finally I can finish a TW campaign without dragging it out extra 50 turns of conquering pointless territory.
-courts, legacies and religion are also fun but that's more in the camp of faction mechanics.
In sum it's a good total war game that knows what it is and what it isnt. CA Sophia looked at the TW formula and put back in what was missing and took out what nobody needed anyway. 

Also... so far it works... no game breaking day one bugs so far. this is very faint praise. but considering the current state of gaming is. it's something.

But don't get me wrong there are some things even I would like improved. Mainly the map is a bit cramped. the province count is good and the maniacs who cry for Mesopotamia can shut up, that's an entire extra game. BUT unless you're doing legit egyptian nile based hegemony you're always at most 2 regions away from the border of the map, and the way the map is designed that just feels claustrophobic. 

I know people are losing their minds over this game being ""not as cool as warhammer"" and ""not medieval 3"" which is where apparently all the bad reviews come from. It's a shame that a bulgarian studio, that finds creative solutions, has to suffer for the greedy mistakes of it's british mother studio.",1697102844,1700682278,True,57,6,0.598496735095977783,0,True,False,False

* Campaign Customization is a very welcome new feature. I love it.

* I rarely manually play battles, but they are fine. Slower than before but that's not a negative. Flow and realism seems good. Quite hard actually, even for a veteran like me. Don't rely on crap units like I often do, they will be slaughtered.

* The politics system is very weird but quite simple as soon as you understand the different parameters of it. But not really that impactful on the game so I think you'll do fine if you just stay away from it if you dislike it.

* The economic model is OK. I was expecting stone and gold to be scarce like in Troy but I ended up with a LOT of it. It proved to be the low-value resource Food that was actually very scarce, so prioritize making farms and fisheries over all other currencies including gold. (This might vary on who and where you are. I was in south Egypt where everything was plentiful except food).

* The outpost system is quite good. Especially that it gives you a speed boost in your own territory once you get the hang of how to use them. But I rarely remember to use them for their intended general bonus effects, and nearly only use them for speed boost and province improvement.

* Religion too seems scary at first since it's a lot to read, but it's actually not that complicated.

Due to a lot of new mechanics, your first campaign will most likely consist of you making quite a few bad decisions since you don't understand everything at once. But you'll get there after a few dozen turns.

[b]The Good:[/b][list]
[*]Many (and mostly interessting) game mechanics: Ancient legacy, Court, Religion, Civilization State and Civil Wars
[*]Highly customizable difficulty settings for the campaign
[*]Given (historical) constraints, the unit variety is decent
[*]Reasonable choice of historically important faction leaders
[*]The campaign map is large and beautiful
[*]Regional native unit recruitment
[*]Many unique building chains
[*]An interessting outpost system

[b]The Bad:[/b][list]
[*]Including the Mycenaean kingdoms and Assyria would have increased the scope of the game, making it more interesting and replayable
[*]Court interactions are detached from diplomacy/faction standings
[*]Combat system will need more rebalancing via patches
[*]Campaign and battle AI have not evolved much compared to previous titles
[*]Cheats are still the main method for the AI to keep up with the player 
[*]There is no proper endgame challenge, only the number of invading enemy stacks increases
[*]Playing wide is a lot more rewarding than playing tall
[*]Blood/Gore is, again, not included and will likely added by a DLC

While I was enjoying the game quite a bit, everything was ruined as soon as I realized how the AI completely ignores the resource mechanic.

No, I'm not talking about buffs and other ""AI cheats"" we're used to in CA games, but not being affected by the mechanic at all. CA, please explain how the AI has resources to trade when they haven't built a single resource-producing building. This means I can't actually affect my enemies by, say, taking their bronze settlements thereby affecting their upkeep on their good units. Completely removes strategy from the campaign map.

It's a shame it took me so long to notice, but it's true. These games keep getting simpler and less strategic, and to add insult to injury, they add one-sided mechanics made to *simulate* depth where there isn't any. Wait for CA to correct their mistakes or a big sale before buying.

EDIT: Added a continuation with a few examples below:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further, none of the added mechanics relating to diplomacy or courts change gameplay in any meaningful way. It's the same as always: 20 vs. 20 stack battles to get anything done. Here are some ways in which this occurs. This list does include some of the ""standard ai cheats"" that have been dialed up to 11:

Want to sabotage your enemy by tanking their public's happiness? Not really possible against AI. They can have the most miserable population on the planet, but they're rarely (if ever) going to rebel. That's just for players lol.

Want to get two factions to stop fighting, or maybe bribe them into settling as third-party kings have done for millennia? Not possible.

Want to encircle your enemy's cities so that their economy collapses? Lol the AI is just going to conjure resources out of thin air. Not a small amount, either. They'll get as much as they possibly need to keep their armies going.

Honestly, three kingdoms is way better. The AI cheats, absolutely, but they still fundamentally use the same damned mechanics as the players. Bonuses are one thing, but ignoring mechanics reeks of a board of directors that refuses to put a single penny into campaign map AI.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: While we're all used to AI ""cheats"" (typically in the form of buffs) in TW games, this time around, the AI isn't even playing the same game as the players. I mean that literally: the AI and players play under different mechanics. If you want a deep strategy game, look somewhere else. If you want to do nothing but fight 20-troop stacks in a game that tricks you with ""fake depth"" and a strategic layer with no strategy, still avoid this game lol.",1698612833,1700334645,False,17,0,0.620920300483703613,4,True,False,False

I guess I was expecting some sort of copy of Troy (which we got), with some feelings of Three Kingdoms (which I thoroughly enjoy). What I think we ended with was a much worse version of Troy. 
Pros: It has potential‚Ä¶?

1.	I really like the graphics, map, and presentation. I do like the weather effects in the battles. Although there are battle issues like hitting walls no matter the troops, I think the battle system has potential. 
2.	I feel like the factions have potential, although in the current state they all literally feel the same. 

Cons: Too much going on, and not in a meaningful way. 
1.	Court actions between both the Egyptians and Hittites are extremely redundant. The concept seems like fun at first, until the actions you have to do every single turn start to feel the same with no real benefit. After playing both sides, I‚Äôd prefer to not do anything with the court system.. it‚Äôs boring. Additionally, after you get a few turns into the court system people start dropping like flies (war game). Vacancies continue to make me question the point of the system. Sure, you can go deep into the technology tree to research the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of taking multiple seats.. but again.. a chore, with no real impact. 
2.	Outposts. I‚Äôve heard some people like having the outposts due to some benefits obtained when you bring an army to one. Although I partially agree with this, it seems super redundant. All of the ‚Äúbuildings‚Äù you construct could be created in the major settlement. It truly feels like these buildings are redundant. It makes the player have another ‚Äúchore‚Äù of constructing again in the same region, rather than focus on the point of the game ‚Äúwar‚Äù. I don‚Äôt mind the concept of the outposts, but I don‚Äôt see the reason a building needs to be constructed on one. They could‚Äôve easily made it simpler with a set bonus or something of that nature. 
3.	Buildings. Despite some factions have their own buildings, the tree is overly complex (likely due to multiple resources). Building structure feels exactly the same, regardless of faction. I honestly felt like this would be a place Sega could‚Äôve excelled in, due to troop limitations. But it really felt like a throw all this at them and see what sticks. In my 24 hours of gameplay, I was not able to consider management and military trees really at all. Focus was always on resources. And I think the management tree didn‚Äôt really have anything appealing anyways, so if I didn‚Äôt have to focus on resources ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd have chosen. 
4.	Multiple Resources. I didn‚Äôt have this complaint per se with Troy. However, this version doesn‚Äôt feel near as balanced from a resource standpoint. I‚Äôm mixed that there are predominately food shortages and high army costs, as it requires the player to think about their army composition (leaning to cheap) more than other total war games.
5.	Battles and Units. Being the time period and limitation on troop types, I‚Äôve found it takes an awful long time to construct buildings required to train higher tier troops. When these troops are gained, they don‚Äôt really feel like a major upgrade and they cost a substantial amount to retain. I.E. it‚Äôs hard to have a fully loaded army on the battlefield. And good luck fielding a 2nd or 3rd general if you have one. Battles are great in graphics and functionality, but even if you have chariots and charge a group of archers with them, you‚Äôll slam into them like hitting a wall. Generals you hire are all literally the same. You can choose the same type of upgrades ‚Äì benefits do not change no matter which faction you use. The only ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is the path taken. 
6.	Factions. For all the changes and hype on the leaders, they all play the same. Yes there are much hyped differences, but in the end, it will feel the same. I was super excited to play Bay, as he seemed to be the ‚Äúsneaky‚Äù guy that would have the most unique battle features. But alas, he felt just like everyone else. The units felt exactly the same. Strategy to win in each battle? You guessed it, exactly the same. I will say that given that upgraded units are hard to achieve, playing with the factions that ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù get them didn‚Äôt really feel any different than ones that are extremely hard to get. 
7.	Invasions. It‚Äôs not just the seas, but even the baren desert receives invasions. I thought the overall invasion would feel more meaningful, but it‚Äôs literally a stack of units arrive. Defeating them doesn‚Äôt feel meaningful, other than you don‚Äôt have anymore raiding taking place on your land. 
8.	Choose a Path and Research Tree. The research tree feels meaningless ‚Äúanother chore‚Äù outside the small benefits that are provided. It‚Äôs also the exact same no matter the leader chosen. The choose a path is also another ‚Äúchore‚Äù. I‚Äôve experimented with a  couple of them. One you have to keep clicking on each turn or few turns to trade ‚Äúmagical resources‚Äù that every faction has, but you only notice it if you chose that path. Another has you combine gods for different benefits (that‚Äôs ok). Another has you conquer lands (I got the full population support multiple times, with a full stack of soldiers promised to help when I attacked ‚Äì only to take the base with only my troops?), another has you build a temple at a specific location (don‚Äôt try this if your place is the full map away?). 
9.	Promises. This game promised leading your civilization through collapse. The game doesn‚Äôt actually ever feel like it‚Äôs tilting to collapse. It feels like food supply changes every few turns, but have enough food saved up and you don‚Äôt really notice it. Oh and there are random invasions (haha)..

Subject matter (bronze age) might not be for everyone, but those that are saying this is 'Total War Saga: Troy, without the word ""saga"", are being hyperbolic. For one thing, the fact that CA even made this distinction in the past is kind of stupid, because although people are arguing that Fall of the Samurai (originally a DLC for Shogun 2) is an example of a ""saga"" title (limited scale and scope, and CA/Sega's re-labeling of it later as a stand alone game), this is actually nonsensical. Actually, Shogun 1 and 2 themselves are ""saga"" titles by their own limited scope/scale, and FoTS is a DLC expansion of Shogun 2, as it was released. But unless you bought Shogun 2 much later after it was released, you paid full price for it despite it only covering Japan, and despite it only covering factions that all essentially have the same units, and despite all the factions having the same (none) special mechanics, and despite there being very little ""replayability"" (going by the popular rationale of what constitutes replayability among other reviewers - which apparently is every faction having completely different mechanics). It is as if people expect nothing short of a life changing experience for a TW game in order to justify at full price now, regardless of development time and resources spent, or else they will take a big ol' steaming poo poo on the game, going into it totally negative. It's a ridiculous position and argument.

To me, the ""saga"" label is not about pricing, it is more about the SCALE of the campaign, to let you know what to expect (higher detail, but smaller scale, versus lower detail but broader scale). In many cases, just because a game covers more area and factions does not mean it's better nor should be more expensive (see Empire Total War for a world spanning game that wasn't as good as the more narrowly focused Napoleon DLC for it). Arguably, the best Total War titles have been the smallest scale, more narrow focused (Shogun 1&2, Napoleon, Troy (yeah, I said it), and IMO Pharaoh). My prediction is that CA (likely Sega) backed themselves into a corner when they created the ""saga"" label, and that we will likely never see that label again, realizing it. But let's talk about game play...

After several hours of playing at review time, I was still discovering new mechanics, which was actually surprising. There is a worthwhile amount of substance and depth to digest and figure out. It seems like CA Sofia have finally been released to really evolve game-play in substantial ways, rather than re-skinning previous game engines. Yes, Pharaoh is set in essentially the same time period of Troy (by how many CENTURIES it is in the same exact time period is debatable - but most sources put Troy about 200-300 years before Pharaoh, but we don't exactly know). Yes this means that some of the units are the same (mainly from Memnon's faction in Troy), being a historical game after all, but there are many more units and the feel of the game is nowhere near the same emphasis (Troy being a more narrowly focused campaign on myth and epic heroes (personal combat), while I'd say Pharaoh is more focused on the Bronze Age's superpowers and strategic situation in general).

When directly comparing it to Troy, Pharaoh has more strategic depth and layers to it, such as the nice Egyptian Court mechanic (that I hope gets expanded later), which provides powerful benefits and is actually interesting (think of something similar to the Rome 2 Emperor Edition's senate and intrigue). Then there is a detailed civil war mechanic that causes interesting tension, potentially forcing significant changes to the strategic situation. The Outpost feature adds another layer on top of the usual TW mundane settlement construction. Then there is also a mechanism that models the rise and decline of civilizations in the Bronze Age (Pillars of Civilization).

One complaint that I see people have is that they feel like the campaign is too narrative, like too much RPG elements -- WRONG. I am sorry, but this is the exact thing I like about it, which makes it feel more personal. You aren't just expected to take X number of settlements, you have a multitude of paths to victory, through Victory Points. How you get there is up to you. This is one of the best things about what CA Sofia has done consistently - offering up a different experience than the usual unimaginative ""total conquest"" type objectives in other TW games. Troy was a personal favorite in this regard, because it essentially told the story of the Iliad.

This is not to say that Troy or Pharaoh is better than the other game; both are two different experiences if you allow yourself to explore both in detail. That said, taking everything into account one can certainly consider Pharaoh an evolution of Troy (in that it shares the same broad time period and some units, sure), but both provide their own experience, and writing it off as identical is a ridiculous oversimplification of both games. It would be like making the claim that Rome 2 and Attila are the same experience.

As far as a few worthy feature mentions, it cannot be understated that the new campaign customization feature is a leap forward in the right direction, allowing you to tailor the campaign to fit your personal tastes, rather than requiring a mod to do most of that. I would personally like them to add more settings to this over time (like controlling XP gain rate for your and AI generals), but it is definitely a huge step in the right direction which should be carried over into all future TW titles.

Additionally, a new unit size of ""Extreme"" is now available, allowing units to be even larger than the previous largest ""Ultra"" size, which now goes a long way to making the battles feel more realistic, right out of the gate (where-as arguably other TW games require battle mods to feel right). Also, units seem to have more abilities (those special-tactic buttons you press to give them a certain behavior or stance), which feels nice.

The negatives to me are that, as usual, CA decides to make the ""blood"" an add-on, and possibly paid, thing. You kind of need it, not to revel in gore, but to easily see which units are causing ""damage"" to each other, otherwise you can't really see who is having an effect and where the combat is the most intense. This is probably the most egregious thing about what CA does, but hopefully they will give it away free, like I believe they did with Troy in an update (from what I recall). Another negative is that the multiplayer doesn't support the same robust approach of WH3, where you can play with more than two players in a free-for-all (where basically everyone is playing the actual campaign, not some coop or forced head to head). When you set the bar CA, you should enforce it in all games from that point forward.

But really what it comes down to when recommending TW: Pharaoh is...

‚úÖFirst and foremost a matter of whether you are either interested in the Bronze Age, or are interested in learning obscure history, or are a veteran TW player that welcomes variety in setting, rather than the 2nd or 3rd iteration of the same time period again and again. Subjective, but for me this is an easy yes.
‚úÖDo you have the capability to recognize that just because TW:Pharaoh is set in the Bronze Age (which is a period that covers ~ 2000 years for crying out loud), doesn't mean that it is the exactly the same game as Troy? I believe I addressed this above.
‚úÖThen after that, it is a simple question of: Does TW: Pharaoh expand on the TW series experience enough to make it a stand-alone game? Without a doubt, yes for me; you can easily spend hundreds of hours here.

If any of those are an ‚ùå for you, then wait until the game goes on sale and try it out.

‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖBut most importantly, above all else, in the year 2023 they decided to go with ""BC"" for dates instead of the revisionist-history woke-Marxist ""BCE"". Chad move.

I am happy to say that this is one of those titles where I completed a campaign victory, solely because the late stage game is good! 

There are good criticisms of the game, and a lot of that has to do with the modern total war and the aging engine. This series really needs a good reboot and refreshment from the Warscape engine, as well as going back to a gritty, realistic, setting.

You don't need to wait for bad public order anymore, in this game, there is no player agency. At all. 20 stacks just randomly pop up and attack your settlements. But CA is intelligent and balanced it: They can also spawn clsoe to enemy cities. Then, those nomad armies attack the armies you send to invade your neighbour.

Everything in this game wants you to stop playing the game. CA doesn't even try to solve anti-player bias anymore: They doubled down on it.

I have started playing total war series since Shogun 1 and I really enjoy it.  Pharoah has brought many interesting ideas from earlier titles and put them together for a great game.  Yes, it is very similar to Troy but that is because Troy is a good title to build upon.  Medieval Total War was built on top on Rome too.  

In terms of unit diversity, it is actually very significant.  Each Leader has a limited but unique roster but once you added on the regional units, the diversity is great.  There are moments where my northern forces were fighting in Egypt and I lost my Canaanite sellswords,  I then have the choice of hiring local Egyptians, or had to send reinforcements all the way from Canaan as the local egyptian forces cannot cut it.

The road from Turkey/Hatti to Egypt is long and it is a pain to send forces up and down the map.  That's why CA introduce the outpost system which mitigate the issue somewhat.  While I know youtube reviewers complain of this being too powerful, i personally think they do not play the game extensively enough to appreciate how important it is.  And honestly it is not as if a unit can travel from Upper Egypt to Turkey in a turn of two.  Nope you need more than 10 turns to make the journey, despite having outposts.

Yes it is true that court mechanics and religion mechanics are not crucial and you can choose to avoid it.  This simply means you have less advantages but i think CA did a fair balance on it.  Players can choose to play it for the bonuses but also can choose to ignore it if they find it too tedious.

I find faction mechanics enjoyable and allow flexibility.  it is unlike Three Kingdoms where often you are forced to advance a certain direction (looking at Lu Bu and Sun Ce in particular).  when playing as Ramses, i can choose to focus on the war in Asia first and only invade the Delta when I am ready.  I ended my Bay Campaign with more Turkish (Hittie) lands that Egyptian lands even though I am Pharoah.

Unit Variety:
While the game does not have the unit diversity of Rome or Medieval each faction is distinct enough that you can tailor your army and commander to a wide variety of tactics.  This is helped by being able to recruit regional units as well as the ones unique to your faction.  

Map Size:
The map is decent, while its a relatively small area of the world the scale is appropriate.  Starting as Amenmesse I am currently 80 turns in and am only just now reaching the Canaanites.  Would like to see the map expanded east and west.

Economy:
I am really liking the division of resources.  Its fairly easy to set up 10 year trade deals to get whatever you need early on and forces you to think ahead on who you can afford to field an army against.  That said, once you have a large enough territory the need to trade is gone, fielding 3 to 4 stacks of your best units without going into the red is not very difficult.  

Battle:
This has always been my favorite part of Total War games and Pharaoh is no exception.  Yes, there is no cavalry, yes some units could be better balanced, and yes I would like more unique factions units.  But for what it does have it plays well.  I have found it quite satisfying running battles with both of my main armies, one as a stack of nothing but Kushite Armoured Archers and the other as 1/2 chariots, 1/4 archers, 1/4 spears.",1699857716,1699886284,True,5,0,0.483365446329116821,0,True,False,False

To Whom it May Concern,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently had the chance to experience Pharaoh Total War, and I couldn't help but feel compelled to share my thoughts with you. As an avid fan of the Total War series, I was genuinely excited about the prospect of a game set in ancient Egypt, a period rich with history and strategic possibilities. However, after spending some time with Pharaoh Total War, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was more of a rehash of previous Total War titles rather than a groundbreaking addition to the series.

It's disheartening to see a game with so much potential fall short of expectations. The studio seemed to have opted for a makeover rather than seizing the opportunity to introduce fresh and innovative gameplay elements. Pharaoh Total War gave off a distinct sense of d√©j√† vu, as if I were replaying older Total War games with a different skin.

What's more disappointing is the pricing strategy for Pharaoh Total War. Charging fans $70 for what essentially feels like the same game with a facelift raises concerns about the studio's commitment to delivering value to its dedicated player base. It leaves me wondering if the decision was driven more by profit margins than by a genuine desire to offer a unique and memorable gaming experience.

I believe that Creative Assembly has the talent and resources to create truly groundbreaking Total War titles. The historical setting of ancient Egypt had the potential to introduce innovative mechanics, captivating storytelling, and strategic depth that could have set Pharaoh Total War apart from its predecessors. Sadly, it feels like the studio opted for the safe route instead of taking creative risks.

As a fan, I sincerely hope that future Total War releases will embrace innovation and take the series in exciting new directions. The Total War community deserves games that not only meet but exceed their expectations. I'm optimistic that Creative Assembly can rise to the challenge and deliver experiences that captivate and inspire fans.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on Pharaoh Total War. I'm hopeful that the studio will consider constructive feedback from the community and use it to drive future developments in the series.

My review comes after a Ramses campaign where I achieved an ultimate victory after defeating the Sea People and becoming Pharaoh. The campaign mechanics and innovations are fantastic. The barter economy works great and makes for a challenging start until you get the hang of it or acquire plenty of resource rich regions. The court is fun to play around with and manipulate, and the Pharaoh buffs and unique actions are great (but hard to know how to use since there is no tutorial and you instead have to rely on eagle eyes to find new icons on the randomly placed around the UI). Choosing between the huge variety of different gods for various buffs and advantages was also a great touch and helped bring the setting to life. 

Most of my frustrations came in the battles, especially in settlements where the AI gets wonky and units (especially chariots) flat out refuse to follow orders: such as getting stuck, refusing to move, getting pulled out of a fight, yet randomly returning to it just to die, and sometimes just deciding to do their own thing. 

Strategically the battles are slower paced than the past few entries, and the ai seems to cheat a bit by always being able to walk right through your lines, yet are somehow also able to block every conceivable route to the victory points dashing all hopes of a quick victory and forcing you to settle in for a slog. 

Presentation wise though, the battles look fantastic, the weather effects are awesome, and both the campaign and battles absolutely nail the look and feel of Ancient Egypt. 

I love the concept behind legitimacy and civil wars to earn the throne, however I grew extremely frustrated when I finally launched a civil war to take the crown towards the end of my campaign (Turn 140ish). After a blitz against the ruling Pharaoh it was obvious I would win the contest with 300+ legitimacy points and my nearest rival with 111. However every time the civil war countdown reached 2 turns, another pretender who had absolutely no hope of winning, would join the war, extending the countdown back to 5, or sometimes even 8 additional turns. What should have been the final triumphant bow on an awesome campaign became an obnoxious grind. 

Ultimately I enjoyed the campaign despite some of its flaws, I hope CA does not abandon this game, and it would be a travesty if they do not add the Assyrians considering a major part of the setting is the collapse of the Hittites.",1699238649,1699238649,True,51,3,0.680705428123474121,0,True,False,False

- feels vanilla-y compared to TW-Warhammer series for obvious reasons (the game needs more orcs); and
- smaller map but it seems like they've left room for expansion.

-Unit variation (bling bling and feel): There are unit variation, one of the new features with this game is local units, meaning, if you take a settlement in another cultural sphere, you'll unlock more, often ethnic/tribal, units. However that said, there are no puking frogs or cavalry. 
-Tactical depth (the actual tactical weight and play of units): If warhammer is high on the unit variation scale, but low on the tactical depth scale (magic destroys armies, armies are there to die basically and look good doing it), 3K the opposite low unit variation, high tactical depth (elephants, defenders of earth, etc.), then Pharaoh is in my opinion more in the middle with both, OK in unit variation and tactical depth.
-Battles: the biggest downside with the battlefields are that they're small and their big at the same time, big enough to do the job, but not as big as they should be imo. While on the other hand the terrain matters more now then previously. Some have said everybody suffers the same from terrain and weather effects, which isn't true. In order for them to matter, you have to exploit them. You need to look at the enemy army before going into battle and ruthlessly position your army, fight and maneuver so that you get the gain. Also what plays into this is how you build your armies, if you mix and match units too much all this exploiting will become harder. Say if you have an army where all units are immune to desert effects and there's a desert-storm, the enemy isn't desert friendly, now you will have an advantage if you take it.
Battles imo are ok, there's both good and bad in them.
-Sieges: Their a lot more fun now, as the defender, the capture points are way more important now. Unlike 3K I can't just let the enemy in, let the enemy get attrition by the towers and defend the centre. Now your army gets penalties for every lost capture point. That means upgrading a settlement to have more units is often more important for the defending side, too few units means your exposed to flanking and losing those capture points and thus losing the siege. As the attacker you really need to get in there, try to attack the defenders from the sides, you also need to weigh options do you deploy your best units first or last. Also building and employing siege equipment is more akin to some older tw. If you fail as the attacker in these you might end up getting out-grinded and lose.  

[b]Graphics:[/b] Oh boy, this game is true eye-candy. The graphics are not only that, but also authentic historically speaking, it shows the the team has read some books. As an example, the gods in-game could have been taken from a wall paining in a Pyramid and the characters cloth and style is also what I've read they where. Oh and the weather effects look cool in battles.

[b]Map(s):[/b] It's both big and small. Small in the sense that it covers most of modern Anatolia, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt and norther Sudan. However, the way it's implemented is imo perfect. There are lot's of provinces, settlements, and outposts. It will take planning and time to take provinces. There are 72 factions at start, that's pretty high, though not quite Immortal Empires 270+, but then again, Warhammer also started small and built up to the immortal empires after years. So the map feels big, strategic and immersive. Egypt is no longer pieced into 4 bulky regions like in Medieval 2.

[b]Lore:[/b] Look up End of the 19th Dynasty for Egypt and Fall of the Hittite Empire on Wikipedia for more info. Ramesses III should not have been the game's poster boy, but otherwise good representation.

[b]Heroes:[/b]  Hallelujah, no heros.

[b]Unit size:[/b] It's not quite historical 250 men/company, but close enough imo. Some militia units go up-to 240, while most mainline will be around 160-ish.

[b]AI:[/b] Not seen anything game breaking yet, if those bugs exist their not too common. Overall, I would say the AI isn't able to outsmart me, but it can defeat me by overrunning me. Even at normal difficulty and especially in early game. The AI is a little better than in Early access imo. I lost my 3 first campaigns because I made dumb economical choices or stayed too passive at start and got butt-f-ed by the AI. Now I learned and I'm slowly becoming top dog.

[b]Diplomacy:[/b] I feel this is one of the areas of greatest improvement in the game. I have to interact with the court to gain certain benefits and trade resources to stay afloat and avoid attrition. 

[b]Economy:[/b] There's the Troy resource system, which I honestly didn't like in Troy. In Pharaoh however I absolutely like it. In Troy I felt the AI sent me resource deals that where just bad, but sent deals only that there would be some interaction between the player and AI. The resources didn't either matter as much, you could get the resources you needed pretty quickly without trading just by taking and developing settlements. In contrast, Pharaoh you actually need certain resources or your start is GG. The game is much better balanced resource-wise and you actually need to trade to gain grain to avoid attrition or similar. The AI also offers you more seldom deals and when it does the deals are actually useful, say you had tried to find said grain in your turn, you hit end turn and then you get a substantial grain deal, though also where you have to pony-up something less needed in return.

[b]Religion, Court and Legacies:[/b]  Oh my, never did I pay attention to this in any other TW, religion is just something in the background. Now there is a Legacy of Akhenaten that allows you to combine the effects of all the gods. Otherwise you can build shrines to certain gods, as Irsu you can worship El as an example, the same El as in Isra-E-L. There are a trade legacy which allows you to send trade convoys and buy/sell resources like a true capitalist, there are a warrior legacy that helps you take settlements with other things, Hittite legacies to help you out with vassals and so forth. All this allows you to completely customise your play and that adds replayability. Thats just with vanilla, traditionally I've added to replayability with mods in other TW. The amount of choice is to me really immersive. The court system also creates a feel that there is one Egyptian realm that your part of, you have to interact with the sitting Pharaoh, can create inter-Egyptian alliances and get dragged into a war when someone else wants to claim the throne, which can be a disadvantage or advantage to you.

[b]Sound system:[/b] The sound system reminds me of Rome 1 tbh, it's not the same, but the immersion of it. The Music is ok, not the best.

[b]Linux:[/b] With patch 1.0.1, works out-of-box

[b]Summary[/b] 
All-in-all I would give this game a 8/10 with it's weakest part being in the tactical field, such as small battle maps, but the strategic and grand strategic fields being where it shines the most with it's legacies and economy. In coming dlc I hope CA Sofia will expand on the maps section, both bigger battle maps and new regions on the campaign map, such as Assyria & Babylon.

For the most part Pharaoh was an enjoyable game. Was it worth the price? Maybe/maybe not. Normally I rate games by if I get 1 hour of enjoyable gameplay per $1 I paid, then it's an okay game. 2 hours per $ is a good game, and 3+ hours is a great game.

It took me 52 hours to paint the map, but that was with a lot of autoresolved battles. I assume I'll play the game again at some point, so eventually it might get to a good game, especially if more mods come out for it.

The battles were okay. Just basic flanking and trying to get lucky with a chariot charge on a line of archers or the back of the regular troops.

The AI, especially when it came to the outposts, was atrociously stupid. As soon as an outpost was destroyed I'd immediately rebuild it, and the AI would attack it again. It was how I would lure the AI into range of my armies.

Pretty much the only thing I used the court mechanic for was to get the extra armies from the commander and the Viceroy. It was VERY handy when an enemy was threatening one of my cities to be able to hire a general, and to immediately be able to deploy a large army. Kind of like WH3 VC's being able to raise an army of the dead on the fly, but these troops were top tier troops.

I selected the ancient legacy thing where you can get the extra reinforcements when you are attacking the cult centers. That was okay early in the game, when getting 5 or 6 mid tier troops on a siege battle were VERY helpful, but by mid game I was ignoring it. Most capital territories were taken by 2 stacks and autoresolved. There was one battle when the enemy had a stack of 20, plus 14 in the territory, plus another 7 from a fort. In that battle the extra troops were very handy.

I didn't do much with the religion aspect. I would build shrines as outposts randomly, but that was about it.

One suggestion for anyone who plays, get the city of Mennepeh, (or whatever it's called). The cult center right next to where the delta begins. In addition to good headgear, it gives you +1 recruitment slots in every settlement, +7 to generals levels. It was one of the last cities I took, and I wished I would have taken it first.

The one thing about the game that REALLY annoys the piss out of me, is that CA still doesn't have anything to acknowledge that you painted the map! Instead it just keeps throwing those stupid invader armies at you. Even worse is that the ""Ultimate Victory"" thing popped up when I still had 4 or 5 settlements yet to conquer. I wondered what would come after Ultimate Victory, and sure enough, it wasn't anything. This has pissed me off since WH1, and I can't believe CA still hasn't done anything about it.",1698980280,1698980280,True,3,1,0.497975915670394897,0,True,False,False

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this distinction, a few years ago Creative Assembly said moving forwards they would be creating two main types of Total War games: Eras and Sagas. Saga games are spin-offs from the main series and the descendants of expansions and stand-alone games like Fall of the Samurai and Napoleon. They are meant to encompass short and geographically limited pivotal points in history. Recently they have included Thrones of Britannia and Troy. Eras games are meant to encompass an entire continents and eras, such as the Sengoku period of Japan or the fledgling nation states beginning the race towards global empires. The distinction between these two types of games is where I have my biggest issues with this title.
It is really clear this was intended as a saga game and there is not enough scope or civilizations to warrant the price. In fact, they‚Äôre pricing it as an Eras game which are the flagship products. I think for this to count as a Bronze age Eras game, they would have at least needed to encompass Greece and Mesopotamia as well. I think it‚Äôs actually quite a shame they‚Äôre pricing this as a main entry because I think it would have sold much better if they had just priced it appropriately. This was exacerbated by the release happening right after a massive pricing controversy with TW WH3 DLC, so the Total War fandom is especially sensitive to pricing issues right now. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what the leadership teams are doing to justify their salaries, because it seems they certainly aren‚Äôt spending much time thinking about their product.
I actually really enjoy this game though. It is really challenging, both in terms of economic management and real-time battles. I had to start about 5 different games before I made it to turn 100 with Amenmesse who can effectively just buy whatever he wants with gold. I was expecting to be safe from the sea peoples, but I still had to fight nomadic tribe incursions and the occasional sea people army that would come down the Nile. The campaign customization is absolutely awesome, even more detailed than TW WH3, and trust me that‚Äôs a good thing because you need to lower upkeep, otherwise you‚Äôll control 4 total provinces and only be able to field 2.5 armies. The political systems feel a lot more thought out and meaningful than they did previously, and the outpost system adds a logistical depth to your planning and development. 
There are some glitches and the AI does seem to be a bit stupid sometimes, but that‚Äôs pretty par for the course and in the grand scheme of things I‚Äôd say this game launched with less glitches than previous titles. 

TLDR: This is a fun, challenging, and intriguing game that‚Äôs priced inappropriately.

Creative Assembly needs to remember that ""good reviews are a privilege, earned by creating good products that are engaging and build upon previous titles and expand on lessons learned from before""

The sad thing is that the developers themselves are more than capable of producing better products than this shit they've served up with this - just look at the Warhammer Total War Trilogy - whilst not every historical lovers cup of tea, was arguably one of the best Total War games released.

I wonder if they just thought people forgot how Troy was allegedly supposed to be a 3 part game series - can't help but feel that Pharaoh was meant to be part 2 of that thread and frankly considering they left the development up to the group that created Troy makes this feel more so to be the truth of the matter.

However, I found in Pharaoh that I could run a deficit in most resources and make the elite armies while keeping afloat through conquest.  The resources need work. I do not know how to balance that out but I do not think it accomplishes it's goal. I always enjoyed total war because of how simple it was, but as I have gotten more experience gaming, I lean to more complicated strategy games.  I have continued to enjoy the games due to the interesting themes but I must say I was a little disappointed in the fewer factions outside of Egypt. In particular the Assyrians and Babylonians.  In all I keep finding myself thinking about the next total war game and how it is going to be.

Pros
- Visuals/Story-Telling: CA Sofia has done an amazing job making this game visually spectacular, from cut scenes to battles and the overall world map as well as the menus. The design and visuals tells all Total War fans one thing, that CA has the ability to create a visually fantastic looking game both on the campaign map and on the battlefield.
- Outposts: Definitely an intriguing feature that I have used even with an hour into my play through, its unique and makes sense for a period of time when such an output could be used. You have the ability to construct 4 of them giving for unique bonuses. If more fleshed out has the potential and ability to be more useful.
- Religion: I like the introduction of religion as religion played a huge role in history. While the introduction of Dieties and Gods are a welcome feature I wish there was more development and immersion regarding the religion/God it is you are associated with. However in a future TW game like Medieval or Empire its amazing how much MORE religion can playout not only in diplomacy but the kind of bonuses/buffs a nation could get for warring with someone of a similar faith vs different OR more interactions with the faith. Religions provide restrictions, they also provide something similar to a Jihad. Something like this would make religion a much more important feature in future TW games
- Combat: Same old, same old. Combat in historical TW games do not change for me. I still get the same enjoyment controlling units and watching as they charge and fight. I definitely enjoy the combat here more than Thrones of Britannia.
- Diplomacy: Is fantastic in the game
- Exploring Egypt, Palestine, Syria and a portion of anatolia from a different view and perspective. 

Cons: 
- Lag/Optimization: I have a RTX 4090, 64 GB RAM, i9 Processor and on High Settings I am getting warnings of less than 30 FPS. CA optimize your games bro
- World Map/Cultural Diversity: You cannot call this a Bronze Age collapse and it barely features any Bronze Age civilizations. The world map is heavily focused on Egypt. And I get the foreshadowing with titling it TW Pharoah and not TW Bronze Age. They should have included Greece, all of Anatolia, all of mesopotemia and then it would have been a true Saga game. But this will more of a Saga of Saga with its limited scope, limited factions and faction/cultural diversity
- Combat: This combat is not only terrible but the animation of enemies dying or getting hit feel and look extremely cartoony. For perspective when troops died or performed combat in Rome 2 or Shogun it was more satisfying especially visually. 
Blood & Gore: No blood or gore, units die like pinballs, its terrible

Grey Areas:
- Unit Diversity: I want to complain about unit diversity but Shogun 2 barely had any and it is one of my favorite total wars. So this is more of a personal complaint
- Price: I enjoy most TW games even the Sagas... except Warhammer  but thats a personal bias again turning my favorite franchise into a fantasy RTS shill (thats a different personal bias). 
a) A $60 price tag for me is justified based on whether I am impressed or excited by a new game, if it included new features for me to enjoy and whether the scope of the game offers replayabilty. While Saga games get a bad credit and it was Thrones of Brit that accredited to that I truly enjoyed playing Troy and plan to play Pharoah as well. 

Ranking? (Based on S-F Tier method against all other TW)
C-Tier: This is better than Thrones but not better than Troy. It does not offer me the same fun I get from playing Napoleon or Empire or Rome 2 and especially not Attila... this is a game that has the potential for S-Tier but felt it was cut short of further development because CA either wants to test the waters with new features or they simply wanted to push something out. If this was a full-blown Bronze Age game with ALL the civilizations and a world map 2-3 times larger, this would be an S-Tier game.

The Total War community at the moment seems to be very negative at the moment, not only towards Pharaoh but Creative Assembly in general. While I am sympathetic to an extent with many of their complaints, the criticism of Pharaoh is - in my opinion at least - unwarranted.
Pharaoh is the first proper historical title for a while,  and also a proper strategy game, which might be a bit off putting for those who have grown accustomed to the rather lightweight War Hammer series. It is a decent challenge on the higher difficulty settings.
While the time period isn't everyone's cup of tea, I would urge people not to be put off by all the negative sentiment around the game. Many of those panning Pharaoh on social media have - I suspect - never even played the game. If you take the time to actually learn the mechanics and the units, you will find that Pharaoh is a good game, which with a few DLC (Mesopotamia and Greece) could be a great game.

Because I'm sure you've read all the cons, so you should realize that they are things completely outside of the dev's control or don't reflect the game's quality. If you think just simply having skins makes a game bad, you need to remember that the core problem of microtransactions is that the company created a problem and is selling you the solution. That's why the ubisoft ""time saver"" cash shop is bad, and that's why pay2win is bad. This isn't that.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[h3] [i] AI [/i] [/h3] 
AI is dumb, but you knew that already if you play TW games. It's much better than Attila and earlier, but it's not much of an improvement from Warhammer. Since all TW have had AI problems it almost seems unfair to criticize this particular game for it, but it is a problem.

[h3] [i] Pricing [/i] [/h3]
SEGA's fault. It's strange that people are this upset about the game costing $60 instead of $50. Games recently went up to $70 and while many were upset (myself included) it wasn't anywhere near the vitriol you'll see here. To deflect from this point people will then claim it should have cost $40 or $30, forgetting that Warhammer 1 and Shogun 2 were $60 with similar scope. Troy was only cheap because it was initially free and Thrones was actually a small scale game.

[h3] [i] Small Scope [/i] [/h3]
I too would have liked to have Greece or at least Mesopotamia added to the region but after playing so much Warhammer I realized that the wide scope was there to hide how little depth was actually in the game. Which leads me to the pros.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[h3] [i] Outpost [/i] [/h3]
For the first time in TW history you can actually catch AI, no ambush needed. Outposts give you 50% of the movement speed you spent getting to it, and some give movement buffs, which let's you quickly rush through a province to attack AI in forced march. The only slight downside was that AI can move after razing an outpost (razing should immediately set movement to 0). That needs to be patched ASAP but modders have already fixed this. Outposts also let you do the Shogun 2 style recruitment because you can recruit a lord, rush to your fort, and pick up the units you stationed there if you need a defensive army in a pinch.

[h3] [i] Unit Cards [/i] [/h3] 
this might seem insignificant, but this is here to point out that CA Sophia is the only dev team that tries to listen to consumer feedback and apply it when possible. People complained about banners and unit cards and they actually took the time to fix this before release. They then added campaign costumization options so people to change the buffs AI gets or the army sizes from 20 units to 10 etc mid campaign.

[h3] [i] Barter [/i] [/h3]
If you liked the resource system in Troy, you'll like it here. The real benefit of this though is that unlike Warhammer, where resources are just passive economy, here they are meaningful. Stone and wood are required for construction, food for all upkeep, bronze for both, and gold for elite units, instant construction, and court intrigue. For added depth, whole sections of the map lack certain resources. Since Egypt has the Nile, the food is plentiful with decent stone, but lack wood. Further south is filled with bronze while Asia minor has dense forests. This means, rather than kill AI and conquer territory which you have to defend, you'd often want to vassalize AI and trade with them for their resources.

[h3] [i] End Game [/i] [/h3]
The crisis here is tied to settlement tier of several key buildings around the map. As you or AI fight over the land, this reduces a pooled bar at the top of the screen which weakens the world and strengthens the rogue factions. This goes from prosperity to crisis to collapse which summons rogue armies in waves per tier, eventually leading to the Sea People. This means your actions on the campaign have purpose. If you plan correctly, you could actually prevent the collapse.

[h3] [i] Court intrigue [/i] [/h3]
Becoming Pharaoh or High King  requires high legitimacy which is gained through battles, territory, ambitions, or court intrigue. The gameplay loop here is gossiping to learn what plots that person is doing or is a victim of and you gain regard with them. Supporting their plots or opposing plots against them improves regard to them while doing the opposite improves regard to whoever is targeting them. This regard can then be used later for a favor, which grants one free use of their council action per court cycle. So in a typical game I'd spend 6 turns spending gold or gossiping to increase regard, then spend the next 6 turns scheming against someone by calling in all my favors to embezzle gold or assassinate someone or discredit them to gain legitimacy. Once it's high enough I can begin a civil war for Pharaoh or High King which unlocks more features.

[h3] [i] Weather [/i] [/h3]
I'm very happy to see weather making a return but I feel like its penalties should be much more severe. There's nothing quite like fighting in the heat and losing since you're heavily armored, only for a thunderstorm to roll in and now give you the advantage. Pharaoh is also the prettiest TW so the spectacle of the wind surging through the grass and shrubs, or the trees bending almost 90 degrees or your units covered in sand and trying to cover their eyes in a sandstorm is quite good here.

[h3] [i] Weapon Variety [/i] [/h3]
Historicals might not have monsters and magic, but the tactics that come out of different weapons is something that shouldn't be understated. You have the traditional spears beats cavalry and swords beats spears, but now you have khopesh which are resistant to flanking, axes which are strong against shields, clubs which are armor piercing, slingers which are good and weakening armor, javelins which are close range AP missiles, and 2H axes which are devastating flankers. I tend to use chariots to quickly rout slingers, but some archers can defeat chariots.

[h3] [i] Legacies [/i] [/h3]
In Egypt there are 4 legacies which provide different mechanics depending on which you pick and it's 1 per campaign. I've only done the merchant one which basically does Cathay caravans, without the battles. You can then plan your route, and actively buy and sell items at different markets once the caravan reaches that city. Cities are usually constant in that they have specific things that are always in high demand and specific things they always sell but they can also randomly contain a couple special items and ancillaries which can buff your provinces back home or give you rare weapons, armor, or mounts for your generals. I found it particularly satisfying to actually have to plan which towns to go to based on what I needed at the time, rather than just always going to the highest gold place in Warhammer.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
The thing is, I can't even remember a Total War game that had all these innovations, especially at launch. Much of the things people like about Warhammer or other RTS games like Stellaris and CK are things added in DLC, yet I've enjoyed what I saw so much in base game that I don't really mind not being able to sail the world. If their DLCs expand the map more and have this much depth in their mechanics, this will easily be the best TW game once it's all done. After the mass layoffs, if CA Sophia gets greenlit for Empire 2 I'll be pleased because I now know this team has what it takes to make that game great.",1698712925,1698713220,True,144,15,0.62114405632019043,12,True,False,False

Pharaoh is another entry in the series which fails to fix any of the fundamental issues with the franchise, but doesn't add anything to make up for it.

The fundamental problem is with the battles. The unit variety is not very good, which is understandable given the setting of the game. But the lack of cavalry or artillery is combined a common problem with all of the TW games: units have really high morale, and will pretty much all fight to the death. This means heavy infantry is king, because every fight becomes about grinding out your opponent. Flanking seems to do nothing - you can have an enemy heavy infantry unit isolated and entirely surrounded, but it can still kill hundreds of lower quality troops without breaking. Chariots are not very good, and the battle maps are just too small to take advantage of them. The enemy battle AI is once again unimpressive.

There are loads of improvements to the campaign map, which are all welcome, but it doesn't matter because the core gameplay of battles isn't good. I feel bad for the developers because a lot of work has gone into this game, and there are plenty of good ideas, but the basic concept of just releasing ANOTHER iteration of the same old systems was doomed from the start. CA cannot keep releasing the same game over and over, they need to go back to the drawing board and rebuild their systems from the ground up.

Stick to Warhammer or the older historical titles.",1698708705,1698708705,False,6,0,0.497571289539337158,2,True,False,False

But this time, the game is firmly set in a historical setting. Pharaoh builds upon Troy and in many ways improves upon this game. I like this game, but some design decisions bring this game down somewhat.

Starting with the negatives, it's a shame that Pharaoh is based upon Troy and not Warhammer III. Warhammer III brought many innovations, in particular regarding the Multiplayer campaign with simultaneous turns for up to 8 players. This is unfortunately not possible in Pharaoh where you cap out at 2 players.
Another negative is the focus on the leaders instead of on the factions. You don't play as Egypt or the Hittites, but as an immortal leader, which might originate from the fact that this game is based upon Troy. This also implies that all factions start with more or less the same amount of regions and you don't have strong empires. As much as heroes make sense for Troy, I would have preferred playing as a faction like in previous games. This is however a minor complaint as you can solve this with mods unlike the multiplayer campaign.

Fortunately, there are also a lot of positives for this game, hence my favourable review. The highlights of this game are the campaign customisation options. You can customise your campaign by choosing to have all equipped fully levelled generals from the start of your campaign, remove AI-diplomacy, or many other choices. This level of control allow to tailor the campaign to your own taste.
Another important factor in my enjoyment of the game is the return to a true historical setting, namely the Bronze Age. This time period is fun with natural disasters, sea peoples invasions and collapse of almost all civilisations of this period. It stays true to the units of this period with infantry and chariots dominating the battlefield. 
Religion is represented by the worship of up to three gods, each god granting specific bonuses. This allows the player to have some flexibility in how he develops his empire. 
Another positive is the outpost system that allows to build amongst others forts that can assist your city in case of a siege. You can choose which units are stationed in the outpost and you are given a substantial discount on their upkeep costs.
Finally, a last important element is the geography which is extremely well represented. The Nile for instance is an important feature allowing you to travel extremely fast which makes it valuable. 

Total War Pharaoh is a good game, it's far from being a perfect game but it's worth a try if you like historical strategy games.",1698707336,1698707488,True,27,5,0.51713031530380249,0,True,False,False

I have yet to be Pharaoh, but I think I've done everything else I can with this faction. All buildings are maxed, God is maxed, level nine tier V units can be recruited anywhere, unlimited resources, nothing left to build, and #2 power ranking behind Tsauret the Pharaoh. By turn 75, I think there would have been little standing in my way. Battles became fairly to ridiculously easy by then, as I was fielding armies of top tier and top trim troops; not much could stop them. 

That being said, the game has been fun. It feels polished. It feels like there's a enough here to give it some longevity. If I give 50 hours to each faction, that should land me on 400 hours of gameplay. That's more than enough value for me. 

Battles have been good, even if the AI is predictable. I'm considering handicapping my next playthrough by limiting army size to 15. That should allow the AI to handle flanking manoeuvres, which is it's Achilles heal in this game. It does feel like it's an improvement over past titles, and similar to my Troy experience. AI Siege defence is competent enough that assaulting settlements without cheesing the AI is a challenge. AI siege assaults are typical of the franchise; AI troops enjoy showering under tower arrows, throwing masses of men through a breach that is held by a spear wall (AI just loves head-on assaults against spear/shield walls in general), but I Will say that pathfinding appears to be much better. 

Overall, this will be a good bang-for-my-buck game. It's pricey, and I get why the masses are upset at the cost. I don't know why it's as expensive as it is, but again, just purely on a value proposition basis, worth it.",1698672071,1698672071,True,3,0,0.451725631952285767,0,True,False,False

I have loved the Total War series ever since Rome in 2004.  Wow almost 20 years.  Total War was always the premiere strategy game in all ways.  

I think it was about Attila (2015) that CA fundamentally changed the game.  Previously you could deploy your army as strategy required.  In the new format you can only have an army attached to a general.  This wipes out dozens of strategies.  

In the new format the way to win is not to have a good strategy.  In the new format, the way to win is to level up your general.

Really good. The music in this game is off the rails. Reforging the Hittite empire to electric guitar with a blend of Mediterranean music is lit af. Its a very polished game. Same old TW problems that Warhammer has, thats the engine and if you are in the know than you know its a technical limitation of tech debt and we wont see anything done about this.

this game is a failure in current state. Surely, you can have fun for a few hours but:

1.	Scope of the game is artificially limited, half of the most important civilizations are not present.
2.	Game factions in a core play the same way all along, once in midgame ‚Äì I have literally no interest to continue.
3.	Legacies are in no way balanced, Canaan doesn't have its own court and legacy at all.
4.	Interesting staff is hidden under 12 turns of the game ‚Äì IDK why, to deny refund? Its hard to play for a first time with manual battles less then 2 hours to unlock court and Legacy.
5.	Battles are basically blobbing without any tactical thought
6.	Pathfinding of units is atrocious ‚Äì most of the time you will deal with trying your troops to move, while they stack on every corner in the town
7.	Chariots are gently slapping enemies ‚Äì to make them hurt you need to edit them or wait for a mod.
8.	Half of datafiles is trashed with old troy datalines
9.	Buyers of Deluxe still unaware what exactly they bought in those DLCs

Yes, Sophia Team made a great work with what they were given. And its not their fault they were given a rotten apple to cook a pie. 
To summarize ‚Äì you will definitely enjoy Pharaoh, if you love Bronze Age as much as I do. But I I had a second thought ‚Äì I would buy this game ONLY on sales or with heavy discount.

On one hand, the game itself is good (I still would not call it a good Total War game) and I can appreciate the effort CA Sofia has put in it. On the other hand, for every single thing done right, there are at least two things done wrong - a good example is the setting itself; while I enjoy the Late Bronze Age collapse period and CA Sofia presented it well, there are a few things missing from it (most notably, Ancient Mesopotamia and Mycenaean Greece; the Achaean faction only uses Canaanite units instead of unique ones). The particular resource management system in Pharaoh does not fit a Total War game - you either constantly struggle with trying to work out some deals with other factions in order to temporarily stop the resources from bleeding out or become a self-sufficient faction, rarely even going for deals. The Sea Peoples, a somewhat essential element of the game, quickly turn into a frustrating nuisance, forcing you to constantly micromanage your armies in order to protect your settlements from being razed. Thankfully, you can at least turn them off with the campaign customisation settings - something I have to massively respect CA Sofia for adding.

While the new additions for the battles in the form of dynamic weather and armor degradation spice things up a bit, the battles stay actually the same - collisions not working as they should, which consequentially makes units unable to fulfill your orders sometimes. The impact of the morale is not as hard as it was in the previous games, even though I constantly use flanking tactics (and morale debuff abilities). I would even argue that armor degradation makes battles even slower than they previously were. All of this is both boring and somewhat irritating, up to the point where I just go for the auto-resolve whenever I know I will win without heavy losses, something which should not happen for a game that hails from a franchise known for its real time battles.

If this was a Saga title sold for a lower price, perhaps I would be more lenient in regards to the game itself, but this is supposed to be a ""historical Total War"", which unfortunately makes it nothing else but an overpriced disappointment. I do not recommend getting the game at the full price, of course, but if it ever goes on a sale, buy it only if you really wish to try out the game.

In many aspects it is better than Troy, by a wide margin. I do think the campaign is a bit confusing, and the provice buildings UI is just terrible (seriously, bring back the colour-coded icons), but overall there's clearly a degree of polish and love from the dev team that made this (I think only 3K is more detailed). In battles, unit control is really smooth  (though chariots remain as BS as ever) and some of the new mechanics have proven interesting considering that battles are mostly variations of infantry fights.
Buuuut... I cannot ignore some aspects:

1) This feels more like a Saga TW. Is not quite there, but it just doesn't FEEL as grandiose as Rome 2, 3K, Attila or even Medieval 2.

2) The lack of cavalry units in a TW game REALLY hurts. I understand the limitations of the time period, but yeah... not having hammer and anvil tactics feels like a cheap way to make battles last longer... Compare to 3K, where heavy shock cav can destroy an army when properly used, and even the broken chariots don't really feel as satisfying.

3) The company drama. CA needs to sort their PR #### out, otherwise I'll just refuse to give them my money in future installments of the series, as will many others.

Pharaoh is a good game, just not what we wanted tbh. It does have a lot of content, but it's rather repetitive, with a campaign that doesn't feel satisfying. Too many complex mechanics that amount to no big difference. Battles are interesting, but nowhere near as fun as 3K or Rome 2. It's a polished game, but one that feels... boring.

Visually, for the eye, it's such a pleasure to look at in the campaign game. 10/10 for this, campaign and UI are fabulous and I love how it looks. 

But underneath the hood, it's just disappointing. Warscape game engine which is used since Empire Total War is 15 years old now, what can you expect from it? Ultra modern graphics and animations? No, not really, it's 15 years old. In development terms, it's rather old, and no matter how much you improve it, you need something new. From the ground up. The new mechanics made in the game are rather interesting but the outpost system, while on paper is great, just adds more battles to fight because it's easy targets for the AI to go for. You need to maintain a very close watch on every border, and with limited resources & armies this is not particularly enjoyable to work with. 

One thing that bothered me very much is the price. It's not justifiable at all. This is not a game that is AAA, it's not as big as a major title, it's esentially a Saga title. It's way too expensive.

But Pharaoh is a really. good. TW game. CA Sofia once again did a great job. It's simply interesting to play (""one more turn"" symptom for me). 

- Game is polished and well optimised (no crashes, runs smoothly on my becoming-a-mediocre PC build).
- Beautiful art, UI and sound design.
- Trading system from Troy - I loved it and I works great here. I hope it will be a standard for the next generation of TW games.
- New and remastered features like dynamic weather, kingdom legacies, regions with native units, outpost system, gods - this all works so good. Workforce and how it balances population happiness and recruitment pool. In terms of game design game is all just really well made and all these systems interconnected and works well with each other.
- Once again about religion system and selectable gods - I hope this also will be a new standard for TW (maybe like cults of saints and various heresies in Christianity in the inevitable Medieval 3) . Even without fantasy elements it feels good now (and I hope maybe CA will release something like ""Mythos"" add-on, as they made for Troy)
- Customizable campaign elements - basically you can make game that fits you best. You don't like Sea People invasions? - turn them off. Want to maximize attrition to make traversing the desert _really_ painful? - also possible. I love it.
- Units and cultures are kind of close to Shogun 2 idea - they are not that multiple in variations, but each has some clear role with weight, armor class and weapon.

What I miss and dislike:
- Research tree is difficult to navigate and understand. Maybe it would be better to replace it with some other more engaging mechanic (something like ambition choice or suggested reforms from a council)
- Agents - it seems CA trying to remove them completely. Probably, outpost and gods dedication system were intended to replace them, but they are fun to play + useful for scouting.
- Some form of character interactions or Dynasty family tree. It's kind of hidden in the plain sight that all main characters of Egyptian faction are relatives to each other (two half-brothers, one sister-waifu, one cousin). Also, it would be fun to killed family members or Merneptah (I am not joking, tombs of fallen pharaohs and kings could be a nice touch and unique outposts on the map)

I really hope CA Sofia will continue to support this game for long. And UK-based CA can learn a lot from the Sofia team.   I play TW games for 20+ years, from Shogun 1 - and Pharaoh gives me hope that despite CA's latest screw-ups with WH3.

Does it share similarities with Troy? Yes. Is it just a reskin of Troy? No. Certainly no more so than Medieval 2 was Rome reskinned, Napoleon was Empire reskinned or Attila was Rome 2 reskinned.

Is it a Saga title in disguise? Maybe. The ""Saga"" subtitle is somewhat poorly defined and honestly at this point probably a mistake by CA as its hard to specify that something is ""smaller in scope"" without implying that it's also ""smaller in effort"". This game covers a relatively small part of the world, over a relatively short time frame and in that sense it is a Saga game but it does feel more expansive and ambitious than either Troy or Throne of Britannia which came before it. Time will tell how much the setting of Pharaoh grows as more factions are added to the game (and to that end I hope that CA continues to support it). 

The battles feel more visceral and more strategic compared to Troy, closer to an older historical title with less emphasis on stacking stat bonuses and more focus on manoeuvring units and using the terrain. Similar to Troy the distinction between Light, Medium and Heavy infantry plays a greater role compared to past historical titles but doesn't compensate for the lack of cavalry, artillery and other more unique unit types which make battles more interesting in the later time periods. 

On the campaign side, the multi-resource economy from Troy makes a return but feels less punishing. Some settlements are capable of producing multiple resource types and diplomacy feels a bit a more reliable for exchanging what you have for what you need. Other mechanics which at face value seem to have been copied straight across from Troy have also been refined and improved, the Gods system for example is more expansive, less micro-management intensive and feels better integrated into the setting whilst other mechanics (Court positions, Outposts, Ancient Legacys, Regional Recruitment) are also positive additions which make Pharaoh feel unique compared to any other Total War. The only step back compared to Troy is that the uniqueness between the different factions (at least those of the same culture) is less stark and really comes down to faction unique units, unique buildings and starting deity rather than high level faction specific mechanics.

If you're a big fan of older historical Total War titles I think you'll get much more out of Pharaoh than Troy and I'd recommend it to you. If you enjoy Troy for the time period, the campaign mechanics and the return to a historical setting I'd recommend Pharaoh to you. If you enjoy Troy for the characters and the mythic units or if you enjoy TW Warhammer mostly for the faction asymmetry and varied unit types it offers then I'd maybe think twice before diving into Pharaoh.",1698409381,1698409381,True,3,0,0.468609869480133057,0,True,False,False

The strategic level has lots of great features (outposts, legacies, variety in how to build out your cities and unique buildings), although the court specifically feels a bit tacked on (I like it in and of itself, it just doesn't tie in with whats going on in the rest of the world).

Coming from Warhammer, the combat is slower and less dramatic (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, depending on your tastes/mood), but there is a surprising amount of depth in army composition and tactical options available to the Bronze Age roster. It's not Warhammer-level diverse, but they did a good job differentiating the troop types so it doesn't just feel like throwing waves of generic infantry at each other.

My only real complaint is the scope of cultures. The scale is large (in terms of land area and number of provinces), but at the price point I really would have liked to see Mycenaean Greece in the west and at least Assyria if not also Kassite Babylon in the east, which would have really made the map feel fully fleshed out. Even the Canaanite and Hittite factions share some Egyptian ""mechanics"" and feel a bit tacked on as a result.

Update: After 102 hours of playtime my initial 5.5 hour review still stands. I would like to add that I found a faction and character I loved playing as but due to lack of content my own ""immersion"" was stolen/lost. Bey and the Cannanite faction have to either choose a Hittite legacy or an Egyptian legacy. In a nutshell this tree path gives access to either Royal Egyptian units or Royal Hittite units along with other aggressive or passive bonuses depending on your limited choice you choose to pursue. All-in-all this won't seem like much but for me personally I'm all about the ""immersion"" value I can find in the Total War series. They have a fully intact Caananite Gods tree but not their own legacy I mean come on geez. Once I played as Bay I relished their light Vanguard units and their light Syrian archers which are the ""best of the cheapest"" archers that cost bronze upkeep so I instantly loved the playstyle the faction presented. Until after around a dozen turns, then BOOM your given the option to choose a legacy and it's only Egyptian or Caananite. So immediately I was dismayed; I know I know a little OCD of me but this is my own personal review. For example in Rome 2 my immersion vector finally steered to Epirus as my single player campaign choice. So this alone after 102 hours has ruined the game for me personally. If they correct this silly mistake, then I will gladly come back and play more Pharoah until Medieval 3. Also, historical accuracy isn't a valid or logical reasoning point for not including a Caananite specific legacy path because even the Caananite/Bay narrative intro view of the map talks about the ""Caananite"" people so my mind was blown and my immersion was diminished.  Would like to add that they are apparently mass banning people on Steam via the Pharoah community forum thread for bad reviews and actual condemnations/complaints for the failure of Pharoah (or the lack of content within I reckon). Just give us back Total War: Arena on Steam and a lot of the older players will be content because we don't and we won't go fly Gryphons or play as witch doctors in the goofy Warhammer series!",1697079107,1698365937,False,10,0,0.423442691564559937,0,True,False,False

Pros.
Many Different Cultures. I count 4 major and at least 3 minor (lots of different people to fight)
Battles. THE BEST BATTLES in a TW title. I have never seen so many individual soldiers actively fighting in a TW
Soldiers in units seem to have their own mind. unit cohesion is hard to maintain and easy to exploit.
The AI is a #$%#er. Smartest AI in any TW. They will stop at nothing to flank you.

Cons
Becoming king/Pharaoh in either kingdom is not very challenging and can be obtained early with easy prioritization
Once you become king/pharaoh that's about it. you can try to conquer the other kingdom or just defend against endless waves of sea peoples.

First, labour capacity is added to building requirements. In essence, it replaces the old population requirement for the main building chain. Second, all settlements have outposts sites on which one may build a variety of building types that confer boni if interacted with - for a limited time. This seems quite nice, but eventually it becomes a bit of a chore. Especially the bonus that confers a 20% discount to army upkeep is quite relevant but also a recurring interaction that ultimately is just busy work. 

There is also a court. This may be the weakest part of the game. I wouldn't miss it if it weren't there and it is perfectly possible to win the game on top campaign settings whilst ignoring the court completely. However, if one does decide to actively interact with this part of the game: add another few clicks per turn. Busy work is, sadly, a bit of a theme. 

On to the good stuff. Various factions have decidely different flavours and truly different units, even though they are of the same class. The best thing is that as one progresses through the game one gets access to the so called native units. In effect, the more one captures, the more one's roster expands. This means that army composition remains an interesting aspect throughout the game. 

Due to the variety of resources required to keep things running, the economy also remains an interesting factor for most of the game. It also means trade is a very relevant part of the game. Furthermore, if you want to hurt an opponent, taking out key resources is a valid road to victory. Vice versa, if one does not defend their own key resources bad things will happen.

Based on my first full, ultimate victory playthrough with Seti these are my thoughts on the game:
Campaign is probably one of the most fun I've played in a total war game in a while; definitely an improvement from Troy. Outposts add a layer of planning at the province level that I've felt lacking even as far back as the earlier titles. Properly setting up outpost structures can boost resources, provide logistics chains for armies, and provide a stronger defense depending on how exactly you set them up. Suddenly raiding armies can be that much more annoying as they pillage outposts and more seriously injure your engine in that area. 

The campaign map itself also had surprisingly more depth than I expected. The wide open stretches of the Western Desert favor speedy generals, proper pre-positioning, and attrition resistance lest your armies arrive too late or too exhausted from forced marches to intercept Libu raids on your valuable gold and bronze settlements. Meanwhile the Nile itself is a super highway flanked by walled food producing cities; which becomes especially important because enemy armies might suddenly teleport themselves from own province to another. I can only hope a future expansion adds the arabian desert and Mesopotamia to multiply this dynamic further. 

Sea Peoples invasion is a fun challenge in the mid-late game. A steady stream suddenly explodes into multiple strong armies bearing down on you. As Seti I didn't find it *that* difficult to deal with the invasions; albeit I had several buffer states between me and the coast and I'd become Pharaoh (with the requisite royal units) by the time the invasions got really serious.

Court shenanigans are a fun layer of chrome tho I wouldn't consider it a super decisive aspect of the game. Granted I played as the penultimate 'ignore the court' character in Seti (starting up a Bay run as I write this). That said some positions could be pretty useful; particularly vizier, first commander, and treasurer. Tho some intrigues like the one where you steal legitimacy feel like it pays out too little for the amount of time you have to wait for it to activate.

Building up legitimacy is itself a fun sub-game if becoming pharaoh (or high king I suppose) is your thing. You have to sacrifice outpost slots for legitimacy producing monuments and/or go on targeted conquests to eliminate rivals or seize specific lands. It honestly felt very thematic to the period and I enjoyed my machinations to successfully beat out my half brother in the south for the spot in the Great House.

I'll end off with my thoughts on the battles themselves; it's a total war game. I know some would strongly disagree, but if you've played other total war games you'll find this one little different. Have better units or have more charge-y units to envelope the enemy's flanks and rout their army. I do think the battlefields are too cramped for bow chariots to really make their advantages felt so I mostly resorted to just using them as charge-y bois (which they are quite good at). Ranged units seem to have much lower range than, for example, Troy so that does add an interesting dynamic in their usage. The hold/advance stances add an interesting element I'd love to explore further but idk how much their impact actually is considering they're often on the elite units anyway. 
Sieges haven't truly worked for me in any total war game and this one is no different. You fight on the walls and if you lose there you lose the battle, whether attacking or defending. The capture points are a neat touch but they really only matter in settlement battles where the enemy already has multiple open paths they can attack from. IDK maybe I just haven't discovered the 'right' way of fighting walled sieges. The settlement designs also feel kinda derivative (and every settlement being surrounded by hills feels weird); but my opinion would change if it turns out they based them on the actual city excavations.
 
There's more I could say but I probably should try out some of the other factions (hello Bay!) to really get a sense of how the different mechanics work together. I do recommend this game and while it may not be a ""true,, total war title in terms of scale it is a very functional and, I would say, very fun game.",1698164448,1698164448,True,10,1,0.502004802227020264,0,True,False,False

There aren't many 4x games that have real time battles on the scale of Total War, but that isn't enough to convince me to keep playing Pharaoh, or really any other Total War for that matter.  The formula is stale.

I appreciate Sofia trying to add the outpost system, but it just becomes one more thing to babysit as the AI constantly sacks and raises them.  The court is an annoying minigame that doesn't help immerse me in the setting at all.  The playable characters look great, but they have no personality.  At least in TWW3, each of the lords have some flavor to them.  A lot of the UI elements look good, but are designed poorly.

There is a lot to love about this game. However, there is ONE giant thing to hate. As it stands this game is NOT worth $59.99. Looking into the future and knowing there are going to be at least four DLC's, three faction DLC's and one Campaign DLC. One can guess that these DLC's are going to be an additional $14.99+. This in inexcusably predatory.

Total War Pharaoh's redeeming traits are trumped by the price. The fact that I have just under 30-hours and I have played each faction for 150-turns is saddening. This game can provide a fun challenge for the player, yet with the lack of factions/factional diversity it just gets stuck in one giant game play loop.

I think this is a nice addition to the historical side of the franchise. New and different campaign and battle map mechanics have been introduced, which overall add a lot to the experience, while some familiar features like family trees sadly aren't present in this title. Overall I think its mechanically very much a satisfying addition to the franchise. 

It also runs and functions perfectly in my experience, which is nice to see on release these days. 

The scale of the campaign is smaller than we would expect from a ""full"" Total War game, but I must strongly disagree with all the people complaining about that. Not every game needs to be Rome II on launch, and those who were there for that know that NO game should be like Rome II on launch,,, As I recall that game wasn't properly fixed for over 6 months, with updates that regularily ended my first precious campaigns in the game through incompatibility during that time. For me, I certainly prefer a smaller but polished experience over a bloated one of lower quality. This one will grow in time, admittedly with perhaps pricey DLC, but nonetheless - I think its false to compare Pharao's scale to previous games and ignoring how polished it is on day one. 

As for the value for money issue, which is connected to the scale of the game - how do you people who call this expensive determine a games worth? 

For me, I convert the cost to hours of work it takes to earn the money, then compare that to the hours of enjoyment i get out of the game; I should like about three hours of fun for each hour of work. The price of this game represents about 5hrs of work for me. I've already enjoyed it for almost 36 hours and I can see easily another 10-15 hours before I grow tired of it. To me that is excellent value, even though the price can look high with no context.

Let me start with what I liked:

* The Bronze Age. I just plain love this time period.
* Local recruitment system adds a bit of variety to unit compositions.
* Open-ground battle maps look good and play fairly well.
* The campaign map, and some of the unit models, look pretty nice.
* Some of the siege maps are large and look good (but aren't without major problems - I'll get to that)

Here are the core problems that plague this game:

1. Exteremely limited unit variety.
2. Extremely limited faction variety.
3. Copy-pasta faction leaders and generals. Plus copy-pasta troop formations.
4. Tons and tons and tons of copy-pasta content.
5. Buggy sieges.
6. Buggy unit control (especially chariots!).
7. The end-game crisis isn't nearly enough of a crisis.
8. No naval battles.
9. Where the hell is Greece? Troy? Assyria?

1. Unit variety is more limited than ever: Yeah, no light cav, no heavy cav, no shock cav, no jav cav, no bow cav, no crossbow cav. Did the bronze age have any of this? No crossbows, no pikes, no elephants, no dogs, no artillery, no falx, no berserkers, no heroes, no monsters. No, but the effect on gameplay is devastatingly boring. Now you just get blobs of infantry and lack-luster archers shooting at each other.

2. Only three major cultures? I guess you can count the Libyans and the Sea Peoples as two extras, but they aren't even playable, and don't even manage cities. So bland.

3. It seems like there's only two models for generic generals/faction leaders for each faction type. And guess what? Almost everyone and everything is a generic general, so get used to seeing the same face over and over, in both battles and diplomacy. They even used the same face for a Libyan general and an Egyptian general, it's the same guy in different outfits. What the actual fuck.

4. Even units look the same. Very little variety between individual dudes in a unit, and they are almost all wearing bland brown colors that just blend together. Towns look the same, cities look the same. The same armies clashing over and over in the same places. So boring.

There's not even a major seasonal change in Hittite (Anatolian) land. Where the hell's the winter snows? It's just perpetual autumn over there, I guess. Really sucked some of the fun and mystery out of the region for me.

The Hittites were the faction I was the most excited to play as, yet somehow, they just seem to be lacking the personality and charm that makes them feel enigmatic, threatening, and intriguing. It feels like they didn't even try to come up with anything fresh and original for the Hittites to deal with.

5. Siege AI is as bad as ever in this Total War. This time, however, the cities are actually quite large and interesting, but the AI only ever tries to hold the walls. I'd love to battle through the city, but the AI just isn't into it, and there's no real incentive to doing as a defender anyway.

Guys with torches can still run up to gates and throw torches to bust em. Seriously? I was tired of this mechanic years ago, it's so ridiculous.

There's a major glitch with towers and gates right now: some of them are fake. Towers that don't shoot, gates that won't open. I have this theory that they invented ""fake"" towers and gates for maps to use as decorations, and they accidentally placed these ""fake"" towers and gates on real siege maps. Oops.

6. Chariots are supposed to be king in this time period, but chariots are as buggy as ever, but it's 10x worse because they're now 1/3rd of your army comp. Chariots get stuck on everything, the pathfinding sucks, they're so slow (literally as slow as a guy running on foot), feel completely weightless (only have good charges on downhill), and are just unbelievably clunky and glitchy for a cornerstone unit. Unacceptable for a full-price game.

Plus, even regular units constantly get strung out and don't respond well to orders. Missile units are also bad offenders, especially jav, who will stop shooting and go into melee on a whim.

7. The Sea Peoples were a bit scary when they started showing up with full stacks of top-tier units, but they wound up just being an annoyance I had to play whack-a-mole against. They burned down a few cities that I easily reclaimed and rebuilt.

""They must have done some damage elsewhere on the map"", I thought. I was playing an Egypt faction, and they came down on the Nile hard. Nope. The only province damaged was Cyprus, and the whole rest of the world seemed just fine. This was made worse by...

8. The complete and utter lack of sea battles! I'm fighting the SEA people, who come in on SHIPS, and sail across WATER, and specialize in NAVAL ASSAULTS. And you can't FIGHT them on WATER. Are you KIDDING me CA? This should have been a core feature, a rebirth of the naval system for Total War. But no, it just teleports you to the nearest beach, even if you sea battle in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Ridiculous.

9. This game feels like a big DLC for Troy, so where the hell is Greece? You could've had a double-sized grand campaign map that featured more than 3 major cultures. But no, that might have made this game actually good. Can't have that. I'm sure they want to sell that to us as another DLC at some point.

Conclusion
Should you buy this game? No, not it's current state. Why did I spend 60 hours on it? I'm a diehard bronze age fan, and I wanted to squeeze every drop of joy I could from this copy pasta hell.

Did I enjoy some of it? Oh, sure. But most of my experience was tedium, and by endgame I was just auto-resolving every battle I possibly could, because I had already seen everything the game has to offer. One campaign, and there's almost nothing left to see or do.

I wanted this game to be more. I still want this game to be more. But I'm tired of lowering my expectations. I demand more from one of my favorite game franchises. Not worth a buy.",1698058244,1698058244,False,9,0,0.557595551013946533,4,True,False,False

Pharaoh's Court is nice and add some diplomatic actions

Hero have ''guards'' now in battle, its a little battalion that can be improve with Hero items too. (I found a chariot for my hero and now all the guards have chariots. )

Lots of depth in empire management, with city building requiring management of your workforce as well. Also very appreciative of the campaign customization. All Total War games could use the dozens of options to change to our preferences.

I also enjoyed the court system and the power you can wield when pharaoh/great king. The enhanced terrain and weather systems are very promising for future games as well.

I think the Sea Peoples could use to be more threatening and be better at overwhelming areas, but I've got a lot of hours in the series so that might just be a case of preparing too much for them.

But at full price I can't really recommend the game.

They took some risks here, but I'm not sure they all paid off.

The Bad:
Combat -
Unit speed is in a really wierd place.  I'm used to walking my troops, trying to conserve fatigue and tiredness, but right now it feels pointless. Add that to increased unit movement speed and it all just feels like the game is running about 50% too fast.  I can only assume they increased infantry movement speed because it all felt too slow without cavalry.

Units often take forever to die. Even if completely surrounded by multiple units.

Chariots are alright, but with the increased movement speed of infantry they don't feel like they outrun units nearly enough.  They kind of feel like a ""win more"" unit.  They feel fun if you were already going to win the battle, and they might help you get there faster with less casualties, but they won't help you turn a battle.

Archers feel a bit pointless with the reduced range.  By the time you start shooting, skirmisher is already triggering your men to flee.  Your men are also obnoxiously slow to actually respond and generally just stand there to be charged.  The firing arcs are also kind of wonky due to the short range.  Your archers can't even really arc fire down onto the walls to support a siege, they just kind of laserbeam straight into the wall and hit nothing.

I ran into a wierd issue with reinforcing armies.  An enemy was reinforcing a battle where I was doomed, but I could perhaps ambush their reinforcements to inflict some losses.
The reinforcements trickled in so slowly that their entire army walked over to mine and killed me off before their units finally finished arriving. I have only ever seen this issue one time, however.

The Campaign:
Court Actions are a huge gamble and I definitely applaud the attempt to do more interesting story building and politics.  The problem is that its tedious.  Every single turn you have to click what you want to do.  There's no option to ""Do this until further notice"".  A number of times I'm so eager to get to a big battle, that I've realized turns later that I ignored the reminder that I need to gossip twice every turn to some rival of mine.  This could use some small Quality of Life changes to the system, but should not be thrown out.

Forts are incredibly annoying.  They make every territory battle a slog, because I have to have extra armies to either siege the fort while I attack the settlement.  The idea is interesting and I think the -50% upkeep is an interesting mechanic while raider waves are coming.  But the AI builds so many of them that it isn't an interesting problem, just annoying.  You also can't start a war by attacking one for some reason.

Glitches:
My Lord (Ramses III) has long ago earned the 3rd title slot, but I can't put more than 2 on him.  Incredibly annoying.

The Good:
The game is pretty enough, though limited by the engine.

It's a total war without magic.  That's kind of nice.

The limitations caused by the resource management make me wish that we weren't locked into the modern ""Generals must lead armies"" scheme.  I wish I could independently trickle units to the front or transfer them as needed without hiring complete new generals to walk the entire length across my empire.

Summary:
Pharaoh isn't a bad game by any means, but it's definitely saga level content at full price.
I bought it because I was desperate for new Historical Total War, but maybe I should have just tried replaying 3 Kingdoms instead.  I could have bought Baldur's Gate 3.

I keep going from liking this game to disliking this game, and in summary I think it's a more negative experience than positive. I've played 40+ hours so far and there are a number of annoying and irritating game related issues, I'll try to list as many as I can below.

-small world map size (where's the rest of the fertile crescent? Lybia or Mycenae? All future DLC perhaps?)
-city, village, and outpost placements are somewhat questionable and make for watching your empire collapse real quickly when the AI circumnavigates around your front line armies and fortresses
-Egyptian swordsmen call themselves spearmen when selected... I'm sure there are other similar errors as well
-there are no vocal battle alerts, at least not that I heard: doesn't tell you when your ram is at the gate, broken through the gate, or when your ladders, tower, et cetera have done what they're supposed to do
-battles are a SLOG, and your units are retarded, regularly getting caught on things, or just standing around while only 20 out of 120 men unit fight the enemy
-economy balancing while interesting and a fun dynamic, is very frustrating when you can never not have a food deficit even in fielding crappy conscript armies
-early game for certain characters has no clear direction or strategy
-civil wars will start early, or for no perceptible reason
-why can't Egyptian major cities on the nile, with a garrisoned army, like Meneffer for example oh I don't know, maybe STOP an enemy army from immediately sailing down the Nile? The Nile is not that wide, and an army's area of interception literally covers it but 4 full stacks of Sea People armies will sail past you one by one and you will not even notice
-the resource and mechanic of legitimacy is interesting, but why are certain no-name characters favoured more than ohhh I don't know... THE CROWN PRINCE or other memebers of the Royal family?
-Allied AI will actively pursue and steal as many provinces as it can from you
-Enemy AI will throw themselves down as vassals to other people (your allies) to try and get away from you and end the war through a cop-out
-despite how pretty the game looks, there are many other things just missing... the feel and experience is shallow, especially in comparison to other Total Wars

I have not read or watched any reviews of this game, so I don't think it's a dumpsterfire, or THAT bad. But... it certainly shows a lot of flaws. Almost like Rome II when it came out. but... somehow worse. Since it's far smaller in scope.

i'm holding out for it to improve. But at the moment, I am not mad, I'm just disappointed.

-Resource management and trade systems are not deep or detailed

-Lack of Calvary and unit variety (no Calvary makes battles not interesting.)
-All units look too similar at the lower tiers
-Map is detailed near the Nile but desert areas look plain and left out
-What's up with the glowing rings around cities and lack of effort into defining cities on the maps (some look like blocks) lack of effort is disappointing

Pharaoh is my first TW game which I asked for refund. I have mixed feelings writing this review. On the first hand, CA Sophia actually listen to their fans. On the second hand, final product is simply boring and overpriced.

Starting with pros:
* Game is beautiful, graphics are polished and nice. Also soundtrack is climatic.
* Optimization is good - on 5yo RTX 1070 I played everything on Ultra / 1080p and only sometimes (huge sieges) game dropped below 30 FPS. It's better than Attila.
* Intresting new mechanics like the Court, Gods, wheather system, outposts.
* Resources system (similar to Troy) is somehow refreshing.

Cons:
* Battles quickly becaming repetitive, as you can use only infantry, archers and chariots. Partially thats the limitation of Bronze age, but still there are no heroes or special units.
* Map is too small - there is no Assyria or Babylon, also it's narrow, which means all your battles are fought in similar places. For this reason this should be called Saga.
* Lack of replayability - my third campaign (I played early access) is almost identical as my first two. Simply, it's boring.
* UI is unreadable. It is not possible to guess which building is giving what bonus.
* As someone already mentioned it looks like copy-paste Troy. Well, Troy at least had 3 modes.
* There are also minor bugs and balance issues: Archers are useless, Chariots are often stuck, basically you need to spam infantry. I would not mention it, but knowing CA policy they may actually abandon the game and leave this unfixed.

I don't know what happened to CA and TW I just to know, but it's going in a wrong way.

If you still hesitate take a look at Steam Chart, it's basically 5,400 players all-time peak and 3k a week after launch. At the same time Warhammer 3 has 22k, Rome 2 - 8k, Medieval 2 - 5.8k.",1697999063,1697999063,False,2,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False

I have tried both getting to be Pharaoh early in game and later in game, early allows you to use all those great powers gained to do some fun things to enemies and kingdom, getting it late, to late, will make it seem slow and it gets boring.
2. Troops, there is not a lot of variation with them, but, they get stronger and wiser, and terrain in any battle is very important a small army can take a larger one if terrain is on your side.
3. There is a lot to manage, trade can become super important to keep your supplies up, wood and stone are very important for building so trade for them and keep your pile high.
If you get to Pharaoh early war will be a constant almost, so it can be a lot of fun constantly managing enemies and your kingdom while managing to keep expanding and growing.

From a technical perspective, the game runs really well. I have not had any issues with crashes or anything of that nature. 

The combat is also nice, so far, every time I have lost in battle it has felt like I did something wrong and not the game being unfair. The advent of different units handling different climates and terrain differently is also nice. For example chariots are great in battle, but you will lose some if you send them over open desert for too long. 

The addition of outposts to further custimize the region is nice. I like the option of being able to build extra buildings to focus on logistics, religion, trade or defense. 

I am looking forward to continuing to play as the opening video made it look like I will have to deal with the sea people, which, as we know, were responsible for the bronze age collapse.

+ Some fun faction mechanics which take all the best parts of the Warhammer games, like internal realm politicking and competitions for offices
+ Good unit variety, with mixtures of variously armed infantry, archers, skirmishers, and chariots
+ The resource system from Troy is here but I find the numbers have been balanced since that game
+ Huge variety of buildings to choose between to develop either the economy, society or military
+ The general (lord) level up system is fun and combines with other systems (the Great King of the Hittites can appoint his generals as princes to give them special titles!) 
+ Generals can be customised with wargear, like in Warhammer games, except that this loadout actually changes how the general functions as a unit on the battlefield. Eg you can swap his sword for a spear and change his bodyguard into spearmen, or into light archers, or into melee chariots etc etc
+ The history compliments the gameplay but doesn't overwhelm it. I'm not railroaded into any decisions, but I'm aware of historical paths I could take.
+ Good graphics. Environments are beautiful (I especially like chariots leaving trails through wheat fields!)
+ Maps are interesting, including sieges.
+ Battles aren't over too quickly like in Shogun 2, you have time to make interesting choices.

- The unit/model AI is weird like in Rome 2 - if you order one unit to attack through another unit, it doesn't blob up, it moves into and through the other unit, with soldiers phasing through one another. Looks bizarre.
- Seems to be a memory leak that causes lag after an hour or two of play but I assume this will be fixed soon
- A bit unstable. I crash every few hours.
- Musical score is maybe a bit reserved? I think they tried to go for very historical sounding tracks but it comes across underwhelming. I miss the campy music from Rome 1!
- The map could be larger, with more varied playable factions. I guess they want to release that as DLC.
- Not a lot of personalisation with the faction leaders. I don't really get to know them. I guess this is a result of the poor historical records from the time so it can't be helped, but it does detract from my enjoyment.",1697957473,1697957473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Thanks to somebody in the positive comments, I dared to purchase it at full price (basic edition) and already spent almost 10 hours on it in a few days.

Here's what I used to play from total war:
Rome total war (~1.5k hours on pirated since 2009 to 2012)
Rome remastered (25 hours, feels plain after all these years)
Total War Empire  (45 hours it was a fun game, but I didn't get used to the gunpowder type of game in Total War)
Medieval 2 (15 minutes, felt too old of a game to play)
Warhammer 2 (4 hours last year, realized I didn't enjoy it at all, maybe will revisit one day)


So why do I like Pharaoh? I believe it's because I had super low expectations on what a game like this can have (Rome: total war type of expectations), but I was pleasantly overwhelmed with the features in it. The court system seems super cool, I'm gossiping, plotting, getting that bread, the outpost system is SUPER cool, that was my dream to have something like this back in original rome total war OR in a remaster. The funny thing is that in my 9 hours, I had like 4 battles in total, because I'm enjoying every moment of learning about different benefits to buildings, faction, provinces, etc.

One thing to keep in mind is that because I was not familiar with a similar game that everyone is talking about (Troy?), I had to spend almost an hour in first move just to learn all these things. After first opened the campaign, I was a bit overwhelmed and wanted to quit the game after 5 minutes, but I said to myself ""wait, read all these things, what these do, what these are and try to enjoy"". GLAD I DID. I did start with Normal/Normal campaign and battle difficulties to learn the game first. I even tried to siege my enemy on like round 10 and had to load back to previous save to not to get my ass whooped lol. And glad I did that, because I could rethink my strategy and invest more time and resources into my current territory. Another thing that I realized is that in some ways, this game reminds me a bit of Sid Meier's Civilization 6 (in the micromanagement way + all the other ""researches"", courts, etc. features), but it has what Civ 6 doesn't = managed battles! That's one big thing that Civ games are missing for me. anyway, back to this game. It's a great game that I always wished to have back in rome total war times. I did start with a few mods right away and I do believe it helps a bit (one of these, AI overhaul, was recommended by original comment that helped me decide to buy the game).
Mods I'm using:
Hecleas AI overhaul
Hecleas Animation overhaul
Rewoeked unit economy
Improved unit sspacing
Better campaign camera

I really suggest you trying out the game ESPECIALLY if you haven't been playing that many total war games OR you have been playing just rome total war and always wanted to get some more micro management, more features, etc.

I really hope that the developers won't drop this game just because of the hate they initially got from the more power user type of players and will continue supporting the game + will add all the planned and unplanned DLCs (I don't care, I will buy them to support such game).

There are a few things that annoy me in the game, a few UX/UI decisions, but I will better fill in the feedback form to them directly once I have time. Also, these aren't that impactful to the game and you quickly (in a few hours) get used to how to navigate in the game, where everything is, etc.

But after going in with an open mind and playing for about six hours, I do think it has legitimate issues that really drag it down. After a year or two of DLC and patches, it might really live up to the classics like Shogun 2 or Empire. Right now, though, it's just not an engaging experience. 

You often hear people talk about games being ""a mile wide but an inch deep,"" meaning that they have a lot of different things to do but nothing is particularly complex or requires much thought. This game is almost the inverse of that - it's an inch wide but a mile deep, in a bad way. The actual progress of any particular campaign feels very similar, and factions aren't uniquely differentiated in nearly the same way they've been previously. Part of that is just the reality of having the game set in the Bronze Age, so far before any other entries. But it feels like the developers compensated for the more limited scope by just making every thing you *can* do more complicated or intricate for no particular reason. The court system, the building management, and the royal decree systems are the worst offenders here - it feels like everything is complicated and tedious without being engaging, like the developers just added features until it took players a certain amount of time per turn. I've also had some weird issues with AI, both in battles and on the diplomacy map. 

Hopefully developers will commit to this one longer than they did to Three Kingdoms and really build it up, but for now it's a disappointment for me.

The new campaign mechanics are fun, and the AI will actually cooperate with you on trade deals to make it work. I've never been a huge fan of crisis mechanics in TW games, I just find them annoying, but the sea peoples aren't awful to deal with. You get notice of when they are coming and just have to be sure to have some armies stocked in the settlements they are targeting.

In battles, it is solely infantry other than the chariots, but the mobility difference between light-medium-heavy infantry is huge. Javelins are a little janky but they do massive amounts of damage if you flank with them. Low tier archers/slingers are pretty bad, but once you get the higher tiers with flaming shots, they can usually be the tipping point to get units you're engaging to route. Chariots are unfortunately still janky for a bronze age game, though maybe that makes sense as it was the sea peoples who wiped out chariot kingdoms on foot. They still have their uses as the after battle cleanup crew and they can do solid damage on a rear charge. They aren't that hard to get and recruit late game so I haven't cared that much when they die.

Overall I've enjoyed it.

I wont say its better than others just a different experience. Unlike other total wars i found i cant just doom stack (which is refreshing) its alot of micro each turn doing swapsies with other factions for the resources i need until mid/late game.

Alot of interesting features pick your god, politically plot for the throne, fight hordes of boat people, choose a legacy giving your faction a unique mechanic like Cathay trading, minor factions are useful, usurp the throne or smack down upstarts.

Dislikes, generals have no unique abilities use a few from gear and the same from the limited skills to pick, combat seems very back to basics, weather and all the hyped features barely noticeable, units are too pricey, i finished the Hittite campaign with the two guys that didn't cost copper the only place i could get it is an island full of pirates making it very bland in battle.  

Other things of note, only 1 general to army (8'ish gear slots), no hero types, no siege artillery outside of the half Nubian guy with his god tier archers. At this time random maps are a little janky at the moment it will keep the your starting hostile/friendlies and all diplomacy will go back to your actual starting city.

There are plenty of other reviews that go more in depth so i'll simply bullet point the best and worst:

Good: 
- Very thoughtful mechanics that strike a great balance. 
- The avoidable in-game crisis gives more weight to over campaign strategy and diplomacy 
- Resources are spread around, and although clustered strategically in some areas, you dont have to run out of resources during normal play
- Cities wont collapse if left alone. A downfall of all previous TW games, in pharaoh there is city management, but if done properly you can leave your cities alone to thrive and produce resources. 

Bad: 
- Its been repeated countless  times: unit development is flat. Almost no variety which leads to very two dimensional battles
- AI on battle map is atrocious i spent most of my time trying to keep archers pointed in the right direction and not running into the enemies lines. They are completely suicidal on the battle map but dominate auto-resolve.",1697861958,1697861958,True,2,0,0.49932524561882019,0,True,False,False

The game does a good job of diversifying the unit types between faction and local units which can vary even within a smaller region.  The weather can really affect a battle, sandstorm battles in Egypt are pretty wild.  Overall I think improvements to battles are the biggest overall improvement in the game.   Battles dont get settled in a few minutes, the AI is solid, and there are a nice variety of stances available for different units.  I also think the developers have done well to make siege battles more engaging, I used to dread or auto resolve sieges...now I enjoy playing them out.

The limited resources make you have to plan out your conquests to ensure you have enough food and bronze for your armies or wood and stone to build what you need to.    You cant just build up a few 20 unit stacks and terrorize your enemies right off the bat  You have to be more tactical on how you build your armies.

I have enjoyed my Hittite campaign more than the Egyptian so far, but I have only had two campaigns so far.   Will do a Canaan campaign next, but just got Kurunta appointed HIgh King and the world is slowly approaching crisis.

this should be a total war saga game

it has far less point in common with rome 2 or attila games that are extremely loved by the community

they completely miss the ball with the scope of the game

i will concede that there are some intersting things
- secondary settlement are interesting as concept but are terribly executed with the ai that will constantly try to destroy them rather than doing more significant actions
-regional recruitment. again a concept that was present in medieval rome 2 and even attila (kinda) that has potential. i certanly like the possibility to recruit troops from conquered people

aside that i noticed way more problems
- the map is stupidly huge but regional. there is only a tiny portion of the middle east (parto of anatolia coasto of syria lebanon israel and the red sea coast, plus egypt and north sudan). meaning that you will spend a lot of time trying to exit your starting position and experiencing midgame content after conquering 10-15 settlements.
-there are a stupid amount of factions. this is both a result and a cause of the previous point. the map is so big that it need factions to be populated, but at the same time these factions are all copy pasted. egypt is the worst offender with at least 12-15 factions just for the egyptian

so you will have 12-15 factions with at least one settlment each but most with a full province
meaning that with a map landmass of rome 2 gallia you have 10 different factions with 20-30 settlments and at least 15 provinces. compared to the 3 provinces and 10-12 settlments of rome 2

the problem is that you will hit a point where you are bored by the uniformity of the engagaments and enemies. 

and that just to unify egypt. actually engaging in warfare against different cultures is so far away that i dropped the campaign out of apaty

and better not even delve into the court sistem. terrible mechanic

pharaon is not a bad game
it is a mediocre game especially if compared to the true masterpieces of total war like medieval 2 rome 2 attila shogun 2 and warhammer I II III

to this day i still play these games
i have just finished a session on a modded medieval 2 elder scroll total war. a game that is older than many pharaon players but that still is unbeatable in terms of gameplay and moddability

just study your past successes and give players what they love.
just look bellum crucis, third age total war second age total war macchiavello DAC elder scroll total war
people made that mods free
just for passion

i will not recocmd this game. especially nto for full price

The game itself is not bad and I would recommend it if it costed 30$...  at the end this is a saga game....

However, as the game costs 60‚Ç¨ then I would need to review it as a full priced one.

Pros:
Mechanically good, CA Sofia always delivers 
Very beautiful
Works smooth and is optimized.

Cons:
3 factions that feel really bland.
Map is small in scope.
Warfare of bronze age is not interesting enough to make a total war game about it.

Sorry CA but you really need to improve a lot if you think we are going to pay more for less.

Pharoah is VERY GOOD in my view.
 
Sure, its maybe a bit overpriced, but that is my only significant criticism.
There are loads of enjoyable mechanics to get to grips with and if there's one you don't like there will probably be a way of minimising it in the options

The customisation screens for the start of each campaign are a major step forward for replayability
Many You Tuber criticisms are weak - for example ""no cav"" - that's easily fixed by modders
for example ""unbalanced"" - this is often the case for any game of this type and is patchable - If you follow Warhammer over the last 7 years, the relative strength of each faction goes up and down with each patch

The game design is quoted as aiming for deeper tactical battles rather than the crazy clickfest that characterises other TW titles - this is more satisfying play for me, you may feel differently of course, so go play an FPS or whatever.

The development of TW with this game is way better than some other new titles by other developers - for example Age Of Empires IV (no change in graphics or UI and not much extra value)

After 7 years of WH1 WH2 and WH3 its refreshing to go old school for a change, and anyway you can still get into Deities for the magical realism angle

Enjoy, if you have the spare cash :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstly, I have been playing Total War since Rome: Total War around 2005. 
Secondly, I am extremely disappointed with the 
unjustified hatred this game has gotten on both YouTube and the Steam Store page.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game, fundamentally, would be what we could only dream of in those days when we were 15 years old, playing AOE2 and Rome: Total War.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The era of the bronze age and ancient history gives a simplistic, barbarious, and rag tag feel. It truly is a battle of the ages, where even archers have their place in Melee.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Graphics are incredible, and scale of battle immense. 
It is the best-looking Total War game we have had by far, as would be expected as the next instalment in the franchise. (I thoroughly enjoy just taking screenshots of battles, and I have never seen anything look more glorious).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have paid $100 AU dollars for this game, even after reading all the negative reviews.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now for my review of the general components of the game;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Graphics: 9.5/10 (Incredible lighting, scale, effects, realism. It feels like an ancient battle field)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UI: 9/10 (Ability to scale, more unit size than previously, nice colours, bright and colourful yet also deep blue.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Features: 
- Stars over the Egyptian night skyline
- Great monument builder or trader of the lands plus many other focuses. 
-New outpost system, balancing visiting them each turn to boost movement speed or reduce upkeep. Takes balance, placement and skill
- Potential for a super focused multiplayer campaign (very narrow yet expansive for head to head)
- Massive campaign map, given the small region, it is absolutely massive
- The best general upgrade system we've had in total war by far. Feels extremely immersive.
- Cavalry, what cavalry? Makes chariots the new cavalry of the game (OMG) they are truly decisive to a battle, but are vulnerable, especially to levy spearmen (who have abilities focused on chariots)
- Want to get unique troop auxiliaries? Court faction opportunities that focus on role play elements of a royal court. You can start as a nobody, a governor or a military leader, and work your way into the court by diplomacy, schemes or outright taking the job vacancy!
- Amazing, micro resource management, (which I'm sure is why a lot of people have the Sh*ts) where you have to organise food in advance.
- Food and other resources are also earned from winning battles which is awesome.
- Cool battle animation when battle is finished.
- Gods pathways to choose from that can level up and have assigned generals
- Prince mechanics who look after vassals
-Plus so much more, I can barely fit it in!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Units:
- Extremely realistic and immersive roster, with slight variations between factions yet all keeping the realistic feel of the region. Way more diverse than say Atilla, as much as I love Atilla.
- Ability to use 2d ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic portraits for unit cards and generals, or 3d, which looks absolutely beautiful.
- New unit commands such as advance or give ground (advanced tactics)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Soundtrack: 9/10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cons:
- Sea people repetition
- Hardly any people in MP Campaign lobby because you, the fanbase **** it up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recommendations:
- Play on Veteran / Veteran minimum for campaigns.
- There is also a mod called Hecleas AI Overhaul that will improve AI Drastically.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Summary to the criticism of Pharaoh:
-- This the greatest strategy game of the ****** year. It feels like Rome Total War but more realistic, bigger, immersive and specialized. All we would need is a Roman Invasion of Egypt DLC and my lord!! I cannot emphasise enough that, if you are a total war fan; BUY THIS GAME!
---------------------------------------------------------------
-- This appears to be another example of 'cancel culture' & it sickens me. 
Once a few hipsters / influencers make up their mind, pre release, the movement begins!
They are movement of sheep who bitterly trash games like Starfield or Pharoah: Total War because they are unhappy about something, and then others follow. You guys can't think for yourself? But, for those of us Zealous generals, whom have grown up playing PC Games for 20 + years, we are in for a treat my loyal friends!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- I cannot believe (as a long lifetime fan of total war), the hatred this game is getting, for literally no reason! If you didn‚Äôt buy this, and went off reviews and youtube vids, you are a ******* slave. And good for you, I can sit here, on my top tier pc, and game!

Pharaoh's map feels like three rectangles placed in front of you with a huge sea that nullifies about a quarter of the map. Troy managed to avoid this issue by having many islands in the Aegean. Cyprus is not big enough (geographically) to do the same. The scope of the map is too small and detracts from the value of the game.

On the other hand, the native unit recruitment system combined with the faction specific units is a fantastic idea I've wanted in Total War for a while. Well, a system better than Rome 2's where only Rome can recruit every unit in the game.
The mechanic of local deities is lovely and adds flare to the experience. Campaign customisation is pretty good. The ability to pick and participate in your court of interest is fantastic and could work well in future TW titles. The legacies are a nice idea. Nice to see weather making a return.

Overall, solid 7/8 out of 10. Is it a remake of Troy? Absolutely. Does it add a good chunk of new features and play styles? 100%. The only real gripe I have so far is the settlement UI is a bit one-note and hard to distinguish between building types. They all look very similar. But this is a damn shade better starting point than a lot of previous TW games.

It's a shame but it's just anger at CA being pointed at a game that doesn't deserve the hate, anyone with any fairness and impartialness towards it won't judge it the way a TW fan will.

Like half the complaints about the game are ridiculous af.

I feel bad for CA sofia, they clearly put work in many areas and all that they are getting is nitpicking and parroting of things questionable content creators have said like andy's take who clearly just don't like the setting and made a 50 minute long video trying to find whatever they can spin in a bad light, like the camera for example which made my eyes roll.",1697772253,1697772253,True,8,1,0.500922143459320068,0,True,False,False

After the disastrous Rome2 was released I stopped paying attention to Total War as I predicted they would build the next games on top of it. I briefly played Troy, and was inspired through that to try Pharaoh.

Look and feel: 10/10
This game runs beautifully. I thought the art of optimization had died out in the early 2000s, but these guys proved me wrong; quick loading screens, no crashes, fast AI turns, no lag/stutter in battles. The graphics are amazing, this is truly a beautiful game and easily outpaces any other Total War game I have played to date, this is true for both the campaign map, the UI, the battle maps and the units and weather effects as well.

Campaign features: 8/10
I can only speak about Egypt as I have only played one campaign so far as an Egyptian faction. Basically, the Pharaoh will die in the early game leaving the kingdom in civil war. You are trying to collect Legitimacy points in order to become the next Pharaoh. All of the campaign features tend to play into this core concept. You can pick a Legacy to follow, through which you basically decide to gain bonuses and Legitimacy through building wonders, conquering cities, through trading, or through the creation of a new religious deity. There is also a Intrigue system where you can try to rise into various offices which give you certain bonuses and abilities, it's a neat idea, but not very complex or interesting in my opinion. I certainly have not explored all of the options available, but as a general take, these systems seem to be interesting ways to bring some new side objectives into play and increase replay value. Another interesting feature is that invasions are back! In Pharaoh the Sea People invade, which has happened in my campaign and I am hoping it will bring some chaos into Egypt to capitalize on. This was a cool feature of Medieval2, where the Mongols and Timurids would each invade at some point to break up the monotony of a long running campaign and I am glad to see it return.

Music: 10/10
The music is beautiful and specific to the setting. Upon starting battle on the campaign map you get some intense music to rile you up and get you in the mood to water the sands with blood. I like it!

Battles: 8/10
The battles in Pharaoh are much slower than in Troy which works out great because zooming in to the action and watching the fights unfold is more interesting now with the individual unit avatars all fighting each other in animated combat. The combat is focused around infantry and makes the distinction between light, medium and heavy units in a really meaningful and interesting way. All units have their place and excel at different tasks. Armor can break as well, so battering heavy infantry with club units has great effect. Everything I have experienced in battles is extremely well balanced and seems to make sense. Arrows are not overpowered, but can be effective in the right places, what weapon is being used against what type of unit plays a big role in winning battles. Battle AI is basically the same as always since the old days of Rome and Medieval, the enemy generally attacks from the front and isn't particularly good at focusing it's units on specific points in city battles, so nothing too exciting on that front, but honestly this has not bothered me much until now as I am generally at a disadvantage on the high difficulty levels and the AI not being too genius or annoying allows for some epic underdog victories.

Generals and Armies customization: 8/10
They basically combined some things together from previous games; generals can gain traits through leveling up and choosing them as in Troy, these are basically more like army traits. Then there are traits which a general earns though performing certain actions as in more classical games like Medieval2 which are focused around his bodyguard unit or campaign map bonuses. This system works quit well, but I would like to see more traits added into this to bring it more in line with the wide variety of traits a general could acquire in Medieval2. Generals bodyguard units can be equipped with various weapons and armor to make them basically whatever unit you want them to be, ranging from chariot archers to heavy infantry with clubs which I find to be a really cool aspect. Your main general is the character you pick when you start the campaign and he is immortal and can only be wounded. I must say that I miss the old family tree and adoption system from Rome and Medieval2 and especially the combination of mortal faction leaders and traits which could be earned through sending your general into combat often which would increase their hit points so that they could become pretty macho dudes if they risked putting themselves in danger often.

General impression:
After 18 hours I feel as though I still have alot to learn, as far as mastering the various tools the game offers effectively. Certainly I am excited to try out other Egyptian factions and to explore the other kingdoms outside of Egypt as well. The game has been a real pleasure to play thus far and feels like a well polished, beautiful, good quality game, a welcome contrast to the epic fail that was Rome2 those many years ago. I will certainly be paying attention to Total Wars historical games again and specifically to games coming from the Sofia studio.

Anyhow, at the current state, the game seems more like a Troy DLC than a new game. It has some changes, but in general, less content, faction diversities, no mythical story mode, even less charachter oriented, and all in all, much less replayability value (the only thing which gives replayability the chance, are campaign map customization with starting position changes). 
Troy was definitely more interesting and diverse, which means Pharaoh is a stepback. And it still suffers from same issues Troy had. Considering Rome 2 concept, which happens in the same area (more or less), there's much less resources on the map/in the game, which became game focus in its own. If you don't use the campaign customization option for reduced unit upkeep, you spend half the game trying to come even at the end of the turn. I understand that bronze age was more about exchanging resources than paying the money for it, but the way it is now, it's just hurting the gameplay. 
There's few buildings to build, and with already mentioned resource problem, I always end up building all resource producing buildings, and uniqe one to fill the remaining slots. There's to few buildings slots in non capital provinces, which makes resource producing buildings even more important. Provinces edicts are more or less the same for all factions, there are no governors of provinces, you don't have advisors like in Three Kingdoms, no family tree, no loyalty for charachters, no agents to place on the map. Civil war for the Pharaohs crown is just about who has more legitimacy after certain number of turns. which means, you don't have to do anything on the battlefield, just start a civil war when you have more legitimacy, and wait for the timer to end, to gain the title. Once you become pharaoh, even if you don't own whole of Egypt, game is practically over, and, as already stated, there's no challenge in starting the game again with different egyptian faction after it. 
Gold, the resource people fought war's over since forever, isn't so valuable, especially mid to late game, cause it's used only for certain buildings and units, and you can produce a good amount from a single province (and there are a lot gold producing provinces in the game). Even most of AI factions had a lot of gold at the end, while most of them strugled with bronze, food and wood. Stone, once you develop your provinces, becomes almost unnecessary in the game, and it happens at the same time the resource deposits deplete (in this game, opposed to Troy, there are stone deposits, not the gold one).
Game isn't much charachter oriented, it's a step back from Troy in that regard too.
As several people mentioned, it seems they could be planing a 3rd instalment (probably Mesopotamia), with intention to bland it all into one map like with Warhammer. If that's the case, they should've anounce it, cause some people have the Troy on different platforms.

All in all, I cannot recommend this game at this price at the moment, hope they'll redeem themselves with factions and campaign dlcs anounced, better try out some older Total war instalments, and wait for a big discount.

Edit: Although I have a decent machine, even on the medium graphic settings I get the frame rate to fall bellow 30, which eventually, crashes the game. It usually gets resolved after relaunching the game.",1697746117,1697746412,False,5,0,0.52082526683807373,0,True,False,False

I was hesitant to buy at first due to the mixed reviews but thought that I had to give it a chance because I love total war games. 

Things I did not like:
-User interface changes felt like a step back from three kingdoms, for example removing the on screen pause button in battles. No max troop count shown on the unit icons at the bottom. 
-Character portraits looked kind of low res on post battle screen
-No option to change the troop size in options menu - maxing out troop size in three kingdoms made the game hugely more enjoyable for me. The armies just feel small in this game. 
-Not my favorite setting - no fault of the designers since it's historically accurate, but a bunch of light armor troops in the desert and no cavalry to speak of hurt the experience more than I thought it would. 
-Characters all progress upgrades with the same tree, making generals feel samey. I miss the unique upgrade trees for different types of generals and trying to mix and match general combos to make a truly strong army.

That aside, the amount of flak and hate this game had received before even the beta was out is astounding, simply because it wasn't, Medieval 3, Rome 3, or another Empire. So many claim that this game is A Troy clone yet Troy suffered greatly until the Mythos update and this game plays well at launch. Or the fact that both games play in completely different ways. Some say that this is the worst release of Total War when Rome 2 dropped practically unplayable or, something more recent, the bugginess of Warhammer 3 when it first dropped.  The complaints of the lack of naval battles is ironic considering none of the Warhammers or the Three Kingdoms Total War lacked it as well.

Unit hiring is different, I feel that native units fit the bronze age period very well and reflects the lands that that army has gone or fought through. The outpost system is a nice addition allowing for a bit of extra travel in a turn, a strong garrison, more legitimacy etc. The legacies and ambitions aspect to the game is very nice and something that could be beneficial in future total wars. The changing weather during battles is a great touch and the layout of some desert battles can be used to your advantage if you manage to take the high rolling dunes, plateaus, or narrow rocky passes that may spawn. Especially like the adding of religious, building, and trading, end goals along with painting the map. The map is a tough nut to crack. I do wish they also included Minoans or other bronze age Greeks, but just getting to Canaan let alone up to the Hittites from upper Egypt is a grind. The map is bigger than it seems at first glance.  I also greatly enjoy the cut scenes and preferred them to the animated ones like in past titles for the more cinematic feel they impart. Though this time period is not the first I would have asked for, the game did get me to look into some history of the Ramessid dynasty so that I understood some of the games lords and the players of the 19th dynasty of pharaohs more, along with this tumultuous time in history.

I do believe that CA Sofia put a lot of character and heart into this game.

While the battles can be a puzzling mixture of fun and frustrating, the complexity and delicate balancing required in the campaign mechanics on offer is really something worth getting your teeth into. 

Campaign Positives - Local recruitment system encourages diverse armies with different play styles. 
Legacies and Gods to worship enable customisation of your campaign to your objectives, with some fun systems like trade and different paths to conquest activated depending on your choices.  
Scheming in court, gaining legitimacy, activating a civil war and claiming your place as Pharaoh/Great King in the court system is challenging and satisfying, rewarding you for your investment with powerful abilities and units to shape the campaign. 
Outpost system improves complexity of your province building, allowing further customisation 
Trade and Building/recruitment is improved with a mixture of resources that can be bartered between factions, much more interesting than the generic gold seen in other Total Wars.
Lots of customisation options when starting the campaign to finely tune the difficulty to your preferences. 
Felt appropriately challenging to balance all these systems as I built up my empire. 

Campaign Negatives- Endgame crisis is frustrating, especially when marauding armies spawn behind your lines and seem to target the player exclusively. 
AI sometimes meanders around to target weak cities and raze outposts over setting up satisfying battles and sieges, though not always. 
Would have liked to see more factions/a bigger campaign map
Doesn't really feel like it's modelling a 'Bronze Age Collapse' as it's easy to just keep building in strength until you're at your strongest/most powerful during the supposed crisis and fending it off just involves swatting the raiding armies that pop up 

Battle Positives - Weather system is amazing. Awesome visually to see eg. a sunny day changing to a sandstorm with the sky darkening and units reacting with comments/covering their faces to struggle through the sand. 
Different classes of units enable different playstyles despite rosters lacking in cavalry 
Commands like shield wall/heroic advance make disciplined units feel more elite 
Tougher units/higher morale means battles last longer, enabling you to set up flanking manoeuvres while the main lines slog it out. 
Landscapes eg mud/sand seem to have a real impact on the units, with opportunities to set up ambushes or use fire to burn vegetation 

Battle Negatives - Lack of unit variety sometimes prevents strategic play. 
Missiles feel either useless or overpowered depending on their class 
Light units can feel floaty, gliding past each other without impact, though this changes with heavier classes of infantry. 
Difficult to disengage chariots from melee 
Skirmishing doesn't seem to function very well, with units just not retreating properly or getting caught when they should have just pulled away easily.",1697720239,1697720239,True,4,0,0.496075361967086792,0,True,False,False

Yes it is a smaller game than TWWH3, and YES it is worth the price, and  yes it is NOT as good as the Warhammer side of the franchise. I can already tell every faction  in this game is worth playing,  unlike TWWH3 (lookin at you Tretch Craventail). Not only does each faction function  very differently on the world map, but each factions  army layout forces you into very niche and very interesting battle roles. I  honestly think that nowadays, youtubers will make or break a game, and because of this, the fact that so many youtubers came out violently against Pharaoh, It did very poorly on sale. Too many people will listen to their favorite parasocial  relationship that their own feelings, which is sad.

That said, this is the first modern historical Total War game I've played. I played Shogun 2, Medieval (a little bit) and Three Kingdoms (though not sure if you would classify that one fantasy or not). This one definitely sticks out from the rest. Three kingdoms is easily my favorite of the three, and this one isn't better, but unique in a good way. The absence of battlefield siege weapons, Monolithic generals, and cavalry are the main points of note. While I do enjoy all of these within the context of Three Kingdoms, Pharaoh excels heavily in infantry combat in a way that no other total war has so far. I have never once found myself thinking that this game NEEDS cavalry as an addition. The infantry is so  diverse that no each faction has ways to deal with things that normally would necessitate cavalry.

All in all the game is very beautiful, very thematically and aesthetically pleasing, has a great deal of replayability, and, most of all, improves on old systems in a noticeable way. I understand if bronze age isn't interesting to a lot of people, but if this time period is interesting to you at all, I can't recommend this game enough.",1697090386,1697687072,True,3,1,0.321718782186508179,0,True,False,False

It's a bit sad this very polished game is set in such a relatively uninteresting period compared to past games. Don't get me wrong; Pharaohs are cool. But, unless you're some ridiculous ancient history fan, chances are nearly all of the named leaders will be lost on you. This is a problem after coming from 3 Kingdoms, Troy, and the Warhammer games, all of which were made with fans in mind and had pre-existing appeal to large fan bases. While PHARAOH makes some significant steps forward in game design, moving away from eras or brands with huge recognition was the wrong play. 

So, let's do the pros:
The new ambition mechanic (basically allowing you to pick your own missions) works fantastically and prevents the old problem of being given a mission you never intend to complete.
The court intrigue system that allows you to jockey for powerful positions with unique bonuses while plotting against rivals is superb. A great addition!
Egypt looks gorgeous.
Watching commanders duke it out in a duel after fighting or resolving a battle is really neat, though they need some more animations. I think I've only seen about 10. Still, the animations are improved over 3 Kingdoms and Troy.
PHARAOH did away with the horrendous motivation system for generals from Troy.
The barter system from Troy of gold, food, wood, stone, and bronze has been retooled. Resources are much more plentiful, but trade is still basically a necessity in early conquest. PHARAOH strikes a nice balance here that was missing from Troy.

Things that aren't cons but need improvement:
The deity system is a significant step back from Troy. The bonuses hardly feel worth the effort.
Also, Ancient Egypt was as steeped in mythology as Troy. The loss of mythical units is a hard miss.
The outpost system (basically additional buildings that you can construct for some small static bonuses and fairly significant military bonuses that last a few turns) is interesting, but I found myself more annoyed by it than enjoying it. As an example, one outpost type prevents your army from suffering attrition in the desert, which in Egypt is pretty much, ya know, all of it. Meaning every time my army need to go somewhere, I had to make a pit stop at an outpost first. Useful, but annoying.

Cons:
It's not Medieval 3 
It's not Edo era Japan done 3 Kingdoms style. I mean seriously, how is this not in the works.
PHARAOH employs a similar mechanic to the Warhammer games in that, inexplicably, an event triggers that causes random armies to just pop up all over the place to harrass you. It's pitched in the game as some sort of random sea-folk with whom you can't interact other than to fight them coming to rape and pillage your people. There's no rhyme or reason to it. It just happens. And boy is it annoying (just like the Chaos portals from Warhammer).
I'll say again. It's not Total War Samurai Warriors. Huge miss.

Overall, it's a fun game and easily the most polished Total War game to date with the most features. The new additions noted above are extremely interesting and fun. If you love Ancient Egypt, this is the game for you. If, like me, you don't really care about Ancient Egypt, it'll probably be a bit of a struggle to care much about the game after a play-through or two.",1697239574,1697686960,True,2,1,0.519999980926513672,1,True,False,False

The price is indeed debatable and at $49 would have felt the perfect spot. Also, blood shouldn't be a separate paid dlc, for the better for players and for CA itself actually.

I've been very positively surprised by Pharaoh. We got new interesting mechanics never seen before in the franchise, with some other features making a return as well. The campaign is fun with the little mini games such as the court, ambitions/objectives and there's a sense of character development as you turn your faction leader into whatever you want with all the options and choices you are given along.

The optimization is great and I've encountered zero bugs some far 6 hours into it. Unlike with Troy, I've felt very interested into my campaign and the overall bronze era period has seemed to struck better here by a mile. Soundtrack is fine with some nice modern tunes that I'm into from time to time, specially during battles. 

Might not be the Total War that we wanted, but I think it's the one we needed. It's been made with care, love, from a smaller studio and it's definitely in the right direction. Makes me hopeful, and I can't wait to see how this learning translates into the long awaited Empire 2 or Medieval 3.

I think it‚Äôs one of the best Total War titles we‚Äôve had in years. As a Total War fan of almost 20 years, It feels like they finally got down the optimization and it runs great on my meh-tier PC. 

For being a relatively small geographic region, the map feels enormous and full of variety. I have yet to fight a battle where the map looked the same as any other battle before it.

The combat seems to make a bit more sense with units wrapping themselves around enemy units for partial flanking. Contact of individual soldiers seems refined, less of the ‚Äúmosh pit‚Äù chaos of previous titles. Although I have seen some battles devolve into this when many units are targetting one enemy, but through the majority of the battles it seems like the formations are maintained yet dynamic along the edges.

All the new features are great, I don‚Äôt have any complaints about those.

My only complaints are the lack of blood, and the lack of starting factions. Canaan is my favorite so far so it‚Äôs unfortunate to only have two options.

Especially lacking is any Hebrew or Jewish tribe, which is especially odd given that the God El is available to worship for Canaanites, but they are decidedly not altered by that choice in any meaningful way, and do not become monotheistic. 

Also, the addition of outposts seems a good idea, but isn't properly fleshed out in my opinion, as there are only a few kinds of outposts you can have, and they don't add much. 

The unit roster seems limited as well, which is not surprising given the lack of cultures to choose from.

I did find some enjoyment in it, but it's better suited for the ‚Äòfree‚Äô on the Epic Store type model that Troy used. After only 30 hours, I'm starting to feel like I've exhausted most of what it has to offer. If you like Total War, sure get it, but at this price? Nope.

For some context, I've played nearly every Total War game and invested around 80-120 hours into each.

I‚Äôll focus on downsides, which are likely what you're most curious about:

Raiders/AI: They are, in my opinion, the game's Achilles' heel. The problem isn't the concept but rather the execution. These raiders act like relentless terminators with the aim of being annoying as possible. They happily sacrifice their own units, they couldn‚Äôt care less if they are standing right next to a 20 stack ‚Äòautowin‚Äô army. They roam your territory, wrecking every outpost they possibly can They appear almost immune to attrition and seemingly impervious to common sense. This forces you to spend a significant portion of your campaign chasing these raiders around the map (because they are constant), as if they've made it their life's mission to attack your faction alone. Want to pillage the riches of Egypt? Nah, let‚Äôs send our vast armies to conquer some small faction.

I wonder if implementing an 'area of control' concept, where enemy armies can't simply walk past, without initiating combat could help. This would put an end to the scenarios where raiders slip by your army to destroy two more outposts before you catch up the following turn. Make the terrain count for something, let me defend the pass, etc. The concept of 'area of control' is already in use for city combat; extending it, or playing around with something new makes sense.

Diplomacy System and AI: The diplomacy system, often hailed as ""reinvented"" in each Total War installment, sadly remains a disappointment. It seems to have no idea. For instance, you ask for 4,000 stone, and it ‚Äòdemands‚Äô a 62 gold in return. Or you seek 100 wood per turn, and it requests an entire city for the deal. I mean really? It's high time for a complete overhaul methinks. By the time the system becomes useful (ie, I need 100 more stone to build this building and I can‚Äôt be bothered waiting a turn), you're well into the min/max stage of resource generation anyway.

Outposts: I like the idea, but the execution falls short. They're too vulnerable for their cost and the micromanagement required. Armies should be able to utilise them automatically without painstaking micromanagement (eg, they automatically make use of them in path generation). By the time you can use them effectively, you‚Äôre past caring about what benefits they give anyway, this plus the raider mechanics as above.

Army/Combat Mechanics: Finally!!! Is what I would be saying if the idea was thought through a little more. They provide 'advance' and 'give ground' buttons, which are fantastic additions, but their limited availability to only some units is perplexing. Why can‚Äôt all units have it, maybe add a mechanic for various levels of success or something, allowing players to set formations and issue commands without the need for excessive micromanagement are quality of life additions that have been missing for years (how many times does a melee unit stand there and just take it from a missile unit that is literally right in front of it). Give me unique animations and sounds during these actions could also elevate the experience, unit commanders barking orders to hold their ground, to fall back, unique animations, responding to a limited degree to changing battle conditions automatically, a lot of potential here to explore that never is.

Court System: Hard pass. It's a lackluster and uneventful feature that I rarely bothered to open.

Town Garrisons: In my view, a step backward. The garrisons are usually too feeble to offer any meaningful defence, even with upgrades, so why bother? It might be worthwhile to explore alternative ideas, like provinces assembling levy armies for defence when enemy threats emerge‚Ä¶ something! Anything!

X factor: It doesn't really have it. There‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on.. it just seems a little bland. Doesn‚Äôt seem to offer a lot of variation in the different factions, so limits the replayability I think. An ok playground for ideas, maybe don't ask full price for it next time ok?

i've seen a lot of reviews that complain about the time period. I think before you buy this game you should watch one of the hundreds of youtube videos about the bronze age collapse. this is a fascinating period in human history, and the game put a lot of love into making the challenges you face set in the period. The sea people were essentially vikings 2000 years before vikings, and they brought about the collapse of the first wave of major human civilization. This is a fantastic learning tool for a dreadfully undervalued period in human history, and as a game has added a ton of mechanics to put you in the setting. Reviews saying that this is a reskin, are simply wrong. The battle animations have been updated, there are tons of new mechanics on the battlefield.

No quest battles for unique rewards, you just complete overworld objectives... most complicated system is politics and its only complicated because the UI is challenging to understand.

Why cant we get a Total war that respects our ability to forge our own path? What happened to the simple economy systems that allowed for freedom of choice? Having to tunnel-vision for wood and stone the first 50 turns of a campaign is boring and because diplomacy is so braindead (thanks Troy), its tedious to interact with. Religion provides buffs, thats it. No complicated push/pull of one region gods vs another... just buffs. Court/Politics is the most complex system in the game by far. However, once you realize that the strongest thing to do is ""sway and blackmail"" the Commander for free T4/5 units, conduct bare minimum trade deals for upkeep, and conquer the world, the game gets boring...again.

To sum up a summary of every campaign:
Early Game: Focus entire economy on wood and stone
Mid Game: Build recruitment buildings and upkeep reduction structures
End Game: Switch entire economy to food, gold, bronze for upkeep

Simply that it has a LOT of MAJOR bugs or TW design which we are used to that are for no reason worse than in the previous game, even Troy using the same engine.

Mainly, missile unit targeting. Fire-at-will command doesn't work (unit simply put), right-clicking an ennemy unit doesn't work half the time and the unit just rush in melee, range are bugged half the time, sometimes greater, sometime smaller. To be frank I had an indie game feeling regarding the jankyness of the gameplay of the missiles unit. 
The second major issue is the AI. Legitimately worse than any other TW (not Napoleon though) I can think of. Ennemy missile never shoot, or maybe one volley then just move for no reason. infantry unit will randomly rush through your unit and target the missile unit behind, killing themself in the process. This also turn the battle blobs of unit fighting eachother, forget line battles.

I can't get my head around why all those things we are used to are just butchered in this TW.

The bad:
All the clans feel the same except the sea raiders. I feel like they lack distinction. In shogun 2 I would encounter people with specializations, like horses, archers etc. In Pharao one folk is the same as the other. I open the diplomacy screen and the only difference is the name. I rather have half the clans and more unique features for all of them. I cannot agree that the map is small like some are claiming. 

The campaign cinematics feel very weird when not playing as a faction in egypt. Who cares what happens to the pharao when you are a tribe of warriors? 

Similarly units play very similar. There are basically 3 categories: melee, ranged and chariots, now what unit you choose in each has little effect on gameplay. Even clubs and spears dont make much difference. In shogun 2 you would care more about what unit the enemy had. 

Archers feel lackluster and its very cringe when enemy units walk around like pin cusions with maybe 10 arrows stuck in them. 

In general it feels like it takes forever to down one single unit, even if I order my whole army to attack a specific unit it isnt wiped out emmidiately. Feels rather unrealistic. 

The biggest drawback of this game are sieges. Climbing walls without cannons or catapults is realistic but very boring. The problem is that the AI pins you down on the wall and it quickly turns to a huge blob of soldiers fighting on a narrow ledge while most of them cant do anything and just stand there. Add to this that archers wont release arrows on enemies on the same wall. This needs serious rework in my opinion. 

Sea raiders are very powerful and overshadow pretty much every faction in combat in the beginning. It doesnt feel very realistic.

UI could be better and more streamlined. Trading basic goods requires unnecessary steps and I do miss the controls to order soldiers to take steps in a direction without breaking formation. I like that I can scale banners but even on smallest they take up too much space. 

The entire court thing is very meh and unimpactful. 

Some good points:
I like the generals, plenty to level up that give generic buffs and abilities without feeling misplaced or ""fantasised"". Finding gear is fun.

The campaign is decent so far with raiders and random events that effect my gameplay.

Resource production makes sense, I just wish I could make trades last longer than 10 rounds. 

Gaining gratitude and things like gear for generals from the populace is a very good mechanic that makes sense.

AI in battles is a step up from shogun 2. Warriors dont feel as clumped together and move more independently.

The map is large enough for me.

So hey, here's another review from someone who has barely started the game. For good first impressions.

First, the performance: it's fantastic, game runs really well. They got this right with Troy too, so no surprises here.

Some pretty interesting new Campaign mechanics right at the start as well - no idea why people says this is a Troy re-skin, considering the game quickly introduces new mechanics (and doesn't utilise the same faction mechanics from Troy).

Outposts are a nice amalgamation of some campaign mechanics and buildings from previous TW, in a way that feels more interactive too - structures built outside of the settlement that give passing friendly armies bonuses, and can be sacked by enemies. Each region has multiple points for building Outposts, so deciding what to build where adds a nice new bit of tactical choice. They also refund some of the movement cost used to reach them, further incentiving you to interact with them.

One of the outpost types is a Fort, and units garrisoned there have reduced upkeep and will help with defending sieges in the region - I like that as some extra versatility for defense.

The game uses a resource system for buildings, like Troy, which I always find more interesting than simply using gold costs. Seasons and the weather affect output of buildings, especially food producing ones - another good detail.

The Court system is a really interesting new political system - unlike in TW:Rome or TW:3K, here you have multiple playable factions sharing the same Court - all Egyptian factions are part of the Egyptian Court, as one would expect, with the Pharaoh at the top and different seats below. This give some more room for diplomacy and espionage creativity, with a nice system of intrigue actions.

Ambitions - quests that you select from a few choices - also add a nice new bit of tactical choice and incentives to push you to move forward in the campaign. Which Ambitions are offered to you depend on your ruler and also on your past completed Ambitions - which can help shape your different campaigns, I'd imagine, for more replayability.

The technology tree (""Royal Decrees"") is now more of a web, with interconnecting points between military and economical technologies - more interesting to plan around and play with.

Generals are back to a three attribute system instead of a skill tree - which I think is a better choice for a Historical title. Getting to certain thresholds in different attribute combination unlock skills (most passive), and you can equip up to four of those at a time - with a timer on changing them.

The in-game encyclopedia of units, buildings and such is probably the clearest if has ever been in a TW game - I might even say it is almost becoming usable, incredible.

Some of the new campaign powers are really fun to play with too - I rather liked the way Caravans work here, I think it was a better implementation than the TW:WH3 one -planning efficient trade routes is fun for me.

Campaign Customisation are a large set of options that you'd normally need mods for; great stuff for replayability, hope they keep this on future TWs.

[b]Edit after further playing:[/b] Very good TW, might become one of my favourites.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Vast majority of negative criticism is form people that decided they hate the game the very second it was announced. Most simply because it wasn't Medieval 3.",1697363298,1697544610,True,8,1,0.536838114261627197,0,True,False,False

By far the most interesting and engaging campaign mechanics of any Total War I‚Äôve played- the resource-based, trading focused economy provides more options than just military recruitment cities or economic cities and encourages stockpiling goods in times of peace and running deficits in times of war. This gives a little more flexibility for raising more troops when necessary, but puts how long you can field them on a timer, which does a good job of breaking up the endless conquest snowball that most Total War campaigns eventually devolve into. A nice touch is that there‚Äôs decent regional variation in what can be built on the campaign map- settlements on the Nile can build extra food buildings, for instance.

The outpost system is a great addition to the series. Outposts refund 50% of the movement you spend to get to them, and this bonus applies again when the extra movement lets you reach another outpost. They can easily double your armies‚Äô movement range in your own territory if you‚Äôve built a network of them, and they provide substantial economic and army bonuses on top of the movement buffs. They make it a lot easier to catch armies in your territory, which has been a long-standing issue in the series. 

Battles are okay, nothing revolutionary. They feel like older games in the series, slower-paced with more emphasis on outmaneuvering enemy units rather than micromanaging optimal matchups for each unit. Even tier one units will hang on for a minute or two when matched up against top-tier foes in melee, giving you a chance to flank opposing units or wear them down with missile fire. Missiles generally are only effective against low-armor opponents without shields, at least in my experience, so melee brawls end up being the defining feature of most battles. So far, the relative lack of unit diversity hasn‚Äôt been a problem for me- what you can recruit is largely tied to the province you‚Äôre in, so as you work your way to different areas of the map, your army compositions will change. I think there‚Äôs a decent chance that I‚Äôll miss a more diverse roster over time, but for now I‚Äôm having a blast anyway. 

I‚Äôm enjoying the game a lot more than I thought I would, and I feel like I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth out of it.

The formations are trash i.e. advanced, shield wall and hold position. Seemingly provide no real benefit and the AI are clunky as hell getting into formation. Would recommend you play battles the way you would in warhammer, which is super dumb, why cant formations be like three kingdoms in terms of quality?

Politics - ace.

Resource Management - ace

Scale of world/setting - sub-par

World map aesthetics - best to date

Unit variety - finding it hard to enjoy total war games where the only cavalry type are chariots.

Unit composition - Gold tier (tier VI) is unstoppable - needs nerf or limit to how many you can field per army (might be adjustable in custom settings? Unsure).

Overall I recommend if you want a foundational/solid game with great potential.
If you're on the fence, I'd wait until the first one, maybe two, dlc drops before purchase to see the direction they are taking this game.

I play a lot of Paradox games and this is a refreshing change of pace as the combat is much dynamic and engaging. I don't like the Saga series and this is not one of them. It's a return to the Rome/Attila model of gameplay. I will be coming back to learn the game mechanics and systems in more detail once I get tired of Diablo's new season. 

The game looks good and plays well./ I did get frame drops when the game is simulating the computer's turn, but it was smooth in every battle at native 4k on a 32inch monitor being powered by 3700x w/ a 3080. Trade is simple, but intuitive and helps the game develop. This is the era where global trade was beginning to develop and it's simulated well here. 

I did not like how bronze was simulated. Certain regions can just make it and histroically tin was a strategic asset that was imported from mainly England and Afghanistan. I feel that have a mechanic for tin would make the game more engaging. I also did not like that we are limited to 3 factions at launch. I know they will be available as DLC in the future, but it feels lacking without having the proto-Greeks and other eastern civilizations. Sumerians would be pushing it, maybe as a formable nation, but we should have a bigger world with more factions.

I'm a lover of Shogun 2 primarily and haven't been all that much interested in Total War games because they don't cover history that is compelling to my personal taste.

Total War: PHAROAH is set in Ancient Egypt during the 19th Dynasty with an elderly Pharaoh Merneptah on the throne - the campaign map passes through modern day Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria & Turkey and offers 8 factions of three cultures: Egyptian, Canaanite & Hittite respectively (4, 2, 2 respectively).

The campaign is played with the goal of claiming the throne of either Pharaoh or Hittite Great King through a mixture of civil war & legitimacy based on multiple factors, fighting for supremacy & surviving end-game crisis of the 'Sea People'.
Though the game lacks a large selection of unit types due to the period (sword, club, axe, two-handed axe, javelins, slings, bows, composite bows & chariots) it has two key strengths that make combat compelling:
1. Unit Variety: each realm has 10-11 'native' troops and there are 8 realms in the game & each faction has 11-12 unique units. And these are not superficial differences either. For example Lower Egyptian Militia can travel through dessert without attrition, have clubs & shields that are good against armour, but might struggle against Haribu militia who cope worse with hot temperatures but have axes that will have strong bonuses against shields.
2. The importance of terrain: due to the types of units flanking/positioning and unit matchup is key. Unit Weight has a dramatic effect on sandy terrain for example with units suffering movement penalties scaled with how heavy they are opening up lots of fresh opportunities for strategy.

Other highlights in Pharoah include:
- Beautiful thematic UI & artwork (I highly recommend the 2D unit cards you can set in the settings)
- Outpost system and forts add a new dimension to movement & protecting provinces
- Split between recruiting from local realms & factions keeps things fresh
- Pantheon of deities to devote self to for corresponding gameplay buffs (favour to improve passive bonus, can pray at shrines to help armies, can designate generals to give them bonuses)
- Court system allows you to gain regard with others, plot against others & make requests as you work to take the throne.
- Civil War Mechanic / Legitimacy used to seize the crown
- Ancient Legacy & Victory Point system allows for structure of goals for player to form a narrative

Overall probably one of the best Campaign / RTS games covering Ancient Egypt created to date and I'm really impressed with what CA Sophia has achieved, despite my scepticism caused by the way I've seen the TW community behaving as of late.

I'm looking forward to future updates & expansions and I think the underwhelming reception / negative reviews come from two areas.
1. A lack of interest in the time period (people want Rome 3, Medieval 3, Shogun 3 or Empire 2 it seems).
2. It being trendy to find fault and criticise CA at every opportunity because of unrelated historic grievances.

My only issue with the game so far is the typos / grammar mistakes in the encyclopedia & tutorials and the default absurd size of unit banners which can thankfully be turned down in interface settings.",1697478748,1697478944,True,4,1,0.52154916524887085,0,True,False,False

It's a shame so many decided Total War: Pharaoh was bad the minute it was announced, and a sizable portion of the player base will never give it a fair shake. It's a tight, polished experience that performs well, has a fantastic art direction, and some great new features that add a lot of life to the campaign. Battles last longer than some of TW's other more recent entries, which is a plus, and fighting across the lands directly invaded by the so-called Sea Peoples makes for a great setting.

I acknowledge that the last point is much more subjective. I'm under the impression that the majority of TW-players would rather get a more eurocentric title, namely either a return to the Middle Ages or to the early modern period. Eh... their loss is my gain, at least for now. What can I say? I'm a Bronze Age boy through and through.

But I did get my degree studying that stuff, so maybe I'm biased.

My main quibble would be that a lot of the ""generic"" generals and faction leaders look very similar to each other. More visual diversity among them would be nice, but maybe that will happen once more playable factions are added to the game and other cultures visited. Would love to see Ugarit get some time in the spotlight.

As for my experience with it; I've been playing two Campaigns, one as the Hittite King, Suppiluliuma, and one as the Egyptian ruler Tausret. I've been enjoying both far more than I thought I would, as I was initially hesitant to get the game because of its seemingly limited offerings of units, and a relatively small worldmap. Here's some pro's and cons to see if this game is for you.

Things I Liked:
[list]
    [*] [b]A Beautiful Graphical Engine- [/b] especially considering atmospheric effects. Considering samey-feeling battles and a stagnant campaign map, even in Warhammer with all its corruption mechanics; the game does a wonderful job to add a different vibe as the world goes through the Bronze Age Collapse, with a lot of variety in every stage.
    [*]  [b] Stellar Native Unit Recruitment- [/b] is a rewarding system on multiple levels. It greatly increases unit diversity, especially playing a longer campaign as a single faction, and keeps fighting the same faction in different cultural regions engaging. Heavily armoured Anatolian Spearmen require a different approach than Nubian Archers, or hard-hitting Upper Egyptian Khopesh infantry.
    [*]  [b] Much Improved Campaign & Battle AI- [/b] no other Total War game has had me feeling more like a military strategist than PHARAOH has. On the campaign map, factions, and especially invaders all have their own specific playstyle which shines through a lot more than in many older titles. A certain wave of Sea Peoples might specifically target settlements, while your cultural neighbours might raid and plunder your outposts with small incursions, before looping around the territory of another faction to catch you in an undefended region. General battle-ai has been strongly improved too, with the AI seemingly being able to make 'task forces', and able to re-prioritize units [b] after [/b] they've already engaged in combat; a large achievement over the AI from Warhammer or Troy.
    [*] [b] Historical Battle Tactics [/b] As for battles too, while there is still room for improvement, taking units strengths and weaknesses into account further than 'fast melee unit goes after missiles' has never been more satisfying. I've been able to win seemingly hopeless battles by clever positioning and tactics that would have seemed nonviable in older titles. Despite units being able to hold, morale seems more important than ever, helped by the relative usefulness of some missile units in melee combat. And [b] if [/b] you get their pathfinding to behave, micro-ing chariots while managing your defensive lines can be tremendously satisfying and fun. 
    [*]  [b] Accuracy and Setting [/b]- however this weighs for you is gonna be very personal. I have a stronger personal interest in Bronze Age history than say, the Roman Iron Age, so I do want to be upfront about that. For me, seeing this ancient world slowly (and literally!) disappear into darkness as countless invading hordes, famines, droughts and unrest begin to destabilise the world was a wonderful and more emotionally narrative experience than I've had yet in a Total War title. Seeing Cultural Centres fall one by one, and defending Suppiluliuma's throne from a growing number of pretenders, while finding ways to most efficiently distribute my units to even keep afloat was a wonderful challenge. Adding to that the Religion system (somewhat similar to the western allegiance mechanic in Shogun 2), the very active Royal Courts, and accurate yet diverse unit rosters, I've found PHARAOH to be a very immersive experience, with a different and more deliberate pace setting it apart from other recent titles.
    [*] [b] Clear and Aesthetically pleasing UI [/b]- a successful iteration upon Troy, TW's recent releases all have increasingly clear and visually consistent interfaces, nailing a balance between symbols, flavour, mechanical clarity, in a beautifully if non-distracting presentation.
    [*] [b] Campaign Map & Economy [/b]- in another note taken from Troy, the 4-resources system is back but strongly re-balanced. Lacking in a resource provides challenges and goals, and creates a different playstyle all in itself. Down in mountain desert terrain, you might be able to field quality bronze-reinforced units, but be restricted by food given how other strong factions guard their access to the Nile. In fertile Anatolia, you might be able to field vast armies of Militia and lower tier units, but struggle against fortified positions. Canaan is a nice mix of both, though their fisheries lack the growth-bonuses other farmlands grant. Outposts, while their bonuses seem initially trite, provide an interesting way to buff your armies and can be absolute gamechangers. Forts can be filled with reinforcement armies at discounted upkeeps, Shrines give a variety of bonuses dependant on your pantheon, and all other buildings also grant useful passive boons [i] as well [/i] as a bonus to each army that visits them; which also always replenishes part of the movement-cost to get here. It's an interesting and clever system, and all the more useful when an invading army pops up and you need to get a defensive force there over a large distance.
[/list]

Things I Disliked:
[list]
    [*] [b]The Price- [/b] though PHARAOH's general quality, balancing, and gameplay all hold up, a full-price title usually grants you a larger scope in campaign and faction diversity, which of course impacts replayability. This is off-set by the extensive campaign customisation options, but the fact of the matter is that compared to Three Kingdoms or the Warhammer series, you are getting less bang for your buck.
    [*]  [b] Strange Battle Camera Limitations- [/b] depending on the battle, I simply haven't been able to pull the camera out as much as I'm used to (before being forced to used Tactical Mode). While I've adapted during play, it's a strange and grating design decision.
    [*]  [b] Missing Factions- [/b] while I understand upcoming DLCs will be very affordable and I understand the realities of game development, I greatly missed the opportunity to play as Minoa or the Kassite-Babylonians.
    [*] [b] Rare if persistent UI Bugs [/b] especially in province-building and character-creation screens. Some faulty game-logic seems to misunderstand the current UI-states, locking you out of constructing buildings or outposts at times. They're fixable, but a strange blemish on an otherwise polished game.
    [*] [b] Chariot Pathfinding [/b] absolutely sucks, especially- but not exclusively- when commanding more than one unit of them. A shame since when used well they're very fun and efficient units.
[/list]

Something I Hated:
[list]
   [*] [b] Wandering Tribe Invasions- AFTER surviving the Sea Peoples [/b] will continue to harass you and plunder your outposts. They appear randomly in the west and north of Anatolia and the west of Egypt from almost turn one and are an annoying chore to deal with, especially in the late game.
[/list]

In conclusion, while far from perfect, I've enjoyed my time with PHARAOH a lot. It's highly polished and beautifully produced, but sits in a strange place in the Total War pantheon; more premium than a Saga game, yet not as impressive in scope as games like Three Kingdoms. If you like the setting, I highly recommend it though.",1697455746,1697455746,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

I think it's so cool to finally have a bronze age focused grand strategy game, especially a TW game. I've always been interested in playing Egyptians or Hittites from the period. The scope of the campaign focuses on Egypt, Anatolia and the Levant to great detail and is very cool imo. I also really enjoy the outpost system which is similar to the building system in games like Empire but also having provincial building systems more in line with modern TW games using the workforce system (which is like population in Rome 2/ Attila). The way each region has its own native Unit roster is really cool. The game accurately depicts the warfare of the bronze age by putting focus on chariots making the period feel more unique as a TW title along with Troy as true Bronze Age strategy games. The only real downsides are the relatively small selection of playable factions and not having the Iraq area as part of the default campaign, although this does make sense considering the conflict this game is based on. Overall I'm looking forward to playing more of this game and seeing what CA brings to this game in the future.",1697454798,1697454798,True,1,2,0.457453608512878418,0,True,False,False

The usual culprits being whiny medieval 2 and rome 1 players who are still mad 10 years after rome 2's launch. Actually pathetic. This is a good game guys, Please do not listen to them. Do not let them drag down your opportunity to experience one of the best bronze age setting games made ever. Unfortunately total war has an extremely toxic and disgusting community much of who verbally want to destroy anything CA makes, any new ideas. And the other half wish to do the same thing unless its Medieval 3. Really sad honestly, i remember a time when companies were rewarded for pushing the boundary and trying new things. Not just being a COD clone and doing the same thing over and over. If the negative people had their way they would have medieval 3 be the same as medieval 2 with improved graphics. 

I really do not understand their problem? what is wrong with SAGA's? i like having a region of earth zoomed in and more fleshed out. That is interesting to me. Last i checked in empire total war the whole of France was one region and one city Paris. How is that fun?? Yet these people would rather have that then a expanded middle east, Egypt and turkey. Like what??
Do these people also realise that medieval 2 is a literal reskin of Rome 1. 

This game is huge, runs buttery smooth, amazing soundtrack, in depth religion and political system. Revamped trade system as well. Battles are more affected by weather location and the type of faction you are then ever before.

2. goal when playing the game: none. There are two main purposes when playing the game: to become the leader of the southern or northern forces, and to prevent the sea people from invading. Goal number 1 is quite simple and becoming ""king"" doesn't mean the game is over, goal number 2: too boring. Instead of giving players a purpose in playing, the game makes players bored with the game.
3. Replay value: the game has a very good random starting position mechanism. If it appears in 3Q, WH3 or Rome, Attila, it will truly become a bomb that makes people play again and again.

 One great addition is the concept of outposts, which refund 50% of movement points to the army that accesses them. Outposts solved one of the biggest sources of boredom in TW, which is taking a million turns just to move your army across the map.  CA has also made improvements to settlement management that makes it almost fun and less of a chore. These are all just tweaks to the formula though. 

It's just too small of a game to justify the price. I've actually would give it a thumbs up because I've enjoyed my time with it, but I already feel like I have experienced every possible scenario of the campaign map. 

That's not to say small maps can't be done. Shogun 2's map was smaller and no faction variety and I still play it to this day. Those were the days before CA got too greedy with DLCs. The difference is that map of Japan was a complete experience. Any given clan could come out on top, which kept each play through exciting.  Whereas in Pharaoh it's pretty much destined that Egypt will dominate. Pharaoh feels smaller in this respect--it feels over-scripted. 

Only Egypt is fleshed out.  I played my entire Ramses campaign without even reaching the Hittite lands in Anatolia . The third culture, Caanan, basically just sits there and doesn't even get it's own ""court"" system. Troy had the conceit of the Illiad to cause its two factions to fight and brought both sides of the map into a clash, but in this game the factions are mostly fighting themselves in civil wars and the occasional sea people's army.    

Speaking of sea peoples. They should be more of a menace. Historically they caused a lot more devastation. I want to see doomstacks ravage whole areas. Instead they come in at a trickle , burn a few huts down and get destroyed one by one. The collapse mechanic never seemed to be much of a problem and it didn't feel grim like Attila did when the huns showed up.  

 In Pharaoh however, you can literally see parts of Eurasia are grayed out just begging for the Assyrians and other factions to be added . It feels like DLC bait. As I played I kept imagining how much more epic it could be.  CA could do the equivalent of ""Immortal Empires"" and just add Troy's map to this one. It's the same engine too so they could do it if they wanted.

I don't mind the loss of unit variety , but I honestly feel that CA picked this time period because the lack of technology means less work. A pike and shot TW would require them to develop cannons, gunpowder weapons, cavalry, and the rest .

In short, TWP is a solid experience for what it is, but CA is doing the bare minimum and charging full price for it.",1697431798,1697432338,False,7,1,0.537159264087677002,0,True,False,False

How you customize your experience will greatly impart the style of play you receive, I found when you have the Sea People occurrence set to high-you (and every other nation) will do nothing but prepare for amphibious assault after assault from about turn 40? on? Now, what this does is stop most of the AI from expanding because they're busy dealing with the Sea People. So if you want a more relaxed and traditional Total War, have the Sea People on low, but if you want to constantly defend your kingdom from sea people and watch other factions fail nuke it on high. I found that every unit-even weaker units, can make a difference in the battles if used correctly. i found myself putting my archers and javelins on the flanks and having them sweep around to shoot the enemy in the back.

The use of multiple currencies doesn't really change the gameplay loop, nor does it add any real value or portray economic models as all currencies are effectively gathered the same way and effected by the same modified.
The diplomacy system is completely minimalist and greatly lacking compared to TW: 3K
The general experience and title system is quite fantastical for a ""Historical"" title, the effects of a high leveled general are firmly in the realm of God King and not mortal.
While I applaud the split between native units and faction units, there is a lack of diversity in unit effectiveness and playstyle. Basically higher tier units are just better and heavier armored so there is no reason to use light units if you can afford better units.
Additionally the lack of morale effects means units fight on until they have suffered roughly 80% casualties even when fully surrounded means battlefield maneuvering has minimal impact and terrain is very limited in effect. With general units fighting almost to the last man.
The tech tree is the same for all factions and does not provide any effects that  can change playstyle.
The one mechanic I think actually worked well is the deity and worship system. It actually felt quite varied and had interesting choices. Once again however it was quite magical for a ""Historical"" title.
The court system was fairly simplistic and quickly wore out it's welcome and became a chore.

It's beautiful, has actually pretty decent music for a modern total war, the campaigns are interesting with enough flavour and dynamism to keep things engaging.

That being said, it is wildly over priced. This is not a ""mainline"" total war by any stretch of the imagination and it should certainly not be selling for more that Warhammer III did at launch; which even without the addition of Immortal Empires, and the previous content from the earlier entries in the trilogy, Warhammer III has mountains more content for less money.

Overall, if you like Ancient Egypt, you're dying for a new Total War, or you have money with nothing better to spend it on then this won't be a poor purchase.

Short review : 

Many mechanics got an interesting come back alongside new features, feels great but get quite shallow in terms of content. Game's good but too pricey on the long run. 

Long review : 

Pros : 

+ revamped economy 
+ awesome optimisation 
+ campaign settings 
+ landmarks mechanics 
+ territorial recruitment + faction units
+ hero customisation / items 
+ Invasions lots of them 
+ collapse mechanics 
+ religion is back 
+ kingdom and court mechanics 

Cons : 

- not enough playable factions 
- not enough cultures 
- IA bugged most of the time especially during battle 
- chariots really are a pain in the ass to use, feel buggy
- overpriced 
- the map feels tiny since it doesn't have that much stuff and we really want what's around 

What I want in the future : 

- Greece 
- assyria 
- babylonia 
- more territories and its respective units 
- chariots rework 
- playable sea people 
- mp real-time campaign

==========
TL;DR:
==========

- Absolutely amazing entry, the best one I've played in a long time
- An amazing mix of everything I love about past Total Wars, with huge improvements to things like the user interface, which takes some learning but is brilliant and intuitive in the end, and insane customizeability, plus tons of new flavor/RPG additions that scratch and itch I have been wanting TWs to for years.
- If you're okay with the colorful aesthetic [some call it cartoonish, I call it accurate to the colorful civilizations and armies of the past] it's absolutely gorgeous
- More than accurate enough to scratch my historiographer itch (I am obsessed with history and love the bronze age)
- Can be as insanely challenging or as comfortable and easy as you want it to be (try the Hittites/Supiluliuma, tons of fun, crazy tough at first)

I am legitimately too obsessed with TWs, and when I have one of those artful, goosebumps moments, where I think ""Whoa, I care about this campaign, these characters, this plot and journey... I feel transported back to history"", this is when Total War is at its best to me, and Pharaoh has given me several of those moments already in its first weekend out.

==========
Extended review/rant
==========

I say all of this as a die hard fan of the historicals. Started with Shogun and Rome way back when, but for many years been playing basically just, in order of play time, rome 2 + DeI, attila + mk1212, and thrones + shieldwall. Sure, I am not unwilling to play anything since they messed with collision--i'm not THAT hardcore/hipster about it. Rome 2 and DeI is an incredible experience, and more than plenty to make up for what the later installments removed that the early ones did well.

And they absolutely nailed it this time. The game is a wonderful mix of total war with a variety of Paradox/CK3 style flavor added into the mix, which has been missing for years. A ton of RPG flavor, insane customizeability to a level I did not even begin to grasp at first (there are SO MANY options I am seeing where I am like YES, they have needed this UI option for YEARS!!! FINALLY!!), and perhaps equally as important as anything, the UI itself is ACTUALLY CLEAR and intuitive such that I am seeing and learning all of my options and capabilities within the game interface, on campaign and on battle views.

Now here's the thing--like any total war game, or any game of any complexity, the UI can seem clunky or bad at first--and there are definitely things they need to work out. But in just one weekend of playtime, I have learned how it all works--which is at LEAST as good, or better, than any other total war game I remember learning. I think that if anyone says otherwise, they have simply been playing them too long to remember how much they had to learn at first.

I stress the UI and campaign-level RPG features so much because they turn out to be hugely important when you play a game that overwhelmingly takes place on the campaign map. But, onto the gameplay itself--there are issues, but there are also great things. The collision could use some work, the stickiness could DEFINITELY use some work. You have to fight to get your money's worth out of your chariots, they will stick very easily, and change direction/start moving extremely sluggishly. Which, to an extent, is not unrealistic, but when your foot traps insta-pivot and run rapidly to their destination, and chariots have to fight out of sludge not matter how you apply them, it's an issue. Still, they are useful enough in a cavalry role (flank cycle charging, distraction/diversion, taking out missile troops, etc) to be worth having at least one.

That said, the battles are awesome and gorgeous--again, they take a bit of getting used to, but again, no more than any TW game. At first I was really annoyed at the forestry obstructing the hell out of so many of my battles (I started as Hittites in Anatolia, which is no desert/darker and foresty) but quickly realized I can turn off foliage to see more clearly. This has been in a lot of past TWs, but it was made more clear here after being an issue at first, because of, again, great UI.

I really love this game already, so I want to do it justice, and want to account for all the great things and the things that need improvement, so this review is a work in progress.

Okay, now some details and list items to try to get more juicy detail.

Pros:
- Gorgeous aesthetic, accurate enough to the time period to satisfy my history obsession
- Super fun RPG/Paradox-style flavor additions, like Court, Ambitions, ancient Legacies, a Shemshu Hor cycle, honoring gods, leader/general customizeability [even more if you are the high king/pharaoh]
- You can now simply directly click on siege ladders to get your troops to use them (!), with the cursor turning into a ladder to indicate as such
- [WIP]

Cons:
- Chariots are not great. They stick, are even slower to move than i think real chariots would be, altho they would be sluggish and awkward--but it is not realistic relative to foot troop movement. Still useful, but not great.
- Showing/hiding the army panel no longer seems to have a shortcut hotkey (I could be missing it, but I am a huge hotkey fanboy, and could not find it in the controls settings) and when I did it repeatedly in a battle by clicking the show/hide arrow in the bottom right of the army panel, it actually bugged out such that the panel slowly moved more up the screen each time i did it, hahaha, so clearly a bug or two to work out here and there, but this was the only actual one i found.

[will finish this review when I am more able to put together thoughts cohesively/write down all the detailed stuff i love about this game, but for now wanted to get a positive review out there to try to balance out all the negative reviews from people who didn't seem to play it more than an hour or two]",1697398433,1697398433,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

But I stuck with it and kept chipping away.  Like Troy and Britannia they have taken a step in a different direction when it comes to settlement management and a general overhaul. This is what puts you off at the start as its not like the preceding games so the change is a shock to the system.  You literally have to think about where and what you have to build and how the outposts work (these are not like Warhammer 3 outposts). Trade,bartering and Court management are more involved now and can make the difference between surviving the opening turns or dying in the heat. My first opinion is now swaying to the positive every turn.  Yes the unit tree is limited at the moment but I suspect this will expand the more the game advances and as you know from the other games they are regularly updated even after a few years. If you love Total war games and are willing to put the time in regardless of the defeats. Then this game will only grow on you and become a stable on your play list.  Remember 
1. Its a change in direction and its that change that makes you baulk at 1st.
2. Its bronze age so don't expect Medieval total war or Attila.
3. Do expect to mess up for a while, until you at least get use to the mechanics
4. Give it time it will grow on you, trust me. 
5. Yes its expensive but most games these days but what you do get is the knowledge that you will get additions as it develops.
6. Its educational.
7. No i didn't get it for free

I think this one will survive the sands of time.

These are all businesses. They are here to make profit. Nothing more. These aren't the companies of the late 90's or early 2000's. These are greedy, lazy, and profoundly deteriorating fortune 500 companies seeking to make a buck off the majority of unaware gamers. Most of the people leaving positive reviews have either never played all the TW games, or are content being spoon fed whatever the developers feel like cooking up.

When I boot up a game and it's clear as day a copy/paste of another game, then we have a problem. However, this problem does not only exist with CA. This is commonplace now among the entire gaming industry. When companies such as Bethesda even screw up and start going downhill, then you know we're in the shit. The standard now is to produce products that aren't optimized, finished, or lazily redone and slapped with a different title. Any smart person paying attention to trends can see what's going on. These companies put out half assed garbage and the people eat it up. Because what are a bunch of keyboard warriors going to do about it? Absolutely nothing. All most of the player base does is cry and moan in forums and attack others who disagree with them. so the companies win. We're too busy fighting each other over garbage while the companies are pulling in profit.

People need the wake the fuck up. The games are shit and we have other games to compare them to as proof. GAMES THAT ARE STILL BEING PLAYED 10-20 YEARS LATER. Can I see myself playing TW Pharaoh 20 years from now? Most likely not but I sure as heck will be playing Rome 2 or other masterpieces before CA and so many other gaming companies took a dive headfirst into the corporate greed train.

For those of you concerned about refunds: call your bank and dispute it for ""faulty product"" or ""lack of customer service."" The latter most likely since Steam doesn't play ball after you play a game for a few hours to only find out it's nothing what you expected.

The battles are fun, in my opinion, because all the different infantry types feel different, unlike previous titles where heavy infantry was the only viable option.

Chariots function like cav from previous games, which I'm more than ok with, as cavalry was essentially non-existent at this point in time.

Another note, this game runs so amazingly smooth, I can't believe it. It literally run better than Rome 2, which is a decade old at this point.

I will agree the game is not entirely fleshed out and isnt the ""historical"" title players were wanting but it holds the potential for so much growth historically or ahistorically that it can be a very fleshed out and beautiful game in the future. 

Pros: I personally like the new armor mechanic because even though it makes battles longer it makes it feel slightly less arcade-like as the recent games have felt. 
I really enjoy the current characters and recognize the room for growth in other areas where they can add Persia and the Aegian or more of Africa to get more replayability at the expense of historical accuracy. 
I like the unit upkeep system and find it more enjoyable to manage since i need actual military production to support my military. 

cons: WHAT ARE THE CHARIOTS OMG
Some new game mechanics not very well explained in game so i need either the tutorial or figuring it out myself. 
character skill trees are kind of boring and oversimplified (which is okay i just wish there was more)
Balancing issues which im sure the devs are already well aware of.

As others have said it is basically a re-skin of Troy, without the mythical mode or any story.  (A mythical mode would have been insanely cool.)  Short version, this game feels incomplete. 

The new court mechanic is a let down, you start with one action a turn, which doesn't really do much. You can basically play without it. 

Religion should be cool and immersive in an Egyptian game, Its not, you can basically play without it. 

Diplomacy is really broken. In my current play through with Amenmesse, no one wants to make nonaggression or ally with me, unless I pay them significantly, often asking for cities.  However, for slightly more in gold they will become my vassals. I realized this late, gold really doesn't have much use, so in a few turns I used my stockpile, now I'm rolling with 35 vassals covering about 85% of the map.  A few turns later some will now freely confederate.

Economy is broken, as others have said, with out constant trading you can barely afford armies. I am going to go out on a limb and say most TW players don't want to have dozens of barter trades going that they have to constantly remake just to keep their 2 armies of basic militia fed. The computer does not seem to have this issue. Same economic setup as Troy with food, bronze. stone, gold, and wood, but not balanced for costs. In Troy you also had limited ability to make and maintain armies but the costs & opponents were balanced for it.   Almost all buildings take a good amount of stone, at least as Egypt, which is silly. 

Marauding armies that don't stop spawning. Its got them. Personally, I just never liked this in TW games.

Appears there are no Agents to be made.

UI its not terrible, however it also feels like its not finished.  IE its back to pin buttons instead of hovering for a couple seconds to lock like WH3.

 - Religion's cult based system is both historically accurate and fun.

Just play the game, it's a fantastic base for whatever the devs and modders decide to do, set in an interesting era; and maybe someone can copy some of it over to patch up the abomination that is Troy.

if you are comparing this game to others that have had years of patches and overhaul mods available, either mod it yourself or wait.

Been playing TW since Shogun and in those 20+ years spent thousands of hours enjoying one of my favorite gaming IPs.  So what don't I like about this game?

First I think it is misnamed, it should be labeled A Total War Saga: Pharaoh, because it is of the same scope as Troy.  But where Troy had 3 game modes, this only has one mode.  So you are not getting a Rome, Shogun or Empires, you are getting a stripped down Troy version of Ancient Egypt.

So what is not in the game and why I do not consider this a Total War title...

Heroes, there are no Priests, no Spies, no Champions

Faction Tech Trees, every faction uses the same tech tree

No skill trees, don't bother trying to plan a build between Amber, Red and Blue abilities, just put a point anywhere on your general and move on

No dedicated mounts to unlock, want to have a chariot for your general, hope one drops for you and I hope your armor, weapon and shield are compatible with it, mounts are all RNG.... good luck

No enjoyable battles, some of my most memorable moments in computer gaming have been TW battles, I tore through a Hittite campaign because I was just auto resolving fights because I did not like fighting my units (something that I have loved doing since Shogun!)

No fun trait system to tweak your generals, now you have a This or That system of traits and even when you do get a trait good luck trying to figure out what it does, because it won't show on the character screen, not even if you mouse over it, so playing the game within a game of getting traits for your general... meh... just keep moving nothing to see here

So what is in the game?

Outposts, I will admit i think this mechanic has potential but like William Wallace, was poorly executed.  You spent every turn sending your generals to different outposts to keep up different buffs, and I think they are honestly OP.  It was nice to build something other than invisible upgrades to your province and I think this is an interesting mechanic, but to quote Mark Rosewater in his fantastic GDC Vault speech 20 years/20 lessons, don't confuse interesting with fun

Gossiping, yup, hope you enjoy gossiping every turn... like Every Turn... seriously?!?!?  EVERY TURN you have to go to a screen and gossip and scheme at court.  You won't fight every turn, but you will gossip...oh yes... you WILL gossip.

So I started every character to get a feel for the game, then I played and finished a Hittite campaign, then I started a Ramesses campaign with the intent to finish, but I got a few hours into it and I just did not like playing the game, that was hard for me, to admit I did not like a Total War game.

but like I said in the beginning I think this game is misnamed and probably should be called...

Map is limited in scope (just 3 main Civs), battles are a tradeoff of melee foot units, archers and chariots - no creative use of unit types, variety of deployable buffs from general.

While I agree that the price is too high for this game, especially at a time with a cost of living crisis and the recent fallout from CA‚Äôs handling of Shadows of Change, this game is really good. 

Total War: Pharaoh brings a host of new mechanics that make it a worthy successor to the historical mainline games, and with DLC I foresee this becoming one of the best historical total wars. 

The period is very interesting, and the campaign reminds one of Total War: Attila or Barbarian Invasion. Where you must survive a collapse of civilisation and guide your faction through these troubling times. It‚Äôs fantastic to see Egypt in its prime represented finally in a Total War (not counting Rome 1). 

The outpost system is a welcome addition that brings back forts and watchtowers in a good way. This also adds a good layer to province management that is welcome. It brings to mind a similar system that was in Empire: Total War.  

The new court, legitimacy and civil war system feels like a vast improvement over Rome 2‚Äôs clunky political system. With it feeling more natural for civil wars to break out and legitimacy playing a prime role in the authority of the Pharaoh or Great King. I also like that factions aren‚Äôt bound to their home culture, and can participate in any race for the throne. Which echoes real life where Egypt was ruled over by foreign dynasties. 

The scope is limited I agree. The lack of Babylonians, Assyrians and Mycaneans is noticeable.

I like all the new mechanics, the unique traits and the commandments of the different faction leaders. Always something to strife for and unlock, and it really sucks you in as you play. Feels a lot more advanced than previous games.

The units is fairly varied, as much as possible for a game from this time in history, and I really like that you can recruit different units depending on region, and the fact that you unlock even better units if you become Pharaoh og Great King. Great idea. 

The graphics and the map is beautiful and feels alive, and the game even runs perfect on an average PC like mine (3060 ti and 13600 cpu). 

I look forward to (hopefully) win my first campaign as Ramesses and then try out some of the other factions.

You really have to understand the mechanics of the game to be able to enjoy the game with the proper strategy. It's slightly different from Troy but in a lot of ways the same. When you attempt to engage in certain diplomacy the game glitches and it makes it so you can't commit to any sort of non-aggression pact, or alliance and so forth. However, I noticed the turn after, the other faction was able to offer me a non-aggression pact. So, obviously there's an absolute tonne of glitches we'll all notice, and there will be a tonne of patches I'm sure. The thing that boggled my mind was the fact that I bought the cheapest version of the game just to see how it was, then I ran into a bit of an issue of not being able to buy or download other content after the fact. I think this was a very rushed game to market with a potentially limited budget. They approached everything about this in the wrong way by ignoring the entire community of what we actually wanted. Everyone wanted Medieval 3, Rome 3 and so forth. But at the same time, maybe due to the fact that they were able to swap so much over from Troy they potentially made it cheap where it didn't really much matter and then charged high prices because they knew the hardcore fans would buy it regardless. Either way, if this turns into a complete fail and some guy at a corporate desk thinks it's because people don't want the historically based games-- 100% is not the case. A lot of us wanted a Bronze Age based Total War, but we didn't want a limited map. I think I can speak for the entire community that we're sick of being given the bare minimum effort on projects and we're also sick of having to rely on the mod teams to actually make the campaigns enjoyable. Maybe go out of your way and hire those guys.

All I ask, is please keep in touch with the community. And if the guys at the forefront of the game that are creating the game are only doing what is asked rather than offering their absolute unfiltered artistic input, speak up and let the people in charge know why we're going the wrong direction; having a bunch of DLC and limited games is pissing off the entire community. I only see a little over 2000 people playing Pharaoh right now on the weekend. Pleas get a team that cares to make a massive game and commit to what the community is asking for and those numbers will be a hell of a lot higher and will bring in people that are new to total war. The only people you have buying these games are most likely, in my opinion, people like me that have been around since Shogun. I'm giving a positive review because there's potential and because you guys have already been ripped on enough.

Please fix the bugs soon. Stop being sell-outs. And I hope the people that own the company actually play the games, if not please sell it to someone worthy of the Total War Legacy.

They removed the traditional one-resource-fits-all gold system of past entries in favor of the multi-resource system from Troy. Players now need to manage settlements that produce gold, bronze, stone, wood, and food, which makes minor settlements feel more impactful. However, this also introduced two major issues in conjunction with the ridiculously large campaign map. 

First, all resources are stored infinitely in the void--there are no stockpiles in large settlements, for example. In the late game, this becomes a problem when every faction has stockpiled so many resources that their settlements become superfluous. It doesn't matter if you've captured all of a faction's major and/or food producing settlements, they'll continue to sustain their multiple 20-stack armies off their near bottomless reserves. Captured all a faction's bronze producing settlements? They'll still continue to throw hordes of bronze-equipped armies at you for the same reason.

The second issue with this resource system is the lack of supply lines. I'm not advocating for the complexity you'd see in a Paradox game, but there's an issue with factions capturing huge swathes of non-contiguous territory, sometimes on the other side of the map from their capitols. This becomes a problem when they can begin raising huge armies from territories that are entirely cut off from the rest of their territories, or prevent you from securing provinces by taking a single random territory that they could realistically never support. At a certain point, the lack of supply lines becomes immersion breaking and frustrating. 

I mentioned earlier that the map is huge, and it starts to feel more bloated than anything else. Destroying factions and taking territory starts to become a chore at a certain point. A workforce system was implemented to prevent factions from instantly upgrading their settlements, but the consequence is that the already-management heavy late game becomes even more management heavy. It's not unusual for you to start your turn with over 20 notifications of possible settlement construction and upgrades that must be managed manually. When you own 60+ territories and still must continue to constantly develop all of them to manage invasions from every direction, it just becomes tedious.

Compounding this, the map has a system of roads that prevent desert attrition. Marching your troops off these roads will open you up to severe attrition penalties for your armies unless you have the proper outposts. However, not all adjacent provinces are connected by roads, and transporting your armies around one side of the map to another can take quite a while. However, this is where the AI starts to simply become a nuisance. AI generals and factions have no sense of self-preservation, and they will gladly take massive attrition penalties and doom their armies to destroy your outposts. This barely provides them any positive benefit and significantly reduces their military power, but it's incredibly annoying to deal with as a player. This is not an exaggeration--the AI will literally raise single-unit armies to destroy your outposts, even though it cripples their own economies.

TW:Pharaoh introduces new court and Pharaoh power systems, which are intended to add depth and strategy to the game. However, the court system can descend into just another box to check to end your turn very quickly. Instead of picking a course of action once per court rotation, you have to manually select an action every single turn, and you rapidly reach a point where you stop getting meaningful benefit from them. Court positions can give you bonuses to recruitment and development but also, annoyingly, make you a constant target of AI factions trying to reduce your legitimacy. At some point, one of the dozens of AI schemes with a 19% chance of success will succeed if you allow it to go through, and it's going to be frustrating.

Pharaoh powers give you unique upgrades if you become Pharaoh/High King, but some of them are literally broken. I took a power that would allow me to annex a faction that has below a certain amount of territories, but it simply didn't function. The button was always greyed out, and hovering over it would just pop-up a blank white box.

The campaign economy mechanics seem the best in a total war game so far, providing a more interesting resource management situation with multiple currencies and increased utility in using trade features to acquire those currencies or liquidate excesses. Because copper for example is both a rare resource, and also required to recruit and pay the maintenance cost for the best units, it seems like it will be hard to have mid or late game elite doom stacks marching around. It seems you really will need to be more strategic about your army composition and upkeep. The outpost system adds a more interesting way to manage your settlement's hinterland than other total war games have provided. Really most of the notable design improvements on earlier total war games are in the campaign mechanics less than in the battles. 

Biggest negative for me, at present the multiplayer campaign seems to constantly desync, making it effectively unplayable. This will probably be patched, I realize campaign multiplayer is of interest to a niche group in the community, but I am in that niche.

They are exciting and I genuinely don't know if I am going to win or lose. Napoleon Total War was a great game, but the battles were just drawing your army up in a straight line. Empire Total War was badly criticised when it was released. Pharaoh Total War is way better than 3 Kingdoms which was so disappointing.

Another thing people complain about is the price. But they are missing the point. The price is relative to how many hours you get out of the game. So people raved about the price of Baldurs Gate 3. I uninstalled it after 5 hours. So for me it was a really expensive game. For Rome 2 I have had over a 1,000 hours use, so it is really good value. I am expecting to get the same out of Pharaoh with the expansions, so it becomes good value. Look at all the DLC you have to buy for Warhammer 1/2/3 and people complain about the price of Pharaoh!",1697317326,1697317326,True,9,5,0.494378060102462769,0,True,False,False

First off I need to point out that the most recently released total war game i played before this was Warhammer 3, which is essentially an updated version of Warhammer 1 from 2016, so I haven't played Britannia, Troy or Three Kingdoms so a lot of these features that I appreciate may be holdovers from newer games that I just never played because I wasn't interested in them but they're still an improvement over Warhammer 3.

First off Pharaohs performs much better than Warhammer 3, i'm not on the technical side of game development but the load times are lightning fast and despite how good the game looks it runs at a smooth 144fps on my system on max settings, where Warhammer 3 chugs at 100fps at minimum settings and the loading times are so slow I would autoresolve battles to avoid loading screens and tab out during loading screens to do other things on my computer. When checking graphics settings it also shows you what the game will look like with different graphical options enabled so that you can quickly determine what you like.

The second major improvement I immediately noticed was the campaign customization system gives you a lot of off the shelf modding capability to make the campaign play the way you want. I didn't mess with it but a lot of the features were immediately appealing to me like the ability to make the map start explored like in Empire and Napoleon, instead of having to discover everything. you can also change things like removing random events, lategame crisis, changing bonuses to the player or AI (or just improving the pace of the game) randomizing starting positions and AI personalities too.

The resource system is also a huge improvement over the gold system of older total war games. Instead of immediately blowing all of your resources every turn to build up your economy and armies until you end up running out of stuff to spend it on you now have to manage different resources in order to expand and meet your upkeep needs. It's also interesting that you get bonuses to food production based on the seasons with different buildings. IIRC this is a feature from Troy so I didn't pay much attention to it.

The regular battles were fine, total war games have had good battle design since Rome 2 so this is unsurprising

Overall the game only really offers improvements over other total war games. There is a lot of vitriol for Pharaoh and it seems to all be coming from low IQ low testosterone individuals mindlessly bleating off whatever the youtube man told them to say. I thought I would address some of the ""criticisms"" I have seen of this game mostly because I am sick of peasants and worker drones trying to ruin everything good in the world.

1. The game is too expensive: Gaming is one of the cheapest hobbies on the planet so if this is going to break the bank for you then you should just turn off your computer to save on electricity or seriously do some research into your financing. for $60 you get a excellent video game with infinite replayability. Compare Pharaoh versus 1983's Super Mario Bros, which takes 30 Minutes to complete and cost $25(76USD in 2023). Video Games are getting cheaper and longer.

2. The Scope is too Small: A lot of people seem to be confused into thinking that CA took the map from Rome 2 and then restricted it to only cover Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Anatolia and tried to sell it as a brand new game. You're confusing Pharaoh with the Age of Bronze mod for Rome 2 where they did exactly that. This game has an 54 Province map, Rome II has a 57 province map, so they're the same size just scaled differently.

3. There isn't enough variety: This is a historical total war game so the concept of variety is limited to what was historically available, all that really means is reskinning the same unit of swordsmen and maybe some minor stat changes to represent soldiers from wildly different cultures. Which is something they in fact do in this game quite extensively, I think this system is much better because it helps to teach you about different minor cultures that were washed out by the massive scale of Rome II. There are 8 different regional cultures with their own distinct units in the game. They're not linked to any specific faction like in other total war games so you can recruit them just by holding the territory where they're available and having the right buildings. 
If they were to add in Mesopotamia, Greece or Germany like these people are asking for then all they would be doing is adding in more reskins based on those regions. If you want to play a game with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in it with some real variety then go get the Tomb Kings DLC and Chaos Dwarves DLC for the Total Warhammer Trilogy.
This just shows how gamers are getting stupider though since back in 2011 no one was complaining about how you couldn't play as the Chinese in Shogun 2 since it was obviously a game about Japan. Even the title is the same as Shogun being named after the ruler of the country the game is focused on.

4. I don't like the bronze age warfare: That's an opinion, not a real criticism of the game. If you don't like the bronze age style of warfare then you're like a vampire touring a crucifix factory. It doesn't mean a game is bad just because you don't like fundamental aspects of it. I don't like playing Rhythm games but i'm not going to give a long drawn out negative review to Osu because of that.

I've also seen some general stupidity, someone made a review complaining that their units couldn't chase down routers because there was no cavalry. 
You can get chariots first off which were the bronze age equivalent of cavalry, but also light infantry move faster and will overrun routing enemies. the first battle I fought I was able to kill or capture the entire enemy force without any chariots because this is a constant fact of total war games that slow moving infantry get kited and can't down routers.

I also saw someone complain that there weren't enough resources and the enemy had too many resources because the AI cheats, which as I previously pointed out are all options that you can change when creating your campaign. He also complained that nighttime on the campaign map was too dark. I can't imagine how that could be a problem since everything is backlit and highlighted on the map except for geographical clutter like trees and animals placed on the map to make it look more alive. In addition you can in fact set the time of day on the campaign map to be static to different points in the day to get your perfect campaign lighting or have it cycle at your preferred pace. (this is something you can change at any time too, not just when you start your campaign)

I felt compelled to make this review to show my support to CA for making an awesome game and getting nothing but hate for it. I'm glad that we got such a good game but it's being attacked like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare did, entirely because of the irre of the NPC herd. The feces that falls from their anus has more value than anything that came out of their head or mouth since it can at least nourish the Earth. The only good thing they will ever do is waste their life and energy as wagies for their betters. If you posted a negative review for this game or have negative thoughts about it that aren't compelling then your best bet in life is to recognize your own cognitive shortcomings, stop attempting and failing to reason for yourself and just mindlessly repeat what I am saying, instead of what the rage baiting Youtuber said.

Suffice to say that if you are more intelligent than a houseplant and enjoy the Total War series, you will enjoy this game.",1697310492,1697311034,True,3,2,0.405738890171051025,0,True,False,False

As for the combat, the unit variety is more limited than other titles, but the weather and terrain systems, as well a unit formations, make the distinction between light and heavy units dramatic, a far cry from previous Total War titles with more units (of which only the heaviest 10% were actually recruited).

The court system is cool, having to juggle the intrigue whilst beating back Sea People was pretty dope.

I lost weirdly my 1st campaign at legendary because I cannot finish or move armies with no access to the event tab either. Sad, I had a great start. Talking about a great start, even if I am a TW vet since Shogun, I thought it was fairly easy as I had most legitimacy 1 turn before becoming Pharaoh at turn 45 with over 100 legitimacy. Sad I cannot move my armies anymore and finish my turn because I was on a roll and about to become Pharaoh! I was playing the Kushite clan in the South led by Amenmesse. It looks easy to become Pharaoh playing max level in 1st campaign. Difficulty seems easy for Legendary level, a level that has gone for Battle that stops at veteran now. Maybe another level of battle would have been nice considering beating the AI is fairly easy so far.

I just started a new campaign with the girl, only a few turns in but so far so good. I hope I do not end up getting stuck later like in my 1st campaign by not being able to move armies anymore and finish my turn after a battle.

The economy and trade is a joke like in Troy, AI is trading away key resources to potential opponents instead of letting them cripple. Example ? I need food badly to support my armies and used to get 4k of food per turn from other clans including those who compete for the Pharaoh title against me, lol. Economy broken just like in Troy.

AI playing a bit better with invasions and a few good calculated moves but othwerwise nothing too crazy or overly smart. Battles are fun even if I did not used many unit types yet. 

Not sure I would recommend it and like another user has written, very few people asked for a period like ancient Egypt for the next TW game. Thousands have asked for TW Med3 and by incorporating some of the gameplay of CK3, it could be an epic game. Instead, they went for this one arcadic type TW game like Troy and Troy was a disaster. Unlike Troy though, I did not get it for free, so for over 100$ pre-ordering this game, I feel like a fool atm.

I might just go back to Rome 2 with the great MOD in 3 parts Divide Et Impera and keep trying to win a long campaign with Carthage or something. This MOD is so hard and fun!

Which is a pretty niche setting as the equipment available is pretty limited all things considered. (No cavalry unit, no pikes, yup it's a bit early for those :p )

One very valid criticism is about the immortality of faction leaders, to that I oppose the idea that it's basically a way to have a bit more of uniqueness in an era where most people fought with spear, axe, sling and bow. (Even tho Sofia did a good job of making Egyptian / Hittite very distinct thanks to the unit weights and attributes)

Is it worth 60‚Ç¨/$ ? For me it is - I didn't play TROY so there's that - but even if I played TROY the effort Sofia is putting into the game makes it worth it for me. Trust me these folks are clearly passionate about what they are making.

I'll just finish this with this : It's clearly not the perfect game. Yes there are issues. Some can be fixed, some can't. It's not a 10/10. It's a 7/10. Drop that to 5/10 if you're really not into Bronze Age.

BORING when compared to Warhammer 3.

However, for a historical title, the themes are a little confused and pushes the game into a problematic play-space for a few reasons. It's a little too arcade and not enough strategy.

[i] What should you expect from a $100 AUD video game? Probably not this to be very honest [/i]. It's not because it lacks in design quality, or (from what I've experienced so far) technical flaws. In so few words; the presentation of this game is absolutely gorgeous and the style is romantic (Except for the cluttered UI); Unfortunately there is not enough replayability or campaign depth for the game to feel worthwhile.

[b] It's enjoyable for the initial moments but lacks momentum. It's too expensive, lacks scope and is repetitive. [/b]
Below is some additional information if you're looking for it.

[h2] - YUMMO BITS - [/h2]
The introduction of multiple resources types is a very welcome addition; adding diversification to strategy and management. Food, stone, wood, bronze and gold are the dollars at play here, and my overall experience was enriched because of this. Different military units, or buildings, require a cost and upkeep that varies between these resources. It was an engaging experience having to be more tactful about my military composition, civic development or expansion into regions which held those resources.

Bartering these resources with other factions was not only very fulfilling, but also a necessary element in maintaining my military and civic health. It's a welcome step in the direction of making diplomacy a more meaningful focus for the player. 

Another reasonable feature are region outposts. Being able to construct specialised buildings outside of a settlement was a surprisingly relevant feature that held some significance throughout my campaigns. The bonuses an army receive, or the province modifiers they provide, are worthwhile investments. Additionally, what I appreciate so much about this feature in Pharaoh, is being able to create military infrastructure outside of a major settlement. This is significant and useful in a strategic context missed by most Total War titles.

Campaign battles in Pharaoh may not appeal to all players. A lack of cavalry, outside of chariots, can give a misleading impression about the depth of combat in this game. The depth lies not in a vast array of units, or a system of magic, but in terrain, topography and unit mass. Unit weight and discipline are the key factors at work here, and they are satisfying to consider in their own right. However, unit collision remains a pretty big issue for Creative Assembly as a whole. I've not had much experience with siege battles, but they're much better than Warhammer 1 or 2.

[h2] - YUCKO BITS - [/h2]
However, despite the good feelings I have on the game; for a historical Total War game there are some really difficult design obstacles that CA brought upon themselves by limiting the scope of this title. The absence of scope is a direct consequence of their design objective; there's Egyptians and Hittites. They both have a crown, and some very special people want that crown very badly. You are one of those people who want a Crown and if that doesn't interest you strategically there's little for you here. Civil, Military and Faction diversity is lacking and makes the game very difficult to justify playing after 1 or 2 campaign victories. An example of a great feature impacted by the lack of scope is the Ancient Legacies and Court feature.

The Court system is underwhelming and rarely useful because it's neither a source of information, particular advantage or diplomatic significance (Unless you want the crown). I think this would have been better implemented if it allowed the player and AI to engage in more significant decisions at a much lower frequency. Gossiping or Embezzling Funds every turn was not very engaging and didn't really impact my ability to succeed or overcome difficulty during any of my 3 campaigns. (For the 3rd one, I completely ignored it). Although some of the court positions are desirable, the feature fell a bit short overall.

I cannot stress enough that the lack of scope really impacts replayability.

A design focus on replayability is certainly within the Ancient Legacies, which includes great concepts but is handcuffed in it's implementation. Ancient Legacies allow you to pick a past ruler to emulate, providing a unique campaign mechanic out of 6 options. What has left me in a catatonic state of confusion is why the player has to choose one at the exclusion of all others. Having fun with trade caravans, planning military campaigns or creating your own religion feel like features that should exist as persistent options for the player rather than at the exclusion of each other.

There is no doubt in my mind that an increased scope would make make this game an actual masterpiece - Simplicity is the most important part of a game, but the absence of meaningful faction management, military development, cultural diversity and an underwhelming tech tree make the game too narrow without any space to experiment or personalise your experience.",1697272434,1697272497,False,13,0,0.531395137310028076,1,True,False,False

for the overworld map, it's just building up your base, can be a bit confusing at the start if you are just used to the old Shogun 2 way of things but nothing you can't get over, 
You also have several different resources you need to collect to build things, this is realistic but is also a pain, as most units require upkeep costs as well with more than just gold. 
But this is not the reason I refunded the game. 

The battles. 
I played a total of 5 battles during the time I played the game, 
all 5 battles I was the attacking party, but you would not know it as the enemy just came to me each time. 
even when they were supposed to defend their settlement they came to me. 
This I found annoying instead of making the best use of the landscape they were brain dead. 
And even the battle animations could not save it for me at this point.

With outposts both facilitating movement of armies and able to provide additional garrisons to settlements among other bonuses they become higher priority targets when trying to conquer a region. This makes it so that instead of beelining settlement to settlement more careful planning is needed to take out the outposts (and outpost forts actually need to be laid siege to and captured) before capturing the settlement itself. It takes time for other systems to start opening up in the game as well, the deity, court and civil war, and legacy systems all open up over the first 20 or so turns, so some people may not have even played long enough to get to those. And after that is when more and more of the outside raiders arrive, Kaska are around from the start, but more come in, and so do Phrygians, Libu, various Sea Peoples, etc., which play into the need to build outposts to facilitate movement because the player needs to react to Sea Peoples suddenly plopping down an army on their shore. The multi-resource economy feels decently balanced, with until a larger area is controlled trade being needed to maintain enough resources to keep an army going while also developing settlements. Battles unfortunately do have some flaws of more recent TW with how quick they go down, and units sometimes being sticky. The new additions of higher quality units being able to make fighting withdrawals though is great and more tactics like this should be added in the future, just this opens up a lot more possibilities when previously to try to accomplish the same a unit would have to become fully disengaged and turned around. As for historical accuracy, CA does play a bit loose with timeline and relations. For Egypt at this time the succession was a mess and in chaos itself with rulers often in power for only a few years at a time, so CA does a reasonable job at trying to represent it in the style of a TW. For the Hittites though, Kurunta is a fair bit past his time (which I guess is why he is depicted as being so old in the game), Hartapu would make more sense ruling in Tarhuntassa (which as a side note is a lost city but CA does a decent job placing it based on the various locations academics have theorized it could be), as Hartapu is mentioned in an inscription by Suppiluliuma as having ruled Tarhuntassa.",1697261624,1697261624,True,5,2,0.520098447799682617,0,True,False,False

Total War: PHARAOH is an absolute gem in the Total War series, offering an immersive experience that transports players to the pinnacle of ancient Egypt's power. This game stands out as one of the best Total War titles in recent memory, despite some negative comments stemming from unrealistic expectations.

First and foremost, the level of historical accuracy in Total War: PHARAOH is truly commendable. The developers have painstakingly recreated the grandeur and intricacy of ancient Egyptian civilization, capturing every detail from the majestic pyramids to the bustling cities along the Nile. The attention to historical authenticity is unparalleled and adds a layer of depth that truly immerses players in the era.

Moreover, the gameplay mechanics in Total War: PHARAOH are exceptionally engaging. The strategic elements that the Total War series is known for are masterfully executed in this game. From managing resources and diplomacy to commanding epic battles, every decision you make carries weight and consequence. The blend of turn-based strategy and real-time battles creates a seamless and captivating experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

It's important to address the negative comments surrounding Total War: PHARAOH. Many of these criticisms stem from an unrealistic desire for Total War: Medieval 3, and it's unfair to project these expectations onto a completely different game. Total War: PHARAOH stands on its own merits and deserves to be appreciated for what it is ‚Äì a tremendously accurate and engaging new addition to the series.

In conclusion, Total War: PHARAOH is a must-play for fans of the Total War franchise and history enthusiasts alike. Its historical accuracy, immersive gameplay, and captivating storyline make it one of the best Total War games in recent years. Don't let the unwarranted negativity deter you from experiencing the wonders of ancient Egypt in this remarkable game.",1697074214,1697252985,True,4,1,0.479498535394668579,0,True,False,False

All TW games borrow assets from their previous titles (Attila: TW comes to mind), so there are 'similarities' like character selection and in-game resources that stick out. However, this is not Troy with its mythological monsters, setting, and heroes. Instead, it offers a front row seat to the end of civilization.

Your task is not to rescue your kidnapped wife (or alternatively, to elope with Agamemnon's wife who is actually in love with you, sparking a world-wide event pre-dating Jesus‚ÄîHomer, you crazy mf). No, your task is to survive, plain and simple. If only it were so easy!

Now there's some cons in here: 1. While you can get a lot of different regional units there's basically only three factions 2. Very low variety of generals/AI lords 3. some improvements (like the get off my lawn button) that were implemented in Warhammer 3 are missing here 4.

However, from the perspective of TW game, and actual campaign, Pharaoh is the most polished title in the historical branch, taking notes from all its predecessors to create a solid experience. I will say it now - in a few years from now, I expect TW community to wake up to a similar realisation we had about the Attila: ""it was a pretty good one, after all.""

For the rather modest size map it plays on, the campaign has surprisingly deep and intertwining mechanics with a number of approaches to solve the issue of survival after the bronze age collapse. Multi-layered management, juggling several key factors and land upgrades, paired with the (actually important) resources system - all crucial in keeping your civilisation running - all that steers Pharaoh away from a typical brute-force doomstack snowballing that plagues other TW titles (especially WHs).

Battle system might seem more basic than in other TW games (again, due to historically accurate units that were mostly infantry-based in the era) but if you spend some time studying and testing you will find that running a variety of different units actually matters - if not for battle performance, then for their cost-efficiency and saturation of armies available. And since resources and upkeep matter now, and you won't run almighty doomstack around winning every battle, being strategic about your forces will quickly prove crucial.

One thing that TW series suffered for a long time now was always diplomacy. 3K and WH3 tackled these issues, somewhat. Pharaoh is the best iteration of diplo yet, to date, in the series. With all the improvements made so far like quick deals or quantitive resources trading. No revolutions here, but lessons taken from the past titles and put to good use.

Is Pharaoh going to define TW series like S2 FOTS did? No, bronze age has its limitations for both tech as well as geographic reasons. But nonetheless, Pharaoh is a solid TW game that you might just want to give a chance.",1697243436,1697243526,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many ppl are complaining that it's like Troy. Well, it is -duh. It's been made by the same studio, a small part of CA. But why is it a bad thing? They've really improved every aspect of the game from Troy :
- units are easier to distinguish from each other (banners have been added, and if You don't like them - just turn them off)
- sieges are much more meaningfull, no more ""a** ladders - I can't state how big of an improvement this is - FINALLY no magic ladders
- combat between units is better, not only with better animations, but with time to kill - melee takes longer (especially compared to TW:WH) so you can actually plan sth
- campaing is much more mechanic-rich - there are some new mechanics, more or less sophisticated. Some pathways are mutually exclusive, thus encouraging multiple playthroughs.

Apart from that - the graphics are really neat, the artstyle is on point, and the game is pretty well optimised - I can easily play it on my ancient potato with GeForce 1070. 
Of course- it has it's flaws - the AI is lacking, the UI could be improved upon. The price is way to high. But those are minor things. 

So I'd say it's like Troy, but much, much better. And Troy got kinda ""fixed"" with multiple patches, remember that. Knowing CA Pharaoh could get even better with time. And thats the main point - I see that CA Sofia really tries here, they listened to the complaints, fixed, adjusted and fleshed out the systems from Troy and added a bunch of really cool new things. We're getting showered with low-effort game-like products (diablo 4, the newest BF, Saints row, Forspoken... this list could go on and on) nowadays, and yet there's little appreciation when a small studio tries it's best and actually delivers a solid, good game. Is it a gamechanger like TW:WH? No, it isn't. Is it Medieval 3? Nope. But it's a solid, enjoyable game, for a couple of playthroughs. 
I don't understand all the negativity - is it because of the similarity with Troy? Or maybe it's all the anti-hype from TW Youtubers? Cause they've been ranting about how this game is going to die on day 1 for quite a time now. I just hope all this negativity doesn't damage CA  further and we'll see great TW games in future.

Interesting character development with crowns and titles.
Invasion mechanics which don't suck (never thought I'd say that).
Court mechanics need more fleshing out.
Actually being Pharaoh is cool with the additional mechanics which get unlocked (want more of those).
Campaign customization options are off the charts for a TW game.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Total War: PHARAOH, the latest addition to the Total War series, left me thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied. As an avid fan of the franchise, I had high expectations for this game, but unfortunately, it fell far short of delivering an enjoyable experience.

From the very beginning, it became apparent that the game lacked meaningful progression. By turn 80, I had hoped to witness significant developments and face exciting challenges. However, I found myself constantly struggling with food shortages, which severely hindered my ability to build a formidable army or expand my empire. This perpetual struggle made the game feel tedious and frustrating.

The inclusion of the ""merchant"" mechanic felt like a pointless addition. It lacked depth and failed to contribute anything substantial to the gameplay. Moreover, the striking similarities between Total War: PHARAOH and its predecessor, Troy Total War, were impossible to ignore. With only minor changes, it felt like I was playing a recycled version of the same game. Considering the hefty price tag of ¬£49.99, this lack of innovation was unacceptable.

The AI in Total War: PHARAOH was abysmal. Their actions and decision-making were illogical and predictable, resulting in lackluster and unchallenging battles. Diplomacy, a crucial aspect of the Total War series, felt utterly pointless in this game. The absence of meaningful interactions and consequences rendered it a wasted opportunity for strategic negotiations and alliances.

In conclusion, Total War: PHARAOH failed to meet even the most basic expectations. The lack of progression, underdeveloped mechanics, high price point, and subpar AI make it impossible for me to recommend this game to fellow Total War enthusiasts. It is a disappointing addition to the series and a regrettable purchase.",1697221765,1697221765,False,7,1,0.474794864654541016,0,True,False,False

I disagree with people saying that this is a Troy re skin, because if it was, it would be so much better. I literally re downloaded Troy and played it just to compare it to this and the difference is night and day. Troy's worst trait is its battles, the AI is clearly outdated and the battles just suck. Somehow, they're actually fucking worse in Pharaoh, like much worse. Troy's campaign map and mechanics are universally liked, this game's map, mechanics and UI are all terrible. I could write an essay describing how trash this UI is. When you end a turn and a new event pops up, or something to do with civilisation decline or whatever, nothing is ever clarified for you. The game literally throws at you a wall of text and tells you NOTHING about what that text actually means. Might as well do it in Egyptian hieroglyphics then, if I am to decipher the game's terrible mechanics. Also, why is it that when the night cycle takes place on the campaign map, you literally are unable to see a damn thing?. I am so heartbroken for CA Sofia. They're my favourite team, and this game is a very clear and obvious downgrade from Troy, which I like very much. The game is still buggy of course, the court system is actually pointless after sometime, and I do not mean a long time, no it literally just becomes annoying and provides almost no value early into your campaign, it needs to be reworked completely.

While the game boasts visually pleasing art styles and well-designed battle maps, these aspects can't salvage the overall experience from its myriad of issues.

The gameplay in Total War: Pharaoh is nothing short of boring. The mechanics feel uninspired, and the overall progression lacks depth. The game fails to engage players in a meaningful way, with repetitive tasks and lackluster objectives that fail to capture the essence of strategic gameplay. There's a distinct lack of innovation, making it feel like a rehashed version of previous titles in the series. (i.e Thrones of Britannia, Troy)

The UI design is cluttered and confusing, making it a frustrating experience to navigate through menus and manage your empire. Important information is buried beneath layers of unnecessary complexity, making even simple tasks feel like a chore. A strategy game's UI should enhance the gaming experience, not hinder it, and in this regard, Total War: Pharaoh sorely disappoints.

One of the few redeeming qualities of the game is its art and art styles. The attention to detail in the environments and character designs is commendable. The ancient Egyptian and bronze age aesthetic is well-captured, bringing a visually appealing aspect to an otherwise lackluster game. However, great art can only carry a game so far when the core gameplay fails to deliver.

The battle maps in Total War: Pharaoh are well-crafted and thoughtfully designed. They offer a variety of terrains and strategic opportunities, adding a layer of depth to the otherwise monotonous battles. While the battles can be visually engaging, they can't compensate for the overall lack of excitement in the campaign gameplay. The outcome of a battle doesn't matter that much when you don't have interest in the game.

In conclusion, Total War: Pharaoh is a missed opportunity. Despite its commendable art and battle map design, the game is marred by its boring gameplay and cluttered UI. Fans of the Total War series might find some enjoyment in the visuals, but ultimately, the lack of innovation and engaging gameplay make this installment a forgettable experience.

I played a lot of TW in my life starting with Med2) and than Rom 2, the Warhammer franchise (I also play the tabletop game since 2008), 3K, the two Saga games and now Pharao) and yes I consider myself someone who is eagerly waiting for Med3 or ROme 3. I can honastly say that the game is not worth the 60‚Ç¨ but its not as far of as many say.

The pros:
+ You can customize a LOT in the campaign (Army size (10,15,20 units passively making garrisons stronger which I really like), AI aggression, Strenght of the sea people (Late game crisis) from strong to weak and not at all, you can tweak the diplomacy, random start positions and sooooo much more (I now want to see the listed customization options in every TW game and I really really like playing around with all the options)
+ Despite all the negative reviews I do not find the map to small, i think its ok (not great) and I will enjoy any DLCs that addn some areas
+ If you like the setting (which I do (yes Med3 would be better blabla)) this game is for you because the atmosphere is there
+ A lot of new campaign mechanics that I enjoy (A court system similar to 3K, worhsipping gods better than in Troy, ambitions to choose from, Campaign events (civil war) etc.). If games within a game are not your cup of tea than this becomes a con, but I really like them.

Neutral:
 The game throws a lot of midifiers for specific unsits and situations at you, I really enjoy dealing with this, if you do not than its probably a problem ;)
The Outpost system is really a great idea but somewhat to simplified and  needs to be expanded in the future
No Warhammer like army diversification with mythical and/or fantasy units (I do not have a problem with that but maybe you have)
The Troy ressource system which I absolutely love but you may find it worse than Warhammer
The battles fell engaging and more close combat focussed (with the known AI issues TW has at the moment), yet you basically only have close combat, ranged and chariot units to choose from

The cons:
- The factions feel somewhat similar at a certain point in the game
- Some of the new mechanics are not that well balanced (which in my opinion can be fixed and is not that big of a deal)

The Pharoah mechanics are useful (forced annexation, extra upgrades, elite units) and there are several points in which you specialise your empire/ playstyle to, say, trade, military dominance or wonder building, or specify certain religions etc, which combined with campaign customisation has led to a surprising amount of potential to role play in what is generally far from the most diverse setting.

It is more than a Troy reskin.

But as reviews here allude/ screech to, iteration isn't always enough. Everyone and their dog has an opinion on what fundamentally needs to change, but apart from the obvious (incompetent CA leadership, battle AI) I would like to add one thing:

Health bars. And tangentially, ""overstatification"" (word?). In modern Total Wars, every group of soldiers you control has a collective health bar and none of the individual dudes will start dying until that collective health bar drops half way. Charge a massive chariot into light infantry? They get back up, before falling back down 10 seconds later after the cumulative ""charge bonus"" effect whittles down the health bar post-impact. It trades any feeling of impact and lethality (word??) for a generalised ""ooo my melee attack stat and charge bonus are way higher than your charge defense and evasion, therefore I win."" ""I ran over you with my big horse"" apparently occurs merely in the realm of what I see and do, not the famously fun and engaging world of abstract power levels.

But I don't need a health bar more complicated than a count of how many dudes are still standing. I don't want to raise a new higher-tier army only to find out they are just the old army with +2 weapons - I want them to do something new: formations, splash damage, formation breaking, assassinations or lob a massive rock halfway to India. I want to play strategically with new options. I want elite units that can die immediately if I'm an idiot.

Thank god there are no guns in this time period. ""I shot you with a big cannon"" - ""yeah but my guy is actually a super-mega-elite super dude with an invisible force-field and 154 evasion so it doesn't hurt him.""",1697189997,1697189997,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Usually I play most Total War games with mods to make them more historically accurate but Pharaoh is probably one the most historically accurate game straight out of the box. 

Overall, I recommend the game, the only negative so far might be the price. The game is quite expensive, it's the highest price I ever payed for a Total War game and actually the most expensive game I ever bought.  I like the game but I don't know if I can really say the price is worth it.

Edit: To address some of the negative reviews. The game is not ""copy-paste Troy"". It does share many things, but the factions in Pharaoh have nothing in common with Troy.  It also has a lot of new things.

The game adds something that was until now only present in mods for other Total War games, we finally get regional recruitment as a integral part of recruitment. Any faction can recruit the local troops if they own territories in the the respective region. This allows a much larger variety in the troops you can use, more then might be visible when seeing the starting factions. You can be playing as an Egyptian but you might have most your troops be Nubian and Kushite, for example.

The religion is also handled very differently. You can have up to 3 main gods. You are not limitied to the gods of your culture. Gods are tied to specific regions so they need to be ""discovered"" before you can pray to them. If you start in Sinai for example you have access to  2-3 Egyptian gods and 1 Canaan one . 

There is an outpost system where in each region you can construct a limited number of outposts (max 4). All outposts give back some of the movment range so you can create sort of a ""highway"" to quickly move your troops. Some of the outposts are garrisoned and you can have fort battles.

Some regions are considered sacred lands of Egypt or of Hatti. If you own some of that land then you can participate in the court politics of the respective Kingdom. This is an interesting idea, although the execution is not that quite there yet, as it can become a bit repetitive quite fast. 

The battle AI is the same as in all recent Total War  games, so not the smartest. Battles do feel longer and less ""arcady"". The weather conditions have a big impact and you have less control over them as they can change during the battle. In other Total War game I was usually just clicking wait until I mostly got the clear conditions I wanted. I had one 25 min battle in a sandstorm, for example. 

Another new thing is that you can choose some legacies to follow that impact the ways you can get various  bonuses. For example, for Egypt you can choose to push for building monuments (they appear on the map as well), where you start building in specific provinces various monuments, statues or pyramids. Or you can choose a legacy where you are focused on conquests, with various bonuses helping you either conquer easier or pacifying faster the conquered provinces. The other two legacies for Egypt allow you start your own religion and one focused on trade caravans. 

I'm sure that I'm forgetting someting but overall the game is a good one. It's not perfect, but it's definately not deserving of refunds or the mixed ratings. If you want a historical focused, very well running and bug free Total War game, then this is for you. I agree that the price is an issue, so this is a valid criticism. Maybe wait for a sale if you cannot afford it right now, but for sure don't avoid the game just because a lot of people are frustrated with CA.",1697096617,1697187656,True,2,0,0.501106202602386475,0,True,False,False

[h2] What I dislike about the game [/h2]

It is a mythological release, it is not historical.
My largest complaint is that it is unhistorical.
If you actually know something about the Late Bronze Age then you will realize MANY places have incorrect names and locations. Many leaders never existed or have less evidence of existence of leaders they did not put in the game for what ever reason.
Weapons such as slings do far to little damage and have far to little of range. Making a veteran bowman equal to a veteran slinger is un-historical no matter the era. All the way until the late roman era Slings out-ranged bows.

This isn't getting into other issues such as certain peoples having red hair and described as red haired since antiquity and in game they have black or brown hair....

[h3] Non-Historical dislikes [/h3]
Sometimes the armor setting can make units feel like they are just absorbing blows.
On higher unit settings such as Extreme chariots do not behave properly, and all units have bad pathing when unit size is increased.
It can be confusing to understand what resources are highly valuable late game, and the game directs you to trade the valuable resources off early game. This makes replay-ability better, but for a first play though it can make it harder.


[h1] What I like about the game [/h1]
Battles are slower paced and more focused on positioning your army than who can micromanage the fastest. I really enjoy this. I personally dislike War Hammer with a passion. I much prefer this type of game play. It reminds me more of Shogun2 where you have abilities that can effect the outcome of a battle if done properly, but it's not just point and click and kill half the enemy army.

Units are unique but not over bearing. I can [b]definitely[/b] tell the difference between fighting a Hittite and Egyptian and Canaanite. 
Sometimes I feel like that difference is a little to much and exaggerated. But I can understand why they did it for play-ability. 

The end game is really fun, but it does end quickly... I wish they would have gone till the last man standing instead of just ending it. Maybe with mods that will change.
Expect the game to last around 120 turns.

Ability to customize your generals is REALLY nice. I enjoy customizing my general and his body guards. I can make them suit their army very well and use them as such. It's basically a free gold-tier troop.

[h1]Would I buy Pharaoh?[/h1]
[h3]YES![/h3]

Yes I would buy it. For $60 it is a lot of fun.
I personally bought it for $90, which is a little to much for the game atm. But I love this game.
It's really a good game that for some reason has all the War Hammer fan boys who were not even old enough to remember Shogun 2 or Rome 2, are review bombing the crap out of this game.

If you are like me and want slower paced battles that are won based of tactics and not just clicking magic spells. This is a fun game.

The nicest thing about this game is it plays well out of the box. Unlike Rome 2 for instance, Pharaoh is actually playable the second you buy it.
All the new mechanics work and are functional.
Battles have meta's and you can different play styles as a rock, paper, scissors...

I would highly recommend this game if you like strategic slow paced battles (like I do).
I would not recommend it, if you only like a Total War game that gives you buttons to insta-kill your enemies armies.",1697176973,1697176973,True,3,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

Yes, but even ""Rome"" didn't stick to the Italian Peninsula or just mediterranean nations, it included Carthage, Parthians, Greek city states etc. ""Atilla"" wasnt limited to the Hungarian/Eastern European plain. you understand where I'm going with this.
This feels like you'd be expecting a solid time piece with Mesopotamian empires, Myceneans, Urartu, Sea peoples, I expected a ""Rome"" type of game but instead got a expansion pack without the grand campaign part.
I was also surprised to see Seti and Ramses on the same campaign mode, wasn't Seti the father of Ramses? Initially I thought the playable character would start in a different era of Egyptian history.

Maybe they weren't around for Rome II or Napoleon launch but this definitely feels like a full total war game and way less buggy than either of those or Warhammer was at launch. Only annoying thing is there are some clearly really built out factions already (Like the sea people) that have sizable rosters but are unplayable.

The game is great, looks good and its the best running total war to date. The factions are cool and there's tons of sub mechanics to handle. :3 

Though I understand that this time period may not be for everyone, that doesn't mean the game is bad. Which is what a lot of people seem to think.

To reinforce what i said earlier. The games performance is great compared to Warhammer 3 (As an example). It looks really clean and all the units have cool animations that go with their really cool appearances. 

The combat is a bit faster in some areas and slower in others. You can get into old meat grinders that take a while, however flanking behind something has massive bonuses/penalties depending on you being flanked or you flanking the enemy. 

You can end fights really quickly given you have space to move.

The campaign map looks clean, the UI is better in some areas but the deity UI is pretty all over the place (For me anyway) takes some reading to get used to to fully understand what it is you are looking at.

The sounds are great too, its clearer than it used to be and it has a nice clang to the combat where i feel like.. if i were to listen to a battle in the bronze age, i'd say this is what i'd hear, well.. more screaming, but the impact noises of weapons and armor, is nice. 

It's not that i cant write more about this, it's that i don't care to. I'm not doing this for fame or glory, i just think people are selective readers and want to hate on things and push it as a bad game, when they don't get the thing 'they' want. 

But I got what i wanted so I am having a good time.

One day Medieval 3 or Shogun 3 will do nicely for me. But I wouldn't pass up a 40K total war either.",1697043480,1697138818,True,11,1,0.415189653635025024,0,True,False,False

I can't recommend the game because of the price.

Good stuff
+ Court mechanic.
+ Economy trading. In this game you will HAVE to trade. Even in late game I wasn't able to sustain my armies without trade.
+ Small Elite armies are better then Big and cheap ones.

Bad stuff
- Any unit other than tier v and vi axeman are useless. 6 this bad boys will anihilate a full stack of tier 1-2 units. So, every fight is boring and feels the same. 
- Chariots are useless. Basically rush in and die. Tier vi chariot easily dies to tier 1 spear.
- UI is terrible. Every building looks the same.
- Outpost idea is nice. But it is dumb. Army from only on general sneaks into your territory and can destroy all of them. It doesnt cost anything to raze them. and you cant catch this mf. So tons of resources to waste.

As well for a historical title I think the Character/Lords are the most unique and interesting out of any other title second to Warhammer Total Wars.

A lot of people say it is Troy copy paste or there isn't much content. I don't agree with either of those criticism. The campaign simply has a lot more depth than Troy, and I feel there is plenty of content. The main issue is there are only 3 factions at launch though each have many Rules/Lords to pick from.

As far as Total War games goes, this is a far cry from their best historical works. I leave Warhammer aside to compare this to other Historical works. 

We cannot deny that this is a copy paste of Troy with some elements upgraded. They re-use a lot of assets, that I can see. The ressouces of the campaign are the same, but they added small and new things like Outposts. 

The battles are where I feel like most historical fan will lose their interest, as I did. It's unknown to me why CA persist in trying to dumb down their game and make them arcade-y, but this is another victim of this. Battles are fast, units run extremely fast even on foot and AI is pretty much as dumb as you can imagine even charging out of their defensive positions to attack. I miss the old days where battle maps were slow and needed thinking and actual manoeuvers to achieve the best results. In here, even if you wanted to move slow and manoeuver around, as far as I have seen the enemy runs up to you so fast you can barely move, even if they should defend, so it's pointless. This felt bad.

This is coming from someone who HAS NOT PLAYED Troy, but has played a little bit of multiple different Total War games. So I would call myself a ""casual"" Total War gamer as of right now, but after this game, I have a feeling I will be playing a lot more of them.

This game is my first real modern experience of Total war. I played a little bit of three kingdoms and a little bit of Warhammer 3, but Warhammer 3 is not on my SSD so it runs like shit. So as my first true Total War modern experience, it feels great. The battles are good, the Minor settlement ""sieges"" are alright, although, they can be free in the early game if you just train 10 axe men and 10 bowmen. all the settlement upgrades feel pretty nice, and I am not sure if this is new, but being able to pick a settlement to basically just sack in a couple turns by giving them different de-buffs or getting help from the natives feels really cool to me. I also am at the point in a campaign where the Pharaoh Civil War has just broke out, so that is really cool to me. Have no touched siege battles yet so I will not give any input on those at this time. The game just feels pretty good to me and I really recommend it for someone who is looking for a really nice modern Total War game. I don't really follow the Warhammer hate train, as i personally dont care and like the game for what it is, im not going to hate on them for increasing the price of a DLC, no matter if it is justified or not. So with that being said, and as someone who has not played TROY, I would recommend this game to anyone thinking about getting it. Do i think it is worth $60? Depends. Are you actually gonna play it a good bit? Then yea i say it's worth the buy. Would I highly recommend it on sale? I definitely would. If you don't have the $60 to spend on it rn, then pick it up on sale and I dont think you would regret it. Please keep in mind this is coming from someone who has not played TROY, as i am only a college student, so I have no money. 

At the end of the day, it is your choice whether you get this game or not. If you are going to get it because you want to, or if you just have every single total war game and have an unhealthy attachment to the series, or if you dont get it because you either dont like CA rn or because the Pharaoh side of history does not appeal to you, it is your choice. I'm ending this review here with giving this game an 8/10 from me, and I feel that it is worth picking up.",1697125777,1697125777,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game shares a lot of DNA with Troy, but it's tremendously expanded from Troy, mechanically. Think...Napoleon to Empire. Or Atilla to Rome 2. The core is there, and you'll feel it. But this is bigger and better in every way.  The campaign strategy mechanics are robust and deep, layering on with each successive year of game time passing. The number of 'plates to spin' as you balance your strategies is exciting, and MUCH more than Total WARHAMMER, TROY, or most other recent games....although Three Kingdoms still has it beat there.  

Each faction feels distinct, each culture feels very distinct. There's lots of unit variety.   People who complain about 'floaty' and 'light' units in battle are only commenting on early game, because 'light' tier 1 units do move fast and shift positions quickly.  Once you get to the slower, heavier, more orderly Tier 2 and Tier 3 troops the weight changes significantly.    Battles are a tad too fast for my taste, but that's been a problem with every TW since Shogun 2.  At least battle maps are VERY interesting--terrain and topography vary greatly. The battlefields are far more technically complex and interesting to fight on than Warhammer, and the changing battlefield states (weather, etc) are very cool. 

Presentation of the game is top-notch. It's a beautiful and crisp game, the art and UI are top notch, the audio design is fantastic, and the music is enthralling.   In battles you hear the thrum and stampede of your troops moreso than any other recent title. Things have weight and bass to them.  On the campaign map the hissing cicadas, squawking flamingos, creaking fishing boats, and tinking sounds of blacksmiths at work on Bronze is so crisp and immersive. 

The setting is super well-explored too. As a fan of ancient Egypt, the land of Pharaohs and the story of their flashpoint at the end of the Bronze Age is super flavorful, and CA Sophia did a spot-on job representing the era and getting the flavor rounded out!

The game's biggest drawbacks, IMO:   Battles are too fast, the resource/trade system is a bit cumbersome (but still a nice evolution on generic 'trade agreements'), the battle graphics don't do a whole lot to help you distinguish between masses of fleshy shirtless dudes (so you can't see battle lines clearly or tell who is who), and the campaign is linked to immortal hero characters who can only ever be 'wounded'.  I don't love that. Shogun 2 focused on a tight and specific period of time (the rise of Tokugawa) but it let people die, and it let alternate stories get told....

Overall I agree with IGN's 80/100 score, personally.  This is a very good TW game and a very good strategy game. It's not the greatest and it's a far cry from Three Kingdoms, Medieval 2, or Atilla / Rome 2 (after 3 years of patching lol). But it's still worth playing for Total War fans.   A lot of people are conditioned by their favorite youtuber/streamer to hate this game, and the typical talking points are mostly hollow. A lot of criticism just comes from people angry about Warhammer 3's DLC pricing, or people upset that this game wasn't Medieval 3 / Empire 2. Or they think this is a SAGA title, despite this game being far larger and more varied than Shogun 2. 

This game won't redefine TW for you, but it's a robust strategy game with fantastic mechanics, good pacing, great presentation, and plenty of reasons to come back. It's immersive, it'll get you interested in ancient Egyptian/Hittite history, and I'm also excited to see what modders do with it. The Steam Workshop is ALREADY active with no wait/delay. The battles are flawed in some ways, and the focus on each faction's 'main character' make this *feel* smaller in scope than it actually is. I'm sure once they start adding DLC factions and FLC content, people will stop crying about breadth. 

Hopefully folks enjoy! If you're the type of person (like so many others here) who spend more time trying NOT to enjoy games, trying to find flaws in games, or are someone who falls for bandwagon groupthink easily, then don't bother.

As a history buff, I'm glad that this interesting setting - Ancient Egypt, Canaan, and Hatti on the eve of the Late Bronze Age collapse - was explored with a ""Total War"" game. I don't mind the relative lack of unit variety (no cavalry, battles mostly being infantry affairs), as I enjoy watching battles fought between historically-authentic armies. That being said, I would have liked to see a more fleshed-out map. The anti-""Troy"" mob seemingly annoyed CA into decreasing the number of settlements on the map, as the developers said in as many words during one of their interviews. While those only into the gaming aspect of ""Pharaoh"" may be glad to not see many reskinned faction clones (like the non-Trojan Anatolian factions in ""Troy""), I honestly wish that Canaan had far more cities and cultures, such as the conspicuously absent Ammonites, Moabites, and Israelites, as the region should feel a bit more chaotic and fractured than it appears in the main game. I also wish that the greyed-out areas of Libya and western Anatolia were immediately available, as it would be fun to play as the Libyans or the Mycenaean Greek colonists of Asia Minor. I understand that Mesopotamia is probably a big ask for a game centered around Egypt, but the hype around ""Pharaoh"" being ""the ultimate Bronze Age game"" just doesn't fit a game centered around a zoomed-in, yet occasionally sparse part of the world. Otherwise, I really enjoyed battling the threats of the Sea Peoples and the migratory Libu, Kaska, and Phrygian peoples, as I got a sense of other parts of the world experiencing a similar collapse, and the refugees of these disasters bringing the collapse with them as they search for new homes and plunder. My two last criticisms of ""Pharaoh"" from a historical perspective are Merneptah and Setnakhte. I firmly believe that Setnakhte should have been playable, as the one faction bordering the Libyan desert, and as the only adult Pharaoh in the game not to be playable (despite having played far more important of a role in the civil wars than Ramesses). Secondly, the cutscene for Merneptah's death showed up in c. 1203 BC, only for Merneptah to still be alive and well in the next turn, and to battle me (as Ramesses) for a few turns before the cutscene replayed and Merneptah truly died. Merneptah should stay dead once the first cutscene plays, rather than force me to roleplay betraying a Pharaoh I thought dead.

From a gameplay perspective, I enjoyed the Sea Peoples ""wave mechanics"", campaign customization was a major improvement to the series, and I enjoyed the stress of having to manage and trade resources at a time when international trade was threatened by the collapse. I don't have many complaints with the day-to-day of the game, from the historically-accurate battles to the campaign mechanics. However, a criticism involving both history and gaming is the developers' decision to once again feature immortal characters. Historically, Amenmesse died in 1198 BC, Seti in 1197 BC, Bay in 1192 BC, and Tausret in 1189 BC. Even old Kurunta would have likely died before 1190 BC. That said, it is wildly disconcerting to be playing as Pharaoh Ramesses III in the 1180s BC and seeing these people still alive. It's totally ahistorial, and, while I understand that ""Pharaoh"" is a sandbox in which history can be altered, I'm sure that - if these characters were as mortal as any other general - most of them would likely be dead by the 1180s BC, whether from battles or plots. Honestly, I would rather have had competing family trees (with Seti and Tausret as one faction, Amenmesse as his own, and Setnakhte and Ramesses as one faction) to give me the sense that I'm forging a dynasty, not just playing as one invincible character. I can already imagine reaching the ingame year 1100 BC and playing as a 100+-year-old Ramesses, who still has yet to cut his lock of youth.

Overall, I enjoyed the gameplay and the setting, though the ""invincible heroes"", CA's decision to cut the number of settlements due to fan pressure (when this actually sabotaged the game), the limited scope of the ""ultimate Bronze Age game"", the lack of family trees, and the Troy-style graphics verging on cartoons tempered my excitement. I'd still recommend the game for those who don't mind the historical inaccuracies (including having years displayed above the turns, but the years meaning nothing to characters' ages) and for those who want to finally play as Ancient Egypt in a Bronze Age game, but I have many reservations about recommending this game to history buffs or even Bible readers who may expect a larger scope and more historical details in a game set in such an exciting, yet under-portrayed region of the world.",1697119256,1697119256,True,36,3,0.656663298606872559,3,True,False,False

It adds some really interesting features from Thrones of Britannia and Attila (Huns, Vikings, and Norman invasions), with a more complex economy that really adds some challenges, especially in the early game. I've played tons of Med 2 and Empire, for example, as well as Warhammer 2, and economics rarely factor into my plans in those games, but in Pharaoh, economic concerns absolutely drives my strategy. Playing as Rameses, I'm in a relatively resource rich starting position except for stone and gold, both of which are necessary to build higher tier buildings, meaning I either have to try and conquer wealthier factions with my lower quality troops or use diplomacy to buy those resources. 

Between the new economic system, civil war mechanic and invasion mechanics (both of which are kicking off simultaneously right now in my campaign) while some random ambitious Egyptian warlord wants my stone production that I only just conquered from Beersheeba, it's a very precarious early game. I'm facing a wave of Sea People invasions of a dozen weak armies- location unknown and target unknown- while a 20-stack Egyptian army attacks my Sinai empire despite me being ready to strike their capital, and I can only afford a small secondary army. 

So, as far as early game situations, this is probably the most challenging in a non-annoying way. There's a lot to manage and balance and it definitely includes having to make some sacrifices that games with a single economic resource didn't have.

Pharaoh looks and sounds incredible. The graphics, the campaign map, the sound design, the music, its all really well done, but unfortunately thats where it stops for me. Everything else feels half baked. The potential for this to have been ""The next historical total war"" is there! But it feels like CA Sofia just werent given the support to produce it. Copy and pasted assets, a UI which even for a total was veteran like myself, just feels awkward, large and unwieldy. Battles which whilst they sound and appear amazing does not benefit from the warhammer engine. The warhammer engine works with warhammer because of all the magic, large entities and monsters which add spectacle, AoE attacks and larger than life combat. The problem with Troy and subsequently Pharaoh is that the units just dont feel like they are clashing at all. Its one big mosh pit of flailing rubber-banding limbs. The sounds are heavy and brutal but the actual models are just wet noodling the air until randomly a model falls over. 

I believe this really is the limitation of the engine, and the support given to CA Sofia, not the passion of the dev team. This should have been a DLC for Troy, and kept the mythos units etc. The engine doesnt work for a purely historical total war game because it wasnt designed for it. Same as Troy, this feels like warhammer but all the craziness taken out, which hasnt been replaced with anything meaningful or added anything previously used in their historical games. Its a game based around immortal heroes and stat modifiers, rather than what their historical games used to be about - empires, lineage, diplomacy, espionage, trade, population and eventually war.

Those that said it was like Troy are right.  Definitely more like Troy 2.   I played Troy when it came out but not on steam, and that game for me needed massive updates that the Fort Night folks didn't have.  I probably should have given it more time before requesting a refund, but about 4 hours of frustration were enough.

The Diplomacy seems to try and work the same as Total War 3 kingdoms, except it doesn't.  It lets you filter to show who might accept a proposal, but that isn't the case.  It gives you different options to filter which is helpful, but then half of the factions that your supposed to be able to get a treaty with do not give you the option.  This was with non aggression packs, never mind anything else.  

The resource management on default is a major requirement.  They have settings to lower the upkeep but on default you will not be able to field more than 1 20 stack army.  That 1 Army will put your resources in the read making your need to barter all the time.  Perhaps if you get to 6 provinces you can have a 2nd Army.  Some may find that more engrossing, but I found it tedious.

The Sieges of town and battles is very much the 3 kingdoms canalized movement without the tower defenses.  I would have liked to have seen maybe a village when attacking a village not just earth mounds.  

The Unit AI was pretty bad for missile troops.  They wouldn't engage and if they got bunched together, then they would say they were obstructed and not fire.  Speaking of Fire.  I tried 8 battles with fire arrows to light the long grasses on fire.  Nope.

1. i feel like the map is very bland, i understand its in the desert but it could use some touches to improve overall look and or feel.
2. Too many of same type of units, i feel like there is the same units but only different names or armor, mby add little more diversity.
3.diplomacy isnt bad but could have a little more depth in my opinion.
4. generals also need depth, as most generals look the exact same so not very exciting when recruiting.
5.all enemy lords also look the same for the most part so not really much excitement and role-play if some ppl wanted to play that way.

Game is probably fun for those who didn't play Troy (70% identical game copy/pasted).  Now I feel like I spent $60 on a Troy DLC.  Just not enough new stuff to keep me going.  

Negatives on new stuff: 

1.) The new stuff that was added like the court system where you choose some options to harass some people for influence or some other small stuff is pretty useless.  It happens every turn so I feel obligated to make the options which just makes the came feel repetitive.  

2.) 6 hours in and the religious system seems to have no purpose. Sure there are some passive upgrades to your empire as you level up your gods but I didn't seem to be competing against any of the AI in this regard.

3.) Tech tree was not exciting at all.  I felt like I eventually just picked random options as it was so boring.  Examples are +10% to stone production, +20% ammo (chairots only), etc.  The problem is I didn't have any super awesome troops that I wanted to chase on the tech tree as all the troops I had seemed very vanilla but with different names.  The archers for example all looked identical but changed the colors some for their tier level. 

4.) Diplomacy layout changes were either bugged or so confusing it may as well be bugged.  I click non-aggression treaty and I see a faction with a positive agreement score.  I click on the faction and there is no option to make an agreement. Some factions would have the option which just added the confusion why other did not even though it showed up on the quick deal list with a positive score.

Positives on new stuff: 

1.) Outpost in each province is kinda cool and makes moving around the map rewarding when you have to backtrack across your empire with your main army.  I would recommend they keep this idea for future additions of the TW series.  

In the end I'll probably just play 3 Kingdoms more instead of this game and hold out hope that they remake Medieval.",1697085058,1697085058,False,25,0,0.549155354499816895,0,True,False,False

CA Sophia continues to show it's where the creative momentum of the company is, from saving Rome 2 to Troy and now this you can watch a direct line develop of the branch's design ethos forming and becoming its own distinct feeling 'flavor' of Total War. The only problem is they're stuck with the Total War systems still.

For every interesting element the age of the engine and core gameplay systems shows. Units are broken up by region rather than faction, Nubia's elite archers are available for anyone with control of Nubian lands to draw upon regardless of the faction or even culture they represent. This creates diversity even in the 'limited' military types of the era.

It's hamstrung, though, by the same recruiting system every TW game uses, with almost arbitrary feeling caps and restrictions that don't seem to capture the region's uniqueness as well.

Armor is in the game, perfectly capturing the game changer bronze was for war at the time. To counter its ability to soak damage armor degrades over time, use and constant battles add up and a heavily armored unit can become vulnerable over long campaigns if their enemy is equipped with armor damaging weapons and has the time to wait them out.

Again, though, this system is weakened by being able to be stacked and blobbed up like morale, where with a good combo of items and leader abilities you can turn the armor degrading into a non issue fairly quickly. I understand not wanting it to be too punishing, but to completely overwrite a balance feature with just a few easily found stacks makes it into a trivial thing instead of the interesting mechanic it could be.

The campaign map is interesting, taking a controversially 'narrow' view to focus on making each region feel distinct and worth fighting for for various reasons. Some are resource powerhouses, some are scared lands that give your leader legitimacy to rule by controlling, some are simply good chokepoints to keep your rivals from advancing. Outposts further add to this, mini features of the map you can turn into military, economic, administrative, or religious buildings that grant bonuses to the region ranging from increasing your people's piety to their gods to making a watch tower with extra forces to reinforce your cities when put under siege.

Unfortunately those regions are grouped under the same territory system that's been in since Rome 2, where you functionally have one 'true' city that makes up the core of the territory and a few smaller, much more limited, cities with few interesting or unique options if any at all.

The game is full of  issues like this, but still a strong showing. The perfect example of 'two steps forward, one step back', it is progress and it is improvement but it's impossible to shake the feeling that this could be great if it wasn't tied to out dated frameworks. This game is good, if you're a fan of games like these you'll enjoy it, but there's a part of me that almost wishes the Sophia team was able to make their own game free of the TW frameworks just to see what they can bring to the genre as a whole.",1697076807,1697076807,True,5,0,0.519566118717193604,0,True,False,False

   of that studio
+ The music is dope
+ The gameplay mechanics are really interesting. 

Cons:

- Enemy AI during battles gets wonky at times (easily patchable)
- There needs to be a clearer indication of what units a new military building offers. There are no unit cards to preview, only 
   icons that don't mean anything to a new player.

I like the games, but I have only played one other before this, that game being Three Kingdoms. I can not speak for the similarity between this game and Troy, for I have not played said game. However, from gameplay clips and first hand accounts of people who have played them, I can say that these games are not the same, albeit similar in structure and mechanics. From what I have seen, they most likely took inspiration from that game's system and expanded upon it thoroughly. Whether they expanded enough for $60 is debatable, but  I am not writing this review for people who have already played all the TW games. Now onto the actual review.

Pros:
I like it, man. I have nothing much more to say. The graphics are good if a bit wonky at times, but the main appeal of this game isn't 24k ultra wideband magic RDR2 reminiscent graphics, it is about strategy and diplomacy. For those two aspects I think they did really well. The diplomacy system has definitely shrank in comparison to Three Kingdoms, but what they lack for in diplomacy they make up for ten-fold in the countrybuilding mechanics. Every single new material has its own purpose within the building system, and they did a good job at implementing them. The map is massive, despite what many have said, and there is a massive selection of factions to face off against. From my limited time playing I saw some-48 factions with more to be discovered. The battles are very total war. I have nothing more to say about them. The battles are standard. Overall, I genuinely really enjoy the game so far.

Cons: 
Your character moves way too fast. For whatever reason, you can traverse the entire map in what feels like 15 turns. This is the main reason I think people consider the map to be small. It is realistically gigantic, but the movement of your character makes it feel like a breeze to traverse through.
The selection of playable factions is negligible compared to other TW games. I think there are only 7 playable factions, and about 3 of them are easy mode. I recognize that there will likely be more coming in the future, but as of right now it sucks.

Overall I enjoyed the game. It has its fair amount of setbacks and cons, but I don't think any of them are large enough to write the game off entirely. Despite the insane amount of suck-uppery I just did, I am still going to recommend that you don't buy the game. I always think it is risky to buy a game first-day, and especially so with a game of this price. 

TL/DR: This game is genuinely enjoyable and good, but do not buy it as of right now.",1697071898,1697071898,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is essentially a Troy DLC sold for full price. And has all the same issues that plague recent TW, while doing absoutely nothing to address them. 

While this is nothing new at this point the most glaring of these issues is the character centered factions. Rather than having immersive factions like say Egypt you have a bunch of characters. And everyone has the exact same starting position more or less. You start with one or two settlements an an army. One easy enemy army is right next to you as well as an enemy settlement behind it. 
This is such a step backwards even from relatively recent Atilla where you had numerous very different starting positions. Now replayability relies entirely on differing faction mechanics. But while previous titles like Warhammer and to a much lesser extent 3K and Troy did this somewhat well by having ver varied mechanics. This is not really the case here. Every character has a handful of unqiue units, a unique building and some ability. Thats about it. This is not enough. This in effect means you play one campaign and have largely seen what the game has to offer. There are a few artificially gated mechanics through the ancient traditions as well but I did not find any of those particularly engaging. 

It also just really does not work for the game concept. It just does not feel like I am a faction in a major Empire. At no point in the game is there an actual Egypt on the map. Or a Hittite Kingdom. When the entire map consists of single province factions that have no real connection to each other outside of the kingdom mechanic and units it just feels like some sort of shattered world scenario from PDX games. 

The choice of time period really does not help either. It does not allow for artillery or cavalry which massively reduces unit variety. If the engine at least worked well with chariots perhaps it would be fine but as we know from previous titles it really does not and nothing has been done to improve it despite the setting. Unacceptable imo. 
Another issue with the bronze age choice is the relatively limited number of factions. Yet even for the time period they still chose to only have 3 factions in effect. With only the Hittites and Egyptians being truly fleshed out. The Canaanites are very lackluster and have nothing unique going for them. Not even the kingdom mechanic for some reason. Ok I get it there was no empire of that sort in the region but it'd be cool if you could form one. Or alternatively at least give the guy known for raiding Egypt some features around raiding.

I will begin with reason for the negative review; around 12th turn Ramesses I was fighting a battle where i hid troops in the tall grass, which i ensured they actually all had the hidden buff, where my noob ass ai enemy brought a front to entirely counter as if they could see them in the brush. They quite literally split their forces and aimed at my army as if they knew the exact number and forces there.

The building tiers are easy to get used to, as you compare them to Total War Warhammer, which is far superior in almost every way, other than the recent price gouging that I have selectively, instead of inclusively, participated in. Don't bother investing in specific heroes or lords, the benefits are strong as hell, but feel like a buffet cookie cutter model.

It will be very difficult to top a fantasy model with a realistic model without a-symmetry. You will have a very loud cult following that will cry for realism and that will drag you away from a-symmetry, but it will definitely be the minority that looks good on paper and convinces the decision makers to wreck a lovely series.

I think the game *could* stand to slow the campaign's pace down a little bit.  It seems like you've barely begun before the sea people are at the door and civilization is imploding around you.  Hopefully modders will be able to fiddle with this aspect of the game.

I wanted to like this game and came in expecting to enjoy it. I am a huge MTW2 fan and still play it to this day, and even play some Shogun 2 and some WH2 once in a while.

Unfortunately, it just wasn't what I was looking for. Most of my complaints are subjective though. 

First: The UI and artwork is blocky and simplistic, there is a big emphasis on abilities, upgrades, equipment, etc. There is also a large amount of behind the scenes numbers that are there on the screen constantly for people who really enjoy this stuff to digest so they can ""min/max"" or whatever. It is basically an RPG game with an army attached where you fly across the campaign map to level up and become more powerful.

This is unappealing to me, if it appeals to you then enjoy.

Second, the battles are similarly arcady. It's not enough to look like ancient egypt, it has to feel like it to. And it doesn't. You could reskin all the models and animations and terrain and market this same game in a new setting as a sci-fi battle bots arena where you send RC drones in to clumsily swing at each other with crude weapons and it would feel more like what I'm seeing matches up to what I'm doing.

There is really just no sense of realism in this game. I was expecting to be immersed in a simulation of ancient Bronze-Age warfare, I was not. 

The individual human models are in ""units"" and are locked into one behavior, and they all concurrently change behavior instantaneously when the ""unit"" reaches some threshold or you issue an order. Which makes sense for extremely disciplined troops, or troops before they engage in combat. Or if this was a brand new style of game that was just now being developed, and well you have to start somewhere so that's how it is for now but maybe it will be improved in the future. But it's not. This is how every TW game has operated for the last 20, yep twenty, years. There is still no improvement on this aspect, and many others. In fact, some things have disappeared that were there originally. Which is quite frankly shocking.

And there's more to mention in that same vein of missed opportunities, but this is already too long of a review.

So, as a stand alone game, this game is OK, it's not a bad game. If you like the art style and how it's presented and really like the setting then fine, enjoy it. I don't.

I'll start by saying I was in the group of ""too expensive, looks like Troy reskin, and Bronze Age without Greeks, Mesopotamia, etc is lame"" but, I decided to get the game during the early access weekend with the full expectation of not enjoying it and refunding. Boy was I wrong, not only did I enjoy the early access, but I had withdrawals after it ended. For all those reviews who say it's just a boring reskin of Troy, I suggest you look at their measly 1 hr or less played time. Asinine take. The campaign itself is 10x as deep as anything seen in Troy. The battles have been greatly improved upon. Yes, light units move fast, but you when battle lines clash they have much more weight to them than Troy ever did. Gone are the Troy features of units just running right through each other, especially routing units. If you have a unit surrounded and it starts to route, it will take a good minute for them to work their way through your units and they will take tons of casualties doing so, even the General units who are very strong in this game. Yes, Bronze Age doesn't have the variation of units but ffs TW fans praise the shit out of shogun and that game was Ashigaru & Bow spam till you win. WOW what a great game with huge selection of units. 

As for the campaign map and features - resources require you to plan your expansion ahead of time. If you don't get a stone building soon enough you won't be expanding any of your cities. Too many wood, bronze, and stone cities? Good luck building an army which is supplied mostly from food. Want to use the court mechanics to their fullest? Need gold from a city or tons of sacking & raiding. Yes yes this is fairly identical to Troy BUT you now have the addition of outposts on the map. These are genius imo. Different outposts provide different bonuses to their regions and bonuses to any armies that visit them. They also refund 50% of the movement spent to reach them, which is a HUGE bonus considering the map is pretty vertical and you will be eventually be facing invasions from Crisis factions as well as the starting factions.

The civilization state mechanic is interesting as well. I believe it's similar to Attila (not sure didn't play a bunch of Attila) where the worse civilization gets the factions get different malus. There are techs that will help with these such as giving bonus resources etc during the worse phases of civilization and you can bring the phases back up by controlling Culture Centres and improving them. 

Overall its a very solid TW game and glad to be back to an Historical version. Yes, I too would have loved a Med 3 or Empire 2 but just because we didn't get right now doesn't mean this game is garbage and it's most definitely not ""simply a reskin of Troy""

One very valid point about the game is it's price, which definitely beggars more thought before you purchase.

That said, TW: Pharaoh is a very standout entry to the Total War series. With over 800 hours in TW Troy across Steam & Epic, I can very confidently say this is *not* a Troy reskin in the slightest. Every campaign mechanic has been built from the ground up, and even mechanics that also exist in Troy (such as the multi-resource economy) are greatly expanded upon and are balanced entirely differently. Battles are much longer, bloodier affairs with fluid unit movement and more options to ensure formations are held. The impending collapse of the Bronze Age world is captured exceptional well by all aspects of the game, from visuals to pacing. The game is exceptionally smooth and bug-free (with about 20 hours across the EA & release I've yet to encounter any bugs or persistent performance issues).

Pharaoh's main downside is the AI, which can be utterly stupid.

It's not bad, I really want to like it.

Also when the AI comes at you with 2-3 armies while you have 1-2 armies max, it just sucks.

With adjustments to the food upkeep costs, this could be pretty good.

But I was actually surprised that its one of the better Total War games I had played, I enjoy this much more than Three Kingdoms so far.

1. The Battles are much slower paced like they used to be.
2. There is no real fantasy elements and its all very much based in real history.
3. The battles seem to have a lot more weight to them, the units feel like they are fighting not just pushing up against eachother.
4. There's lots of unique units for each faction, each faction feels distinct, where-as in three kingdoms it felt like it was very  much the same kingdoms copy and pasted everywhere.
5. The performance is really good so far and I've not found a single bug, the game feels very solid.
6. They have added outposts which a lot of people hate but I personally like the mechanic.
7. The return of resources, this was in Troy but it feels right here.
8. The campaign map and visuals are some of the best I have seen.

Now to address the reasons this game is being reviewed bomber, and perhaps rightly so.

1. This game is clearly based on Troy and a lot of the assets are re-used.
2. The scope of the map is smaller than people wanted.

So the scope is certainly smaller, but I think this shouldn't be taken as a bad thing, the game focuses a lot more on the internal struggles of Egypt instead of its external struggles with the surrounding nations. Its much more about civil conflict than external affairs and with this focus, it doesn't really need to cover all the nations in the bronze age.

The game does share assets from Troy but I can't really blame them for re-using some assets, the re-used assets are a small number and the newly made assets are a lot, its not uncommon for games to re-use assets (Look at Forza, Call of Duty etc)

I don't agree that this feels like a Saga game, it feels much bigger and I think it deserves its own title, but it doesn't feel like a very ambitious title, its got a much narrower focus like Napeleon Total War did. 

Personally I like the game and will continue to play it.

I will highlight just one simple fact from my experience with this game - out of SIX battles I played in the campaign as Ramesses, THREE were placed on the SAME tactical map (as in IDENTICAL), and two more on the same settlement map, while I assaulted two different settlements. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to make players play on SAME pre-made, non-dynamic maps, that do not reflect armies position on the campaign map, should be let go. I know it is the same system from Troy and Warhammer, but the series needs to move on, especially since a superior battlemap generation mechanic was already in place in previous historic titles.

This game, despite its pricetag, has no intention of moving the series forward.",1697050457,1697050457,False,94,2,0.656421840190887451,0,True,False,False

____________________________


First impressions are very positive. 

Graphics - best looking TW. Campaign map, day night cycle, the lighting and weather effects are all top notch. Battle maps environments too are a standout. 

Sound is good, the chanting and marching of the troops is weighty and really adds the flavor.  Music is good enough. 

New Mechanics are a big win. The expanded resource pool that we need to manage impacts the game in ways I like. Building my cities and towns is more deliberate. Its no longer the more-gold-less-gold boring ass binary we usually see. Also, bartering feels like you're actually bartering. Since can how your target is currently valuing any given resource and we have so many more resources to manage, there's more back and forth with your target.  

Sieges. Another win. Laying siege in Warhammer looked bad and played worse. I hated it.  Pharaoh fixed that. This is the way I want seiging to work. The scale of buildings and walls is on point and the maps make sense. It looks like a real town or city. Its immersive and tactically fun.

Battles are slightly slower pace which I prefer. I want to set up flanks and traps but units died so fast in WH that sophisticated planning was a waste of time. 

Difficulty settings. This is how its supposed to be. Options and sliders for days,  Pharaoh lets you really dial it in and lets you play exactly how you want to.

These are only my first impression too. There's still so much for me to learn. But I've seen enough to recommend it. Its fun.

The game is quite fun. You will see a lot of discourse online about this being a Saga title, but I would argue that the extensive campaign features and size (the map is quite large, even though it doesn't include Mycenea or Mesopotamia) qualify this as a legitimate historical title.

The campaign is where Pharaoh really shines. Court mechanics, Shemsu Hor, religious actions, Pillars of Civilisation- all of these elements make for an intriguing campaign. Shout out to the campaign customization as well, which offers a plethora of options for you to tailor the campaign to your liking. Want less Sea People? Sure. Less movement range? Done. Want random start positions so Ramesses III can start up in Hatti? Go for it! It will offer a lot of replayability and it's a feature I would love to see in all Total War games going forward.

Resources are a major part of the game and make you feel like you are actually ruling an empire. It also drives your strategic decisions. Hemorrhaging bronze? Well, you might have to put off expanding until you can capture a bronze settlement or upgrade your current ones. It's fun and adds another layer to the campaign.

The battles are fun and adequate, but probably not the best in the series. I do enjoy the units despite the simplicity of the setting. It reminds me in ways of Shogun 2. And simplicity isn't always bad. The new advance/fall back mechanics are wonderful and should be included in every TW game going forward. During a siege battle, I was able to have my troops at the gate push through and break through the enemy spearmen guarding the gate. A much needed feature in TW.

A word on chariots: they are fantastic in this game, but you have to learn how to use them correctly. You need to give them space to accelerate. Lots of space. You can give them a charge order from ten meters away and expect anything to happen.

Performance is excellent across the board. The game is also quite beautiful to look at and includes a photo mode.

Overall, I'd give Total War: Pharaoh an 8/10. It's a fun game with interesting mechanics, fun battles, but a little let down by the scope not including other major Bronze Age powers.
