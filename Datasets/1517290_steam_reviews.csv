Instead let us put characters that we can sell you skins for, remove the whole ""you're in a war"" theme and replace the great kick you get from the guns with fart sounds and bb shooters.
lets degrade the graphics, nerf all guns to oblivion, create empty maps, use ""Matchmaking"" because no browser for you, and last but not least lets get an idiot to ruin the franchise's music.

There is still an issue with content variety compared to previous Battlefield titles, but comparing the current state of the game to the state at launch, it needs to be said that Battlefield 2042 has undergone massive improvements and changes, and it is an absolute blast to play. It feels like a classic online shooter experience, with no stat-tracking BS skill based matchmaking systems forcing you into a 50/50 win-loss ratio and throwing you into games that feel completely unfair and rigged. Lobbies feel like organic random selections of players matched together based on their connection instead of their stats, and all of this deserves to be praised. It truly is a great time. 

 That is, when it works.

 There are still issues with the game, balancing issues, baked in flaws with certain mechanics that were ill conceived and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the game. There are issues with the core design philosophy of the operator system, which even with the addition of conventional classes still muddies the identity of Battlefield. There are occasional minor bugs and glitches, none of which are game breaking and can usually be fixed with a restart of the game. But the absolute biggest issue with BF2042, is the EA app, and EA's DREADFUL online service. 

 There is a major bug within the EA service itself that makes friends appear offline, even when they're not. Even when you're all in game trying to invite each other, you simply can't because they do not appear in the social tab. There is no fix for this. There is seemingly no reason for this, and no cause. No amount of restarting the game or EA app will fix this. It simply decides when it does or doesn't want to allow you to play with friends. 

 Friends will appear online in the EA app, though it will not show that they are in game, even though THEY ARE. You cannot view them in the social tab in-game, and therefore cannot invite them, because the EA app lacks BASIC SOCIAL FEATURES, such as SENDING GAME INVITES!!!! 

 The only choices you have are; 
 1: Pray. 
 2: find something else to do for the rest of the day, because there is nothing you can do to fix this issue. It's not on your end. Unlucky.

 No amount of restarts, verifying game files or repairing damaged files, system restarts, or uninstalling will fix this issue. It will simply work again for no reason in a few hours, or within a day or so. Trying to play with friends in this game is a ****ING NIGHTMARE and randomly cripples your ability to party up, which is such a shame because when it works, it's so much fun. 

 2042 has had a rough time getting to a playable state. The launch was one of the worst in video game history. And even though it's in a much better state now, EA's incompetence is still holding it back from reaching it's full potential. I cannot recommend this game with the experience I've had, not based on the game itself, but based solely on the bare-bones, incompetent, poorly designed, poorly maintained, and entirely dysfunctional EA app that players are forced to use. EA, fix your broken systems and services, or get rid of them completely and let us play our games through Steam.",1708904033,1708904033,False,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Gameplay? It's actually decent. Well balanced, not great but well balanced. Gunsfeel fun and you dont need to put a lot of bullets into enemy for them to stop - so more reality.

Graphics? Jeez. Some of the darker maps brings memories from BF3. Love it. 

Specialists. I thought they were going to be like in apex - but not at all. They are great. Not too op gadgets (except scout drone) but all-around fun specialists. I've got few favourites.

Not too many hackers - so far in 24 in-game hours.

I can admit that this game is a more of a COD game than BF game. Would love to have more slower gagmeplay, especially in narrow conquest games.

Ok guys now we need to be able to play it without breaking expensive hardware. Yes this game came really close to frying my motherboard. Not only did it do that, they are too lazy to add the ASUS mobo drivers to their Anticheats whitelist, that in turn causes their anticheat to kill a kernel program causing your pc to crash. But dont worry they have a fix. Just download a sketchy program and give it admin rights to suspend YOUR MOBO DRIVERS while you play the game. Did my dumbass listen to EA? yea i did! and last time id ran the game with disabled mobo drivers it crashed anyway and when my pc came back on did any of my peripherals work? NO....

-If the game is heavily discounted.

-If you are willing to spend money on a game that will possibly lose support the moment a breath of the 'next Battlefield game is coming out' (it’s what happened to Battlefield V and Battlefront II 2017 when this was announced loosely) 

-Finally, knowing full well that this game is not being made by the same DICE team that has made many of the games in the past that just play better in many ways. 

I hate to say that I don’t think this is what Battlefield is anymore, I will say it isn’t as horrible as it was at launch but there are so many weird things going on, for example, the game feels like nothing has weight, when you turn left and right or look up and down the game just feels as if everything is made of paper and cardboard, another example is that almost all of the weapons in this game are just laser beams from any range, why?. 

Just know that with whatever the next Battlefield title will be, the launch of this game and this game alone is what that game [b] CAN NOT BE. [/b]
I love Battlefield, and I really don’t mind what 2042 has become. But please do not expect much from this very hollow game.

Tried to refund the 100ish dollars i spent on it but steam wouldnt give the refund because i spent more than an hour in the game.  BUT now that they have fixed 90 percent of the major issues i am quite happy.  It finally feels like it shouldve from the beginning.  It is a shame that most of the players are gone now.  

Game play feels fluid, guns feel good, attachments seem to make a difference even if its minimal.  Only huge complaint i have is the engineer AT/Javelin/RPG  feel useless takes wayyyyy too many rockets to kill any armor.  The fact that the choppers and planes do not have to go back to a landing strip or helipad to get more flares or repair or reload guns like it used to be in earlier battlefields makes killing planes and choppers VERY VERY VERY hard.  Not a fan of it.  On most maps its pointless getting in armor because of the air support.  

Another small complaint there is no limit of the amount of any one class on a map.  So everyone plays sniper or engineers and you end up with 40 snipers on a team or 40 engineers and you either get scoped nonstop the second you spawn or if youre in armor yet again 20 javelins tossed at you less than 2 minutes into spawning a tank you waited for 4 minutes for.

I spent £100 on this and in return received an unoptimised, unfinished game. The game doesn’t even have a scoreboard or any detailed statistics page to show my k/d ratio and accomplishments. Not to mention the fact that I run the game with everything on low settings with DLSS and only achieve 120fps. Can’t even reach my monitors 144hz refresh rate which is a complete joke when it’s 2022 and games like PUBG with bigger maps can achieve a stable 200fps.

I finally decided to come back to this game after 2 years and it's finally an enjoyable and playable experience. In its original state I would have never in a million years recommended this game to anyone, but now it's actually a decent game. The only downside that I have noticed so far is the lag of animations across multiple maps such as the rocket world event on Orbital due to the 20hz tick rate servers on solo/co-op. When the rocket is flying up into the air, it doesn't look smooth at all; like going up and down whilst travelling up as if it was lagging despite me being on 25-30ms latency. This isn't an issue on the normal online servers as they're 45hz tick rate.

The latency is terrible, shooting someone for like 5 to 10 bullets before I even doing any damage to them, vehicles are always overpowered because there is no incentive to use engineer to take them out. Lacking in content you unlock the same attachments over and over for guns that all feel the same, lack of realism, the game just needs to go back to its roots with movement and accuracy of the way firearms look, feel, sound, and operate.

I feel like there are only 10-20 really players ever in my matches there are other people there but they move and act like more advanced bots than the actual AI. Most of the time they are on the my team making me feel like I am constantly losing, the AI bots are just too easy to farm and shouldn't be in the game but they cant even fill servers anymore so it makes sense 

The map design is terrible, only good maps are the ""Legacy"" maps the have from the previous titles. maps are just boring to play, especially when there is no lore behind them. Not after a single player campaign or even a co-op mode is really just adding fuel to the dumpster fire EA calls a battlefield.

After doing some research and tweaking some settings, I was able to bring down my CPU usage. Additionally, I was having some issues with my network that was compounding my issues. After getting a tech out to troubleshoot and repair my network, I have been able to play again without issues. I still think that the devs should look into the CPU usage and figure out a way to better optimize the game. 

I have been enjoying this game for awhile, that is, until something changed. Not sure if it was an update or what but now when I play, my CPU usage goes through the roof and makes it nearly impossible to play. 

Specs:
Intel i9-10900 @ 2.80 GHz
3070ti

Is it as good as BF3, 4 or 1? No. The ""premium"" edition priced over 100$€ at launch was an embarrassing money grab for no substantial content at all. The lack of a proper server browser hinders the game so much. It basically makes the game unplayable outside peak hours as everyone just gets spread out over bot lobbies. How you've failed to implement this in like 2,5 years is beyond me. Where community ran servers were the exact thing that made BF 3,4 and 1 so good and is keeping them alive to this day.

But looking past the way EA fumbled the ball with this game. By showing no comprehension at all of knowing what their community loved about the franchise. A sad thing more developers suffer from these days. Overall, looking past all its flaws, I really enjoy playing the game. And would certainly recommend it on sale.

This isn't a battlefield game. I'm forced to download 3rd party software (EA's Launcher) which also starts up alongside my normal routines which adds another thing to roll my eyes at when I boot up. The game play is literally just CoD with the ADHD kids and rhetoric in chat logs. After buying the game, there are the unstoppable first play cut scene (I had to stop the game wholesale via task manager just to avoid it which resulted in another unskippable cut scene) alongside a conquest mode tutorial and game which I find predatory since they're intentionally doing that to prevent people from refunding since it adds play time without actual play. Before even playing a match, I had to fix and optimize my settings in game since it somehow confused my monitor with a 144hz as opposed to 60 which to be fair might've just been an odd bug since once I made the switch.

All of this to say that was a ton of effort to just get into the game. The wait time for me was 2ish minutes on a weekday, so I'm sure on the weekend its bumping so no complaints there. The menu loading times on the other hand. Sure 2-3 seconds, I'm used to BF taking not even a second with scaled down UI as opposed to feeling like I'm in a e-store the entire time.

TLDR: Its not old BF (BC2, BF3, or BF4) its a great rendition of CoD tho with BF game modes so if that's your what you're looking for definitely buy it! If you grew up (2008-2014) causing war crimes like me on BF this isn't the game for you. For those that feel the need to leap to its defense, its not a bad game. Its just not what was advertised to me (imo), and its difficult to point out clear differences since I've been away for over a decade. Its just not the old BF fun. Now its more fun for the competitiveness(?) idk how to describe it.

After some progress, I am reassessing the game at over 250 hours, and level 100 (S001) ranking in the game. 2042 has historically been a game of contestation, so I'll be highlighting over the biggest aspects.

Overall, I *recommend* Battlefield 2042 for people who want an FPS emblematic of PUBG and older game titles.

[h3]Specialists, styles & game play tactics[/h3]

In 2042, you are given a total of 14 operators, officially called ""specialists."" Much like Rainbow Six Siege, each specialist tailors to focusing on a specific playing style per class. As a new player, you will most likely play one or more of the following:

- MacKay (Assault)
- Boris (Engineer)
- Falck (Support)
- Casper (Recon)

There is no variance in the fundamentals of a class, regardless of whoever you choose. You should find a specialist that fits best with your playing style so you can become more in-tune with the game. For assault players, your main focus is in infantry aggression, pushing into objectives and acting as a first-line. Engineers cater vehicular activities, found in Rush, Conquest, and Breakthrough. (Rush + Conquest) Support and recon are as self-explanatory as the assault class.

Whether you're playing Team Deathmatch, Rush or any other game mode, there are ""meta"" tactics used by most common regular players, such as ""dropshot""-ing and spawncamping. 2042 is reminiscent of COD, be wary when starting.

[h3]Gun play & levelling[/h3]

**Gun play in 2042 is broken**. To learn more, consider watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sd9QooFI9k]this YouTube video[/url].

Weapons are categorically divided into five: SMG, Assault, (e.g. carbine-based) LMG, DMR, (e.g. marksman/rifle-based weapons) Sniper, and Tactical. Approximately half of all SMG and Assault weapons will come with little-to-no recoil. All other categories will have marginally wide bullet spread and adverse vertical recoil; and attachments are required to be unlocked via. kills or prerequisite challenges.

These are the best weapons to start with (as a beginner) if you wish to have a balanced experience between levelling and playing:

- M5A3
- VHX-D3
- AM40
- K30
- PBX-45
- DM7
- SWS-10
- MCS-880

[h3]Multiplayer & network connections[/h3]

2042 has a slight problem with keeping persistent connections between clients and servers. You should expect occasional and common disconnects. This may or may not be a dealbreaker for some, as of Season 6, persistence loss has significantly decreased.",1702868372,1708373165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is a scam. Do not buy it. Game is missing core features from previous battlefield games. You would be better off purchasing an older battlefield game and playing that instead.

EDIT at 41.7 hours played. I came back after 2 years and it seems they have addressed many of the problems that were around at launch. I can say I do genuinely enjoy playing the game now, but I'm more just playing it cause I paid full price at launch and wanted a battlefield game to play. It DOES actually feel like battlefield in my opinion, but they haven't done anything that warrants me changing my review. They haven't even done the BARE MINIMUM to bring this game up to par with its predecessors. They added a scoreboard and infantry maps? Ok, should've been there at launch. It's nothing groundbreaking. They don't have persistent lobbies which is still stupid in my opinion. 

EDIT: I don't know if it's either the game or the launcher, but one of these is causing my laptop to reject my internet connection and say ""no internet"" while still hooked up to the wifi. Only happens when I try to play this game every other time. You guys are a JOKE. I'm not paying full price for one of your games again. I'd give a less than one star review if possible. It's literally a CHORE just trying to get into a match.

EDIT at 102.4 hours played. Clearly I have enjoyed playing the game just based on my hours put into it. I still hope it fails really, too much wrong with it. More glitches: I was just signed out of my EA account while in the middle of a match. Also, I keep running into a glitch that disables all controller and keyboard inputs for several seconds, which is especially frustrating while I am in the middle of a match. This is the one and only game I have these issues with. WIFI glitch still occuring. Do better EA.

EA app has now shut down on me and is refusing to reconnect. ""Try again in a minute"" it says, which does not work. As of right now the game has now become unplayable. I payed $110 for this dogshlt. You will NEVER get full price from me again. Come to think of it, what was all that extra money I spent on the ""season pass?"" what do we have, like, 4 DLC maps? When TEN YEARS AGO they were realeasing 4 maps for every add on pack? By 2015 BF4 had like 23 DLC maps.

I havn't played it for a long time. Afther release the game was broken pretty much it was a bad release.
But now the patched the whole thing up its actually pretty enjoyable. 

But still the thing i miss the most right about now is: You cant lean this function was normal in previous battlefields. The maps are big and open at first i did not mis the leaning function but when i was searching for it in the menu. Some how the gameplay is fast so you wont notice. 

The sounds are very good the game sets the mood. The recoil here is very low so shooting isn't a challenge the challenge is more hitting the person who is a threath. I hope the next battlefield is going to be a bit more complete with the leaning mechanics. Ill just rate this game up right now. I havnt played it long but long enough to know the maps a bit. It's enjoyable now better than before so try it out if you dont like it refund it simple. For me i like this game it's always call of duty against battlefield. I've played battlefield more than i did call of duty.

Battlefield 2042 offers an experience that, on the surface, seems to fulfill the franchise's promises, yet it falls short of capturing the essence that fans have come to love. The game is marred by a repetitive gameplay loop that, despite its scale, fails to leverage this advantage effectively. Historically, the series has been celebrated for its emergent gameplay, where the vast, highly detailed maps and the dynamic ability to alter the battlefield play a central role. Unfortunately, these elements feel notably absent or underutilized in Battlefield 2042, leading to a sense of disconnection and disappointment when compared to its predecessors.

Additionally, the introduction of more unrealistic features has diluted the sense of immersion that is crucial to the Battlefield experience. This shift away from what made the series stand out has been a significant detractor for me. Given these factors, I find it difficult to recommend Battlefield 2042. It seems as though the developers have lost sight of the core attributes that previously defined and elevated the franchise.",1708234245,1708234245,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Modern Warfare, Russians, Americans, well yea i would not mind taking those drones away but all in all, superb game, i never played these games for story anyways, it is all about the chaos in multiplayer and the destruction, so far... loving the new classes and being able to choose a character with dif perks.
Reminds me a lot of Battlefield 4, and most of the maps are very dynamic and interesting, loving it.

Cons:
- Long loading screens even with an SSD M2NVme 4.0
- Every time i log in i have to be reminded of your Battlepass, i dont give a DAM* About your Battlepass, i dont need it, Battlefield dont need it.
- Way many information on the Menu and i would rather have a cleaner HUD when playing.
- Even though i do like that now characters have so much more gadgets, i would like a more realistic approach rather than stupid wingsuits and grappling hooks.
- Team Death Match maps are not made for team death match, none of them are, they just cut conquest maps in half and tag it has TDM, it is not a classic TDM experience like they call it, you dont have a base where you spawn, it keeps changing spawns so it makes it frustrating to play because many times you spawn around enemies;
- Same goes for classic modes like conquest, spawns are very mediocre and sometimes you spawn miles away from the objective, even sometimes 2 meters from an enemy.
- Modes like breakthrough should not have vehicles, as some people block entry points to sites and it is nearly impossible for defending teams to have a chance to win.

Few cheaters here and there, other than that, Incredible audio as usual and amazing visuals.

However, it's still playable if I am careful and find great firing positions rather than constantly run and gun - as my objective is to destroy enemy armor. The jets are a great addition, and mouse flying 5th gen is incredibly smooth. Vehicle driving is greatest it's been, and up there with the dedicated greats like need for speed. I really like racing ground vehicles, and driving tanks feels very, very smooth. I put hours into BF4 over the years, and although my mini PC isn't the fastest, I am glad I can play relatively smooth and excited for the future of BattleField franchise.

I would say that I am very satisfied with the new experience, I feel like I discover the game again. Also, the Ray Tracing looks absolutely beautiful in some maps and it make a difference. For me this is a very fun battlefield. I played to every battlefield since battlefield 3 and I can say this one is one of my favorite. I think the game feels better than it may seems and there are a lot of things to do. I got it in sale for arround 12€, and for that price I think that was a steal.

They've already made exclusive skins, Battle Passes and Collection Events, all of which feels wrong, because there is no fully-developed game around those elements. It's like throwing money into a slot machine. Wasteful.

There is no guarantee that the developers won't abandon the game as they already did with the Battlefield 5. You can't be sure about its future. No new agents were added since the end of Year 1.

If you look into it, the game had a rough development because corporate was trying to ride the hype train and make a CoD Warzone wannabe, complete with lore that gets released on a season-by-season basis that no one cares about, and unique soldiers with specific abilities that are either totally useless or completely overpowered. The game is fine for some mindless fun if you get it discounted. But honestly it sucks because it suffers from the same issues that plague every single battlefield game, but are amplified by a hundred because of these unique characters that don't belong in this IP.

For example, tanks or heavy vehicles would rather camp at spawn because if they get too close to the combat zone, Mackay is going to use his grappling gun from half a football field away to get on top of the tank where no one can hit him, spread his cheeks and dump his load of C5 before twerking away into the sunset with his finger on the detonator. Same goes for wingsuit bitch doing the same thing but flying across the entire map instead. If you thought 2142 was ass because of suicide bombers, well you ain't seen shit.

Update: Oh yeah and EA Anti cheat just booted me from a match and shut down my game... while I was playing solo against the AI...

I just got it recently and despite the negativity that surrounded the game when it first came out, I can say that the game is fun and I haven't encountered any bugs so far. This is my first battlefield game that I've played since Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, and this game doesn't live up to them. The game play is fun and the shooting is satisfying, but that's about it. The maps are boring. They're too open, spaced out, and there's no real flow to them. The destructible environments might as well not exist. The classes are also boring. 

The game play feels watered down because it doesn't feel dynamic and it just comes down to shooting. Each class has a certain special ability like all the other battlefield games, but since the game play is so fast paced and the maps are so open, they don't feel unique or have any real utility. Medics can be useful sometimes, but if you have decent squad mates, then they can revive you anyway regardless of their class. Also since any class can use any type of weapon, it makes the class type even more moot. Sure each class specializes in a certain weapon type and they gain certain benefits from it, but it's really not that big of a hindrance to use a different weapon.

I can't really explain it, but between the poor map design, the game's fast paced focus (faster than what a good Battlefield game feels like), and the fading of classes, it just feels like a watered down shooter that looks like a Battlefield game, but lost touch with what a Battlefield game is suppose to be. All I want is more Bad Company.

Actually, all I want is a 2142 remake.

Also, fuck you EA for locking a third of your content behind the elite edition.

Is it worth $10.00? For some mindless fun, sure. It beats getting an aneurysm from sweating in Warzone. Is it ever worth handing over your money to EA? Absolutely the fuck not.",1700930769,1707953946,False,6,0,0.559930682182312012,0,True,False,False

Non of the guns feel unique. Almost all of them play the same with the same recoil.
Most of the original maps are poorly designed except for a hand full. Sorry can't name them cause they are not that memorable. 
Portal mode never got the love and attention that it needed so it's pretty much dead now. 
They wasted resources on a battle royal extraction mode that was pretty much dead on arrival.
The specialists suck. They tried to turn battlefield into a hero shooter. The specialists are not tied to factions which means the enemy team play the same specialists as your team. At least COD had the decency to tie the specialist to a faction. The class system is terrible. Weapons are no longer tied to classes, but they now get proficiency bonuses to give players an incentive to stick to the weapons. It doesn't add much to be honest.
The UI is god awful. 
The sound design is terrible and the OST sucks and isn't memorable.
Battlefield no longer makes you think about the weapons you bring and class you play as.
Battlefield no longer feels like a military shooter. 
Battlefield no longer feels like Battlefield.


Note: 
I used to be a pretty passionate BF fan. I'm so angry about this game because I know Dice could do better, and they have. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun playing this, but the quality that Battlefield used to have is gone. Everything this game sets out to do sucks in comparison to previous games, or even other games in the market. So yeah don't waste your hard earn money on this. At most get it on a sale. Somewhere between $10-$15.

I now have 100 hours on Steam, plus another 200 or so on PS5, so I've played quite a bit. I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to offer a perspective from someone who is a long-term player and is actually still playing.

I skipped the first 2 years of this game because of the awful launch. I tried the beta and was completely disappointed. I had faith that they would fix it eventually, as they always do, but this was the first time I actually didn't even want to play a Battlefield game at launch.

Fans of previous Battlefield games can have a lot of fun here now. Try the 64-player Conquest mode instead of 128. They didn't get the 128-player mode right, and it still feels a bit ridiculous if you're a long-term Battlefield player. Nobody likes feeling like what you and your squad do is essentially inconsequential, which is how the 128-player Conquest feels to me. The 128-player mode is a spectacle, but that's all it is to me. The 64-player mode fixes this: one player or squad can have a significant impact on the game, as it's always been with Battlefield.

The maps are plentiful and pretty solid overall. I get the feeling we won't be remembering how great any of these maps are in 5-10 years like we do with maps from BC2, BF3, and BF4, but there is a lot of fun to be had, and there is a good variety. Even though this game basically flopped, DICE & EA stuck with it. They improved it (as they do with every Battlefield game after a few years...) and kept adding content. Classes are back now (finally, DICE/EA, how did you think Operators were a good idea?), 64-player Conquest is in the game, and all the BC2 portal maps are in the main rotation.

There are still some issues: classes are back but not as they used to be, any class can use any primary weapon leading to a massive oversupply of Engineers, because why not if you can have the best AR in the game and RPGs at the same time. There are no consistent lobbies leading to playing the same map repeatedly, among some other things.

Performance is great, but I do have a 4070, so it's probably not a fair test reflective of what most people experience. However, it also did well on a 3060 I have in another computer, as it should. No random stutters or any of that nonsense. DLSS implementation here is great, I use quality mode at 1440P and see absolutely no downgrade in quality.

It still isn't quite the Battlefield game we deserved, but after some time and many fixes & changes, the game is in a good place & is well worth your time and the €11 asking price on sale.",1707756455,1707756455,True,3,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False

Even starting it is a gamble. It never starts from the first launch, and the worst thing they could do was to let you think it is loading while you are stuck in an infinite loop of some video, the one you don't even see when it launches properly. A word of advice, when you see that video (earth/hospital) don't wait, nothing will be loaded and the only option you have is forcefully close it and try your luck again...

The next big problem is cache files, which are being saved to your One drive cloud and somehow it grows HUGE, in gigabytes so if you don't have enough space there, you are... It's like they are working for Microsoft making you upgrade and buy more free space...

The last but not the least is a problem with loading. The battles and return to the main menu, just take unreasonable amount of time to load. If you compare it with other simmilar games it looks like somebody deliberately made it this way to waste your time.

This game had a rough launch. I didnt play it for the whole first year it was out, even though I preordered it. 

But I can safely say that BF2042 is an excellent game (and has been for a few years). it is my default to return to when I am bored of everything else.

The stuttering that has happened now makes the game unplayable,
I have to play the game in window mode or the picture is incredibly dim
Every time I spawn in the game completely locks up for 2 or 3 seconds (I do mean EVERY spawn)

The frustrating part of this is that I had no problems in August/September of last year. This all occurred around an update at the end of 2023. The game has become slightly better since then, but that's easy to do considering after the year-end update the game would 100% lock up and just repeat whatever last sound it heard until I completely closed the game out (The same 1-second gun-shot on repeat full blast in your ears is quite annoying), I guess we should count ourselves fortunate that was fixed.

If I could get a refund, I would. But the 30-plus hours I racked up before the game became unplayable will prevent that from happening. Maybe steer clear of this game, or don't. When it's playable it was fun, still BF3 and 4 were better titles.",1707717722,1707717722,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But even if you get to that point, I would recommend you just play Battlefield V instead. It has more players than 2042 everyday and is a better overall Battlefield experience.

I tried really hard to like this game, because I love Battlefield, and although there are some things it does well I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a genuine Battlefield experience. First and foremost, it has no single player experience. You may not think this is a big deal, but since almost every BF game before this have had single player campaigns that were genuinely well made, it feels scummy of them to not include one with this game and still ask for 60 dollars. 

Secondly, the hero/specialist system. At launch and for a couple seasons, there were only hero's in the game, each with their own special abilities, gadgets and passive perks instead of the traditional specialist system from previous BF games. This would have been an ok change, if they were balanced. Some felt significantly more powerful than others, and of course that led to EVERYONE using the same 2-3 heros, while the others were virtually unable to compete. However, they have since reintroduced the specialist system. So problem solved right? Absolutely not. Their way of adding a specialist system into this game was to take all heros, and divide them up into the 4 specialist categories. Additionally, each specialist class has a proficiency with a certain type of weapons (For example, Medic gets increased ADS speed with SMGs, Assault gets increased starting ammo with Assault Rifles, etc.) However, you are not locked to these weapon types per your specialist choice, meaning you can use whatever class of weapon you want with any specialist. Since the specialist weapon class proficiency perks are so bland and barely make a difference, most people still use whatever gun they want with whatever hero they want. The specialist system feels entirely pointless, and I can't help but feel DICE just shoehorned it in as a way to stop the players from complaining. 

Thirdly, gunplay and movement. Have you played any Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare 2019? If you answered yes, then you have already felt what 2042 gunplay and movement feels like. Although it doesn't feel bad by any means, I can't help but feel it's simply a lazy choice to simply copy modern CoD gameplay when Battlefield already had it's own identity in this regard. Guns have absolutely no recoil. Scope glint is now a thing, and since the movement is as fast as CoD movement now, you're shooting yourself in the foot for using a DMR or Sniper as Assault Rifles have egregiously good range and super fast ADS speed (and also no recoil as mentioned before) It features sprint and tactical sprint, but tac-sprint is INFINITE with no cooldown, and the ADS speed out of tac-sprint is the exact same speed as ADS speed out of normal sprint. Meaning tac-sprint is a total redundancy in the sandbox, and is only there as tool to say ""Look CoD players, our game has tac-sprint and slide cancelling too!""

Fourth, the maps. The maps are where my only praise for this game comes in. The maps are gorgeous. Each features it's own theme reflected it it's name. Kaleidoscope is a futuristic city featuring a lot of polygonal architecture and clean, straight edges along with a great color palette.  Hourglass is a neon city of skyscrapers covered in sand dunes. Exposure features an underground lab cut in half and exposed by a massive landslide, featuring some really fun gameplay moments on top of, at the bottom of, and inside of a massive canyon wall. Like every other BF game, the maps have a great sense of scale and art direction. It's a shame the rest of the game cant' be of the same quality. 

Finally, destructibility and levolution. 2042 features a pitiful amount of destructibility for a Battlefield game. Very, very few walls/floors anywhere in the game can be destroyed with explosions. Levolution is present only on some of the maps, and most of the time you wont't even see it because it barely affects gameplay. Remember in BF4 when an entire dam would collapse and flood the map? Or when an entire skyscraper would fall and the rubble pile became the new objective? Well in 2042, sometimes a small piece of a freighter ships hull falls over and makes one new opening to an objective point. Or sometimes a tornado spawns and rolls right over only one objective on the map and disappears. The levolution is very boring and gets lapped by BF4's levolution, a game that came out over 10 years ago.

With 128 players is VERY confusing plus you can't find enough games to play with PC players only, you have to crossplay. I don't see many bugs as used to when the game was launched.
Bought the game under 10€ on Blackfriday weekend.

Game sounds are a bit bad, don't expect to level all buildings to the ground. Weapons are easy to use in my opinion.

Edit 11/02/2024: since beggining of the year I suddenly got low fps, constant freeze. 5800X3d + 2080ti was running great! Now its like playing cyberpunk in 4k! NEGATIVE REVIEW.

Ultimately, it feels like a pretty good adaptation of a Battlefield game, but not all the way through. The option to mod guns in combat, use weapons across all classes, and the implementation of operator-specific abilities is WEIRD but not BAD. If this would have been marketed as an all new franchise it probably would have been well-received. Here are some things I noted:

Gun play? Really good, satisfying. Weapon customization in combat is... different but kinda cool.

Operators are fine, but they should not be able to be on both teams, really weird idea. Have 2 operators with same abilities, but one for each faction. Seems like a corner that was cut.

Operator abilities are fun, not game-changing for the most part.

Vehicle variety is nice.

Portal. Wow. Being able to play on a Bad Company 2 map with the classic guns makes me so unbelievably happy. It takes me back to early mornings when I would sneak onto my XBOX 360 just to play a match before heading off to school.

In conclusion, the game is not traditional, but not bad. I know it had launch issues and such, but now that it goes on sale for roughly $11 USD, it is totally worth picking up.

I almost rated this as negative because of the issues Ive had before hand (EA launcher was crashing thus I couldnt play vibeo gane)

If you're unaware of what battlefield is, its basically like call of duty on a large scale: 32 people on each team are placed on massive scale maps and have the objective of capturing flags. In other words everyone roleplays as those background characters that die immediately while the 5 people who have an ungodly amount of time in FPS games roleplay as the protagonists with actual dialog and meaningful impact 

This game is pretty much as fun as I remember the betas being so for $10 its not terrible 

But there are some glaring issues: 

-The game crashes a LOT, especially if you have a select amount of random programs open (it appears discord is a huge no no with 2024????) 
-Theres some major network issues on the 64 v 64 mode 
-General performance stutters in some spots 
-Theres this weird thing where if you're on the losing team you get spawn camped a lot 

But on the flip side it appears this game isnt plagued by some other industry standard garbage that made me lose interest in FPS games many moons ago like skill based matchmaking 

So win some lose some. As someone whos a more casual gamer these days and bought for $10 well after the rocky launch I think this game is pretty okay if you're good with just accepting you're going to lose sometimes",1707615631,1707615631,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Rifles accurate past 100m? not likely in this game, super realistic!

They've had a year to tune and balance but I just left a map where a guy in a little bird went 40 - 1 because Aircraft and vehicles are still overpowered, especially aircraft, it's ridiculous a guy in a little bird can go a whole map and not be killed with AA missiles or AA vehicle. Also it takes 3 C4s to kill a LAV? 1 should do it.

Which is (unfortunately) a big plus compared to Battlefield 1 and 5. 

The gameplay is enjoyable. The gunplay actually is really good nowadays, and vehicles balance is the best one I've seen so far in the Battlefield games. Don't get me wrong, the game does have many flaws, fundamental ones even. I would not recommend getting this game for a full price. But for 12€ (as it is on the current sale), it is definitely worth it. Even more if you play with a small group of friends.

[25/11/2021] Edit : the update just got released and the game is way better then before. bullets wise - pp-29 wise and FPS problem solved  (but why profanity filter always on hmmm )

[2/12/2021] Edit: the 3rd update fixed the major problems in the first hour of the update was awesome but. also cause a new problem some players couldn't move their mouse at all but it didn't happen to me, overall i gotta wait for the servers now to get fixed up

[15/12/2021] Edit: Here i am still playing after all the updates but bro the game really changed but i am still a little upset but with all the changes but hey dice is just showing us a glimpse of battlefield 2042 is going to be in the future


[/1/2022] late Edit: the update is a joke, hint to what happened FARMING!!! i got nothing to say..

[3/2/2022] Late Edit: (The game is Dead) a lot of weird things been happening they released a weekly mission and after 1 day they decide to remove it cause a lot of complaints about the weekly is missing the task/missions welp, overall idk what to do about this game anymore . . . like should i even refund?

[20/4/2022] Late Edit: A huge update came out and it feels like a nothing changed at all just tweak there and there and the VOIP chat would be nice if they at least added more maps cause the game needs a lot of maps and portal should be like full xp potential not reduced or anything for an example no ai means 100% xp but nope, this update is ok.

[19/8/2022] its been 4 months i am still playing the game and its still getting more patches and finished the ZeroHour, there's couple of notes the shop (in-game) is so weird like i can't even understand what DICE is planing to do, before we had the weekly missions for a skin as a reward for completing the mission and now these skins are in the store so u can buy them even tho the weekly system before the patches it was glitchy so no one could've even try finishing these Weekly missions, kinda weird tbh from DICE overall game is in a good condition (somewhat) / Fr tho this BF is a joke -BAD BALANCING-


[5/6/2023] Really late Edit: its been 260 days since my last update in the game i am still playing the game from time to time and after all I've been through i believe that the game is ready to be played somewhat. . . the reason why i said somewhat because of the vault/Portal weapons they getting balanced even though most vault/portal weapons are broken and  finally thought about adding Camo/weapon skins to these weapons (vault/portal) and some extra attachment, why the extra attachments? i don't know.

Should I spend 0.4 more hours and end up voiding my refund policy?

Edit: This game itself is OK, but on software perspective it is pure trash. I had to fiddle around to figure out how to fix being stuck in loading screen during my 1.6 hours playtime. Then, when I finally got into the game (I ""fixed"" it by relaunching multiple times), there is server issue where I always end up joining an empty server (the only way to fix this is by enabling crossplay). Even if there was a match, there are another two issues, I got kicked by no reason, and also performance is so bad. My character moves in slow-mo which is actually a global issue since 2 years ago. Finally, this game is online-only, so there is no way I can enjoy the game when the game itself is unplayable and doesn't have any singleplayer. Yes, I know it is advertised as multiplayer game, but my point is their server sucks.

Also, I actually notice this since BF4 when they updated the game having an in-game server browser. Since that day, BF4 starts to be unplayable sometimes.

^ This is what I put as my refund request for Battlefield 2042

(May 8, 2022): I think this game is a lot more worth it than it used to be. I was denied my refund request for this game and I've been playing on and off ever since but recently I've been playing a lot more. They did an update recently that fixed a lot of bugs, made the game's animations smoother and made the game run smoother all around. They tried to balance a few things, which worked in some ways and didn't in others. I still wouldn't pay full price for this game, but if you could get it for $30 or less, then I would say that would be a pretty good deal.

(February 8, 2024): This game is literally malware. They released a series of updates that has permanently ruined the performance for this game. For reference, I have a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x, so there should be no game under the sun that gives my computer a run for its money. However, this game stutters and has frame drops all the time and it doesnt happen on any other game. For some reason, this game just takes 100% of my CPU for literally no reason in the middle of a match. This has been going on for a lot of people for the past year or so, but it finally hit me and hasn't gone away after even uninstalls.",1641033828,1707454165,False,2,0,0.527356564998626709,0,True,False,False

I played for just under 2 hours. Not because I planned to, but because it just felt bland and weird. I don't know how to quite describe it, but all of the action in the other battlefield games felt really cool, and small things from the movement, shooting, and just lack of interesting maps and environments made it feel like such a bummer to play.

Idk who's idea it was at Dice and EA to have a bot mode, and allow us to gain XP playing the mode, but seriously, hats off to you. Even at a slower rate, it's so nice to level up and unlock stuff while playing a casual game. I don't play bots in any other shooter, but with the large scale battles here, it feels pretty good (even if the AI is dumb as hell). 

With that being said, my main complaint with this game is the specialists. Idk why they went that route, it's boring and restrictive, I don't know anybody who likes that. Let us create our own character, even if it's very basic, and have us play that character across each class. Sell us skins only seperated by male & female, I think that would make the game much more immersive and just make more sense. It kills the fun knowing theres 30 Boris' and 20 of each other specialist running around, very bad idea. 

I think the ship has sailed on full-price purchases, just let the game go F2P. Take out the specialist stuff, let us make our own operator, open the flood gates via F2P and go on a heavy promotion campaign. The core gameplay here is good, but it's plagued by a terrible launch and lingering bad decisions they just don't want to let go of for some unknown reason.

[strike]Edit- Keeps getting better with age like wine.[/strike]


Edit- 1/31/2023

The class update (Patch 3.2.0) REALLY ruined the good charm the game had, it SEVERELY hinders player choice, recon class is a very selfish class in this update, they can't do any-kind of useful team assisting activities, no giving ammo, no giving med boxes etc, you must conform to the new class rules and you must use selfish equipment that only helps yourself as a recon.

Whoever thought of restricting the ammo create and medical crate to just the support class and making the players pick ONLY one or the other has got to be in assisted living conditions to come up with that kind of ""team assisting"" mechanic there, the funny thing is the player that picks the support class could outright run a smoke launcher and ignore the calls for medics and ammo, meanwhile being the sole providers of it to the entire team.

This is supposed to be somehow help team play and be better than what we had before, which was the ability for you to pick the operate you liked and tailor your kit to better suit your play style which would help the team. This class update destroyed that.

Prior to this update, and dating back to launch, my review was ""Recommended"".
After this update I cannot suggest the game to anyone, it will remain ""Not Recommended"" until these changes are rolled back.



Edit- 2/11/2023

Still consistently bad patch notes not even worth a discount purchase, new class update is completely unbalanced trash, the best balancing was when there was no restrictions, also getting kicked for cheating in a bots mode or the game crashes on start from predictable EA garbage problems



Edit- 3/5/2023

Still consistently bad updates since January.



Edit- 5/3/2023

Still bad after the January update.

They've added random deviation bullet flight for guns and the anti-cheat is kicking for zero reason still 4 months later. 



Edit- 6/25/2023

Still very hard to enjoy the game after the January class update.




Edit- 7/10/2023

Still trash after the January class update, don't be tempted by its low discounted price, it's abysmal.



Edit- 9/1/2023

Still trash after the January class update. Lopsided balance for Support players still exists and nothing to remedy it has been done. If you insist on buying this dumpster fire don't waste your time on any other class than support, its the only viable thing after January.

Edit- 1/5/2024

Nearly a year ago they released the class update which made balancing absolutely trash, prior you were able to use the character of your choice and craft their loadout into many different styles to help the team, I ran a recon character which I would use very aggressively due to their AOE scanner, I ran ammo box and LMG and restocked the team assisting in pushing and flanking, today it's impossible to play that aggressive without having a dedicated support player shadowing you restocking you or you will burn through the two magazines you're given unless you run out into the open and grab some ammo off a body due to not being able to run an ammo box on any character anymore, somehow this helps the team play though they claim, 2042's lack of class restrictions that it released with was truly the best change they made to the series, shame its lost.

At this point in time I only play the game for the custom mode maker with buddies.

Contrary to popular beliefs, Battlefield 2042 is a thoughtful and decently-well engineered first-person tactical shootah, in which you take the role of one of the various awperators at your disposal, and take part in large-scale modern warfare in a semi-futuristic-realistic setting of our nefarious modern society. While this is an EA title (yet again), you will be confronted to various micro-transactions options that will try to lure you into acquiring copious amounts of shiny pieces of equipment that provide no particular competitive advantage to its holder.

Not many maps, if i'm not mistaken this is the bf with the lowest amount of maps EVER and they are releasing the newer ones at a slow pace.... why? Simple they are trying, TRYING (on the succeeding part...) to make the original works. And they don't... or  better they kind of do on Conquest but on Breakthrough every single map has some horrible point. Last point of Kaleidoscope, last point on Discarded and Exposure too. Who thought about stuffing 64 players in 10 meters was a good or even SANE idea? Manifest is Makay hunting ground (on reddit i read a comment that said it felt like Arnold fighting the Predator. TRUE) and to be fair various specialist just break the game. The best map are unironically the ones that comes from the older bf games like BC2 or BF3. Bf 2042 has quite possibly THE WORST map design i have ever seen in a FPS EVER, all the other Bf titles had some very solid maps and some bad ones but this bf has only examples of the latter. AH yeah and conquest the 64 player mode is the only viable the 128 is a mess in just about everything, with the worst hitreg i have ever experienced.
Weapon balance is inexistent with the VHX ( battlepass weapon go figure huh?) being so broken that it single handedly makes every smg bad. Its basically and AR made for close quarters with a HS modifier that is straight up BETTER than all the smgs... Why? 
Hitreg is quite bad too but not always, play 5 min in a match and see for yourself if its worth finishing it or just quit and find a match where hitreg actually works.

Graphics and audio are quite good as always has been in the saga but when you fail so hard at what is actually important for an FPS (map design, weapon balance and actually having a decent feedback when you kill someone) can this game be considered good? I don't think so but at least it's not infected with cheaters like its 2 predecessors so if you really miss BF try this one i guess.",1706698036,1707164378,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tanks with red Christmas skins, Soldiers with yellow or pink weapon skins and gear. All you want here. And with it the game loses its last bit of seriousness. It’s just one big joke of a game when it comes to the scenario and the stage it plays on. Just seeing your colorful squad at the start and end of the round, reminds me constantly that I am fighting with a bunch of clowns, nothing else. 

Also considering that most available and offered skins are quite unrealistic when it comes to a military camouflage, you don't have much of a choice. If you want a skin, you need to take the colorful Dice and EA throws at you. Or should I say put in your face? Because the next big pain point I had with the game is the season pass upsell; you really need to dismiss the shit upsell page each game launch before you can even play or access the game. That is a new level for a full price Battlefield. 

Now you might wonder, why did he still play over 100 hours? Infact the run and gun play is still good. Graphics are OKish for a modern AAA game, though some elements feel like a downgrade to its predecessor. Then again the sound mix up is a blast! It’s just some much fun to play while rockets and grenades hitting around you and give you a never seen before bass on your ears. Generally I do believe the sound mix up is one of the big strengths of the game. Also if you are not into BF3 or BF4 anymore but still want a kind of modern warfare battlefield scenario, that is not tactical at all and has most of it (ground & air vehicles), then there is not much else than Battlefield 2042 out there. 

I played the Open Beta and discarded the game. But Dice has done a jump to fix the game and bring it from a quite bad game to a OKish one if you play alone and a solid one if you play with friends or good team mates.

The rough start in 2021 almost killed the game but DICE fixed step by step the problems and now in 2024 it is definitely worth having another look at it. 

The gameplay is fun and chaotic, it runs significantly better than at launch, the gunplay is great and the in-game attachment system is also a cool addition.

I do not compare it with previous Battlefield titles therefore is the specialist or operator system after some confusing moments really great to play. Being able to be a healer who also can provide recon support is super fun.

However, it´s easy to get in and most important it´s enjoyable and fun to play.
Only get it on sale which steam has it quite often. Thanks for reading.

Why?

Pros:
- Good variety of maps on some game modes
- lots of cosmetic content
- good amount of guns and gadgets
- the core battlefield experience is there
- vehicles are OK
- UI in game (when playing) is ok, the ability to swap gun parts is a nice touch.

That seems like a solid pros list doesn't it. However there is a but to all of them and many of cons themselves.

Cons:
- most NEW maps are either uninspired or badly designed. Throwing a tornado into a map does not make it better. Having spawns that do not take into consideration enemy captured points do make it miserable.
- lots of PAID cosmetic content - your usual battlepasses and what not. Some of it's ok some of it's not, mixed bag as usual.
- most guns play the same unfortunately. All boils down to DPS and what you managed to unlock the most. Most gadgets and abilities are actually useful but why not give players a freedom to mix and choose? Only the class designer can tell, especially when anyone can carry any gun.
- back to gadgets/items - if you have multiple AT launchers why not have a more detailed breakdown of their usefulness? Why do I learn useful tips about them from a loading screen. Is RPG stronger than the basic launcher? Do I have time to test it? Should I go on a wiki to find it out? Irritating to myself and this scenario applies to few more gadgets. In general the information about them is not presented in a clear way.
- core battlefield experience is there but it's only fun for maybe 25-30 hours. Then you might realise it's something you played before but this time it's not as much fun or polished and all the little details get in the way such as horrible UI or bizzare rubber banding in bigger servers.
-UI - could not make it harder to navigate menu and find information. Want to swap a gun mid match but not sure which option is better? Well get ready to click way too many times and be prepared to memorise the stats so you can compare them.
- flying vehicles are painful on mouse and keyboard, gamepad is a must.
- AA Vs helis/jets can be either a fantastic experience or a complete mess, especially if you are on foot with a very underpowered AA launcher.
- Sniping is underwhelming so are the LMGs. Other methods of fighting as mentioned before are ok but extremely repetitive.
- no tutorial or a training map and if it's there then golly i could not find it.
- bizzare character writing - I understand a lot was changed to the game in that regard but reading the character cards or the loading screen trivia is just painful. Cramming all that exposition into each charactet to make them cool is just bizzare and badly done. Classic example of let's have an X amount of characters that have to tick this list of 'cool' features. 

That's it. It could be great but it will never be. Let's wait for another one.",1706666585,1707015372,False,187,7,0.789413928985595703,0,True,False,False

The hit regulation is broken, the UI is missing a lot of elements, and the maps lack any creativity. It's a bland attempt at a battlefield game. The price on the game isnt worth it, it's lacking a ton of content. I'd wait for everything to be fixed and refined before purchasing.

02/02/2024:
Game still doesn't have a dedicated server browser, you'll only have access to a server browser for custom experiences. Soldier spawns are still nonsensical, it will constantly spawn you into the middle of a firefight and you'll die instantaneously. Rockets still don't register on air vehicles, and will usually fizzle out on impact. Weapon balance doesnt make sense, there's always one weapon per season that out does all the others. Hit registration bug is still rampant, your shots will not register on enemies due to terrible netcode. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game like the plague, there are no good times to be had here, most lobbies are full of bots, its a dying game. 

05/19/2023:
Game net code still doesnt function properly and is inconsistent to all hell, hit regulation is purposely being manipulated to benefit console players, more than half the time your bullets dont register on console players, while their hits register much faster on you if youre on pc. The multiplayer has no skill based matchmaking, and matches will always be once sided, RARELY will you be in a balanced match, their anti cheat is a joke. The map design makes no sense and will leave you frustrated. Dont buy this game, not even on sale, RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS. I play this sh*t show so you dont have to! Ill update again once the next season is up.

03/10/2023:
Game is in better shape than it was at launch, however, the game still doesn't function very well. Weapons are unbalanced, hit registration is awful, and the map design is barren and pretty terrible. Spawns don't work, so don't be surprised if you spawn in front of enemies, vehicles stats are disproportionate to rocket damage, so vehicle camping is a huge issue. I wouldnt buy it, whatsoever, there are better military shooters out there with better dev teams and mechanics. I recommend you wait for it to be free through PS Plus/Xbox Live, because judging from what the devs have stated, there isnt a high probability that they'll adding more content after season 4.",1638202852,1706909361,False,12,0,0.560486197471618652,0,True,False,False

Thanks for the surprise mechanics, we love those.

Balance of the game is atrocious helicopters are way too overpowered and are getting buffed while their counters are getting nerfed. The air supremacy not being helped by the maps (almost all of them) complete lack of cover). It is a common sight to see someone in an helicopter going 100-0 in score, ""it's hard to play"" isn't an excuse if once mastered there is no countering it.
There's a huge disparity in weapons balance with assault rifles beating everything else in 99% of scenarios. There is only one secondary weapon (G57) and everything else is a downgrade. 
Maps are flat with no cover, 3 of them have a boat theme yet we don't have a single water map. 
There is no singleplayer campaign or even singleplayer content at all meaning this game will inevitably be wasted space in your library when multiplayer dies and servers shut down.

Now the positives : 128 player mode makes the game more team-based and fixed base spawnkilling from previous games, the gunplay is fine, if there is no helicopter main (in either team really) it's a pretty good battlefield experience.

""""""
As a long-time fan of the Battlefield franchise, delving into Battlefield 2042 felt like stepping onto a minefield rather than a battlefield. Dismal, disappointing, and downright disastrous, Battlefield 2042 fails on almost every front, tarnishing the once-glorious reputation of the series.

First and foremost, let's address the elephant in the room: the bugs and glitches. From game-breaking crashes to laughable physics, Battlefield 2042 is riddled with technical shortcomings that make it nearly unplayable. The sheer number of issues is astounding, leaving players frustrated and bewildered as they navigate through a virtual world fraught with inconsistencies.

Moving on to gameplay, Battlefield 2042 feels like a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from various uninspired ideas. The absence of a single-player campaign is a glaring omission, stripping away the immersive narratives that once made Battlefield titles stand out. Instead, players are thrust into a chaotic multiplayer experience that feels more like a beta test gone wrong than a polished product.

The maps, touted as sprawling landscapes ripe for epic battles, fall short of expectations. Rather than feeling expansive and immersive, they come across as empty and lifeless, lacking the intricate details and strategic depth that defined earlier iterations of the series. Coupled with lackluster level design and uninspired objectives, the maps in Battlefield 2042 feel like forgettable placeholders rather than memorable battlegrounds.

Furthermore, the introduction of specialists, a departure from the traditional class system, only serves to dilute the core gameplay experience. Instead of fostering teamwork and cooperation, it fosters a sense of isolation and detachment, as players struggle to find their niche in a sea of generic characters with little to no personality or depth.

And let's not forget about the monetization model, which borders on predatory. From overpriced cosmetics to pay-to-win mechanics disguised as ""convenience features,"" Battlefield 2042 shamelessly prioritizes profit over player satisfaction, turning what should be a thrilling gaming experience into a shameless cash grab.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 is a train wreck of epic proportions, a soulless husk of a game that squanders the legacy of its predecessors in a misguided attempt to reinvent the wheel. With its myriad technical issues, lackluster gameplay, and shameless monetization schemes, it's a slap in the face to fans who expected better from one of gaming's most beloved franchises. Save your time and money and steer clear of this disasterpiece.

let me start by saying you should only get this game if its on a sale, like $25 usd MAX. at that price i think its alright, game play is just ok, graphics are also just ok (i play at 1440p ultrawide high settings). 
BUT nothing really makes me want to play nonstop like bf4 or bf3 did. (Bad company was a bit before my time). 
Personal thought as well, if you are gonna have a battle pass, make the base game free to play like most other series are.

Battlefield 2042's launch was a rough one, riddled with bugs, balance issues, and missing features. But let me tell you, this game has come a long way, and it's now a blast to play.

DICE Hasn't Abandoned Ship

They've been steadily rolling out updates, fixing bugs, tweaking balance, and adding new content. Season 6 brought back the classic class system, a welcome change for many fans. And Season 7, just around the corner, promises even more: exciting new maps, fresh weapons, and innovative gadgets.

Is it perfect? No game is. But Battlefield 2042 offers a unique brand of large-scale, chaotic fun that you won't find anywhere else. Imagine 128 players clashing on vast, dynamic maps, with tornados ripping through the battlefield and sandstorms obscuring your vision. It's exhilarating, strategic, and often hilarious.

Here's why Battlefield 2042 is worth considering, especially on sale:

Redemption Arc: The game has demonstrably improved since launch, with ongoing support and content drops.
Classic Battlefield Feel: The return of the class system in Season 6 is a big win for fans.
Massive Scale: 128-player battles create unforgettable moments of chaos and teamwork.
Constant Evolution: Season 7 promises exciting new content, keeping things fresh.
Unmatched Fun Factor: If you crave large-scale, sandbox-style FPS action, Battlefield 2042 delivers.

To Buy Or Not To Buy

If you can snag it on sale, absolutely. Just be aware that it's not a perfectly polished experience. But if you're looking for a unique and evolving FPS with tons of potential, Battlefield 2042 is worth a shot. Just strap in, hold on tight, and prepare for an unforgettable ride.
Remember, Season 7 is just around the corner, bringing even more content to the table. So, buckle up and get ready for some epic Battlefield moments!",1659570432,1706764752,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

After much research and trial and error, I've discovered that the i9 13900 series of processors doesn't play well unity 5 and certain other games when coupled with a 40 series gpu. After disabling XMP and reducing clock speed of my ram to 4800 MHz from 6300 MHz, I also underclocked my CPU using the Intel XTU, from x55 down to x50, which seems to have resolved all issues with the game. It wouldn't be fair of me to negatively rate this game based on an issue outside of their control, I assume.

Editing review: Despite the good that this has to offer, I'm forced to change to a negative review. Recently, I've been absolutely plagued with tech issues. Seems that after each update for the past few months, I have to jump through hoops to play the game. Now, I'm getting a constant ""out of memory"" error when I launch or as soon as I enter a game. Needless to say, the issue is not my computer. The only other game that I've run into similar issues with is The Finals, in which I had to force the game to launch in dx11, downclock my CPU with Intel ETU, among other things. I'm not willing to go through this much trouble to play a game anymore.

TLDR; I truly believe that BF2042 is a very enjoyable game, even comparable to BF3 and BF4. I have hardly run into any bugs, weapons feel great to handle, and graphics are very attractive. The only major issue that I've run into recently is with the lack of players online at any given time. Several TDM sessions only had ~10 players, 3 on one side, and 7 on the other. Other sessions would randomly have a lobby filled with AI. I personally believe this to be an issue with the player base, in which most assume that this game is ""bad"" due to state of release. IMO, it feels very similar to any other BF title.

After 200+ hours of play time, and even more time spent on BF3 and BF4 (consoles/EA launcher) - this is as honest of a review as I can give.

Initially, this game was a hot mess. I logged in during the open beta to see what I could expect and was promptly greeted with repulsive bugs, game-breaking latency issues, and features that didn't make sense at the time.

After the beta, I decided to give Dice some time to iron out some of these problems, and I'm glad I did. Aside from constant issues logging in, (Every time I launched, the game would simply get stuck on the initial loading screen without any text or UI to indicate that it is loading, so I would need to re-launch the game to get in. Every time. This has been fixed as of season 5 however) the game was much more polished in many ways. I experienced fewer bugs, much more stable play sessions with fewer crashes and latency spikes, and the features began to make more sense as they improved them, or maybe, as I began to understand them. My major complaint at this point was the lack of options for weapons. 

After a relatively short hiatus, I came back to season 5 and 6. Season 6 introduced a new issues in which my game kept crashing due to what I assume is a driver issue or some kind of corruption of local files. After updating my drivers and verifying game integrity, the game continued working. 

At this time, the game has many options for weapons, though they have loosely re-implemented the class system by giving specific bonuses to weapon types depending on your class (Assault class gaining more ammunition when using assault rifles, medic class gaining fast weapon switching (iirc) when using sub-machine guns, etc), a change that I welcome, but it doesn't feel as free as it did before. Point being, the game certainly feels improved and gives me the same satisfaction that I once felt when playing BF4.

All in all- I haven't been able to understand the claims made by a majority of the player-base. Some claim that bolt action snipers are overpowered and are a 2-hit kill, but this was also true in other BF games (Especially in hardcore servers, in which any sniper rifle was a 1-hit kill). Others claim that the game ""looks bad"", but then are happy with graphics of games like Battlebit. Most of the negative reviews don't contain any helpful information as to why it was negative to begin with, and those that do seem only to mention technical issues- but that, I can certainly understand. I suspect I simply haven't had as many tech issues as most others. I believe my experience with BF2042 to be largely positive - I've had many hours of enjoyment and hope to have many more.",1701032085,1706738453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Hit reg is bad

- Maps are awful. There is huge wastelands with nothing in there between objectives and visually the maps are worse than in BF5

- Playing as infantry is miserably. You are spotted 24/7, 64 enemy players so its a matter of seconds when you are shot from the back, maps offer very little cover and the distances are way too big

- No decent scoreboard

- No server browser

- Lobbies are disbanded after every map. Meaning you need to requeue again.

- Can't play with more than 3 friends

- No voice chat

- Sounds are terrible (Directional, vehicle and gun sounds)

- Specialists killed gadget variety as now everyone can run any gun / gadger

- Gringy endgame lines

- Forced deploy at the start of the round. Meaning in most situations you either have to run for ages to get to battle or redeploy and spawn on capture objective

- Not able to crouch sprint

- Gunplay feel off

- Movement isn't good

- Way too many vehicles

- Opposite team looks exactly like your team

- Very few weapons and the attachments for them are more or less the same

- All the bugs

- 128 players was a mistake

- No teamplay. On average I've been ressed 0,3 times per match

Zone Spawning means you're gonna get cornered and farmed. No Switch Teams button, which hurts the player base when you have a Attack/defend game mode and the attacking team is paired with vehicles while defenders do not. Every patch that comes out, a new gun breaks the game and takes on average 3 months for devs to fix. Poor maps and game play. Some maps are either too big for the game mode or too small. Majority of maps offer only 3 avenues to approach to the halfway point (funnels team into getting farmed) or restricts game play and ability to change the map to fit tactics. instead you're forced to push through and play without any real tactics. Just shoot rockets and smokes and you'll win every game.  Levelution is extinct and the only few map changes that can happen is the weather. No nighttime maps or level changing events like the trailer shows. Specialists ruined the core game play that Battlefield survived on for so long. Every specialist gizmo pulls you out of the game loop and ruins moment. Certain specialist are broken or even way too OP and can practically ruin a fight. Last;y, the community has gone to crap. no more do you find people wanting to squad up, help each other or even giving some slack to new players. More often you're gonna find seal clubbers, max ranked, using said broken guns, specialists, and map advantage/disadvantage to go 150 -3 and then say your crap when he had to sit still and hold the trigger. I do not recommend this game nor the developers anymore, I'm genuinely worried for the next battlefield game. If its even gonna be battlefield anymore.

128 players in a match is good inovation. Feels really like I'm in a battlefield. Though the game still has problems.
I would recommend buying it for a discount.

+ Portal mode
+ Gun customization in a middle of match
+ Achievements can be earned versus bots
+ Tornado, or just weather effects in general, very cool

- No singleplayer
- Hitboxes are bad, and I mean really bad - For a solely MP game, this is a big problem

Overwatch, Fortnite, and Call of Duty had a baby and this is the result.  The game can be fun to play, but it is not Battlefield--or at least I hope this isn't the direction the franchise is going.  Any of the old Battlefield games are superior in nearly every way.

Indisputable steps backward from even Battlefield 3, let alone 4+
-No scoreboard
-No player stats
-No game-wide chat
-Clunky UI and menu system
-No true 3D spatial/positional audio
-Destruction is inconsistent
-No filters for joining matches, with the exception of 'portal' mode
-No permanent Rush or other game modes

Other negatives
-Specialists are the antithesis of Battlefield franchise.  They feel like something out of Overwatch or Fortnite.  Not even CoD has something this cheesy.
-You can switch most of your loadout on the fly
-The maps are big just to be big.  There is a ridiculous amount of deadspace in between the objective sites on most maps.
-Graphics are mediocre at best, but will tax your computer as if they are state of the art.
-The dynamic environments aren't.

*Countless game-breaking bugs, though to EA/Dice's credit they are slowly getting patched:
-Stuck firing
-Stuck looking up
-Audio looping
-Launching out of vehicles across the map
-Vehicles falling through map
-Countless animations messed up",1639952031,1706227209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game still has bugs and performance issues  not to mention big balance issues. Having enjoyed BF4 im sad the playerbase for it is not as big prior to bf 2042 release as this game sucks and is not worth the asking price at all. with season 1 around the corner  i want to look forward to it but i fear it'll be ruined. try it on ea play for free but id highly advise not to invest your money in it when there are many great games to spend your money on. Look at WW3 instead as while its a bit too grindy i find the combat to be pretty satisfying and theres a good amount of base game content too. its also cheaper

Edit: the game is getting better but the game is not as good performance wise as previous titles and there still issues with balance like the new marksman rifle is way too strong and versatile and the super hind is just too super. The game is getting there though.
-season 2 is out and its ok, added another stupid attack vehicle no one asked for. with mw2 fast approaching and the beta currently in motion bf 2042 could end up dragging its heels as mw2 has 64 player ground war which is basically conquest on a smaller map. 

Edit 2.5 : In its current state BF 2042 is a much better game than release and i'm actually enjoying it. Performance is now noticeably better and there are now more guns to play with in the 2042 modes. I just wish hardcore was added as a standard mode and not part of the limited playlist. Despite the improvements however it still sucks, albeit not as much. MY biggest issues are maps are pretty bad, spawns are terrible, weapon balance questionable and tdm has been slapped together using terrible locations often leading to spawn trapping and featuring high vantage points giving great views across the whole map while being easy to camp

All around an awful experience.  100 dollars wasted. 

Edit:  31 hours in now, I keep trying to give it a second chance.  It no longer crashes, it it pretty stable, and runs decently on my computer.

I would not recommend this game even if it was free - it is not worth the hard drive space.  I will also never again buy another Battlefield title.

This game is NOT worth 60 euros, it's worth at most 20 (I bought it on sale for 10 euros).
Battlefield 2042 isn't a perfect game and it's not terrible as it was at the time of release, I've played almost 100 hours and this is what I can say.
It's a game that's fun to play, I love that it's a sandbox. You can literally think of anything and do it, if you want to kill someone by jumping out of an airplane and shooting an RPG at another airplane and then climbing back into your plane, go for it! If you want to make a kill with a sniper rifle with a range of a kilometer, go for it! You can even make a fpv drone, just put a c5 on the drone and fly it to the enemy or to the vehicle, and then press the explosion button and that's it, I really like it because you have freedom of action and can play as you want and enjoy the sandbox. 
And also a very cool feature is that you can change weapon attachments during the match, it's incredibly convenient, your weapon becomes more situational, that is, you can have an assault rifle, partly a machine gun and partly a DMR in your hands at the same time, it's cool, it adds more options.

But there are also disadvantages.
- I did not encounter a large number of bugs, but they were there, the most frequent was the black screen bug, every time you need to restart the game.
- The explosion system is not realistic at all. 
Literally a few meters from the enemy, an RPG charge, a G-84 TGM or mortar charge arrives - 0 damage or just a little bit, it's absolutely not realistic.
- The game is monotonous, you fight either for the US or ruzzia in the future war, that's all. I expected a lot more from the game, more weapons, equipment, too few weapons for a game about a future war.
- Vehicles in the game are not balanced and bad to drive (driven like a toy, not a realistic multi-ton vehicle). Players use tanks far away from the battles, because if they get too close, literally everyone will blow up your tank in half a second.
- It's very funny that the game doesn't have all chat, it's just stpid.
- there is no server browsing in the game, it's shocking how stpid it is, when you enter a match, you can be 1/64 or 1/128 and you have to leave, but when you look for a match again you are thrown into the same one and you either have to wait or pause and look for a match again, + due to the lack of online in the game and because there are literally no server browsing in every game you are playing with +-15 AI
- THEY DIDN'T ADD PLAYER DEATHS TO THE SCOREBOARD, IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.
- It's just insolence to add battlepass to this game.
- There are less cheaters in battlefield 1 than in battlefield 2042 
- I've never liked EA because it's a greedy company, its goal is just to get as much money from you as possible, not to give you a cool and interesting game, without microtransactions and other sht.
+- Most of the maps are interesting and fun to play, but there are also some completely boring ones (manifest, hourglass)  
- This game is more like call of duty than battlefield.
- This game has two game modes. That's it. They just took away some of the really cool game modes from the previous parts and just added modes that no one plays, lmao.

So, if you really want to play a good game, then buy Battlefield 1, I can give this game a maximum of 7/10, this game is not for everyone, it's fun, but it's made by people who don't care about the players opinion",1706140852,1706140918,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I pre-ordered gold edition like a donut on xbox before i had my pc, game was terrible.  Since then, it has come a long way and although not the game that was promised, its improved a lot and once again has the battlefield feeling.

pros: The map reworks are great and have the maps feeling like a true battlefield instead of the clean and polished maps they had on release. The destructible assets they have decided to finally use are nice, but the whole maps should be like that.
Portal (BF Era) weapons are balanced nice and the skins/charms is a nice touch. 
specialists are now into classes with gadgets restricted to classes.  
Game is less buggy and more smooth to play.
full servers!!!

cons: Portal (the love letter to fans) has been abandoned, no new maps etc. 
Minimal map destruction.
Specialists are still there.
The game still feels like a large scale TDM in Apex at times.
Vehicles are still annoying AF (skill issue)

I, like many others, got absolutely robbed by Dice's nostalgia bating marketing campaign and so immediately pre-ordered 2042 without hesitating. Over the years some improvements have been made but the game still feels soulless. The maps, whilst receiving some reworks, are still far too vast. The weather events are still useless gimmicks. The weapon is roster far too basic: Especially when compared to the countless weapons available to you in past Battlefield titles. Classes don't feel diverse anymore, you can have your cake and eat it. Many unlock-able weapons are transferable across classes in which they don't belong. Battlefield Portal was supposed to be a saving grace of Battlefield 2042 but it was less than half baked. Tools for portal server owners remain scarce. Overall a bit of a disappointment.

Up to you if that's worth your time, otherwise you can just progress the free track.

What sucks? UI is pretty busy with all the gadgets and abilities in game. There's not a real strong differentiation between ""heroes"" as opposed to class specializations. Unlocking weapon attachments takes a long time, but that's not too different than Battlefields of old.

I wouldn't say it deserves the hate that it still gets today, since the devs have been going around fixing stuff, like, I could barely play the game when I bought it without being greeted by our beloved black screen after almost every match, and without lagging a lot.

It's a bit disappointing that there's no campaign mode. For me, getting all the campaign achievements in battlefield titles is still a lot of fun, so I wish it had one.

It's also disappointing how you can only get a few weapons if you buy premium, but previous battlefield titles did the same thing. Another thing is how you can easily climb up to the top 5 on the scoreboard by just healing and reviving your team, because very few people do it, and if you die, even if there's several supports near you, you probably won't get revived and bleed out. Not even squad members will revive you most of the time.

And also, I used to get the classic black screen all the time but I think it has finally been fixed after 2 years, because I haven't seen it in a while.

But even with all that, I still think it's a good game and going around healing and reviving people while world crumbles around you is a lot of fun.

I think Battlefield, in a lot of ways, fails to really keep up with modern multiplayer video games. Everything is F2P, everything constantly tries to lock you in with aggressive FOMO tactics (which this game vaguely tries with a Battle Pass but it's not very good), and everything goes for crossover appeal and crazy, insane guest appearances. Battlefield as a series has never really done that, and it feels the same as it ever was after it's patches. HOWEVER, I'm a fan of Battlefield's standard, and now that it's a functional video game, I think this is really solid. The sweet spot for a purchase is probably around the ~$25 range I'd think. It's fun, crossplay keeps the game populated, and it's BF3-BF5 Battlefield gameplay as you remember it.

Music- Remember in Bf4 when you won or lost  a match how that cool soundtrack would play? The music in this game is not that. It's fucking bad. 

Maps- The maps have potential, the graphics are pretty good and the buildings are ok. But they are completely bare. It's like they gave up halfway when making some of them. Why didn't they at least copy paste some more buildings. There's this one map in particular that stands out and represents everything wrong with the game. It's a conquest map that's divided into 2 zones, one with solar panels or some shit and the other with grass and like 3 buildings. That's it........ The map is so small compared to maps in bf4 and yet they still manage to have so much open space. Maps in this game are              S O U L L E S S 

Gameplay- Jets feel really gay and don't feel as powerful and as fast as bf4 but that's just me. Gunplay is nice in 2042 compared to bf4 where you're shaking around and having a seizure when run and gunning. Movement is pretty good.

Destruction- I don't care for levolutions but they're ass in this game especially when these devs are literally using frostbite. (then again everyone who knew how to use frostbite left the studio) Regular destruction for buildings is just meh. If you play The Finals you can see where all that talent went.

Would I recommend paying full prices? My question for you is, how do you value your time? If you see yourself getting 20+ hours our of this, yes. Absolutely. Full price isn't even $70.

Main issues with the game.
1. Map design is bad, and most of each map is cut off killing you if you go outside the zones, its stupid and makes flanking almost impossible against decent players.
2. SBMM is horrible, there are players making new accounts which clearly have a lot of hours into the game.
3. Every class can shoot from afar with almost any gun and have access to very long scopes.
4. Marking players and their position is a completely broken mechanic, especially when someone dies can still mark the player that kill him, I cannot think of a single reason as to why this mechanic is even in the battlefield games except to force a k/d=1 if you are decent.
5. Vehicles are overpower and are used more as snipers than anything else, rockets are under power. The mechanic class is a joke.
6. The scope glint another stupid mechanic.
7. Soldier class passive ability can stack with vehicles, for example the character that when you shoot him  reveals your location, stacks when driving a tank. So if you shoot the tank your location is revel. Moreover, players in tanks have complete song awareness when soldiers approximate the tanks making c5 explosives virtually useless. 
8. Who thinks a vehicle with fast mobility, thick armor and which can be used to attack players by the driver himself was a good idea.
9. At this point I am certain that the people that make the decision for the games, do not play the games enough to have a good understanding of why certain mechanics should not be in the game. 
10. Aim assist in this game feels really strong, the aim slow down so much even when the aim is not even close to the target and sure you can tune it down but then are at a disadvantage.
11. In terms of learning curve, the game has a low floor and also low ceiling. A 5 minutes search in youtube tell you exactly what are the broken weapons, characters and vehicles and that is all you need.
12. If battlefield 1 was a secure game to play, It will be ideal. Now that was a good game.

My biggest grips is silly but the fact that is you have a fast SSD alt+F4 and relaunching the game is the fastest way to get into another match is ridiculous. The end game player achievement animations are silly that you can't skip them.

You cant do much about the teams you get but be expected to a either roll the other team or get rolled. While the game isn't as bad as BF V expect a lot of players with ""synthetic"" skill.

*edit Nov 1, 2023 - this new update has brought back the input lag spikes. Seems to have been fixed.

*edit Nov 6, 2023 - The game has seen a big uptick in cheaters. Not sure what is going on but EA cant detect them so they are having free reign. Most players try and hide it but lately there has been a large uptick in people who don't care and kill entire teams is seconds. EA used to send emails to people when you reported a cheater and they banned them but they either are not banning or they quit letting you know your input mattered. FML

I'm shocked, battlefield experience is back.

Before:  I spent every penny i had to buy the maxed out preorder  pack and was supper disappointed. The game WAS a mess, unplayable laggy, and not worth a second of anyone's time. (I'm quite sure everyone knew how bad of a launch it was.)

Now: The game still has some bugs and is not perfect, yet I am able to get smooth game play and the old battlefield feels backs. Lots of things seemed to be fixed over some updates and even freebies thrown to the players to keep them hopeful.

Recommended on a sale?  Hell yeah now!, Full price?  Maybe, I will say after one match of the fixes and updates I felt the good old battlefield 3 vibes from it.

Even the worst Battlefield games have some redeeming qualities and things I want to return in the next game. Battlefield 2042 does not have anything I want to return in future titles. Mostly because everything in this game is just worse than previous games, but also the few new things like the Plus and Call In systems sound cool on paper but end up being really broken in practice.

edit: 19/01/24

I reinstalled BF2042 since a couple of my mates were going to giving it a second go after the shocking launch. This time around the game wont even open. After lots of looking online I have:

1. Checked for missing or damaged files
2. Reinstalled the anticheat
3. Gave all the programs elevated privileges
4. Ran the exe as admin directly
5. Disabled all antivirus and firewalls
6. Restarted my PC

Short of reinstalling the whole game I'm not sure what else I'm meant to do since all the YouTube videos either tell me to do the above or to update my drivers which are all up to date anyway.

I felt robbed when I first bought into this trainwreck. The bugs, the lack of content, the poor balance etc etc. Now I feel robbed again when the game I paid a considerable amount of money for won't even launch, won't give me an error to troubleshoot and doesn't seem to have any obvious cause or solution. 

I would regard battlefield 3 and 4 as two of my favourite games of all time but it's clear to see that the era of great battlefield games is long behind us. Made especially apparent by the fact a 3 man dev team can deliver a more fun and authentic feeling ""battlefield"" experience than a company worth 10's of Billions. 

edit 2: 

I have now 

1. Uninstalled the EA app and reinstalled it
2. Reinstalled the entire game 
3. Done all the previous steps again

I am a massive BF fan who has been playing since Bad Company 2, and I was a total veteran on BF3. Seeing this game release with so many issues did bother me, of course, and like everyone else I was tempted to stay away from it due to all the negative reviews it had received. I finally said... Screw it, and I bought myself a copy of the game on sale, and I waited a while to play it, and I was surprised how much fun I had and how much I actually loved it. It has become a common problem these days for developers to release games that need more time to be worked out, Just like this one. I waited a few years for this game to receive the patches and work it needed before playing it, and I will say that I am far from disappointed. A common problem in the entire gaming community is that everyone Overly judges games today, and very harshly, especially ones that grow to fix their issues and become great games. I will say this, There is no such thing as a truly bad game, and it only truly depends on whether or not you like it and enjoy it, IT all matters on YOU, your opinions, your feelings, and how well you take it and or enjoy it. Do not EVER let the weight of reviews and media affect your views on games, movies, or anything else for that matter. Try these things for yourself and see if YOU like it, because in the end, that is all that matters. Developers can be lazy, yes. Developers can be careless, yes. Developers can be Money hungry, Of course. All that I am saying overall, is To not judge a book by it's cover. And I would say to Try 2042 out, you'd be surprised how much you may or may not like it. I came to realize such a ""bad"" game had many many players on it, which I found Ironic.

I've been playing this series since Bad Company 2. We already know DICE fixes bugs after release and we all know all series launched buggy. However, there is a structural problem here, the architecture of the maps is wrong, the spawn points are problematic. Hovercrafts are insane and There are problems such as netcode hitreg, there is not even a simple scoreboard at the bottom. Guys don't mind this unfinished game until it's complete. if you're very keen, try it for 10 hours with gamepass or ea play.

TR: Yaklaşık 10 senemi bu seriye vermiş insanım hatta daha fazladır. Bad Company 2'den beri oynuyorum.

Hatalar glitchler elbette eksi ama maalesef alışığız DICE fixler. Ancak burada bir yapısal sorun var haritaların mimarisi yanlış spawn noktaları sorunlu netcode hitreg gibi problemler var yahu alt tarafı basit bir scoreboard bile yok. Arkadaşlar bu bitmemiş bir oyun bitene kadar da almayın aldırmayın çok istekliyseniz gamepass veya ea play ile 10 saat deneyin zaten optimizasyon sorunlarına da değinmiyorum.

Worst of all for me are the GPU crashes. I can play countless other games for endless hours without a single one, yet this one either runs stable for hours or crashes within the first game. I tried to look it up multiple times but at this moment just tired of it and will put this game to rest instead.

I was a big fan of BF3 which is why getting to play on Noshahr canals again was a blast. For sure, I see big potential with that when properly optimized with custom servers, but for now, it's a gameplay downgrade of the original in IMO.

The guns feel amazing to shoot and features like changing attachments while in the field is such a awesome addition. I love the Modern / Futuristic setting of the game too. Portal mode is also really awesome, Playing Caspian Border in 2042 brings back so much memories of playing Battlefield 3.

There are issues such as whenever i launch the game the EA Client / Application gives me shit and i have to launch the game 2-4 times for it in order to work.

You still have a horrible community so your games will always be lopsided and horrific unless you play with a group on comms. No one uses their brain and it feels like its gotten even worse each edition of the game. I think this is the last Battlefield for me to have bought. I didn't even really like everything in V but there were redeeming qualities in it. Now its just more and more arcade to the point its COD without zombies. So just buy COD basically. For Battlefield 1 I loved the game btw so I used to enjoy the series. The game needs an update right now and I think I'll uninstall instead.

It is literally Battlefield in name only and nothing like previous games. I mean its fun for what it is and is much better now than it was, but dont be fooled. This is still no Battlefield game, and the Specialists alone really takes away that Battlefield feeling. The maps are a bit better than what they were on release, if you can get this game on a massive discount I would say go for it, but just dont expect that Battlefield feeling like the previous games.

The next Battlefield game has to be the best Battlefield game to have ever been made, otherwise the Battlefield franchise is pretty much dead. They cannot afford another 2042 abomination. 2042 is an okay game as ""just some shooter with specialists"", but is a million miles away from what makes it Battlefield.

I still jump in now and then, but honestly I find it hard to keep playing it a lot like i have in previous games. I just cant recommend it as a BF game.",1637311912,1705362417,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And BF2042 has had to be the biggest flop they have released. They are a Triple-A game but released something worse than an Early Access game - even though they had an open beta.

Aside from the fact the game was COMPLETELY for months after release, it has turned into something a battlefield game should never be. Not only do they keep changing core-mechanics of the game, the ENTIRE meta has been changing along with it.

Are you looking for a Battlefield game where you can just hop back into multiplayer and play after taking a break? (this is how I've always played battlefield) If so, you may find it harder than anticipated. In my eyes, it has turned into a bastardized RPG.

Choose your specialist, pick your favorite ability! Oh, but now you will only gain certain bonuses from specific classes of weapons that you use. And your equipment/gadgets should directly support your specialists' ability - changing every time you switch specialists.

There is a lot I can say, but you'll need to intimately understand every mechanic in this game. Understanding the mechanics will take a decent amount of hours. Once you do, you'll need to figure out how to counter certain things - except you can't unless you have a good squad or two on the team. Team balancing has been a pretty big issue.

And just as you learn everything, there is a new update which overhauls most mechanics. Leaving you figuring it all out over again.

TLDR; BF2042 has turned into some unrecognizable RPG game with a much sharper learning curve compared to their previous titles. Since the horrendous release, game play mechanics have been continuously reworked which make it over-complicated. The only pro is that the game is finally playable.

Will be sticking to BF1 for now.",1705353096,1705353096,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fuck the Stealth Helis

Why does AA exist when it's so underpowered and your air vehicles are so fucking overpowered?!

Also, 2 years and 6 new maps
You literally had to reuse guns from other modes because this game launched with fuckall content
That you also stopped porting over because I guess fuck all
All of your new guns have been broken OP until the next season and then you nerf the fucking shit out of them to the point where they don't even exist
WOW
I'm so tired of that!
Yet you don't nerf 
THE 
STUPID
FUCKING
VEHICLES

Hell, if anything, you make them STRONGER!!!

It's just now you had the clarity to remove the 30mml auto cannon from the Recon truck.  Where the fuck have you been and thought this was a good idea?
The 50mml cannon USED TO BE AUTOMATIC.  What.  The.  Fuck.  Were.  You.  Thinking???

Yet the Gunship is still bullshit.  The Little Bird is still bullshit.  You had the audacity to make the Attack Heli even stronger.  The Stealth Heli is still bullshit, yay, I love not being able to lock onto this cunt because they pressed a fucking button.  The tanks and MAVs are annoying as ever because they're practically invincible and will just snipe your ass from spawn

MAPS

Unfortunately, the game is plagued with hackers who use aimbots, wallhacks, and endless magazines to ruin everyone's fun as evidenced by their random number user names, default skins, unrealistic levels for playtime, etc. For this reason, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. In many ways, it is still a downgrade from previous Battlefield titles. Even without the hacking issues, several game modes have game breaking balancing issues such as light armored cars and helicopters with more armor than tanks. In one mode, Breakout, the attacking faction typically has four or more armored vehicles to the defenders one to two. There is also very little building damage or destruction compared to previous titles.

Matchmaking in this game is awful right now. Most likely due to constant loss of good players last few months, you have a chance to constantly end in teams that are full of bad players with negative KD and no interest in playing the game objective. There are few players that are trying, but it is just not enough. If you do get in better team, games are often short with unsatisfying win. Rarely you get in the game with balanced teams and fun game experience. 
Developers did in the past years nerf any weapon that can threaten air vehicles, and destroying the plane or heli with ground troop is difficult. Short range and slow turn radius of guided missiles and short aim range for automatic missiles makes air vehicles OP in this game. 
There are some cheaters in the game. Some are easy identified, and some are smarter and try to hide their cheating. If I identify player using a cheat, or suspecting the player is using the cheat due to several suspecting plays, I report it ingame. Never did I get any feedback from the developers if they did investigate the players or even ban them (or if their investigation showed that the player is not cheating). So, I feel that they do not care that there are cheaters in the game, and are not doing anything about them. 
Additionally, every few games there is massive lag that makes game unplayable. 
This is my last season of this game till it changes for better. I will play it again after some major update or new content, but for now there are better games out there.

The map design is bland and forgettable, every Battlefield map managed to be fun in terms of design and interactivity. Heck, I haven't played Battlefield 4 in a while and I still remember a lot of fun from the maps. However once I get off of 2042, I immediately forget the map I played on. Plus, the maps are just too big which is weird to say as a Battlefield player, but having enormous maps just leaves roaming around looking for some action until I get killed by the enemy team. A big example is an oil rig in the Arctic and while that is a cool concept for a map design, there is a lot of open space beyond the rig. It just makes the game tiresome. 

The game feels like its trying to be Call of Duty and Fortnite in terms of victory animations and layout. Battlefield for a while was its own grounded and gritty FPS, but now that's changed with the futuristic vibe and the storyline feeling a bit out of place. 

Environment destruction feels barebones and is essentially wasted potential.

Update 3 2024: Literally now a vehicle hogging sim. Someone gets in a heli or a tank and keeps it for the entire game because they nerfed the anti tank weapons for infantry.",1637612849,1705196486,False,0,0,0.446230649948120117,0,True,False,False

Thanks for adding AI and portal mode: now you can play with friends against bots. Because there are a lot of people who don't play much and don't have the cool skills to enjoy the battles against real gamers in multiplayer. Playing with bots is good place to training and get more information about weapon.

What can be improved? There are still many players who like the WW1, WW2 setting, but BF 2042 has only 2 maps from BF 1942 and one is just a desert. You have created very cool maps in BF5: Provence, Airfield, Rotterdam, Pacific Storm, Narvik and other very nice, atmospheric maps with destructibility, terrain, meadows, villages, small details and sounds. But now it is impossible to relax on these maps and play against bots in BF5. It would be nice to add the same or similar maps to the portal mode in Battlefield 2042.

On one hand when a game is fairly even it can be fun and it might even suck you in for hours. 
But sometimes it feels like everyone else is using haxx and it makes you want to punch someone to the balls.

So you managed to sneak up behind the enemy? Well someone will see you the moment you fire a single shot and somehow do a 180 and one-shot you to the head in less than 0.5 seconds. 

So you decided to be a sniper? Well everyone will see your scope glimmer but you won't see theirs somehow.

So you wanted to try and defend? Found an awesome spot to be sneaky? Well someone will know you're there somehow and jump you from the only angle you're not looking and shoot you in the face.

Pros:
- Good voice acting

- Gunplay is fun

- Can switch weapon attachments while spawned

- throwing knives 

-  Visuals and models are fantastic 

- consistent updates

- Portal mode


Cons:

- requires EA app to launch

- No single player campaign

- No Firing Range

- ""modern gaming"" style UI and store

- Only 2 teams (USA or RU) 

- Most melee weapons are behind a paywall

-  Maps designs are sub par (several TDM maps are 'King of the hill' style), which I find boring and lazy map design

- Charging full price for essentially half of a game + adding micro transactions 

- No emblem creator

I don't really love Battlefield, but when I saw that the new BF2042 was on sale for €10, I thought I might as well give it a try and play it, I'm really far away from MP only games, because I've already made that mistake in the past and I played Black Ops 4, which was fun but overall it was quite a disaster, but you can't judge until you try it, right? So I went ahead and tried out a title that half of the people love and half hate, and the result is ... well, quite interesting

[b]Pluses[/b]

Here I have to say from the beginning that this Battlefield has a really good gameplay, although it is like every BF that came out, but you also have the abilities of ""Operators"" who have different equipment that they can use in battle and can help them in general, by giving something they added a bit of liveliness to Battlefield and the game doesn't seem quite the same as in the previous installments, but even after some time the game can seem to be the same again as it was before which doesn't give off the great energy that you'd probably expect, but those who they have been playing BF for a long time, so they probably knew in advance what they were getting into. Another thing that is quite nice is of course the Graphics side, have you ever seen a BF that doesn't look amazing? Of course not! Each BF has really beautiful graphics that can sometimes take your breath away! But with these beautiful graphics comes a lot of problems. but we'll talk about that later. However, regarding the characters and their modifications, as I pointed out, the characters here have abilities but you can also modify them, don't expect modifications in the form of Cyberpunk 2077. You just change the Clothes and Dyes they wear, which ... is really useless but I take it as a positive because you can die with more style! But another thing is that making these Customizations available again costs you something, and we'll get to that again in a moment. However, what costs you nothing, maybe just Headphones or peace and good sound is the Audiovisual of the game. The developers have done their best to make the sounds sound beautiful and simulate a real battlefield! If you listen carefully, you will hear even the slightest sounds like footsteps, bullets falling, plugging in a new magazine, even the sound of your uniform rubbing as you move, or even your character's breathing, and here I have to say that the developers really messed around, but let's see the Cons.

[b]Cons[/b]

This is where it all breaks down, let's start with the mildest and that is the Battle Pass, yes I know Call of Duty has it too and it doesn't change the situation of both games, but if I take it around and around COD has a Battle Pass that gives you it literally makes the game more enjoyable, this BP just wants to extract money from you for other colors, exp, cards, emblems, etc... It's really like you go and throw money out the window, it's really not worth it. Another thing that totally shocked me was their ""Shop"" in which I scrolled for a good minute before I got to the end, not even Call of Duty has so many cosmetics in the game for €60. I understand that nowadays the trend is to stuff microtransactions everywhere, and even if no one forces you to buy it, it still spoils the good idea of the game itself, when you see that you can buy so much, it's something else when Microtransactions are in a F2P game, there from of them run the game, but EA is again doing unnecessary things that just bring down their Player Base and Rating of the game! Another thing, if you look at the Equipment, you really have a lot of weapons here, some are locked because you don't own the Elite Edition for €90 (I'm sorry EA, I'd rather pre-order the game in the full Edition next time!) and the ones you have unlocked are not much You can't customize, because everything is locked and you have to unlock it by playing and killing, so you spend a lot of time with one weapon without at the end of unlocking all the Attachments saying that it was time well spent! Unfortunately, the biggest lightning struck here is Optimization, although I reduced the details of the game for some things even to Minimum, I still had FPS drops in the Game Menu, with the addition of Microlags and increased Latency in the game (Although Nvidia Low Latency was on ON) And playing an FPS game with such conditions is almost a superhuman task. Regardless, let's get into the game, there you will find that the only mode that is played is Conquest, with others you can wait for half an hour and you will be in the lobby with a maximum of 4 and wait for other players, the total indifference of the developers to somehow take care of their game has resulted in quite a locked game where you can only play one Mode, which can get pretty boring after a few hours. Despite the fact that the Anticheat is so great that you practically don't even notice that there is one at all! Conclusion, this Battlefield shows us that even though you can be a multi-million dollar company, you are still just trying to make money and you don't care what will happen in your game, if you are looking for some good BF you better go back to BF4 or BF3 this game is just not worth it! I can't recommend it even at a discount, I have the impression that your wallet will thank you even more.

It's a shame that BF42 turned into a simple arcade game just to attract the COD crowd.

I've been navigating the virtual battlefields of Battlefield 2042, and while the game has its merits, a few issues have caught my attention. Despite my overall positive experience, there are a couple of aspects that could use some refinement.

Firstly, I've encountered occasional lag and input delays, even on servers with a ping below 60-70. It's a minor hiccup, but addressing this would undoubtedly enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Art style is a subjective matter, and unfortunately, the current one doesn't resonate with me. I find myself yearning for the grittier aesthetics of Battlefield 4, which had a more visceral and immersive feel. While personal preferences may differ, a touch of nostalgia for the previous art style is something I can't shake off.

On a gameplay note, I'd love to see the return of the weapons leaning and mounting mechanics from Battlefield 4. These elements added an extra layer of strategy to engagements, and their absence is felt in the current iteration. It would be fantastic if the Devs Team at DICE could consider reintroducing these mechanics.

Furthermore, the impact of the weapons in Battlefield 2042 could be heightened by improving the firing and related sound effects. The current guns lack the punchiness that made their Battlefield 4 counterparts so satisfying. A return to the visceral audio experience of Battlefield 4 would undoubtedly elevate the intensity of firefights and contribute to a more immersive gaming environment.

In summary, while Battlefield 2042 has its strengths, addressing these minor issues could make a substantial difference in the overall gaming experience. I look forward to potential updates and improvements from the Devs Team, hoping that they consider the constructive feedback from the community to make Battlefield 2042 even more exceptional.",1704983107,1704983186,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is unlimited potential with this game, but they really shot themselves in the foot by abandoning the Portal.

Right now, there are only six maps ported from previous titles. Each of which manages to capture the same feel of the original games in an updated engine. You can also create custom game modes with different sets of rules. Remember Project Reality? You can make something like that in Portal in minutes.

Since money is the only language the folks at DICE and EA speak, I'll sum it up like this.

If you guys import the remaining maps from the games you guys shut down servers for and pulled from the stores, people would flock to 2042 and buy it just for those maps alone. You guys are literally burning gold.

I know BF3 is next on the chopping block. Do us a favor and give us the rest of those maps as well.

Also, please add random map rotation in Portal so I don't have to play the same maps in the same order.

Still of the same opinion. It is just utter random chaos.

I got a new rig with brand new hw and now I can now actually run the game... and it's a huge difference (!!!)
However, the core problems still remain: team balancing is non existent, the servers are completely inconsistent (lag, hit reg etc.), and the sound stage is just unclear chaos - just like every match and the game in general.
Games nowadays are hardly AAA in any respect, but few are as infuriating as this utter piece of trash.

November 2023 Update:
The matchmaking is really bad. There is no option to select the region and the matchmaking will not put you in a game if you have 40+ latency. Everytime you search a game it will just put you in an empty lobby which never fills up for 40+ minutes to even hit the minimum player number to start the round.
 The only option is to join someone on your friend list who lives in another region who is ALREADY game or else if you try to search for a game while being in a party, again it will throw you in an eternal waiting lobby with no players.
Just a simple region select or the system expanding its search radius instead of just putting you in a empty lobby wouldve solve this issue.
So many players online, but none of them can find a game.

On the other side, the vehicles are so overpowered that none of the classes have anything in this inventory arsenal against them. Which means, that anytime someone gets in a vehicle they are going 150+ kills and 0 deaths per game as there is nothing against them to stop them.

Old Review (Outdated)-

Current performance is really smooth and stable. Games are available most of the times, actually decent AI Bots which do something to fill the game between empty servers to get the game started while more players join. Decent weapon balance and improved maps. Operators now kind of fit into the narrative of BF2042. Kinda sad the game does not have a campaign, it would really improve a reason for why the factions are fighting for.

If only the game launched anywhere close to the state it is in right now, it would have been regarded as one of the best Battlefields out there.



OLD OUTDATED REVIEW BELOW-

Still a lot of performance issues. Consider buying only during heavy sales.

1 Year update: tl;dr; the game is now overrun by hackers, skip it completely.

2 Year Update: The game is now playble and decent. The playerbase has drastically died off, EA took too long to fix this.

 The game has been out for so long and took so long to fix just to make it playble on powerful hardware, even if you manage to run the game now, it is full of hackers. Skip over this one, even during heavy sales.
Furthermore, due to these ""updates and fixes"" the game has even more severe performance issues on older hardware.
The most disturbing part about this game was how I would only be seemingly killed by players using controllers. I could not figure it out until I plugged a controller in myself and played with it, immediately saw how easy this game was with this controller ""aim assist"", just look in the general direction of the opponent's head and pull the trigger and the game zeros in on the head almost like an aimbot. Can pull off easy headshots all day long, I don't play fps on controllers so my hands were sore fairly quick. Just press one button on the controller and the game does everything for you.

Tested this game on my newer and older systems.
System Specs:

System 1: AMD5800X3D - RTX3070 - 32GB RAM = Playble. Lot of noticeable frequent micro-stutters and game freezes every now and then. Game is extremely CPU heavily, processor pinned at 100% majority of the time even on lowest settings.Changing game setting only seems to affect GPU load while the CPU load remains constant. Max settings still runs the game at 70+ FPS but has severe input latency on anything above medium settings while the game in motion looks the same. Anyone who actually plays shooter games knows input latency is a straight up no-no, it literally kills the game. Personally I run the game at playdoh settings to keep the input latency at the minimum and it is still noticeable, visuals and fps are not important to me as overall system responsiveness. 60fps is decent enough to be good at the game, system latency is the most important of them all.

System 2: Intel 7700HQ - GTX1060 6GB - 16GB RAM = Completely Unplayble even on lowest settings. Game assets straight-up don't even load-in most of the time, missing player guns and player-models, only HUD visible on the screen, can only see red enemy nametag floating around and the buildings and other small assets don't even load in. 15-20FPS average with severe game and system freezes leading to forced powerbutton shutdows as it renders system completely unresponsive. Left it 10+ minutes to see if it fixes itself or generates even a single new frame with no response.

Update, System 3- 5800X3D - RTX4080. 
Now the game feels playble and you can feel the disappointment in 4K UHD HDR 144FPS.",1655675690,1704896445,False,0,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

Now, in 2024, I am playing BF2042 again, and while it's right, it doesn't feel like an actual Battlefield game to me. It's a good shooter with vehicles but lacks the large-scale war experience that made the franchise so engaging. In previous Battlefield games, you were just a tiny part of a massive war machine, and when you managed to make a difference in a match, it felt like a personal victory against all odds.

the game overall is fun in its current state and if i had never played another battlefield game i would think this game is pretty darn good. but that is not the world we live in. so many aspects of the game from a fundamental standpoint are much worse than previous battlefield titles. 

the reworked specialist system is not well balanced and the infantry vs vehicle combat has suffered greatly because of this feature the game was built upon. Even partnered with a friend, tanks and aircraft are almost impossible to kill unless they play stupidly. 

the maps do not feel good to play and there is genuinely maybe 2 maps that are not a remaster that flow well or allows a multitude of different combat styles. after 2 years of content there is only 13 playable maps which most battlefields have at least 20 by this time. the map sizes make traversing from point to point take minutes and there are some how less vehicles spawns on the ground than in previous titles. redacted is the only map in the game worth running smgs / shotguns on but otherwise with the increased map size to accommodate 128 players every other map you are almost required to run dmrs, assault rifles, snipers, or lmgs.

the engine itself is downgraded from previous titles. the physical input of mouse sometimes doesn't work right 100% of the time making some quick flicks not register, its a rare issue but never have i had this issue with a previous battlefield. this time around there is almost no destruction. besides from a couple inconsequential buildings most structures around objectives and chokes are not destructible at all. battlefield 1 and 5 the game previous to this one had amazing destruction and it almost doesn't exist in this title. wheeled vehicles have never felt worse to drive in a battlefield game, they are sluggish, not responsive and almost all of them feel ready to tip over on small bumps. 

The graphics themselves feel weird to talk about in this game as ya they are good but for what this game should have been it should not be on par with how battlefield 4 looked in 2014 with the resolution just a bit higher. there is no style or substance to the graphics that battlefield 1 and 5 did amazingly. 

solider animations in some aspects are what you expect with good detailed animations but in other cases they are awful. some launchers and pistols just reload off screen and this game committed the sin of trying to copy 3rd person take downs from call of duty mw 2019. battlefield 1 is still the very best example of how to do proper first person take down animations and this game failed in this aspect hard even though this is a sequel and by the same studio.

the weapons themselves and the plus system is one of the few high points to game. the weapons look very good, and sound design is ranges from passable to very good. the plus system allows you to change how your weapon is kitted on the fly which is super nice but also heavily contributes to why smgs and shotguns arent usable in 95% of situations. an ar can be kitted foir close or long range when there is 95 % more long range situations. i dont know if its a bug or laziness but i loaded into a portal match and the m1 garand doesnt have a ping when it reloads......

The music. How has a battlefield game fallen so hard from grace in this aspect. I listen to the sound tracks from bf 3, bf4, bf5, and bf1 all the time because they are awesome. this is sound track sucks ass. the battlefield legacy theme is mixed so badly that it sounds like nails on a chalkboard and there is no notable piece of music ive listened to any where in the game.

This game in a vacuum is a fun alll out war experience and still feels like a battlefield game at least after 2 years now. i would still recommend playing battlefield 5 right now as that game still has better player numbers and is a better more cohesive experience. this game is worth probably 25 to 35 dollars but definitely not 60 or 70. Its just such a disappointment as you see how much effort went into the game but the direction and thought wasn't focused enough and because of it every single aspect of the game is worse than previous battlefield titles. 

Dice, stop chasing trends like, battle royales, battle passes, and hero elements/ specialists. you can add that stuff later if you have a successful game. just take the same steps you guys did to develop battlefield 3, 4, and 1 and you will make a lot of money. you have a golden goose of a franchise that has about one more bad egg and then the goose is dead",1704779078,1704780052,False,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

I am very satisfied with this game. The return of bots in 64 player coop maps really rings home to me since the last battlefield game to support this was Battlefield 2 in 2005. I especially love how we can go on portal.battlefield.com and create custom games that we can host. Battlefield 1942 maps with battlefield 3 equipment! Great Job EA! Way to bring back battlefield to the good old days with modern graphics! The main issue I had with the newer battlefields BFBC2 to BFV was the inability to provide a practice environment on vehicles and weapons systems before heading into actual battle against humans. This gives players an edge to see what the maps are like, what the equipment feels like to operate, and to know the limits of each vehicle before fighting anyone PVP online. 

The next thing EA has got to get working on is getting the game unborked on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sooooo, it has been eight months after launch and Battlefield 2042 has finally released its first season ' Zero Hour'. Is it too late? or has DICE managed to show a little hope for the future of Battlefield 2042...

Firstly, I understand what DICE has done with Battlefield 2042 and honestly, it is inexcusable. I did play it on day one on the series X and used the 10-hour free trial (of which I didn't even use all the 10 hours ), so I am completely aware of what state the game launched at. It had a horrendous launch, It wasn't what we hoped for, it wasn't what we as fans of the whole franchise wanted. That release will forever be encrusted as a brown skid mark at the back of my shorts, a stain which many fans have and DICE and EA will have to live with. 

Trust me, I was, and still am pretty P****D about this. It is a great shame to see a series I have been with since the beginning fall so low and gain probably the most hated and highest number of bad reviews I have seen. It felt like a massive kick in the nut sack, especially when the developers continuously talked about listening to the fans on what they wanted while creating the game. 

With that being said, it does seem like DICE is continuing to support the game and trying to make it as good as it can be. So where are we at currently and has it got better? 

I hate to say it, and I know you will all hate to read it. But yes, things are getting better. This was the first time playing it since launch so I haven't touched it since it was first released as I refused to. I was curious upon season 1 release as to what had improved and I was quite surprised. 

The new map 'Exposure': It is unique, there are tunnels to explore, mountains to climb, and beautiful environments with great use of colour throughout. Most importantly, it feels like a battlefield map. You feel like you have direction and don't just land in the open wondering  'okay where am I going. it is clear where you should be defending or where you should be attacking. It has many channelling points which creates the fun times of BF4 when you have 30 men behind a door on each side and everyone is pushing to get through with 101 grenades rolling through. This for me was Battlefield when it was just chaos in many areas. Thankfully this is back, especially on breakthrough mode. The map is big but not so big that it feels like a walking simulator but also it's not small enough to get shot from multiple different points so it's a great balance. it does also have a great balance between infantry and vehicles. 

The battle pass is the same as all the other battle passes out there with 100 tiers to go through. The major unlocks are free unlocks and there are no pay-to-win elements unless you count buying tiers as part of it. Mostly cosmetic unlocks but all great additions. As far as I can tell, it is a pretty fair battle pass which does not feel like a complete grind to get through. The weekly missions are not difficult to achieve which gives you a lot of XP towards the pass. I have already hit level 40 within the pass. Thankfully there are no crazy outfits such as clown heads to unlock or some crazy Fortnite stuff. All unlocks thankfully are decent cosmetics that keep the feel of a modern shooter such as normal camo unlocks or military-style outfits. 

Due to there being a lot to talk about and many changes being made it is hard to fit it all in as season one comes with a lot of changes. What I will say about this update is it does make battlefield 2042 feel like a completely new game compared to when it launched and I mean that in a really good way. Again I know many of you don't like to hear that but it is true. I noticed instantly the guns felt so much better to use and not so aggressive with acceleration as before. Hit detection is especially better with bullets being on point with the targets. I feel like the character is much freer to move around whereas before it felt a little heavy and restricted. In general, is a more polished and more enjoyable experience than before. 

Is it too late ?? 
That is hard to say, but I don't think it is too late for the developers/studio to save the game. Let's rewind to the launch of No Mans Sky for example. no one would have expected that to rebound as well as it has. I had completely written off that game with their updates and pathetic content release, but look where we are now ?? it's honestly come a long way and now it is a top seller. I will keep hope that Battlefield will bounce back like NMS. 

Overall, My thoughts on Battlefield 2042 season 1 are mostly positive. Yes, it's not perfect and yes some things do need a little more tweaking as I do encounter small bugs here and there but not as many as I first encountered. I have seen very little actually in the past 24 hours of gameplay. Sure I am still P****D that we had to wait so long for season 1 but it is a massive step in the right direction! 

It is clear that DICE is finally starting to listen to the fan's feedback and they are applying it to areas. It still has a long way to go but it is a step forward at least. The update is a solid step toward building a better Battlefield. The update will bring people out of the brink and start to love the game again but it doesn't hold enough content just yet and I feel some may burn out and get bored quickly.

There is a shimmering hope that this game can be turned around, Exposure is the most 'Battlefield' map 2042 has to offer with its great map design. It's well-paced and the most fun I have had on a map. The gameplay tweaks are noticeable and a massive improvement from the launch. These updates do make the older maps fun to go back to also. 

So if you can see past the 100k bad reviews and fancy giving it a try again? then you probably won't be disappointed. Well not as much as you probably were on day one. If you don't fancy paying for the game just yet then get EA Play and use the 10-hour free trial to test it out. That's what I did and then brought the game half price two weeks back. It's still not worth full price so I recommend waiting for a sale or checking on other websites for discounts.

Unfortunately the reviews here are mostly negative which paints such a bad picture for the game. Filter reviews by latest first and you will see a recent massive improvement to the game and the good reviews it is receiving. The past 4500 reviews are 41% positive at the day of writing this (02/07/22).  Those negative reviews are deserved at launch but try the game for yourself now and see past the negative comments this time. If this review has made you give it another chance, that's great news!!

This will max (probably) everyone's CPU out to 100% the second you get to the main menu. If your cores or frequency don't make the cut, it will drop frames consistently.

Then there's just a pile of whack, weird, goofy ass decisions that was\is made pretty consistently. Like, DICE put a lot of work into revamping multiple 128-player maps, and then almost immediately after, forced the 128 playlist into only playing two or three of those maps at a time. Or take for example: There's one single pump shotgun in the game which is outperformed in every way by every other shotgun. Your 12g ""shorty"" shotgun-secondary gets one-shot kills more consistently and at better range than the 870. It's been the worst shotgun pick across the board for months. And then at the start of Dark Creations they NERFED IT. 

Don't even get me started on the music. I like music. Across all the BF's there have been some pretty good soundtracks for the menu & gameplay cues, but this one's bar none the worst. Go pick any three tracks from BFV and then listen to what's on the 2042 main menu, or match start. BFV sounds like a composer's homage to a sobering war. 2042 sounds like they made an intern produce it after bombing his family.

Here we are in the beginning of 2024 and the game is still sh** to play. Still has bugs. Still lags like a mofo. Nothing creative about the game play. Many times, you're running forward only to be pulled back several spots from where you just were. Aiming with a scope is a guessing game in of itself to try and hit a target at distance. Clearly this was not really thought out. Like the rest of the game. Wanna fly a helicopter or fighter jet? Good luck with how touchy the controls get for no reason. Trying to get a somewhat decent squad together is next to impossible. There is zero teamwork to be had in the game, and EA/Dice have made it that way. It's a free for all between two sides. Zero initiative to get players to work together. 

If my name were listed as being a developer for this game, I'd quit this line of work. Because clearly the people who made this game forgot how to make a game that isn't crap from the get go. Let's face it, FPS games peaked well over 10 year ago. Everything that has come out in recent years has been trash. And BF 2042 is at the top of the heap of garbage stinking up the place. If this continues to get sh**ier, just call it Diarrhea 2042 instead.

I bought this game when it came out because I was a hardcore Battlefield player throughout the years but this game has gotten worse to date, The class system for this game is ridiculously horrid why have specialist this is supposed to a be Battlefield game where you can customize your character and look different from each other not have 15 Sundances flying around or other characters looking the same, heck the AI look more better than the specialist with no fancy gadgets or anything like that. 
The updating of the maps to look better are a joke literally all the extra objects added take more fps with the constant frame drops I even have the game set to low I can play every other game on ultra but this game. 
The main issue I'm having the most is the fun I try to have fun with this game but that's not possible on Battlefield 2042 the constant base camping or spawning on your team mates and instantly dyeing with no camera to see if its clear to spawn or not, the weapons are over and under powered for certain classes with the new update on (1/31/20023) which make no sense for the assault class to use a sniper rifle, I think that Battlefield 2042 should take a lot of steps from the other Battlefield franchises and see how the community effected those games like BF3, BC2 and BF4.

**Update old**
Since the update the game play has gotten better and is actually fun and starting to act like a BF game but needs more maps the same ones are starting to get old. The classes are still a little unbalanced  but its doable, still wish the weapon classes are like BF3 style and not every class can use every gun in the game.

**Update**
Game is now trash and not fun anymore I wish EA would make a better game, every gun is unbalanced especially the VHX blah blah blah gun and every other one shoots Nerf darts. I'm surprised the VHX cant just nuke the whole server and just call it a day because everyone especially there grandma can use this thing with no brain power. OK got off topic here, 2042 is just trash now and needs to be redone like the old Battlefields used to be fun and make memories but can't do that when this game, this game is constantly dying and unfun.",1675215326,1704175168,False,0,0,0.536872982978820801,1,True,False,False

I know there's tons of people who will tell you: [quote] ""oh, but it's good now, they've updated the game and fixed all of the issues"". [/quote] [b] Well..... no. It's not good, and they have not fixed all of the issues. [/b] 

Yes, it has improved some since release, but it's still plagued with bugs that pop up with each update and terrible implementations of overused ideas that do not work well together, and do not belong in a Battlefield setting. 

[list]
[*] We still have ridiculous ""main characters/operators"" that are ripped straight out of Apex Legends or Rainbow 6 Siege. 
[*] We still have a garbage instant matchmaking system with no server browser that will actually tell you if the game you are joining is a complete dumpster fire or if it's only a few players in the lobby and everyone else is bots. 
[*] The whole idea of Portal being the ultimate answer to anything you want from a Battlefield game has not been developed or changed at all since launch. So no, it's NOT a ""love letter to the fans"".
[*] Every new gun that is introduced is OP in order to convince everyone to spend money and buy in-game currency so you can buy a Battle-pass, which still expires every month, requiring the player-base to buy another Battle-pass and give greedy EA even more money. Those new guns will be nerfed the next season in order to start the whole chain all over again.
[*] Recently EA slowed down their progression on how much the experience you gain with each game counts towards Battle-pass progression. So now they're attempting to force you to buy the premium-priced ""Early Start/Boosted"" Battlepass in order to progress through the Battle-pass at anything less than an agonizing grind.
[*] Most of the maps are still empty feeling and open to a point where sometimes it's just a bunch or rocks or a hill on each point with tons of open space between each point. Yayyyyy now it's just a running simulator for 5 minutes until you get blown away by a heli. So much fun!
[*] Don't be too surprised if your team gets completely swept round after round because there are no attempts at all at balancing in this game. If one team has 30 players and the other team has 20 players the game's solution is to add 10 bots that are barely a token of help to the team with 20 players. So now when more players join they will continue to be dropped on the team with 30 players, guess how that goes? Hint: not well.
[*] A new unique addition to the game with the recent update is the game crashing or showing a black screen instead of loading into a match. So far I have seen this issue primarily with NVIDIA drivers, and it happens nearly every 2 to 3 games. 
[*] Oh, you happened to be lucky enough to have 3 other friends who are willing to play with you? Well if you have a full party of 4 players you will be thrown into separate squads in the beginning of every match. So you have to make a new squad and get everyone back together. Such an amazing experience.
[/list]

There's about 30 other gripes I have with this game, but I'm tired of typing. 

[h3] The bottom line is: BF2042 is still a disaster and a smear upon the franchise name. [/h3]

It's a money grab, and clearly they intend to pump the player-base cash-cow for as long as they can until they release the next uncompleted game with ""Battlefield"" tacked onto it. I keep playing this game with friends because I want it to be better. But it's never going to improve enough to be worth anything more than $10-15 as it is.

I re-purchased this game cause it was on sale for the new year. Heard its gotten so much better and to buy it on sale. Couldn't even start the game it would crash before even loading.

I have a AMD 3700x and ASUS 2080ti. Battlefield 2042 should be playable but it wasn't.

On (AUG 29, 2021). I have to stand in one spot with no big battles going on and use only Sniper Rifles to get the highest FPS possible. In battle's the FPS ""DROP"" like a rock and got about 30-55 FPS. Battlefield 2042 at the time was ""NOT"" playable so I made and ask for a refund at (Nov 9, 2021) I try to fix it's bad ""Optimization a Buggy"" game doing windows updates, update driver's and i even Re-install Windows 11 and 10 to see witch one was better. The game was (unplayable). after all that i still got g 30-55 FPS FPS in battlefield 2042.

Then saw ""EA"" Websites on battlefield 2042 and news about that they have fix some bugs and the ""optimization"" in battlefield 2042. I purchase the game again at (Nov 9, 2021) (Battlefield 2042 Gold Edition) thought EA fix the problem so i got the Gold Edition""BUT"" after testing the game out and started to play Battlefield 2042. EA haven't ""Optimize"" the game and still got FPS drops. I even try re-installing to windows 11 again and check EA website and YouTube videos to fix this but i got no new results so i ask for a refund on (Nov 26,2021)

Then on (Jun 14, 2022) on-sale for $31.79. So i gave it another try. I cuss after all that time they lower the price to get m,ore people back into the game but it seems that Battlefield 2042 needs more work. I played and tested it out and got 80-110 FPS in games, just enough to play the game but still have to stay away from the big battle's and Snipe. 

If you look at Steam Review on Battlefield 2042 it speaks for its self.



1/1/1024

Looks like i can't pay any games on Steam anymore. Since i got my money back from Pay-Pale and played 8 hours trying to fix there game the first time at Nov (Nov 9, 2021). even though i got the game again 7-9 months after with bad FPS, bugs and Glitches, still can't use Pay-pale. Looks like Steam doesn't care about so ill just go on websites buying CD-Keys and apply on here. Steam is trying to get me to reverse the transaction of the 100$ game when i got it on Nov (Nov 9, 2021) but i all ready got the game.

Imagine this: a future where hovercrafts dance on skyscrapers, tanks waltz through sandstorms, and bullets pirouette around corners before finding their forever home in someone's kneecap. That's Battlefield 2047, a game where the only thing more chaotic than the action is trying to explain it to your grandma.

Let's break it down:

• Hovercrafts: They're like mechanical butterflies with the firepower of a pissed-off hippo. You'll soar through the air, raining robo-bees of death on your enemies, and somehow manage to not land on your own teammates (most of the time).

• Gadgets: Forget your puny grenades. Here, you've got EMP grenades that turn tanks into disco balls, grappling hooks that make Spiderman jealous, and wingsuits that let you escape like a disappointed bird.

• Maps: From neon-drenched megacities to sandblasted wastelands, each map is a playground for mayhem. You'll be dodging laser fire in zero-g, sniping from the top of a collapsing skyscraper, and getting run over by a hovercraft while trying to capture a point named ""Bob's Discount Bullets.""

But Battlefield 2047 ain't all sunshine and hover-rainbows.

• Bugs: They're like uninvited guests at your party, except they steal your ammo and replace your bullets with nerf darts. You might clip through walls, get launched into the stratosphere, or witness a tank spontaneously combust. Just roll with it, it's all part of the Battlefield charm (or lack thereof).

• Teamwork? What teamwork?: Let's be honest, half your team will be off doing their own thing, probably breakdancing on top of a tank. But hey, that one clutch revive or perfectly timed EMP grenade can turn the tide of battle and make you feel like a tactical genius (even if you were just spamming buttons).

So, should you buy Battlefield 2047?

If you're looking for a polished, bug-free experience, go play checkers with your grandma. But if you crave over-the-top action, ridiculous gadgets, and enough chaos to make a hurricane jealous, then strap in, buttercup. Battlefield 2047 is a wild ride, and sometimes, that's all you need.

Just remember:

• Aim for the kneecaps, they're extra squishy in the future.

• Don't trust anyone, especially yourself on a hovercraft.

• And if all else fails, just dance. Bullets can't waltz.

Final verdict: 7 out of 10 disco balls. It's got its flaws, but the sheer absurdity of it all makes it strangely addictive. Just don't blame me if you start breakdancing with your grandma's walker after a few rounds.

One of the most glaring things I hate about it, is that it's a cracked-out, ADHD garbage version of the original battlefield games that requires zero strategy to play, about 99% of the time. 

You literally spawn die spawn die spawn die so fast, even if you're getting 30-40+ kills in a match. It's like they took the original formula and made it like Apex Legends or the other stupid games like it to appeal to young teenagers. It's awful.

Nearly all of the maps have zero cover, require you to walk far too long to get to the cap, the cover at the cap can easily all be demolished on capture points, nearly all of the servers limit the amount of vehicles you can get, which means you are either going to walk, you're going to camp a point, or you'll not participate and wait 2 minutes for a vehicle to spawn so you can farm damage again.

It brings out the worst in players. Often times, all players do is camp in vehicles and rack up double the amount of kills anyone else has in the match. It's almost never a fun time. I imagine the only people that will enjoy this is 13-16yo kids hyped up on monster engergy drinks. 

If you aren't a kid hyped up on mountain dew and pizza rolls, and want something with more substance - Go play a game like Hell Let Loose...it's far more in-line with what Battlefield used to be in my opinion.

Old review: When the game launched, it was decent, though a lot of work was needed to bring it up to par. I was excited for the BFBC2 rush mode, as well as the possibility for remakes of all the old BF2 stuff. Initially, crossplay needed to be disabled to get into matches when the game launched otherwise it would crash.

I played a few hours (14) and had some fun, but took a break from it when life got busy. So I come back to the game weeks later and find I can't even get into matches. Then I saw the user reviews have tanked. Apparently there is loads of cheating (doesn't surprise me), and people are having issues joining matches as well. I requested a refund.

BLUF: This game is the buggiest game I have seen in a long time for a full release game.

I can not recommend this game above a $20 price point, nor to ANYONE that deal with problems that result in instantaneous termination of game play. So some friends and I saw the price drop significantly on Battlefield 2024 and decided that despite warning of others here we would throw some cash at it. These friends and I have varying system specs which go from mine (i7-10700K, 20280 Super, 32GB RAM) to others with much higher specs. For myself, I ran the game at recommended settings and pushed to a meager 1080P monitor. I understand that sometimes a specific rig sometimes just doesn't work well with a game sometimes, but when we cant get a team going in BF 2042 because EACH of us is crashing or freezing at random intervals, well that kind of eliminates the hardware as the issue. This game is EXTREMELY FUN when it is not freezing or just straight up locking up the entire PC, requiring a hard restart.

    First of all, let's talk about the scoring method and the unequal distribution of points. For example, if you only mark an enemy and your teammate Gills them, you only get half the points of a regular Gill. However, if you deal 99 damage to an enemy and your teammate finishes them off, you still only get half the points of a regular Gill. The scoring for marking assists and Gill assists, two abilities with completely different scoring methods, are equated directly in the new system. 
    Let's delve into the scoring for Gills and assist Gills. In the previous game, if you Gill an enemy that your teammate has damaged, you receive points equivalent to the damage you inflicted and the points for the Gill. Your teammate also receives points for the damage they caused and the assist Gill points. Moreover, if your teammate inflicts a certain amount of damage, they also receive the Gill credit. 
    Now, let's talk about capture points.In 2042, the scoring for capturing points works in a way that you receive points for completing a capture or neutralizing a point, but you only receive points at the moment of completion. For instance, if you leave the area at the last second after completing the capture, you receive no points. If you capture half of the point and a teammate runs over to share the points, the person who captures the point for the entire duration and the one who captures half receive the same points. It's truly interesting. 
    For example, in Conquest mode, if you, as an Assault player, successfully approach an enemy vehicle, throw a grenade, and manage to destroy it, but the enemy bails out in time and you don't Gill them, you only receive a mere 50 EXP and no points, whereas in the previous game, destroying a vehicle would grant you points.
    The unequal and missing scoring systems fail to provide players with good feedback, fail to motivate players, and no one likes it when they finally check the scoreboard and find themselves at the bottom.",1703929289,1703929289,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

UPDATE - At the end of 2023 I feel like this game is in a state of enjoyment and what it really should've been from launch. On sale this game is easily worth the $12. Really do wish this game had the DLC map style like BF4 did because the only real thing missing now imo is more completely new maps instead of re-releases.

Heres to hoping the last year of updates and support for BF2042 with the new leadership changes translates into the new battlefield game but my original statement of sitting the next one out still stands at least until the price of it comes down because I'm not buying a game again and waiting 2 full years to be able to really enjoy it.",1648224328,1703879963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EA is clearly still managing development costs and allocation. The 'Elite Edition' includes a 'DLC' that is not actually DLC, and a Battle Pass that seems like a free item they are somehow charging for. Legal? Probably. Ethical? Not even remotely.

I have had the misfortune of seeing my favorite franchise die a slow death over the last decade. 2042 is reminiscent of BF4 in totality, and is a clear indicator that people like Andrew Wilson have no business in the arts. Individuals with a net worth exceeding $100M are deranged and cannot be trusted to competently bring entertainment products to market.

17/12/2021 UPDATE - The game is still a disappointment. Stuttering issues persist, affecting server connection more than in-game FPS. The maps, guns, and vehicles (both land and air) are overpowered, contributing to an overall lackluster experience.

Post Launch Review - 19/11/21

One day before -
A minor 1GB update brought a few fixes, addressing some quality of life issues. However, it failed to address the major concerns. The alleged server upgrade didn't bring significant improvement.

Review -
Weapons and Vehicles:

Despite the game's potential, numerous severe issues mar the experience. Every gun feels unbalanced, resembling airsoft guns at times. For instance, the starting AR has a 31-round magazine, yet it takes around 20 shots to kill an enemy, making fights against multiple opponents nearly impossible.

Hitting shots is a challenge due to an added glare that causes bullets to stray from the intended direction. Bullet registration issues persist, affecting not only main weapons but also launchers that sometimes fail to register hits on vehicles even after impact.

Sniper rifles are only effective with consistent headshots; hitting an opponent multiple times with a .50 cal may not guarantee success.

Many vehicles are overpowered, with the ability to auto-repair without a repair tool. This leads to players staying inside tanks the entire game, exploiting the regenerating health and unlimited ammunition. The combination is detrimental to gameplay.

Bugs:

The game is riddled with bugs, ranging from continuous reload prompts to getting stuck in the crouch position. The list includes issues like an endless death countdown, guns stopping firing, inability to look up or down, jittery tank first-person view, and more.

Performance/Optimization:

Despite claims of server upgrades, high-level GPUs are maxed out, and the game lacks optimization. Performance fluctuates drastically, impacting the overall gaming experience negatively.

Lack of Modes:

The game offers only three modes, excluding Portal. The absence of popular modes from previous Battlefield titles is a glaring omission.

Portal:

While Portal offers a variety of maps and game modes, it comes at a cost. Players are awarded XP for soldier levels but won't level up guns, limiting attachment unlocks. Portal feels more like post-game content.

In conclusion, the game is plagued with issues, and each play session reveals new glitches. I advise against purchasing until a major update addresses weapon balancing, vehicle meta, adds more game modes, maps, and weapons, optimizes the game, and resolves the numerous bugs. At its current state, the £40 base price is unjustified. I still love the game when it works, but the flaws are too glaring. This release is unacceptable for a AAA title, and I won't be preordering any Battlefield games in the future. My recommendation: wait until it's fixed, if it ever will be.",1637346888,1703816944,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Fast forward to now, played the 10 hour trial on PC, they've definitely worked hard to fix the game. Game came up on sale for about $28 for me. Picked it up, and it's worth the price. They definitely need a bigger map selection for the 2042 side of things. I will mention the bugs they've fixed that i've noticed while playing in the pros section.

PROS:

They've fixed hit registry. (bug fix)
Connectivity issues are almost resolved. (server issue fix)
Graphically it looks good. However still needs some polishing in regards to how good the graphics can be.
The map selection is ok (is also a negative. But replayability on the maps currently available on the 2042 side). 
Portal is ok. Alot of Zombies game modes along with grinding game modes for XP are there. Not the biggest highlight here.
Weapons and gameplay feel good. Definitely something to adjust to. (to a degree.)
Is worth the buy at a discount (50% or greater discount. Or at or below $30.00)

CONS:
Not worth full price (at the time of review it is $64.99-$120.00 based on edition)
Map selection needs to be expanded. 
More needs to be done to help with spawn trapping. BUUUUUUT we all know that's an impossible task.
Noticable FPS drops during storm events. Haven't dropped below 40fps but went from 140fps to 50fps when the storms appeared on the map.
Operator selection is eh. Definitely would've preferred the old Battlefield Classes over the ops. Granted their abilities are entertaining (Can anyone say Blitz from R6S?).
Their most recent map is fairly broken with ways to glitch to opposite end of the map currently being used for conquest. Not really the funnest thing ever to suddenly get shot through a wall then someone glitching right into existance.

So much so it that it basically castrates the role of long-range sniper.  The most effective way to play the recon role is to run around and use the sniper rifle close-range like it's a damn shotgun.  It's so stupid.

be patient with this game! it's gonna be rough in the beginning but once you get the hang of it!  You're gonna have some Battlefield moments! just wish we had more destructive environments and level changes like we did in the past!

This game at launch was awful. I bought this game 3 times, and refunded it twice. Oddly enough, third time is a charm. No more RNG recoil, I now get over 100 fps on high settings, maps have been reworked, you can level up your guns fighting bots to catch up, classes have returned, there is a scoreboard, and I am genuinely liking the characters (but not all of them).

It feels like this game has been in Early Access for the last 2 years, and has finally released. It's fun, and I have yet to have a dull moment with this game, but this should've been how it is on release, hence, this may not look good for the future of this game because it took so long to get stable. Also, it needs more maps, its pretty much a bare bones battlefield experience, which is ok by me since I paid only 10 dollars to play it.

I prefer the movement we have in this game over past entries and any glitches and bugs seem to gone and the game has been running like a dream. The Redacted map introduced in Season 6 is basically BF2042's Nuketown/Shipment/Rust and is great for chaotic game-play and leveling up weapons.

This was once a premier franchise, now just feels hollow. If you cant hack it on call of duty, this is the place to go. I was really hoping this was going to beat COD and be better. I was excited about the bigger maps, and more to do, just kinda feels stale. (No I was not thinkning this would be call of duty) I had a monster KD every match I played, players literally feel like bots, no one is using coms.


Please return to former glory call of duty needs to be dethroned, and I want you too do it!!! I have nothing but high hopes for your next installment, this was just sooo generic feeling.

Nearly every single point in breakthrough feels either super exposed or no room to move whatsoever. Some zones are single points with no nearby zones for defenders to spawn while others have attackers running 200m+ across flat land with no cover just to get close to site. Of the current 11 maps only 2 are decent, those being spearhead and manifest. Honorable mention to kaleidoscope for being the other playable map but it's still trash. 

Guns feel fine, recoil is fine but something I can't get over is bullet drop and damage drop. Why does my ak-12 drop several inches at 100m? Why do we have 308 or 54R LMG's dropping at the same rate? Why does my DMR take more shots to kill than my LMG at 100m? The best question I've got is why does the recoiless m5 have ranging lines on it that don't even line up? Bunch of complaints surrounding fighting at 100m+ but inside of that the game feels good.

IFF is a big problem as well, for some reason all characters on both sides look the same so there's no ability to tell at a glance if they're friendly or hostile. Would appreciate characters losing the skins for literally any ability to tell if they're hostile or not when I'm looking at them instead of looking for their name tag.Game runs fine though, only had one crash in 30 hours. Getting the game started through steam is an impossibility though. Gotta use the ea app or it shts the bed with a near 100% failure rate.

Avoided a purchase during the many ""free"" sessions because bugs were still a large part of the experience.

Decided that I had my fun with Battlebit but I missed the chaos and polish that previous Battlefield titles provided and I figured $12 for a shot at revisiting it was worth trying.

I'm glad I did. Game runs great, Sounds as good as always and in the few games I've played today I was immediately brought back to that feeling of enjoying Battlefield titles of the past. The game runs great (albeit it on a 4080 so ymmv), the sound design is always a pleasure (Thank you for continuing the trend of Binaural audio) and the gunplay felt immediately natural.

Part of me wishes the game came out like this but I have to say after checking in on this franchise I think it's finally at a point where I'd let any of my buddies who are genuinely interested that it's worth it. I say worth it because the winter sale is good - It'd be a hard pill to swallow at $60 but for a few more months of some somewhat mindless shooty times - It's a good way to enjoy some time.

Now BF devs - let's talk about releasing a 2143 title with the polish and mechanics out of the gate so we can revisit taking down those titans. Cool? Cool.",1703447232,1703447232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did play it extensively when the devs really started ""fixing"" the issues, and I found the game to be decent and, for the time being, playable. I went through multiple seasons (end Season 3 to Season 6 now).

The GOOD. There isn't much to say of good things about the game. I could say that the devs really tried fixing things up, making up for the whole mess they gave at launch. They adapted the maps, gave more weapons, reworked the Portal guns by giving them the attachments from 2042 era, sort of gave the new ""Metro/Locker BF4"" map, Battlepass isn't really grinding. But that is bout it...

The BAD. There is a lot to say, but you probably have seen many YT videos and reviews. I really wanted to like this game at first, but after 289 hours of playing I finally came to the conclusion that this game will never be any good than even BFV. And I played a lot of BF titles, I have around 2k hours through Origin on BF4 (and that launch was horrible at the time). 

1) The classes: they sort of fixed them and gave back the "" original design"". But it's still shit as some of the operators are trash in comparison with the others that are OP. Yes, I am looking at you Dozer (the shield rework made him so much worse to play against). 
2) Weapon balancing: still shit. With the recent update they gave out VHX AR and EVERYONE was abusing it to the point where it became unbearable to play against anyone because the gun is broken. Also the attachments are garbage because you only need to use 2. 
3) The events and the rewards: none were actually good balanced from the beginning with the rewads being absolute disaster for the grind that you had to go through. Good example is the hyped up event with the AI where the maps were too big and the player count was too small. 
4) Vehicles: I hope that those vehicle players that spam the Premium Truck that is not balanced at all will get permanent brain damage as it's garbage. To this day I find it not worth your time learning how to play with the vehicles because you are either destroyed in seconds or obliterated by the sweaty nerds. 
5) Bugs and the performance: there are still bugs with the animations and the spawning where it blacks out your game, FPS is decent but not really good, the overall look of the game feels too simple. 

I am going to finish playing the game with the new season that the devs announced, but it might be the case where I will just uninstall and jump on more BattleBit as that game is the BF experience you wanted to have with no strings attached.",1703415041,1703415041,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only ""good"" new map was Redacted and even that gets boring eventually, everything becomes routine, min/maxed for the K/D farming. The other more recent Linearly designed maps are decent, most of the original launch maps are still pretty much a walking simulator with almost zero cover. The terrain elevation changes on all maps makes it feel like I'm constantly tripping on something.

Input feels weird, its very hard to describe but its at least ""better"" now compared to before. This input weirdness is more apparent with a faster 144hz display. Same with movement, it feels like you're constantly rubber banding. Essentially I don't feel ""connected"" with my character's movement.

Hit reg is still a freaking lottery. 2 times out of 10 your shots wont register. You can see this happen if you enable Event Log from the settings to compare hit regs seen by the client and by the server. This is despite having 30ms ping. The game feels worst to play in 128 lobbies, Its not frame-rate issues, its just makes the game feel more sluggish in regards to input.

I want actual class systems back. 

Lastly, the new anti cheat is useless. Here in the Asian region, we get rage cheaters very often.

Conclusion:
I love battlefield, and this was a big disappointment. 

This could have been great, but it wasn't. Season 7 is coming next year and that might make it fun again. Although I bet the majority of new ""content"" would just be another set of skins for battle pass players. Which i refuse to get due to the state of the game.

- A place able front shielded mini-gun turret is more powerful and more annoying than most vehicles
- Riot shields that are bullet proof nearly grant invincibility in CQC situations unless there is a teammate that conveniently gets behind them
- No weapons are class locked
- The only reason to play any of the classes is for their very limited amount of class specific field items
- Not a fan of a good number of the maps in game

Battlefield Bad Company 2 is Battlefield. EVERYTHING can be destroyed in that game (or rather could before it was recently completely shut down by EA). Each class had meaning and a role to fulfill, team coordination was important, and snipers provided great support by marking targets, providing supporting fire, and requiring a small amount of coordination from the enemy team to find and eliminate. 

2042 has NOTHING of what makes a battlefield game a battlefield game, and just feels like another generic FPS game much like the competition.",1703311353,1703311353,False,1,0,0.478803008794784546,0,True,False,False

I decided that it had been some time since i played last and thought it would be a great time to come back considering the new Map, Specialist and guns
Biggest mistake of my life, the game still runs like garbage, it still has a 2/10 chance of even starting, loading screens are still absolutely rediculously long, the game is still clunky to play, still has no ALL CHAT (which is blasphemy in a BF game but i guess the devs thought words on a screen actually harm people) and the game is still a downgrade from BFV in its gameplay and overall visuals.
This game is still a mess and its even more unstable than its EVER been.

Looks great, sounds great, feels good to play, and has enough in-game content to keep playing for.

Matches flow well on most of the maps (especially after the reworks) and the official game modes are as fun as they always are in a Battlefield game; not to mention the community game modes and classic maps offered on Portal.

Could there be more? Absolutely, with some shortcomings being more obvious than others.

For example, 2042 has a ""story,"" the premise of which is intuitive to pick apart by just playing the game and listening to the US/Russian announcers. But if you want to know more about the lore, you have to read it, which most people aren't going to do because they bought a game, not a book. Without a campaign to tie all the lore together in an immersive and engaging way, the settings and contexts of the multiplayer maps feel disjointed. Which is a shame because a little bit of emotional stock in the matches could add so much more.

Regardless, the majority of the many things that this game DOES has to offer are satisfying, and that's what's important.

Many (though not all) of the negative reviews are from people who unfortunately prefer to be angry for the sake of it and to brood with the like-minded, rather than from a place of honest criticism. 2042's flaws are often over-exaggerated, so take the naysaying with a grain of salt.",1703224734,1703224734,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game introduces a fresh perspective, exciting innovations, and an incredibly immersive gameplay experience.
One standout feature is the stunningly realistic graphics and attention to detail. Virtual landscapes come alive under the influence of dynamic environmental destruction, creating a genuine sense of chaos on the battlefield. The weapons and vehicles are meticulously crafted, contributing to an authentic feel throughout the game.
The new specialization system and adaptable maps add strategic depth, allowing players to tailor their combat style. Engaging in massive battles on expansive maps enhances the overall scale and epic nature of the gaming experience.
Another notable aspect of Battlefield 2042 is its focus on social aspects of multiplayer. The ""Portal"" mode allows players to create custom scenarios using elements from previous Battlefield titles, injecting nostalgia and diversity into the gameplay.
I want to commend the developers for their ongoing support and updates. Regular patches addressing issues and improving game balance demonstrate a commitment to the player community.
In summary, Battlefield 2042 is an excellent addition to the legendary series, bringing a breath of fresh air to the multiplayer shooter genre. I highly recommend it to both genre enthusiasts and longtime Battlefield fans!",1668934023,1703173397,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I manage to play the last chapter of the Battle of Nordvik, seriously the game itself is full of cheaters. Every single match there's always one of em. Maybe EA might wanna up the ante of their anticheat software.

Bug you say? I've encounter them abit, my last team deathmatch game ended up losing because I can't find my gun. The gun itself won't show up on my screen, I can still shoot but the gun itself is now invisible with my hand floating holding magical air killing machine. The weapon balance seems kinda weird, i don't know if I suck at it but probably maybe I suck at it because using AT to damage a tank or even APC seems like throwing a rock at them. It just feel not worth the effort. AT are supposed to make the tank/apc/light vehicle afraid to go in alone, charging the enemy position without any troop support but hey now you don't have to. 

Then there's the elephant in the room. The battlepass system. If this is a free to play game then yeah sure throw in the battlepass system. Some of us might want that custom skin or even a new shade of camo or even a weapon charm. Sure they hand out some of free of charge but seriously charging more on a full-paid game and charge even more for a battlepass system? Wow I mean since when those accounting guys get to decide which feature is important to be implemented into the game?.

I'm seriously glad I got this game at an extremely reduced price but even then I still have my buyers remorse. Seriously what are you guys thinking? This ain't COD. Just give us generic soldier and a standard class system. Sure you've implemented the class system now but for me it's just too late. Hope you guys really learn the lesson this time but then again it's EA at the helm. For them it's either money or bust. 

Edit 09/03/2023 - After the glorious review by commentator on fb I decided to give this game another chance, maybe they really did fix it but alas I can't even launch the game. It decided to launch its own app instead of using steam and somehow it can't sync the save file and thus decided not to launch the game. Goob job guys really great job there.

Edit (2) - Manage to actually start the game but now it's stuck at the intro video constantly looping endlessly. Good job there. Excellent, such game, much wow.

Edit (3) - Played through the fifth season, still some bug IE invisible vehicle, cant load every time i press the continue button. The community playlist is seriously open, only 2 player playing it and I'm one of em.

Edit 20/12/2023 - Since its holiday season I try to give it another chance. Looks like they manage to fix the game this time for real. Haven't found any game breaking bug and the annoying click to continue seems to be working this time. Before every time i clicked the to continue button it will stop responding and i had to exit the game through task manager. Good job but still would i recommend, yeah if its on sale but they sure did take their time. Just like gaben said, delayed is ok but sucks is forever. Right now its sucks, theres not much destruction heck even the final has much more destruction than a game with tank and airplane.",1673417890,1703078611,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels like battlefield to me, it plays well. I haven't encountered any overt hackers yet, which is why i stopped playing BFV. Maybe the game was different when it was first released, but it seems pretty solid to me. I am STOKED I got it on sale, and I'm having a blast.

*Updated after 45 hours of play* 
I'm still loving the base game and I'm glad I didn't buy the battlepass or super deluxe edition. If you are halfway decent at FPS games you can unlock everything just by playing, I don't care at all about skins, it's a first person game except when you are dead and look at your body. If you have money to burn and are impatient, go for it, but for most people it's just unnecessary.

This game does have a slightly different feel than the other battlefield games, it's faster paced because of grappling hook dude and wingsuit dude. But overall it still feels like battlefield. It PLAYS like battlefield, the mechanics I enjoy are still there. Some guns are better than others, but most are pretty reliable. The default glock sidearm has a burst fire mode, it's awesome, I can saw down groups of enemies in ambushes. I like the differing classes with special abilities.

I understand a lot of people who purchased the game at launch might be salty if the game wasn't up to par then, I can't speak for that. The game RIGHT NOW, I'm having a blast. For me it's mindless team deathmatch 24/7. I don't care about any other mode. It's fantastic TDM. I haven't encounter a single 120-0 cheater in 45 hours of play. I'm not saying people don't cheat, people always find a way in online games. But it's nowhere near as overt as in BFV or others. I am really enjoying this game.

*200+ hour update*
I definitely have encountered a few obvious cheaters, but it's still significantly fewer than previous battlefield games. The matchmaking works well at this point, I usually don't have to wait more than 20 seconds or so for a match. 

Pro tip, if you want to quickly unlock weapons, start a solo conquest game with AI set to beginner on the map redacted. It's easy to get well over 150 kills in one round, it will unlock new weapons and attachments SUPER fast. I had already unlocked about 75% of the weapons, but once I figured out the solo conquest I was unlocking like 3 new weapons PER GAME. It's not necessary to unlock everything, but it helps for certain guns that are weak.
after 200+ hours I still really enjoy the game. I bought the game on sale for $9.99 I think and in the end I spent $20 on cosmetics, which bought me 2 uniforms for Falk, I usually play support. I really don't mind spending a little on microtransactions as the game is really fun for me.

The game runs REALLY smoothly too. I'm not sure if it's specifically because of DLSS, but the frame rate never dips.",1697927858,1702937583,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yet even now we get negative ratings for a few reasons of unusual nature. The main issue others and myself have been experiencing, are the occasional lag / stutters which make your smooth aim snap across from the target and when combined with the method the game uses for hooking your cursor, it can be an unsatisfactory moment for many. The other major issue which my friends and I have been experiencing are the endless amount of low level cheaters. If these factors are overlooked by yourself, then the game will offer no more than the good old battlefield experience. Beware of the helicopter mains 

7.5/10

---------  xx/02/23  --------

Revising my initial review, I would like to emphasise the magnitude of the main issues. The biggest issue by far are the vehicles which you are unable to counter unless you are specialised in vehicle destruction which would take away your ability to efficiently kill enemies.

Helicopters are in fact where the main balancing issues lie, other vehicles are on the edge of balanced from what I've seen.

The other great issue is the aim assist on console... The aim assist is effectively aimbot and requires zero skill from the player as it traces the enemies inhuman-like. Yet when you turn off  cross-play, you will be unable to find a lobby of 128 pc players.

currently sitting at  8 / 10  due to the specialist change which is exceptionally well implemented.

The game is cheater infested and the gameplay is not fun. Do not buy this game.

I have fun playing with friends, and they are returning. More of a hopefull game than it was at launch.

I am glad DICE not even have announed a new game yet. It will change, but it feels good with a game they do fix and support.

From the moment I attempted to launch the game, it became abundantly clear that DICE and EA had dropped the ball on this one.

The most frustrating aspect of Battlefield 2042 is the abysmal loading screen problem. It's not an occasional inconvenience; it's a pervasive and infuriating obstacle that plagues every attempt to enjoy the game. Waiting times are excruciatingly long, and the promised seamless experience is nothing more than a distant dream. It's unfathomable that such a basic component of gaming – launching the game – could be so fundamentally flawed.

The loading screens are not only time-consuming, but they also serve as a stark reminder of the lackluster optimization that went into this title. The game stutters and stumbles its way through the loading process, leaving players wondering if they'll ever get to experience the actual gameplay without interruption.

Adding insult to injury, when players do manage to overcome the loading screen ordeal, they are often greeted with a myriad of other issues. The gameplay itself is riddled with bugs, glitches, and frame rate drops that further detract from any enjoyment that might be salvaged. It's clear that Battlefield 2042 was rushed to market, sacrificing quality for a premature release.

One would expect a AAA title like Battlefield 2042 to have undergone rigorous testing and optimization before hitting the shelves, but the current state of the game suggests otherwise. This is not an acceptable standard for a franchise with such a rich history and a loyal fan base.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042's laundry list of technical shortcomings, particularly the egregious loading screen problems and the overall issue with launching the game, make it impossible to recommend. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this broken mess of a game until the developers address these issues – if they ever do.",1702792311,1702792311,False,1,0,0.516806721687316895,2,True,False,False

Wanted to wait some time until EA/Dice could at least get a few patches in before the holiday season. At the moment I just can't recommend people playing this game unless they have absolutely nothing better to do. I will continue to log hours but without some major changes it will probably be put on the shelf until it gets to a more enjoyable state.

Lots of people will give the lack of ""legacy"" features as reasons they hate the game. But really people can live with no scoreboard and other quality of life issues in the short term if the rest of the product is good. Sadly the bad launch, numerous bugs, poor map design and poor performance are the main reasons for the reducing player base.

Specialist is a nice idea but no one asked for it however it does lead to some interesting game play but some of the less useful ones need some balancing or tweaks to that system all together.

Things I like:
128 players (I thought I would gravitate to 64 player servers but keep going back to the chaos that is 128)
Visuals
Gun Play (still some hit reg issues but that was massively improved)
Gun Balance (last patch they got this mostly right, most if not all guns are viable need some tweaks still)
Portal

Things I don't like:
Tornado/Dynamic weather - Do not believe the extent in which they planned for dynamic weather was worth the pursuit
Performance - Clearly needs optimization, very CPU intensive. Even close to min specs you will need a good CPU/Memory combination to get ~40fps on low. I was running a 1080TI + Ryzen 5 3600 and would get about ~55fps on low, 40fps on ultra. Now running 1080TI + Ryzen 7 5800x and get 90fps on low which is at least acceptable.
Maps - I think this has been mentioned a lot, if you are into infantry play most of the maps are not every enjoyable. 
Dice/EA Misled - Based on all of the hype for the game, the actual experience really doesn't match the cinematic videos they released leading up to the release of the game
No VOIP yet - This seems like a critical day 1 need... 

Will update my review down the road if they improve.

WARNING If you have mental health issues regarding being prone to anger or rage, do not play this game. As someone who sucks at PC and deals with anger issues, and has broken things as a result, this game is an anger trigger and WILL cause anger episodes for you.

This is by far one of the worst games I've ever played. DO NOT BUY unless it is on sale for $10 or less. The programming in this is $10 programming at best. 

The entirety of this game is absolutely horrible and is just a maddening experience. For your mental health, I do not recommend this game at all unless you want to play solo/coop with bots. The foundation of this game allows players to have games where they are 40-0, 50-0, 60-0, and higher. The balance of vehicles to anti-vehicle weaponry is INSANE. DICE has said ""they're happy with the state of the little bird too"" - Jesus are you kidding me?!! DICE has created an environment where vehicles ESPECIALLY pilots can go uncontested with no deaths and it's a turkey shoot for them due to the nature of the programming of vehicles and aircraft. Any anti vehicle or anti aircraft weaponry are WEAK and INEFFECTIVE. This design is ON PURPOSE. DICE purposely designed this game to be this way. Again, the foundation for this game is so toxic and damaging to one's mental health, ESPECIALLY compared to older Battlefields, that I do not recommend playing this game.

I highly recommend not supporting EA or DICE anymore after this. 

Update as of Oct 2023
Don't believe all this hype and propaganda about how ""Dice has put so much effort into making battlefield great"" and ""now it's awesome"". It's the exact same as it was at launch minus some bugs LOL. The same substantial amount of exploits and hacking as BF5, DICE + the streamers that they pay are just trying to push a narrative to get more money.

----------------------------------------------------
Initial launch 

Is this playable as others have said? Yes. 
Does that mean it's good? No. 
It isn't battlefield that's for sure. This game has definitely lost its identity. The corner cutting in development and graphics, the features and QOL detriments Dice has made which deviate from Bad Company and BF4 are egregiously obvious. 

You'll run, maybe see someone and kill them, then die. It's the same trading mechanism over and over. You show up on the map, you die. You fire, you die.


Not many people use LMGs b/c they don't have a use in this. You're not going to be able to sit in a position and fire on people b/c as soon as you fire...multiple people see you or you get sniped. 

The vehicles are quite awful. Dice made an explicit focus of being vehicle centric in this version of battlefield, but what they neglected was the opposite side of using vehicles - destroying them. Shooting a vehicle with a rocket (aka recoiless rpg) and hitting yields ""Vehicle Damage 20xp"". Okay...so how much damage? Every shot is 20xp. That's it. 

One awful aspect about Bf4 was the flying exploits - aka the jets, little birds, and attack helis that could easily evade AA and rack up dozens of kills with very low, to no deaths. And this version is no different. A decent pilot is invincible. Doesn't matter if you use a recoiless, AA, the LIS...you get that stupid 20xp message for a hit and they just keep on going. 

I don't understand how such an obvious train wreck happens after BF5 then BF1...now this.",1672188719,1702775643,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Upon initial writing of this review I said there appeared to be a lack of teamplay and I still partially stand by this. While one could argue that the lack of class restrictions led to less teamplay, on the other hand one could argue that it can lead to more teamplay as you could pick whatever, do your thing, but still help out and not feel forced to play a Support character because everyone chose to play Assault and you're running low on ammo constantly. I've always been a Support and Recon main in previous BF entries. Infinite ammo and long range was my thing. This is a major change up of what was a CORE mechanic of the game, and I'm not sure if I agree with this. People say this will lead to more teamwork. Will it? I'm a Ammo man and Recon main, always have been. You CAN'T force me to play Medic or Engineer in ANY BF game, I play those when I want to, not at the request of anyone. You'll have to put class limit restrictions to stop me, like in BFBC2 with Recon limits, which didn't stop me from playing Assault and using a DMR or shotgun w/ slugs, while sitting at the back of the base. The decision to lock gadgets/throwables/specialists back to classes will only do one thing for me, and that is to make me play everyone EVEN LESS. Before, I could help destroy tanks and harass vehicles AND keep everyone topped up on ammo. Play as McKay, get to elevated places and resupply teammates who ran out of ammo. Irish APS for cover, repair tool to keep vehicles alive or set up a defensive position while capturing objectives and provide resupplies. Now? I'm not abandoning infinite ammo to destroy tanks. You may think ""wow, you don't seem like a team player"". Believe what you want but I'm an infinitely better Support player than you or most players will ever be, infinite ammo is my life. Hell, I've done more teamplay as an Assault player than 90% of assault players in BF4 by just reviving people. Quite frankly, I don't care about the team. Its a byproduct of me enjoying what I do which is having infinite ammo, and to shoot stuff. Jack-of-all-trades, master of none. I'd much rather be a master of my craft than a jack-of-all-trades. Limiting this freedom back to the four classes while still having Specialists is a weird move. I will continue to prioritize [b]MY OWN FUN FIRST[/b] before teamplay. Find someone else to assist you in destroying tanks because YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO PLAY FOR THE TEAM. PERIOD.               

So anyway what are my general thoughts? As just a SHOOTER game, its satisfactory at best and I personally don't mind it, now that they've fixed a fair few issues and we're finally into Season 1 which took way too long. But as a BATTLEFIELD game, the hate train has left the station. In my opinion, had they called this game anything but Battlefield, hell call it Battlefield Heroes 2 since there already was a BF Heroes game, I would've been okay with it, but as a BF vet, this game has lost its identity. Battlefield was NEVER a hero shooter. It was NEVER a direct competitor to CoD. Only Post-BFBC2 ""vets"" call it a CoD competitor. Battlefield is its own thing NOT TO BE COMPARED. It didn't NEED to copy other games. Battlefield had its own identity, and tossed it away to appeal to god-knows-who and that was a mistake.

I won't go into details since literally every single person has talked about this game at this point. Because this game is now basically a hero shooter, teamwork more or less goes out the door. Despite the fact that ANYONE can revive (for all you dumb mofos, yes, you, playing Casper or whatever, can also revive SQUAD MATES) majority of the dumbasses in this game don't, either because they're braindead and don't realize ANYONE can revive squadmates or are too busy focusing on ""being #1"". Now that's not to say people don't revive, as I've been revived many times, but there have been MANY occasions where I die in cover, the area is safe, and MANY suitable people (support/squadmates) run by me as if I don't exist. This is the general mentality of BF2042, everyone for themselves. I don't need a Support player, I can just play Angel, I can bring my own ammo, I can pick up dropped ammo. I don't need a medic, I can just bring medbags, or I can play Falk. I don't need Engineer, lemme grab my launcher/repair tool while playing Angel. Recon? Lemme just get my sniper rifle, medbag, and play Angel, infinite ammo, health, and I can sit back at base and snipe. Teamwork is essentially gone. Vehicles? Pfffttt, who needs an Engineer or repair tool, my vehicle has a built in repair system anyways. It goes both ways, having this freedom CAN lead to more teamwork but it can also lead to less teamwork. It flip-flops from game to game.

While this sort of freedom to make almost whatever loadout you want is cool, it takes away what makes a BF game a BF game. Which is why I think if they called this game anything else (and slap ""made by the devs of BF"" on it) or even BF Heroes 2, I think it would've been a better decision which would've likely led to a better reception. The launch obviously was complete garbage and inexcusable, but once again, not here to talk about that, I'm talking about the core experience. At least that would at worst get a mixed rating IMO.

When they introduced Season 1, a new character with a player controlled MANPAT/MANPAD was added. It's like the SRAW from BF4 (closer to TV missile really) or the AT-4 from BFBC2. Except, because this rocket launcher is specific to the character and is a ""special ability"" you actually have INFINITE USE. You used up both rockets? Sit around and wait for the cooldown to replenish those rockets automatically. IMO this adds to the ""play for yourself"" mentality. Why go frontlines when I can just sit back and spam infinite guided rockets.

This game is by far the weakest entry of any Battlefield game if you can even call it a Battlefield game. ""Oh but Hardline exists"". Well, at least Battlefield Hardline had the SPIRIT of Battlefield, literally the only thing it was missing was the MILITARY theme. Outside of that, Hardline was more Battlefield than BF2042. Hardline was essentially a reskinned BF4. Thanks to DICE LA/Visceral or whatever they're called now. The same people who worked on Battlefield Portal which is about the only truly good thing about BF2042. They are the real heroes here.

They failed with this game and they've hurt the franchise. I'm concerned for the future of the BF franchise and what lies ahead because of this.

To sum up my general thoughts, if you overlook that this was supposed to be a Battlefield game, and treat it as ""some generic FPS game"", I honestly don't hate it. I'm somewhat neutral and my bar is fairly low for shooters. If its got guns that I like, good enough for me. Obviously there's more to it than that but you get the idea, I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to shooters. BUT AS A BATTLEFIELD GAME, you've seen the feedback from many others. I came for a BF experience that they advertised this as a ""love letter to fans"", but its more of a divorce letter.

Will I stop playing this game? Nah. Like I said above, if I ignore that this was supposed to be a Battlefield game, and just play it as ""just another FPS game"", its fine for me (huffing some copium), but for anyone looking for a [b]Battlefield experience[/b], go back to previous entries, this might not be worth it.

 to the vehicles dominating the whole battlefield!! To hazard zone sucking completely balls, with no depth at all and to compared this to hunt showdown or tarkov is literally a joke. this should have been delayed an other 6 months to a year. but this is what happens when EA tries to appease to all players and not its core BF players.


Update 2 years later the game is in a better state. Feels more like a battlefield game finally but the price is still buns. put it on your wishlist so when it goes on sale. Full price not worth imo 

all the problems that plagued the game seem to be gone for the most part like invisible walls, unable to revive players if close to terrain or walls, not able to snipe people out of air vics, a real scoreboard an squads plus voice chat. so much was lacking in the begining is why this got such a bad review.

After the lengthy download, I fired up a game to play with my squad, while they could all join, I could not, due to being unable to connect to the EA servers.

I could try and raise this as a support issue, but anybody who has tried that with EA will know that you're not going to get anything useful.  There is something fundamentally incompatible with my computer and the game, and that's it.  So a refund for me.

- The lack of a story would not have been much of an issue for BF1 or BFV, but in the case of BF2042, the setting can no longer provide the story in and of itself, as it is entirely made-up. This, in combination with the fact that it is character-focused, serve to render the setting rather shallow and un-immersive.
- The inclusion of ""heroes"" makes the game feel quite alien from other Battlefield titles. Having 5 clones of yourself running past you definitely does not help immersion. It also prevents people from expressing themselves using a style they enjoy, instead forcing them to use whatever styles are available for their particular specialist.
- The maps are pretty lifeless and lack cover in a lot of crucial ways. Map traversal and positioning relies too heavily on unique specialist abilities that ""situational metas"" often dominate. Going back to the setting, though I doubt this is actually the case, it almost feels like the ""climate change has destroyed the world"" backstory served more as an excuse for making maps that consisted of muddy hellscapes littered with a few assets than it did as a genuine plot point. The new map (Redacted) is polarizing but I find it to be a step in the right direction in terms of map variety.
- The movement system (""geometry traversal?"") is extremely inconsistent and a big step down from BFV. You will often find your character failing to step over a 2-inch-tall rock without explicitly hitting the jump button. This makes movement in general quite difficult to rely on for positioning and leads to a lot of frustrating deaths.
- Voice chat is never used both because it literally does not work half of the time and because a lot of the players are on console. ""All chat"" is disabled by default, meaning that most people will not see your messages even if their text chat is visible in the first place. It is essentially impossible to coordinate anything without talking on a 3rd-party channel such as a Discord call.
- The party system can be buggy and often puts you in different squads, though I have not seen this happening nearly as much with the latest patch.
- Though the game doesn't feel over-monetized in the sense that it doesn't constantly push you towards microtransactions, the cosmetics that are available are generally pretty lame and also horrendously expensive, which really does not make them desirable in any way.
- The soundtrack sounds like it was made by a dollar store-variety Hans Zimmer. Calling it a soundtrack at all is a bit generous.

That being said, here are the reasons I am recommending the game anyway:
- There are virtually no cheaters, whether because they monitor reports or because the anticheat is much better. I've played for 200 hours and I've seen only 2 or 3 obvious cheaters.
- Though the specialist system certainly can lead to metas arising in certain situations, and some specialists are genuinely just not very good, I also find that people just play what they want to play, and it's actually pretty rare to see a large amount of people all playing a similar build.
- The addition of PvE modes is actually, in my opinion, a great one; there are certainly complaints to be made about the AI itself, but the fact that the game will never be completely unplayable, even when there is only one player online, is actually awesome.
- The gunplay is great and most of the weapons are pretty balanced. People complain a lot about various weapons from time to time but they are usually balanced over time.
- The specialist gadgets do lead to some very entertaining situations. I do wish that these were just generic subclasses rather than ""heroes"" though. I also like the idea of allowing any class to use any primary/secondary but giving bonuses to the ""suggested"" weapon types.

Overall, I would not buy this game for full price, but on a good sale it's worth it. Just remember that if you're a veteran Battlefield player, you might be disappointed with how much the game mechanics deviate from other installments.",1702528561,1702528561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EA took a good look at COD and incorporated a lot of their gameplay mechanics. Many things that made Battefield Battlefield, now feel like COD Warzone. Why would I pay to get something that I could get for free woth COD WZ?

Also: the players' mentality is just BS in this game, not playing their role and only thinking about own stats, even if it means losing a game? Sad, sad, sad.

After BF4 I swore never to buy BF ever again since EA pushes games out even if they are mostly unfinished. Thinking after 2yrs + they'd have it right by now I can see my mistake after a good week.

Honestly, this ain't that bad of a game, I've been having TONS  of fun with this! :D 
Large scale battles are what draw me to Battlefield and this one delivers as always, and when I don't feel like thinking too much, Redacted shows up as a alternative within the same game!

Personally I like the specialist system, HOWEVER, I'm not attached to any of them (see line about needing a campaign), and I've love to see a tweak where the specialists more cosmetic (make it so we can swap abilities/tools/etc)

It's not a trash game.
It just doesn't have any players.
Every normal mode has empty servers for the NA side of the game.

They're on the other team. And the entirety of your team and their team is all AI Bots.
Bad launch, and other problems killed the game before it really had a chance to live. 
Unfortunate. However, because of this. No one plays. So, please don't waste your time or money purchasing this game.
There is no campaign, and the multiplayer (The only other mode)  Is borderline completely dead.
No hate. Love battlefield. Just wish people played this game so I can actually make a review where I recommend you buy it.
Not the case however.
If you're looking for a game that is similar to this one and basically the same, but just different. Purchase Battlefield 4

I bought it on sale for like 5 bucks, and that has to be one of the best purchases i've made for that price. The game's actually really fun now, and there's a pretty decent amount of content. They added the classes back!! Also leaderboards, more guns, maps, a ton of unlocks that you get by playing the game (not sure what's new though), and a lot of paid cosmetics in the store. 

I was worried about the battlepass, but it appears to be one of those that give you enough currency to get the next one. I think there's only a couple operators and weapons locked behind the elite upgrade ($$), but the base game is great by itself. There's kind of a lot here to do from infantry focused game modes to GOOD OL' battlefield all-out-war game modes. You can even find those 24/7 meat grinder servers on the ""Portal"" (custom lobbies with modifiers, some have bots, some have game modifiers). 


The operator skills are pretty fun and support a lot of different playstyles. One cool thing is that every 1st weekend of the month is 2x XP. It's for sure worth $30-$40 if you can grab it on sale. (There used to be a handful of sub $10 sales for 2042). Oh, also the maps range from fantastic to decent, with a couple of them being some of my favorite BF maps in recent memory.


Edit: I do kinda have an issue with weapon cosmetics. I'm not the biggest BF fan, I only played 3, 4, and 2042, but thoroughly loved each (2042 less, but still). So I know the camos usually try to stay realistic within reason, but dude 90% of the camos here are so bland and ""safe"".

To me, it still feels like a Battlefield game, but I'm not sure how Battlefield vets feel about it because primary weapons are no longer locked to classes. You can run an LMG on any class now if you want. Recon is no longer entirely synonymous with sniper rifles. Each class gets some minor perks with those weapons, but none of the perks really completely outweigh not going with something else if you wanted to.

I also find it kind of weird that Assault kinda feels like BF4's Support and Support feels like BF4's Assault. I'd honestly like to see Ammo crates given to both Support and Assault to even out that weird feeling. I want to be the big dude with the big gun who gives out ammo again without feeling like I'm forced to be a field medic babysitter with the defib.

Also I really fucking hate the AI soldiers. To anyone who hasn't bought the game yet, if matches aren't full yet the game places AI bots in the match to make the game seem more populated. They're not hard to fight (they're actually super easy if you have any one-tap-headshot weapon) but they're like, omniscient to placed equipment and it gets annoying when I think I pull a massive flank on Redacted and die and then I watch some robot walk around the corner, magically sense all my equipment, and then shoot it all when, in comparison, I've seen real players who are leagues better than me be absolutely blind to my T-UGS and respawn beacon sitting literally inches away from them. Like no real players have gone out of their way to destroy my equipment until they've realized it was causing problems. But the AI bot players do it automatically if they have line of sight to any of it. It sucks.

Plus the AI soldiers give away my position to real players, whether I'm shooting them or they're shooting me, so I kill a bot thinking ""alright cool"" and then a real player suddenly has access to my red dot on the minimap, where as without that AI soldier it would've been a fair fight between me and him and I may have had the jump on him. It's not the same as shooting a real player. Like, if I'm 2v1 and I kill one guy I think ""alright, cool, I got at least one of them in that fight."", but if I'm 2v1 and one of them is a bot, and I kill the bot first and die to the other guy, I can only think ""Man, if only that bot wasn't there, I probably would've killed the real person."" Which is kind of what I'm here to do in this [b] PLAYER* vs *PLAYER* [/b] first person shooter game.

I still like this game, but [u] please please please please please [/u] limit the effectiveness of AI soldiers. Nothing about them is 100% good. There needs to be a hard limit of like, a single squad of them per team. And they should be in their own squad. I don't want to see a squadmate down and go to save him only to realize I revived a bot instead of my other real non-squad teammates nearby.",1702278963,1702278963,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DICE and Electronic Arts have managed to turn what was once a hallmark series for immersive and engaging multiplayer experiences into a prime example of how not to release a game.

The first and most glaring issue is the woeful state of the game at launch. Battlefield 2042 arrived riddled with bugs, glitches, and an astonishing lack of polish. The game's developers seemingly forgot that a smooth launch is crucial for player enjoyment. From constant crashes to game-breaking bugs, it felt like I was participating in a beta test rather than playing a finished product.

The lack of a traditional single-player campaign was a bold move, but the promised focus on a robust multiplayer experience failed to materialize. The much-touted ""All-Out Warfare"" mode felt more like ""All-Out Chaos"" due to the glaring imbalance in the game's design. Maps are sprawling but lack the intricate design that made previous Battlefield titles shine. The absence of a coherent narrative made the battles feel disconnected and meaningless, leaving players without a sense of purpose beyond mindless shooting.

Moreover, the introduction of specialists instead of traditional classes added an unnecessary layer of complexity and disrupted the delicate balance that previous games in the series had achieved. The removal of fan-favorite features like levolution and the absence of iconic Battlefield moments made the experience feel generic and uninspired.

The decision to rely heavily on a battle pass and microtransactions for in-game content is a blatant cash grab that further sours the gaming experience. The progression system feels tedious and unfulfilling, pushing players towards spending real money for cosmetic items that should have been included with the base game.

Lastly, the lack of meaningful post-launch support and the sluggish response to community feedback have left Battlefield 2042 feeling abandoned and unsupported. Promised updates and fixes have been slow to materialize, leaving players stuck with a broken and unfulfilling experience.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 stands as a testament to how mismanagement, a rushed release, and a disregard for the core elements that made the franchise great can lead to the downfall of a beloved gaming series. Save your money and avoid this disaster of a title at all costs.",1702275388,1702275388,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Specifically there is a game mode called Breakthrough which is essentially DICE taking Rush and Conquest and combining them into a new, fun experience. 

I know this game has gotten a bad rep in the BF community at small and the mainstream gaming community at large because of its jacked state of launch, but it shows how much DICE has worked on bringing this game to a much more enjoyable, familiar state while being fresh and fun for those who have spent tens of hundreds of hours into games like BF3 and BadCo2.

One thing that does make me sad is that the Easy Anti-Cheat has basically made this game impossible to natively run on the Steam Deck (Windows is required to run the Anti-Cheat software), and EA does not seem like they are much interested in making their online games compatible with Proton/SteamOS. This game plays far better on M+K anyways, but the option would have been nice.

Overall, get this game on sale for like 10 bucks or less, or try it out through EA Play which is 5 bucks a month. It is a well made game and a lot of fun, but squads are kind of unstable and it's a bit ludicrous to pay 60 bucks for a game that has micro-transactions, season passes, and really only works on Windows computers and requires the EA launcher on top of it all. Ten years ago this practice was quasi-acceptable, but in 2023 F2P games have gotten a lot better to justify those kinds of business practices. Still a fun game and if you like Battlefield, you will like this game, but just don't fall for the full price tag imo.",1702253957,1702253957,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first I didn’t like it but I got used to it and I guess they will sort out the bugs and they will be adding more weapons and stuff soon. A lot of reviewers have very few playtime hours, so they should play a little more for a more objective view. All the problems that this game has are fixable so all this hate is really unnecessary. Battlefield games are generally high optimized so if you don’t have a good pc don’t complain about the fps. It’s important that you don’t take into consideration reviews in Youtube and Reddit, but instead play the game yourself to judge it. You can try it on EA play and then see if you’re happy with it or not

I've been a long time battlefield fan so i can't hate the game but I’m as objective as i can be here. Most of the games have issues on launch. Also don’t forget that dice really tries to make things better by working hard to push updates soon at their games releases. I also like the idea of twitter communication so we’ll be able to know anytime we log into the game the changes they’re trying to do and the problems they plan to fix. The classes in this game are really fun except the medic and you can have a good time playing either if you’re alone, or with friends. Most of my playtime was alone and I didn’t get bored. 

Hazard zone is a nice battle royale and different from the others. You choose a specialist and it enables you to buy gear with credits from previous games and even if you lose you get rewarded. Portal enables you to play with armies from BF2042, BFBC2 and BF3 with the maps from these games as well, which I find pretty awesome!

It's become something of a tradition to come back and see how many bugs have been fixed since launch in games that I've previously played, to ensure that the reviews I've left are still valid and fair:

NOTHING HAS BEEN FIXED. Liz's rocket launcher still causes the camera to get stuck in the floor. This issue ALONE has been a known issue for over a year, and is one of the playable character's CORE SKILLS. 

They should be offering Cyberpunk 2077 style refunds, not begging for the ""Labor of love"" when they've literally only added more paid skins to the game instead of fixing CORE GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS LIKE ABILITIES BUGGING OUT or the CONSTANT CRASHING.

May Dice burn down, with everyone in it.

If you're into this kind of game and are let down by how bad battlefield has become, or just want an FPS that actually FUNCTIONS

Here's a few recommendations:

Battlebit Remastered

Planetside 2

Enlisted

Caliber

Call of Duty (Yes, it's actually better taken care of than battlefield has been thus far.)

DICE has once again shattered the boundaries of the first-person shooter genre with their latest masterpiece, ""Battlefield 2042."" As the gaming world eagerly awaited its release, the game proved itself to be a breathtaking leap into the future, redefining both the scale of battle and the limits of innovation.

Set in a near-future world scarred by climate crisis and geopolitical upheaval, ""Battlefield 2042"" presents a grim yet captivating backdrop for its intense battles. The attention to detail in the game's environments is awe-inspiring, showcasing the devastating consequences of unchecked climate change while seamlessly integrating them into the game-play dynamics. From flooded cityscapes to desolate desert landscapes, each map is a masterpiece in itself, setting the stage for epic warfare that spans continents.

What truly sets ""Battlefield 2042"" apart is the revolutionary ""All-Out Warfare"" game mode. With up to 128 players engaging in battles of unprecedented scale, the chaos unfolds on an unparalleled level. The sheer scope of the battles is jaw-dropping; watching fighter jets scream overhead, tanks rumble through urban warzones, and infantry engage in close-quarters combat creates an immersion that was previously unimaginable. The game's cutting-edge technology ensures that the battles are not only massive but also incredibly detailed, with destruction rendering environments dynamically as bullets fly and explosives detonate.

The hallmark of the Battlefield series – destruction – reaches new heights in 2042. Virtually every structure in the game is destructible, from skyscrapers to shacks. This elevates strategy to a whole new level; there's nothing quite like collapsing a building on enemy forces or blasting open new routes through the map with a well-placed rocket.

""Battlefield 2042"" introduces the ""Specialist"" system, a departure from traditional classes. This change injects a fresh dynamic into game-play by allowing players to customize their load-outs with a primary weapon, secondary weapon, gadget, and unique trait. The result is a remarkable degree of personalization, encouraging players to experiment and adapt their play-styles. It's a move that's sure to be divisive among veterans, but one that undeniably adds depth and innovation to the experience.

Visually, ""Battlefield 2042"" is a stunning achievement. The level of detail, from character models to weather effects, is a testament to the developers' commitment to pushing the boundaries of graphical fidelity. Combined with a dynamic weather system that can turn the tide of battle in an instant, the game maintains an immersive realism that keeps players on the edge of their seats.

However, no game is without its flaws. ""Battlefield 2042's"" launch was not without technical hiccups, which slightly marred the initial experience. Server issues and occasional bugs did lead to frustration, but DICE's commitment to rapid fixes and updates demonstrated their dedication to delivering a polished product.

In the end, ""Battlefield 2042"" is a triumphant celebration of chaos, innovation, and the sheer scale of modern warfare. With its breathtaking visuals, groundbreaking game-play mechanics, and expansive battles, the game propels the first-person shooter genre into a new era. DICE has once again proven themselves as pioneers in the industry, redefining what players can expect from a multiplayer shooter.

Devs have listened to community feedback, changing the class system to a more classic-Battlefield system, reworked entire maps that were disliked, and added in tons of new and old school weapons.

The time to kill feels just right. Almost every weapon feels good to use, so there's no ""meta"". Some will swear by a few ARs or SMGs, but theres always another weapon in the same class that can perform just as well. Movement is fast and sleek, coupled with sprint-slide-bunny hop even advanced movement enjoyers will find something to work with. 

Outside of the standard 64 or 128 player Conquest modes, there are a plethora of rotating modes weekly you can play to shake things up. Vehicle Supremacy, Air Supremacy, TDM, 8v8, modes like Battlefield Bad Company 2 conquest, etc.

The gunplay is classic battlefield so pretty good, they finally added in squads and scoreboards and stuff, and most importantly we got the classic class based system back (or at least a modified version of it).

If you can get this game at a discount, I'd say it's definitely worth a shot. There's enough players nowadays that you won't have to worry about empty servers, and there's a decent amount content to play with. 

However I think the map design is still pretty flawed. Compared to past Battlefields, the maps were artificially enlarged to support 128 players, however because of that there is a lot of big open areas with no cover whatsoever, and you get shot to death pretty easily (it could also just be a skill issue). 

On top of that the battle pass system is...well there's not much I can say about this. Personally I prefer the old Premium Pass system but in today's climate I think battle passes are inevitable, but at least I don't feel as pressured into paying for microtransactions as compared to other games I guess.

Overall it's a decent game with still some fundamental flaws, but at a discount it's definitely worth a pickup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the original review : 

I don't know what else to say man, I knew it was coming, but this game is probably the biggest disappointment of this year.

Even excluding all the game play changes like the operator system and whatnot, the performance issues are just way too severe. And the thing is, you won't realize it since every reviewer tends to use ultra high ends CPU's to test the game, but the problem is that this game is SEVERELY CPU bottlenecked. Even when everything turned to ULTRA at 3440x1440, my 3080 was only getting 40~50% usage, and my i5 8500 was constantly pegged at 98~100%.

When other battle royale games also have 100 players yet this one runs like absolute crap, you know you fucked up.
And I mean the graphics look nice, but they're not ULTRA REALISTIC or anything. There are other games that have come out this year that manage to run better yet look better.

Putting performance aside, the UI is....atrocious. Who designed the main screen ? Not only is it incredibly low res, doens't stretch out to ultrawide displays, the icons are WAY too big. Same goes for the menu options. Everything is either too blown up or color coded in a way that's hard to notice. This is a joke.

I had my fun in Battlefield portal, but this is a new game, I WANT to play the new mode. Hazard zone so far has been incredibly boring and barrren. All out warfare runs like absolute crap and everyone just gathers around the objectives, which kinda makes the big maps pointless. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend getting this game at its current state. This shouldn't either been delayed for another year or two, or they shouldn't just cut off hazard zone and focused on the other two modes. What an absolute disgrace this game is.

My return to Battlefield 2042 has been met with persistent challenges, as the game struggles to deliver the immersive experience expected from the renowned franchise. Despite the promise of a futuristic setting in 2042, my gameplay has been hindered by a series of issues. Let's delve into the highs and lows of this latest installment.

Graphics and Character Design:
Battlefield 2042 impresses with its heightened graphics and character design. The futuristic setting is visually stunning, with character customization offering a welcomed layer of aesthetic appeal.

Cons:

Map Size and Detail:
The allure of the future is overshadowed by the game's cramped maps, sacrificing diversity for excessive detail. Battlefield 2042's maps feel restrictive, hindering the potential for immersive and expansive gameplay.

Graphics vs. Gameplay:
Despite the visual enhancements, Battlefield 2042 falls into the trap of prioritizing aesthetics over dynamic gameplay. The game struggles to strike a balance, leaving players longing for a more engaging and interactive gaming environment.

Lack of Communication:
Communication breakdowns persist in Battlefield 2042, a stark departure from the series' history. Drawing parallels to Squad's successful communication-centric approach, the absence of effective in-game communication diminishes the overall Battlefield experience.

Player Durability and Class System:
High player durability and an unrestricted class system contribute to frustratingly prolonged firefights and gameplay imbalances. Battlefield 2042 needs to reassess these elements to restore the strategic depth that defines the franchise.

Casual Gameplay:
The game leans into a casual gameplay mindset, neglecting the crucial balance between competition and realism. A faster pace shouldn't sacrifice strategic depth, and Battlefield 2042 could learn from successful titles like Fortnite in finding this equilibrium.

Gameplay Pace:
Battlefield 2042's relentless combat pace leaves little room for quiet moments, creating an exhausting experience. Striking a balance akin to PUBG or Siege would alleviate the intensity and improve overall gameplay satisfaction.

Pros:
Amidst the challenges, Battlefield 2042 shines in its improved graphics and character design, providing players with a visually appealing futuristic battlefield.

Campaign Mode:
One glaring omission is the absence of a campaign mode, a feature that has historically added depth and connection to the Battlefield experience. Reintroducing a well-crafted campaign could bridge the gap between single-player and multiplayer, enhancing overall immersion.

Conclusion:
Battlefield 2042, while visually impressive, grapples with fundamental issues that compromise the overall gaming experience. Addressing map design, communication features, and gameplay balance is essential for the game to reclaim its status as a premier multiplayer title in the Battlefield series.

Update 12/05/23: So 2 years later and here's what I have to say.

This is NOT a *Battlefield* game like that we all once knew and loved. Do not buy this with the intention of jumping reliving *Battlefield* from 2013 or earlier. This is a new era of *Battlefield* built for this generation of players. Progression is easy, matches are fast, and team play is even worse. Think *Fortnite* tried to make a *Battlefield* game and you end up here. The list of negatives for the game is long, even longer if you try to compare it to past games of the franchise so do you research before you but or better... Just click away now and don't.

All that said, I have been playing the game again because I'm one of the unlucky suckers that Pre-Ordered the game back when EA still had somewhat of a reputation. I still don't feel like I've gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of this, and likely won't ever. Game is ok in short bursts (speaking from a Veteran of the franchises POV), but even better if you play the ""Portal"". Think Halo 4 custom games but for *Battlefield*. 

At the end of the day, If you still really want to buy this and can look past the *Battlefield* name as it was. Don't spend more than $25.",1641011675,1701837190,False,4,1,0.501661121845245361,0,True,False,False

From the subtle ad's slipped into the game (oh hi Logitech), lack of 128v128 game modes, this whole thing has been an embarrassment of a game from day one.

Though the gameplay is solid, with gunplay and movement being highlights, it falls short due to engine issues and strange design choices. I wouldn't recommend this to new players and only suggest this to true battlefield fanatics.

Bullet point review:

- This game is a real mixed bag

- Good enough fundamental game-play (retroactive implementation of the class system works, however you can feel the seams)

- There is no such thing as having ""a quick game"" (the loading times are long and plenty)

- Poor balancing (Air vehicles are consistently too powerful, some operators are useless - most a viable. Team balancing is often fair, sometimes god awful)

- No map filters or search! (Most maps are okay, a few good, a few bad with it often depending on the game-mode. The lack of filtering only highlights the bad maps even more, made worse by the loading times)

- Love the gun play and movement! (though the long engagement ranges are frustrating sometimes seeing as many of the maps have long sight lines)

Overall: 
6/10

(Shame that this and Battlefield V were cheated due to both being half-baked on launch, however I suggest BF V for all players as it is now an easy 8/10!)",1694643187,1701806921,False,3,0,0.546590089797973633,0,True,False,False

First: The bug with the Armor Hunter for one of the specialists. From what I have read, this is a long-standing issue in which at random, when you use the armor hunter, you're gonna find that your vehicle camera is now in the middle and below the map for some reason. Even changing sessions and all won't work, you have to restart the game which is ridiculous.

Second: BF2042 has an interesting theme to it. It's good, I like that some of the previous characters were brought in (like Irish from 4) but where the hell is the story? No campaign, no ""hey this is what happened"", just all multiplayer. Which, sure, is fine but then what's the point of having a story to each of the specialists and all these loading quotes? What the hell happened to Hannah? WTF is a No-Pat?!

Third: AI multiplayer matches. This I like, only because it seems to be hard to actually find a match in the late evening/early morning. However, it's a little odd that even if I play on the beginner difficulty in an AI conquest match, I get that same XP as if it was a regular PvP match. Why is this a thing? It's as if instead of grinding for things (as normal multiplayer games go), you're just cheating through by letting people get what they want. In a way.

Fourth: what the hell is this spawn shit outside of the team zone? If you have control over D1 or D2 for example, why do I end up spawning 4 feet away from an enemy tank that's about to run me over?

Fifth: Honestly I should of put this one first but whoever designed the anti-cheat needs a kick in the shin. It's horrible, it's buggy, and it's unstable to all hell. Downloaded the game and it took me 5 hours to figure out why EA AntiCheat is going off and won't let me start the game. Never have cheated in an online match, never paid for any of that crap, but yet God forbid I have Driver Signature enforcement off (previous project I messed with in development, once again not a cheat). Not only that, but the random moments where I have nothing running in the background, all of a sudden the game has to shut down ""because Anticheat has detected a forbidden process to be running"". What process? The damn OS?

I'd say I would like to see some changes but for the 8$ or whatever I got for this game, it's really only worth that much. It's clear that even with that armor hunter glitch being still active after a year, there is no concern for this game and it's stability.",1701803728,1701803728,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OG review:

Enough is enough.

(TLDR - I can't play it all with the newest update. Endless validation loop)

I've tolerated the many issues this game has had and continues to have just to try to capture the nostalgia & enjoyment that DICE products provided in the past with my friends. 

Despite the abysmal launch, horrible changes to the game mechanics that they eventually rolled back on when everyone wanted a refund etc. Not to mention that myself and all my friends with high end gaming PC's practically overheated and wrecked our PC's to play this flaming pile of hot garbage.

Its a shame when indie studios with less resources and staff can do circles around Triple A major studios who drag the lifeless half finished, buggy corpse of a franchise to milk it for every penny. 

Its no wonder tons of players have abandoned this shell of a game to support games like BattleBit Remastered.

- CONS -
-----------
- No idea why the heck they left out a Campaign, it's a huge heart of the BF Game Series and should not have been ignored nor left out at all which was a huge mistake by the devs in almost every way
- Not that many weapons actually
- Not that much customization and needs improved a heck of a lot
- Removed Arsenal Call-Ins Etc such as missles, smoke to bombard areas which was not a smart move at all
- Throwing Grenades etc is just strange and annoying, not sure why devs changed it, bad idea
- Weird random little glitches namely with vehicles
- Rubber-banding meshes and textures that shake
- Not many vehicles per player count, unacceptable, parked vehicles on map should also be drivable
- Still can't slide very well at all yet, another thing that is unacceptable at this point for a game of this style
- Wingsuit isn't on all classes, you have to be Sundance to use it which is misleading since not everyone can use it which just sucks because if all classes had it that would be a lot more interesting and fun
- No Operations or Frontlines Modes which is rather disappointing
- Can be hard to get Kills due to larger maps with more players
- Horrible Lag and performance issues galore, seems to be a problem with each season so far
- I miss the Fortification System from Battlefield V, they should have kept that
- I miss the death animation from Battlefield V, it was a nice touch, calling out while bleeding out
- The game itself is very poorly optimized in nearly every possible way to the point that you pretty much need a jet engine just to run it even if you already have rtx. (I found that having a lot more than 16gb ram helps a ton and appears to be a big cause - bf2042 is extremely heavy on your system ram usage)
- EA/Dice made a really dumb decision to axe the new (2023) Battlefield Mobile that could have been great
- Extremely Rude Teammates and Squadmates that will leave you for dead quite often
- Black Screen constantly after ending a match now all of a sudden since Season 4.


= VERDICT = 
===========
While I do love the game there are a number of obvious issues that plague the game each release and each season sadly although it's certainly often playable. I've been a long time battlefield player and to me it feels more like a war with fully destructable environments unlike other shooter games which no other game has yet to match or create something of the sort better, a few have tried and failed in comparison. However the game in its current state as of Season 2 and now again with Season 3 has become unplayable so I cannot recommend it.",1637590809,1701782303,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DICE:publishing an unfinished garbage and refusing to acknowledge any glitches players encountered and pointed out.Better yet,calling ur diehard players(mainly those angry chads paid 100usd preordered) toxic.

Ironically,the most finished content are BF3,BC2,BF1942 maps in Portal which were deved by OG DICE.

WTF are you guys smoking charging ppl 100usd+ for unfinished products?is that the new normal 3A companies publishing their games?

DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT TO ENCOURAGING THEM CONTINUE FVCKING W/ GAME INDUSTRY!

Now, after playing it for an additional 60hrs, id say pick it up if its on sale. Thumbs up.

The launch was atrocious... We all know what happened. I will give them credit for fixing most things, but there are problems that they cant fix, and things that should not have been present on launch. It's a good game though there is still a lot of ugly. However; I feel like the ugly can largely be ignored or played around.

Here is some ugly.

This game feels more like a tech demo than it does an actual Battlefield game. The amount of AI that can fill your lobbies is a bit much. I find myself in lobbies that are 60%+ filled with AI. Its mostly late at night, unfortunately when i'm able to get my gaming in. So. Lots of AI.
The weather events, theyre just annoying when they come around. They don't add anything to the experience other than your screen gets a glitchy animation, it changes visibility, throws shit around, whatever. It's more of an inconvenience. However, they made this happen less often. I think it should just be gone....
The specialist aspect is... Eh. I think it was dumb to add that in, it definitely stops people from playing as a team as much. You dont find a lot of ammo around. Makes it hard to take down tanks and helis, which are already a little too beefy. A standard loadout wont even take down 1 heavy armor vehicle. And with the upgrades on vehicles, it may take several resupplies to take down ONE vehicle. Specialists do have some cool gadgets. Its nice that they have things that can shake up the gameplay. However, theres really only a few that are meta and actually super useful. Nade spam chick, dude that denies throwables, chick  that has tons of rockets, and a chick that heals and revives like crazy. Theyre like 70% of the choosing. But they really dont add anything to the game other than a way for EA to sell cosmetics. They could have just made them gadgets, which is essentially what it is now. The massive maps is a downside. They were just WAY too open for the amount of players, even when they had the massive lobbies. Just play the smaller player count lobbies. Maps are smaller, it makes it not a running simulator, you can actually make it to more than 2 objectives per game, and keeps combat flowing. They just wanted to show you that they could make huge maps and handle the player count. It means nothing now.

Aside from the things listed above, its a regular battlefield experience. It still isnt better than BF4 or BF1. The gadgets and crap kinda ruin it for most people. They just make it a little Fortnite-y. But it looks good, plays well, runs well (cap your frames), pretty solid. Just... They need to move on to the next game and really redeem themselves.

Im hoping for a BF2142 PURE remake after this. By far the best BF game they've made. Just dont ruin it with unnecessary tech demo shit and goofy changes nobody wanted or was even thinking of.

Get if it's on sale. Like... 50% or more. Games kind of dying but still fun.",1670299163,1701674532,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So it feel repetitive and the same as BF3.

We get a very weak semi-finished product for the full price, only to be repeatedly punched in the face with the in-game store and battlepasses. Additionally, the game design itself is really bad and has nothing to do with the legacy of the Battlefield series, e.g. BF1942, BF2, BF3 and especially BF4.

I would like to refer to a few aspects of the game itself that absolutely repel me as a fan (now ex-fan) of the Battlefield series. First of all, the map design is very bad and bland, straight from some pathetic pubg or other crap. The game has nothing to do with war and is more like arcade crap for children than a large-scale war game. A very small number of maps, as I mentioned earlier, of very poor quality. A small number of weapons with customizations (a fraction of those in BF4). Plus some characters, pseudo customization hidden behind the shop... there is no place for individualism in war! We don't want character names, pseudo-plots (which are idiotic) and other inventions. They are supposed to be soldiers - preferably with a covered face like in BF4 with the option of personalization based on military gear, not idiotic colorful camouflages that have nothing to do with camouflages. And the very idea of ""stateless people"" deserves disciplinary dismissal among DICE employees and humiliates this game. The physics of the game 2 years after the premiere is also a joke, the handling of vehicles and their ""mass"" is a very bad joke.

This isn't Battlefield anymore. This is some pathetic hybrid of pubg, fortnite and call of duty. Nothing remains of this series except the title. The game is absolutely not worth more than a few euros (single digit value). And you certainly shouldn't settle for any in-game stores inside a full-price product.

If I bought this game for more than a ridiculous fraction of a percent, I would demand a refund and a refund of medicines to ""unsee"" this ""abomination"".

Unfortunately, my friends and I have to go back to BF4, Hell Let Loose and ARMA. There's nothing we like about this game. We've been waiting 2 years for this game to be fixed, but it's still a very bad joke and not a Battlefield game. Maybe it's time to take this title away from DICE?

Cons
- Horrid optimization

- EA, [i]Launcher[/i]
- EA, [i]Servers[/i]
- EA, [i]Just an extra ""F*** you EA.""[/i]
- Battlepass
[i]Dumbest thing ever created for games, and this one takes it to a whole new level with an effective level requirement of 1000 to max it out, 10 ""ranks"" per ""tier"".[/i]
- God awful network.
[i]I can be 16ms in a Solo, and still experience horrible network issues. Ie:
[strike]Throwing a grenade and having it explode 0.01 seconds later (Exaggeration, but not much of one. Haven't ever timed it, but my guestimates say 0.1 ~ 0.3 seconds before detonation)[/strike] (Answer: Annoying automatic doors closing on grenades),
Being teleported back in time and into a wall/corner/door,
Watching bots/players deal damage to me without having visually (Or audibly) started firing,
1-frame TTK.[/i]
- 1 Gadget

Pros:
- Wingsuits, Grapples, Portable shields, Trophy-systems, Player controlled rockets. These new gadgets are honestly pretty fun to use and can really help spice up the game, especially with countering hard to fight play styles like camping and vehicles.
- The weapon customisation mechanic is a godsend, even if it doesn't make the most sense (Converting an assault rifle to fire pistol cartridges in .1 of a second). But being able to switch from a sniper scope to a red dot at close range is so nice.
- A lot of the old fun stuff is still in the game, The guns feel nice, ""Some"" of the maps are pretty decent, the Tornado is cool
- Robot dog 

Cons:
- The hero esc system is terrible, a blank, nameless soldier from something like battlefield 1 or 4 has way more interesting depth and personality then any of this games cringe ass cast, Just remove them dice.
- These different characters also remove that teamwork from the game, Medics have at least become more common but no one resupplies ammo and just about every class can use snipers or DMR's
- DMR's
- No vehicle launching
- Some of the maps are just so underwhelming or plain bad. There are like two ship yard maps. 
- Ontop of that the destruction is still a let down, The Tornado and Rocket were great but where are more of those game altering events? I wanna see skyscrapers fall, maps flood, Storms ravish the entire land in a hurricane or earthquakes split apart the earth. Yet we can't even have a small shack fully collapse?

So much potential, wasted. The fictional 2042 era would have been a great base for a great Battlefield title that would have redeemed itself from the failure of Battlefield V. Just when we thought they couldn't get any lower, they proved us wrong.

Despite the persistent updates that made good on getting this game to some what mediocre levels if compared to Battlefield 3 & 4 and others before it, there are still some glaring issues with this game. Plus, all that time updating this game, if this game released in a better and complete state, it could have been proper additional content instead of 80-90% just fixes and lackluster content that we have now.

Things that are notable, good, & bad:
- Hero shooter elements / template seems to be heavily inspired and applied into this game. The stupid specialists reflect that.

- [b]NO MORE FACTION SPECIFIC PLAYER CHARACTER MODELS.[/b] Excluding portal, enemy character models are the same as you and your team. This should never persist in games like this.

1. It KILLS the IMMERSION. Might as well scrap the ""US vs. RUSSIA"" faction FFS.
2. Confuses friend from foe identification
3. Relying on just the UI and stupid light bars attached to character models which RED = ENEMY and BLUE = FRIENDLY is dumb.
4. Lore-wise: Jarring to see IRIS can side with the Russians in multiplayer. Given his story in BF4 he lost a friend to the Russians and is a loyal soldier to the US. 
5. The overall look of these specialists and their dialogue is generally cringe. Especially when you compare it to BC2, BF3, and BF4 player models and their dialogue.

The hell is this trend nowadays? even WW3 does this dumb design decision.

- [b]AI character models[/b] look better than player character models and yet those are the ones I want to play as not these CRINGE ""SPECIALISTS."" In previous titles, those are the character models. You play as an unnamed soldier, a part of a large military force against another military force. We could still have no-pats and have it structured like that but yet NOOOO EA decides: HERO SHOOTER-like characters with backstories and sell cosmetics cause that's the trend. SMH.

- [b]Cosmetics/Skins[/b] - many (not all, since some are decent) lean toward these bright cartoony and gaudy themes just like CoD and the trends of today. I miss the times when games like this actually stuck with the theme the devs intentionally portrayed. Serious, tactical, plausible military equipment and gear. Cartoony stuff are few and in between and mostly just for easter eggs or for fun. But not enough to detract from the immersive experience.

- [b]Vehicles[/b] - You have some helicopters that take 2 shots to blow up with your AT launcher. Used to be so effective in great previous titles. It's hard enought to shoot highly maneuverable flying vehicles, they shouldn't take 2 shots to blow up using dumb fire launchers and reward you for such skillful play. Gone are the proper IFVs, MRAPs too. At least tank gameplay is relatively fun but it still could have been better like in BF4. Can't say much on aircraft since I don't use it often. However vehicles models do look amazing and well done especially in most of the cosmetics. At least there no pink-cartoony flavored crap like in CoD.

Also each faction use the same vehicle models except for tanks, helicopters & jets. There are no more faction specific vehicle models in common transports, AA, and light vehicles. Again, this is similar to the character specific models problem. It seems lazy how each faction don't have their respective vehicles anymore. Whereas in BF3 & 4 or other titles, the Transports, AA, and light vehicles are different for each faction. It's so easy to disinguish from a distance if they're an enemy or not. Not having to rely on some UI.

- [b]Destruction[/b] - A DOWNGRADE from previous titles. They showcased a highrise building loosing a chunk of its side getting hit or blown up back then and yet that improved destruction is no where to be found. BF4 had levolution that changed how the map played for good or bad. Bad Company 2's destruction was tactical and not just for show. BF V introduced foritfication. A nice contrast from a totally destroyed map. Here? a step down and then we have gimmicky tornadoes.

- [b]Maps & Portal[/b] - Badly implemented and designed that they used so much time just to rework them. Time that could have been instead used to add more well designed maps and increase variety. BF Portal meanwhile is left in the dust. Can't say much in Hazard Zone cause like the name, I'd rather avoid it due to how bad they've handled this game.

- [b]Audio[/b] - Weapon audio don't feel as powerful compared to previous titles. I mean, it is mostly acceptable but lackluster if compared to titles like Bad Company 2 to BF4 and maybe BF1, the sound effects in those games were a joy to hear. Almost cinematic at times when there is full of action around you.

Overall, it is just slim pickings in the AAA FPS multiplayer side of gaming nowadays. If you're gonna buy this, just buy it on a huge SALE DISCOUNT just like I did. There is some fun in the game but it is still disappointing even with all the seasonal updates. Because it makes you realize, all that time EA and the devs used to fix this game, should have been time to ADD more proper content than what we currently have now if they only released this game in a PROPER STATE, CONSISTENT THEME & DIDN'T STRAY AWAY FROM A PROPER BATTLEFIELD IDENTITY.",1700370548,1701514006,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I guess most of the negative reviews were from launch which really skews the reviews. Or screws the reviews...

FOR ME, RIGHT NOW:
NO BLACK SCREENS
NO CRASHING
NO BUGS 
NO NOTHIN

I am not sure what you cry babies are complaining about? Maybe its your hardware or other software causing the issues?
Maybe take your thumb out of your mouths, put down the juice box, and do some research on how to fix your sheet instead of whining and crying about it in the reviews section?

Maybe holler upstairs to mommy and ask her to get yer baby blanket, wrap yourself up like a human burrito lie down and meditate for an answer?

Well, I am off to go play some more BF2042 and have a great time trying out some different classes, guns, game modes and more!

The intro sucks balls, and it felt like there was an attempt to build atmosphere on the end of the world climate scenario, but there just isn't any atmosphere other than minor future tech n some tornadoes. It's classic USA vs Russia in a nearby end of the world due to the environment. So what better way than to kill each other over the remaining 'resources'? It's pretty dumb, ngl. 

The 'classes' are more dynamic, with more perks. Making the game play more interesting than in previous titles. You can be any role and have effectively any weapon. Wanna be a recon with an SMG / LMG / shotgun & C4? Go for it. You just can't have a rocket launcher, that'd be silly. 

The vehicles are a little OP, so I prefer playing on servers without them, or 'portal' 32v32 conquest. the 64v64 conquest with vehicles is absolutely mental. Prepare to die, and lots of explosions. 

Spotting: whenever you kill someone, you're effectively spotted immediately, making camping hard, and running around even harder.

Iv watched numerous reviews for the game both good and bad and at the end i came to the conclusion that this is the bottom of the barrel for battle field games.  they even came out with a limited time game mode and they keep reading it and taking it off instead of leaving it dis spite the fact that most of the players end up playing that game mode and then are upset its gone and then drop the game and play other games till its back up. i am not a big fan of battle field 2042 they did not deliver what the players wanted nor does it seem like they intend to.  and if none of that is bad the regularly change up maps without anyone asking or complaining they just take it apon themselves to say this could be better lets change it. if its not broke don't fix it. they should have stuck with the game modes they had in the past instead of this clusterfuck. not to mention people just leave if there not an attacker and that leaves more than half of the actual players to have to be defenders. and there is no defending its just not possible unless the enemy team as absolutely brain dead. best game mode i have played so far was the one the removed and solo play.  i do not recommend this game if you enjoyed past battlefield games its not the same at all.,1701403959,1701403959,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While playing BF2042, I don't feel the atmosphere I'm used to from previous games in this series. The weapons feel like toys with almost zero recoil and too much effectiveness at long ranges. You can literally duel a dude with a sniper rifle far from you while wielding an SMG.
Introducing specialists is a completely incomprehensible decision for me. The parties in the conflict are theoretically Russia vs USA, but on both sides are representatives of completely different nations fighting against each other? The fuck is going on here? Besides, what's the point of dividing players into classes and specialists if everyone can use any damn weapon in the game without restrictions? I see no other explanation for this change other than pure greed from EA and the desire to sell skins for these cringe fortnite heroes. Of course, you can't create a game without a shitty Battle Pass these days. In the past, only planes, helicopters and possibly paratroopers could fly over your head in Battlefield games. Now you look up and see a whole squadron of non-binary specialists gliding your way and sniping you on the fly.
Even 2 years after its release, the game gives the impression that it was supposed to be something completely different before its release. The shooting system looks like homework that your friend named Call of Duty gave you and told you to change it up a bit so the teacher (us players) wouldn't notice.
Despite all the issues I mentioned, the game is actually fun, well, as a no-brainer FPS of course not as a Battlefield game. Luckily I bought the game on sale for pennies and I feel sorry for every fan of the series who was fooled by EA's sweet words at the premiere.

I started my acquaintance with the Battlefield series with Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3. I will truly remember Battlefield 3, because for me it was an absolute masterpiece in all aspects of shooter. And how many evenings my friends and I killed on Noushehra Channels and it's scary to remember ahah.
When the next parts came out (Battlefield 4, 1 and 5), I didn't listen to anyone and quietly played them, and they still had the atmosphere of large-scale battles, the feeling as if you were really at war. 
And now 2 years after the release of Battlefield 2042 I decided to try it out and I will say that this game is not Battlefield. Don't get me wrong, I believe that in its current state the game is a solid 6 out of 10. But if you are looking for the exact or at least the same experience that was in the previous series - pass it by, this game is not for you.
Lots of colorful skins, stickers on weapons, strange phrases from soldiers, inarticulate mechanics of weapon classes and lack of recoil on almost all weapons - many people say that this part has taken a step backwards. I will say that it took a step back from the audience it has been gathering for decades and took a step forward to the zoomers and Fortnite.

Battlefield 2042 has a very interesting concept that could surpass many games. Unfortunately, the game received a lot of hate, which caused the company to have to return several hundred players their money back.

The game is very poorly optimized, even on the worst details on the RTX 2060 6GB I couldn't play properly on a server with 64 players, let alone when I turned on a server with 128 players, the game didn't even run slowly.

I played BF1 a lot and just bought this for 10 bucks, it's a no-brainer.

BF1 is full of cheaters and the regular players are >50% pro's. You need at least 50 hours to get decent (1:1) scores and then still things happen you don't really understand. The photogrammetry in BF1 is outstanding and I still think it looks (and runs) a lot better than BF2042 though.

But the multiplayer experience for 36 year old after-work casuals like me ... is way better in BF2042 than in BF1.
More servers, better matchmaking, more interesting stuff happening.

The operators are NOT like ""hero shooters"", that claim is just ridiculous.
I hate hero shooters because of what they are.
I like even battlefields with everyone (or at least every team) having the same options to choose from, like CS which I play since 1999. 
The operators bring more variety through ""perks"" but that's it. I actually quite like it because some of them benefit my playstyle.

I'll start with the pros:
- Sound design - not too bad but room for improvement

Cons:
- Game feels empty: no campaign, and it feels like its missing a lot of features.
- Gun play just feels stale: all the guns feel relatively similar. At the moment, assault rifles are the only viable option and feel completely unbalanced.
- Server stability - this could be an issue on my end although I'm on Ethernet with a 100mb download but I get a lot of stuttering and packet loss as well as server performance warnings.
- Progression feels grindy and one dimensional. Just getting kills to unlock skins and attachments.
- Map design is poor. Very large maps in some cases that just feel empty most of the time.
- Black screening - Seems like other people have had this issue but it's very frustrating.

I would not recommend this game in its current state. Definitely don't buy this at full price as it will be a massive waste of money. EA, if you're reading this, please just make more of an effort.

If you like consistently being spawned directly in the line of sight of enemies, often bordering on having your ass within 2 feet of them, hit registration so poor that you can unload an entire magazine into an enemy with only 20 points of damage registering, getting sniped in two hits with a pistol from 200m away by an enemy who doesn't even have a line of sight on you, map design with zero flow and thus forced 360 degree combat at all times, mechanics that are borderline cheating allowing players to grapple hook all over the map like it's a jungle gym, spotting that works roughly 50% of the time on a good day, vehicles made of cardboard, about 75% of the game being locked behind paywalls leaving you with only the most useless weapons in the game unless you hand over more money, random lag spikes, at least one hacker per game, and an overall play structure that makes an amateur airsoft match feel fair, then this is the game for you!

Just remember to remortgage your house if you want anything better than a peashooter, because in this day and age, apparently buying a game doesn't get you the game. It just gets you the opportunity to dump more money into this broken, half-baked mess.

Most infantry anti vehicle weapons are literally useless against planes, especially that one specialists rocket cause it moves slower than the HELICOPTERS. to be honest theyre even bad against ground vehicles too, cause you will ALWAYS need more than one rocket to take down a tank, which by then you'll be dead from either the same tank or a guy on foot. Theres also the issue of basically every weapon being useless except assault rifles, but that may just be a skill issue on my end. This game could've been great, but alas it isnt.

1. all rockets do the same damage to vehicles regardless where you hit them and what your hitting.
2. grenades do the same damage to vehicles as rockets 
3. no zeroing on the weapons and full auto fans out way to much the characters we play as are seasoned combatants and yet when they full auto they have no control as if a child held it. (so better aim high in the sky for the long shots)
4. server issues constantly lagging or doing some other shit.
5. A lot of the defense points are on low ground with high ground surrounding them which i can understand there not all military compounds but at least dived the the hill with the attacking side so the defending side has a chance because of this all matches you either steamroll or get steamroll.
6. Vehicles can tank a lot of rockets and grenades before blowing up but most run away or back up after taking a few hit and repair almost instantly which is a bummer because if you running rockets you better have someone near you to resupply your rockets or you will scratch the vehicle.

So what are the Pros and Cons ?

-Pros:

1) Visibility is good and maps look and play much better now after the rework.

2) The return of class system made the game much better.

3)Wide ranges of game modes (because of portal logic editor)

4)Weather conditions and tornadoes

5) Conquest 128 now feels fun and great (after two years of maps rework and class system rework)

6) Air Vehicles are fun to fly now.

7) The increasing of amount of vehicles, made it more enjoyable and increased the only in Battlefield moments

8) Movement is good. But I don't like the first-person running animation.

-Cons:

1)Only one new map each season. We only got 6 maps in two years of content which is ridiculous compared to other titles. In BF4/BF3 we got 8 new maps in first 4 months and after two years we got 20 NEW MAPS and A LOT OF WEAPONS.

2) Each season update, we don't know if the game will continue or will get canceled. DICE/EA didn't give the community any road map for the game since the launch.

2) Audio ... I am not talking about footsteps sounds ... I am talking about the sound of bullets, explosions, air vehicles when they become close to you and all sounds in general ... they are not good and don't meet battlefield standards ... old battlefield titles have a much better audio ... this is important because it makes you feel like you are in war ... look at BFBC2 audio or BFV Audio for example.... they make you feel like in a war. They fixed a lot of things and the audio is much better now compared to launch but still not as good as BFV/BFBC2/BF4. Just listen to the weapons sounds, all of them sounds the same. Listen to the shotgun sound and you will know what I mean.

3) amount of weapons and customization... the weapon customization is not that advanced ... it is better than BFV for sure but it is now on BF4 level of customization (2013 title) but with LESS OPTIONS ... I expected MW level of customization for 2021 title.

4) Air vehicles ... there are not that many customization options for them.... so little options (even less than BF4 customization options ) ... the ECM and TV missile are missing ... there are zero options for the gunner in heli ... etc.

5) Lack of destruction for almost all maps compared to other titles such as BFV,BF4,BFBC2


- mixed
1)Specialists. In my opinion, they don't work well in a Battlefield game.
2)There are not that many vehicles in game (air and land). BFV (WW2 game) has much more options for air and land vehicles. Where is the attack jet? Where is the LAV?


- I used to defend the game and I have been playing it since Closed Beta. I admit that they fixed a lot of things and game is much much better than before. The performance is much better. Everything looks great. But now, after spending the previous months fixing the game and reworking the launch maps, they still release only one new map per season. In the current season which will be running for 4 months and we got only one map... And there is no road map or official communication if the game will continue for season 7/8 or it will be canceled like BFV and SWBF2

- Because of lack of new content compared to other titles and lack of communication regarding the game future... I don't recommend this game.

I will keep playing the game from time to time because it is the only game now that offers true-sandbox Battlefield experience. In my opinion, even in worst years of Battlefield history, no other game can compete with battlefield in terms of All-Out-Warfare games.",1637939431,1701271462,False,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is engaging, earning a solid 6 out of 10. It strikes a good balance between tactical team play and fast-paced action, although it doesn't quite reach the heights of some competitors.

Graphics-wise, the game impresses with its detailed environments and dynamic weather effects, deserving a 7 out of 10. The attention to visual detail enhances the immersion, though there is room for improvement in character animations and some textures.

The multiplayer aspect, a staple of the Battlefield series, is good but not groundbreaking, meriting a 6 out of 10. While it offers vast maps and intense combat, it falls a bit short when compared to the refined mechanics and pace of Call of Duty titles.

A notable downside is the lack of a single-player campaign. This absence is felt, especially for those who appreciate a narrative-driven experience in their games.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 is worth trying out, especially for those who enjoy large-scale multiplayer battles. However, instead of an outright purchase, I recommend opting for a subscription service to play the game. It's a great way to experience what the game has to offer without a long-term commitment, making it a good choice for a temporary gaming adventure.",1701232773,1701232773,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was experiencing a bug where every 3rd match or so, the game would boot back to the usual menu but have a black screen and effectively soft lock. This is a PC issue that has been around since the launch of the game and the only solution is to Alt + F4 and try again until it happens again. I've only played for about 16 hours and I wanna say every hour had at least one of these, with a slow over 2 minute long log in process since it has to boot through EA and then check for anti cheat and then load shaders and then load the game. 

I've been told by friends that the operators are a lot less obnoxious with voice lines now, so I basically just pick them based on what skill I like using. Weapons can be used by anyone with the exception of sub weapons like anti tank rockets or C5. It's not as big a genre-defining issue like before with the return of ammo and medic bags, but I can still see why it doesn't feel the same as what previous battlefield players wanted. 

Not to mention you have the now-usual AAA crap of a dozen new shiny bundles to buy packs for smack in the middle of your notifications along with an extremely tedious battle pass if you expend the week 1 to WEEK THIRTEEN missions too quickly (and you will, they're simple things like blow up enemies or kill enemies). A battle pass that includes *new weapons*, might I add. Not just cosmetics.

- Disabling Fullscreen Optimizations
- Updating Graphics Drivers
- Disabling / Adding an exception for the game in my anti malware software
- Running the game as Admin
- Running in Windows 7, and 8 compatibility
- Killing the Ea app thru Task Manager, and then launching the EXE file only
- Closing any apps that may take up a lot of usage, ( I.e Discord, or Spotify ) before launching
- Launching from steam ( which is where I own the game )
- Launching from Ea app ( Not where I own the game, therefore I can't verify the files on there )
- Verifying the game files on steam ( All Files were validated )
- Checking my overclock settings
- Not clicking into the game until the menu screen
- Closing VALORANT Vanguard anticheat
- Running the BF2042Launcher.exe File
- Changing my video settings thru NVIDIA because I wasn't sure if my GPU was spiking ( I have a 3080 ti )
- Unplugging unnecessary USB ports in my pc
- Disabling Steam Overlay
- Disabling Ea app Overlay

And honestly, there's probably a few more I forgot I even did. 

If you're curious about my PC and its specs compared to the Recommended specs, here they are :

CPU : AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12 Core Processor 
GPU : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 ti
RAM : 32 GB 3200MHz ( Only 2 slots used as if that matters )
PSU : 1000W Corsair Power Supply

And last of all that matters is that my game is downloaded on an SSD with 2 TBs total, and 1.24 TBs free.

In my opinion, I would play this game, and probably like it. But for the $60 price, don't try to buy the game, if you run into crashing issues like this in the future, you will 1,000,000% regret your purchase. There's no who or what about it. Just ONLY BUY THIS GAME WHEN IT GOES ON SALE BELOW $20.

I will be Editing this review if you are interested, but as for right now. The game is unplayable for me, even on my pc. My regards go out to anyone else that also has these problems when trying to the play the fucking that they paid for. Thank you for reading, and try the fixes above if your game will not stop crashing no matter what. Maybe some day it will work. Bye bye now.



EDIT: BattleBit hasn't had any issues for me, and it's the fucking 1/4th of the price of this game, just buy BattleBit instead. :/

I have since found out the issue with this dogshit game, I have 32gb of RAM and within 1 minute of me playing the game even on the fucking menu screen, the game shuts down because it has to use all 32gb of my RAM to run. It's truly embarrassing that after 2 years the memory leak issues have gotten worse and not better. I fucking hate Ea and I regret this purchase, here's to hoping that the game will be playable next year. Oh wait, no it wont.

EDIT EDITED: The game is much better now that the glitches are gone, and after I upgraded my probably very outdated motherboard, the game runs much better now. I no longer receive those horrible memory leak issues. And the game is fun as hell, with or without friends the game is super fun. Now that the game is playable I am having loads of fun.",1691192726,1701213253,True,0,0,0.502380967140197754,0,True,False,False

I found the game easy to get into and I really liked the presentation and the soundtrack is really great!

A downside for me was the pricetag, though I think the game makes up for it with the amount of content available. I just bought it on sale. Another problem I had with the game was how certain classes were changed to the point where I pretty much ended up losing interest. There was a character with three types of grenades that also has a wingsuit. They removed two of the grenades and also made the sticky grenade launcher thing a lot less effective.

Sometimes I think balancing done to games goes a bit too far when the developers decide to remove equipment entirely. You chose to release the game with these options and it's fine to downscale them a bit but removing it is just a lazy solution and I don't feel like you have the playerbase in mind when you make such a decision.

All this could just be a matter of taste for me though, but I'm choosing to write about it as it did affect my reason for continuing to play.

- Playing with friends is such a heart ache, I bought this game to play with my Steam friends and we all had to make EA accounts 
  for some reason to play with them
- Once you party up with your friends, your party probably didn't even get put into the match that you queued up for

Took forever to get anywhere near playable and they refused my refund multiple times. So I was stuck with it. Fast forward to now and while it is playable I don't like it. Here's why. 

Operators... I can't stand them. They don't shut up. The"" customization "" is only what you can buy in the shop. There isno story so good luck caring what their bio is and where they are from. Did I mention they never shut up ? Yeah they are annoying and they look awful. Not tactical. Not realistic. Just fortnite tactical. * visible disgust * 

Maps.. They are boring. I don't feel like much time or thought really went into them. They are just meh. Nothing like 4, 3, or BC2. Just boring lifeless and lacking the destruction you want. Which if you were expecting battlefield style destruction you will be disappointed. There isn't any... 

Weapons. Gun play is still lacking in my opinion. Some attachments do the exact same thing but look different and the only plus I found unlike call of duty was they allow you to have a round chambered. The way it should be. 

Micro transactions... Pretty self explanatory. Anything remotely cool looking or better camo is locked behind a pay wall... Modern gaming strikes again. 

Censorship. Even though you are an adult playing a mature game apparently you can't handle words and any and all curse words are censored. Really weak. 

Squad system is bad... Really bad. You can't make a private squad. You can't lock anything. You can kick but that's as far as it goes in a squad. Very lame. Oh and it kicks you from leadership if you don't give orders even though.... The order is the exact same. 

There are no ranked hardcore lobbies. 

Server search is also not a thing. 

Time to kill is childish and damage is insulting. Also the type of caliber you use means nothing 

Just another modern gaming fail.

The game is still riddled with bugs, there is nothing particularly original or groundbreaking about the game (swapping attachments mid combat is the only new and maybe positive thing i'm seeing here). The gimmick with natural disasters occurring during the match is laughable, I've never seen a more harmless natural disaster in my life, you have to intentionally jump into the middle of a tornado then either wingsuit or parachute out with no consequences. You can wingsuit from a 40 story building face first into the ground at 200mph and you take like 40/100 points of damage. Jet physics are straight out of a cartoon, they're floaty and hovery with incredible control despite being the wrong type of jet to have anything close to that type of control. Maps are mediocre, the agent system is dreadful, every battlefield that came before this did better with the class system. Its almost impossible to identify enemy footsteps considering all the loud pointless random shit taking up all the audio(natural disasters). You can't shoot through walls, the destructibility of buildings and the environment is laughable because I remember being able to destroy more in battlefield bad company (released 15 years ago).

Pros:
Still was pretty buggy at first, but those have been resolved for the most part within the last year. I don't get the black screen of death that many others have. I think game play is good, but I can see how other BF vets would think differently. WAY more guns than the early seasons from what I've heard. The ability to change weapon accessories on the fly is neat and the reworks done throughout seasons 4-6 have progressively made the game better. I also like the specialists (unpopular opinion), but it does bring some more essence to the game than just guns and vehicles. Certain specialists are overall better than others, but you can find a niche role for underused specialists to have an advantage, especially if you run a squad with friends.

Cons:
I wish there were more maps and/or maps with more ""je ne sais quoi"" like the preceding games. Still can't fly a helicopter to save my life. EA = micro transactions. The sweats in this game are ridiculous.

Probably still a better option than MW3, Destiny, etc. Not as much fun as BF1, but better than 5, and I still come back to play regularly. 7/10",1701149835,1701149835,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firsly, adding specialists and customizable character skins, not only makes the game look uglier and out of place, but also makes visual identification of enemies harder. Its annoying to have to look for the blue marker over ones head, before you start shooting at them. 
  The gadgets, and the fact that you can pick any weapon with any class make the battlefield pure insanity. Its silly how one man can carry a launcher, a sniper rifle, and a big gadget, all without popping his kneecaps whenever he jumps. It also makes the game unbalanced, and a few classes unplayable.
  The removal of the suppresion effect was one of the bigger mistakes Dice made. Rather than tactical positioning and covering before firing, now gunfights mostly consist of eratic movement and quickly scoping on the enemy. Positioning has very little impact. Now gynplay reminds more of the poorly designed battle royal titles that are so widespread nowdays, and that Dice tried so hard to model its game after.
  The supersonic bullets create a shockwave around them as they fly. The gasses expanding out in front of the barrel, after firing, also create a much stronger shockwave. When these shockwaves hit soldiers they have a concusive effect. And that, coupled with the sharpnel of closeby hitting bullets and the fear of death create an actual suppresion effect. Battlefield was one of the first series to introduce this effect, and it was very realistic.",1701139886,1701139886,False,0,1,0.497416049242019653,0,True,False,False

You will have numerous encounters where enemies will spawn like a few yards around you and immediately dust you. The gun fighting in this game is absolutely cheeks as well, especially compared to battlefield 4. You will almost always lose a 1v1 to anyone with a faster rate a fire even if your gun does more damage per round. Your marine handles recoil like a toddler holding a leash with a pitbull  attached to it. Dont get me started on the fact that it takes like 10-15 rounds too eliminate a player especially at further ranges. Your AR has like .00000001 percent chance of actually killing a player if they are more than 30 yards, unless they have no health or are SpeD. By the time you fire your gun they can simply chimp around and hide behind the one rock that everyone else is huddled behind. There is no hardcore mode that I could find either which is stupid af. Alot of players enjoy being able to down an enemy in a few realistic shots. The music in this game is horrendous and listening to it just about gave me up left and right syndrome to go with my down. You'd be better off having a live glock go off next to your ear then listen to the theme. 3/10 absolutely cheeks. The only thing that is good is the graphics thats about it.

I REALLY wanted to like this game, even a little bit since I have a friend that plays this and I don't normally play shooters online, but was excited to co-op with a friend. I even got this game at a REALLY high discount, but it was just a horrible experience. Maybe it's different for people that have played other Battlefield games before and know the mechanics and how the game works, but I had zero experience with any previous titles before this one, and it was the most frustrating game I have ever tried to play. 

There is no tutorial AT ALL. None. ZERO. The very start of the game drops you into one of the game modes and just tells you to go attack enemy posts or defend your team's post. Absolutely NO instructions on what buttons do what, or how to do anything. The game encouraged me to get in a tank/vehicle and do a few different things. Great, but HOW??? What button do I push? What do I need to do in order to complete the task you are suggesting? I'm not the kind of guy that needs my hand held thru a game, but at least the BASIC instructions would be good for those of us that aren't military shooter vets.

If you ARE a military FPS vet, I'm sure you likely skip any tutorials any newer game may have, but some of us need the basics at the start so we can get the feel for a new game, especially for gamers like me that don't play tactical shooters, but wanted to give it another try.

Gunplay: 7/10.  Large assortment of weapons, I enjoy the gunplay for the most part.  Balance is a challenge - new weapons added are almost always overtuned.  There are also a number of ""portal"" weapons, classic weapons from prior BF titles, which I found uninteresting and only there for leveling up.  

Class/Squad play: 6/10.  The character+archetype style was poorly received, and at launch it did detract from squad play, since there were a couple overtuned characters and everyone could use anything.  This has been adjusted quite a bit into more of the classic archetype kits, but there are still some characters that are substantially more useful/powerful than others.  Squads now feel more impactful, at least.

Maps 4/10.  I primarily play Breakthrough, and the maps are the weakest part of the game.  Several of the launch maps have been reworked and these reworks have helped, but the seasonal maps tend to be poorly balanced as well.

I am honestly a die hard Battlefleld fan, have played many many hours of Battlefield 3 and 4, but this game spits in their faces and ruins the franchise for me which make very sad as Im sure alot of Battlefield fans are considering this game was released in 2021 and still is riddled with bugs/crashes. 

Cmon guys Battlefield used to be an awesome franchise, it was a pioneer in the open world style online shooters category and always had that over COD. But now it seems that now this game has been over manufactured so much that you have lost sight of the features and play style that the community wants when playing Battlefield! You have some good ideas in here but you changed the game for the worse and as I understand it have now lost most of your player base! 

If the Battlefield devs havent played Battlebit yet they definitely should, this game has given the players what you failed to do here and are reaping the benefits. Its far closer to what Battlefield should be than Battlefield itself! Even with Roblox graphics its still 100x more popular than Battlefield....

- diverse weapons

The bad:
- conquest 64/128 is a total chaos. first games you won't understand nothing. everyone running side to side, tanks, armor vehicles, many gadgets, mines and so on.
- aiming is VERY odd compared to other FPS games (Counter Strike, Killing Floor etc...). For example sniping feels very innacurate",1701003207,1701003658,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I finally started playing the constant ads for the shop are a bit anoying.. But sadly this was to expect from a modern game..

But what honestly wasnt to expect was the lack of players.. i played tdm and the new limited game mode..
all other gamemodes I tried didn't work because the lobbies just stayed empty...

.. and then after two and a half hours I found the first blackscreen... great..

cant refund it anymore... so yey they robbed me...

Now I’m doing an easy 6hrs/day in breakpoint. Also scratches the insurgency itch in the AI mode a little but with better/more fun fun handling. It’s not as intense but you can use it to chill after some PvP before you go back.

Big pro - doesn’t feel like there’s any sbmm. If there is then it’s not noticeable. Makes the game enjoyable over longer periods.

Cons -
1). Don’t care for the specialist idea too much, however it is nice to be able to resupply your own ammo no matter what gun you have. I always liked throwing ammo boxes but now I’m not limited on certain gun types.

2). Futurism is eh. It’s not overdone to be immersion breaking and not feel like battlefield but it’s riding the line I think. Not bad but let’s no go too much further on the future or it will turn into call of duty and we will have laser guns.

3). Specialist outfits suck. I like to run full face helmets/coverings for some reason and I’m barely able to do that. Especially without trying to spend $20 for cosmetics which aren’t even that great to begin with. Character customization could use some love moving forward in the future. Not really much to work towards, just give me money or use a basic looking skin forever.

4). I don’t think it would be too bad if the specialists weren’t locked to certain roles. Nothing would make me happier than throwing ammo boxes to everyone while in a full ghillie suit + face paint.

Vehicles handle worse than 3, gunplay is worse than 4, the battles(have you thought abut battle pass) is worse than ever, and the immersion is broken by the battle pass( only 10.99 on sale). the visuals are nice as always, but i feel like they really havent taken a leap since BF3.

I have what I'd consider a high end PC (ryzen 5 5600X, 16gb ram, AMD rx 6700XT ran through a Samsung SSD) and this game runs like dogshit through it, microstutters stack and make the game unplayable
the UI looks like trash, almost like no one ever took a design course in how to make something user friendly, with tabs that pop out of tabs and tabs that look like they should do something but don't. But don't forget everything has to load, so you will spend minutes in a fucking menu to adjust simple shit like contrast to fix their trash color pallet and a minute to get back out of it!
the visual of the game is blue ""waaaow like bf4 was!?"" no not at all, it's all fucking grey on blue and blue on grey leading to the visuals being a literal shitshow of grey and blue, no enemy recognition at all provided they arent running at you (which they wont)
Devs now look at their old titles and wonder why they did so well, COD is doing it too.
BF went ""hm, they liked BF3-4 what made that game sell so well"" and some dumb fucking wopperjawed bastard went and said ""I knaow, ISH BLUE"" and all the devs clapped and went about copying all the main elements without knowing why they were there to start with.

Things I like:
- They FINALLY remastered the best bf title they came out with after 11 years (Bad Company 2) and rightfully so after the mess of a launch it has been for bf2042 with all of the bugs and unfinished/missing features.
- The maps, guns, vehicles, characters and overall feel of the game brings back the nostalgic feel that made me play Bad Company 2 more than any battlefield game I've tried.
- 1000 times better than any current battlefield in terms of the maps, guns, movement, destruction, graphics, map layout, map building aesthetics, vehicles, it just feels perfect as it did back in 2010 but with a fresh coat of paint and upscaled graphics
- Cross platform is incredible and makes it so that we actually have more people that we can play with and fill up servers with instead of playing against bots/npc's.

Things I don't like:
- The scoreboard no longer shows a veteran status number next to your name the same way like the original Bad Company 2 did. This is important. Why? Because you now no longer have a number indicating how many Battlefield games you have played in the past next to your name. In regular Bad Company 2, I had a 12 next to my name, meaning I played 12 Battlefield titles in the past and that actually meant something when others would look at it or me knowing that others can see that.
- The way that you select your attachments is the most un-intuitive process I have ever come across. To the point where I actually had to look up a tutorial on it. Bring back the same UI there was for the original Bad Company 2 to select your guns, attachments and gadgets.
- The fact that there are only 2 maps to play. Granted, yes they are pretty much the best BC2 maps they brought back, especially Arica Harbor, but PLEASE, bring back or upscale the rest of the Bad Company 2 maps. I will pay to get more maps to play on because it's so fun.
- The rest of the guns, gadgets, attachments, etc. are missing. It almost feels like they worked on a Bad Company 2 remaster and only brought back 2 maps as a test. Well don't have it as a test anymore, it is good. WAY BETTER than any of your base game modes or current Battlefields. Bring back the rest of the content that is missing from the original Bad Company 2.
- Being forced to hold down spacebar to die instead of how it was in the original Bad Company 2 where you are just dead and wait to respawn. WHO MADE THIS HORRIBLE FEATURE. GET RID OF IT. IT IS AWFUL. Why do I have to hold spacebar each time and watch my character squeal for his life? Just have me dead and if I happen to be revived before I spawn, SO BE IT. Just like the original, which was MUCH BETTER of a system.
- The way that you make callouts for ammo, etc. is way too intrusive. Covers whole screen and made me shoot an RPG at my self in front of a wall because of asking for ammo or health pack. Make it cover less of the screen or make it similar to how it was in Bad Company 2, where you just ask for ammo near a person who is assault.

Overall, it is VERY fun to play Bad Company 2 remastered again. I was still to this day playing the original Bad Company 2 with whatever servers were left and to be able to do this again, is truly satisfying and just fun. The fact that there is cross platform, is a godsend for getting more people to play with. Please, focus your efforts on the one good thing you put out with Battlefield 2042, which is a remaster of the games that were actually good. Bring back the rest of Bad Company 2 maps, the guns, attachments, gadgets, vehicles and the Onslaught and Vietnam expansion. The map I'd want back the most would be Oasis. (My favorite). Also, would be nice to at least see the maps Port Valdez, Isla Inocentes, Nelson Bay, Harvest Day. Rest of the maps were amazing too, but those especially, NEED TO be brought back.

Also, BF3 remastered, I would say everything as positively about it as with Bad Company 2 earlier. Obviously it's not as good as Bad Company 2, but it has it's own feel, jets are fun, guns are fun, the maps also bring back that nostalgia vibe and would be more fun if it had more than 2 maps.

AND, BF1942 remaster, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a ton of fun with it as I was a big fan of BF1943 and the visuals and scale/size of maps on BF1942 remaster is amazing. Very stunning visually, makes you feel like you're in a real war. The gameplay is fun and is awesome to play with a sniper from towers. Would HIGHLY suggest playing either one of these remasters as they are all very good.

In terms of BF2042, I honestly think it's very fun also and don't understand what these mainstream reviews are talking about. The game is incredibly good, yet you have this echo chamber of same people saying how bad it is, actually deterring people due to sheep mentality and most people being easily manipulated. Conquest mode is fun for me and I like the progression of unlocking guns. Sure it's missing some features and could use more gun & map selection but they already brought back the scoreboard and why are people malding over voip if Discord exists and most people use that? Now I have to worry about having to mute annoying people in game. The graphics are incredible unless you have a potato pc which most people do, the gunplay is fun, they made the map areas you fight in smaller, the vehicles are fun, BF Portal with Bad Company 2 and bf3 is incredible. And they did all of this while in lockdown during Covid. I'm actually curious as to whether these ""reviewers"" played the game more than 1 hour before giving these reviews and then AFTER QUITTING the game, continue to say how awful it is.

Overall, 8/10 and could potentially be a 9/10 if they polish up more, bring back missing features and end up bringing in more guns and maps for BF2042 and BF Portal's BC2 & BF3.",1637875208,1700972514,True,2,0,0.482991188764572144,0,True,False,False

But at the same time, the developers DICE have a monopoly on this ""genre"" and there's not much else like it. You gotta go play mil sim games if you want anything close to it, even then they'll often be missing aircraft. 

Its astounding just how much they screwed up on this game. And its not simple things to fix but issues baked into the game. The lack of veteran experience at the studio + the amount of developers who grew up on ""CoD"" like games is very evident. I'm not saying this to be mean, they're skilled developers. But it often feels like they fail to grasp the battlefield genre and don't understand how small changes can lead to big impacts. 

1. Specialists Design - The developers seemed like they designed this game with aiming at the CoD warfare/Apex crowd as their primary audience. There is a hyper focus on ""selfish"" gameplay styles. Where people choose loadouts that have minimal teamwork aspects. All they care about is guaranteed kills. While this may be ok in a game like CoD, this does not work in BF. Even as arcadey as BF is, teamwork is an integral part of it. And when you're basically telling your players ""Be selfish and get 10x more kills with this loadout vs infantry"", it really starts to screw up the experience as a whole. Ammo crates, med crates, reviving, spotting, anti vehicle rockets, repairing, marking targets, recon, squad beacons, etc. These all lend towards teamwork. And the devs designed the specialists in this game to heavily discourage running loadouts with those. As a result, you'll often see people complaining about things like lack of revives or vehicles being too powerful. Because everyone is running around with a selfish loadout because it gives them more guaranteed kills. 

2. Balance - Oh boy, balance. Specialist balance is horrible. If you're not running either Sundance, McKay, Lis, or Falyk; you're hamstringing your team. That's the simple truth. The devs have said they wanted some specialists with ""niche"" roles, but why? Why do that? Why not just balance the game so that specialists have a purpose all the time. You have sundance that can literally fly around, creating huge amount of issues. McKay which can traverse anything and zip around like that Apex robot character. You've got falyk who has infinite (but on a cooldown) self and ranged healing. You have Lis who has infinite (but on a CD) TV rockets that can cover half the map. Most people play the other specialist aside from these simply because of cosmetics.

3. Map Design - Even with all the reworks, map design is horrible. Take for example the snow map with the ice berg. One side gets a large iceberg they spawn ontop of. Which allows for them to easily parachute to every capture point on the map. Oh look, that side also has a consistently higher win rate! What a surprise. Throw in sundance flying around like a dive bomber destroying vehicles none stop and flanking none stop, you have a consistent crapchute. There's quite a few maps like this where one side has a noticeable advantage thanks to design. 

4. Asymmetrical design - they've bandaided this the best they could without reworks, but there are still asymmetrical balance issues that suck. Mainly around the attack helicopters and the transport helicopters. In both cases the RU side has an advantage. 

5. Vehicle balance - Because of the issues of #1, vehicle balance is all over the place. Since you would be LUCKY if you have more than 10% of your team actively trying to counter vehicles, they had to balance the vehicles to make them like paper. Where one person can easily kill them. So in a game where enemies can range from 32 players or 64 players on  one team, it only takes 1-3 of them to easily kill a tank. Nevermind you have sundances flying around none stop. And if you're ever in a game where a good amount of your team is countering vehicles. Like 25-30% of them...vehicles on the enemy team simply don't exist. They barely have a chance to do anything because of how effective they had to make anti-vehicle. Yet despite this, you still get people who whine because their McKay-C4 loadout can't counter a tank easily or helicopter. 

6. Snipers - They got nerfed hard. Like it or not, this is part of the BF formula. Snipers have always existed. Between TV missiles, tracer fire that looks like they copied the  code from battlefront 2, kill cams, modifable weapons on the fly, and scope glint; snipers are pretty useless now.

7. Lack of Stealth - If you fire a bullet without certain attachments, you get auto spotted on the map. Which is just horrible. The sound should be enough. You don't need to highlight enemies on the map when the fire a bullet. That was such an obvious handicap given to players who don't have sound on. You've got tons of gadgets that spot you. You also have a horrible killcam design where they show you the kill cam BEFORE you fully die. So if you kill someone, they get shown where you are. Then they get revived and boom, they know exactly where you are. They should have only shown you a kill cam AFTEr you have fully died. So you can't just get revived by an ally sitting prone and know exactly where the person who killed you is. Finally the game will automatically ""highlight"" enemies you're pointing at by showing their name in red above their head. So if  you're inside of a bush and someone running by has their cross hair move over your location. Even though you can't be seen at all thanks to t he camouflage, they'll still start firing like crazy into the bush. Not because they actually see you. They just see the floating red name and are aiming at that, not the actual person. 

8. Macros - They didn't do much to counter macros in this. So you've got people using single shots with insane accuracy + rate of fire. They get those mouses where you can program a macro into it to fire faster than what normal human input would allow you too. I don't know why they don't just put in a hard rate limit for these guns. You see a lot of single shots (both firemode and things like semi-auto snipers) firing way faster than they should. 

So if you're looking for a Battlefield game where nobody wants to use teamwork items, map balance is horrible, and the game has even less depth than previous Battlefields; this is the one for your. Sadly though there's nothing like it and its the only BF left with some kind of anti-cheat enforcement (looking at you Bf5). 

One thing this BF has shown is it laser focused on how badly things can go wrong. Next BF they release, I'm going to be watching VERY intently around loadout balance and map design. If we have another loadout issue with selfish loadouts, high mobility specialists, and bad map design; yah that next BF is going to be ""wait till its on sale"" for me.

Something to consider if you are looking to buy the game (for those in the future) is if there's a current season going that can keep you occupied after you reach the level where you've unlocked all of the default guns, because frankly I don't see this game sticking it out for the long run after another installment in the series comes out (in its current state). The only way I can see it lasting is if Portal mode starts to have a more prominent role since its genuinely an interesting concept that I think could have a place in future installments. Portal could almost be a standalone game that gets added to/updated along with each new installment in the series. it could take on the current battle pass system to help produce some profit and keep the legacy of older games alive (RIP Bad Company 2 servers)",1700960433,1700960433,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How Dice and EA managed to escape lawsuit is beyond me. As many of you might know, a lot of key Dice people left the company prior to BF2042's launch. Even they knew what was going to happen and of course didn't want anything to do with it. This game is a disgrace. And no matter how many cool trailers Dice makes trying to promote it, it will never be a true battlefield game.

Needless to say, I got burnt pretty badly at launch
It's been a long road full of ups and downs...but in its current state, Battlefield 2042 is actually worth recommending. It's far better than at launch, and as a self-proclaimed veteran of the BF community, I view this game as the unloved, slightly odd but still fun at times, black sheep of the Battlefield family.
Which does not mean its bad...

I only have two complaints at this moment:

previous review: this game absolutely blows man like I knew when I bought this game I was signing up for huge maps but jesus christ these are like twice the size of the ones in battlefield V. I also dont know if this is a thing where soldiers in the future are like augmented or something to take more bullets but getting kills is super frustrating. It takes like 15 bullets with the m4 to kill a dude with no armour and if they do have armour you could probably empty your whole mag in the back of their head and they would be able to turn around and gun your down with their godly sub machine gun which brings me to the next point which is THE submachine gun. after you reach a certain level the second smg you get which is the bizon it becomes the only gun you will use because of its stupidly large mag and fire rate. there are also very few weapons with unlock levels spread apart quite far so that makes loadout variety a little slow and dry. game also has a habit of freezing and or crashing at random. Optimization is so bad that even the top gpus cant even run the game at 60fps. This game is NOT finished and you should probably give it some time before buying.

UPDATE: Still dislike the game more or less because of these few issues
1. if you body clips into a wall in a downed state you cant be revived (I HATE THIS THE MOST)
2. Attachments permanetly locked even with filled requirements
3. serious hitreg issues 
4. spawn areas on the map are so damn small that its hard to deploy when your whole squad (that are engaged in combat) cover the spawn square",1637388080,1700938951,True,0,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False

""However, it's not all sunshine and health packs. The occasional server lag can be a real buzzkill, interrupting the flow of an otherwise flawless match. It's like experiencing lag-induced déjà vu – you're sure you shot that enemy, but the server says otherwise.

Review as of 2021:
While I have been enjoying Battlefield 2042 I cannot recommend buying it in its current state and price. The game issues and weird downgrades compared to previous titles. 

Pros:
- Graphics
- Weather effects
- Attachment menu
- Interesting gadgets
- Portal

- G̶a̶m̶e̶p̶l̶a̶y̶
- Gunplay

Cons:

I bought BF BC2,BF3,BF4 Day one with Premium editions or DLC, those game was great never had so many issues like this recent one, I am big fan of Battlefield series i think i even have some old limited edition of one of those BFs... please DICE get yourself together and make next game which will blow our mind again, thinks like Levolution from BF 4, proning and barrycading from BF V, Destruction and map perfection from BF BC 2. Bigger map is not always the best solution, you need to fill it up with something interesting and has to be destructible! Maybe try go F2P with the next title but don't do same what other games does do your thing which is BIG Destruction with so many vehicles and big guns!

Played this for the past 2 days and I have experienced a couple bugs where you can't change your loadout at times when you respawn also I have at one time fell out of the map, the vehicles can be buggy at times, and there could be more secondary weapons as there are only 3 but like I said those things will improve. The explosion and  shooting mechanics are insane it looks great, the maps are huge but people seem to over exaggerate the fact that they're too big, no they are not, 30 seconds of running till you find action does not mean the map is too big, the maps in general are beautiful, only two modes but I think the thing that makes up for it is that you can play maps from bf2 bf3 and the very first one. That's a really nice touch to add, overall a really good game can't wait for it to improve.

The game's vast maps and dynamic weather systems create a truly immersive battlefield environment, providing a sense of realism and unpredictability. The introduction of specialist classes adds diversity to gameplay, allowing players to adopt unique abilities and playstyles. However, the game has faced criticism for its initial lack of polish, with bugs, glitches, and server issues impacting the overall experience at launch. Additionally, the absence of a traditional single-player campaign disappointed some players who were hoping for a more narrative-driven component. Despite its initial setbacks, Battlefield 2042 has the potential to evolve into a top-tier shooter with future updates and improvements.",1700854545,1700854545,True,3,0,0.505747139453887939,0,True,False,False

I had fun. Well, atleast with my friends. The game feels like a prototype of something much larger. It's missing most, if not, all the core-features that made the earlier battlefield titles so memorable & funny to play.
I have bought the gold edition, but it really feels like i bought the standard edition. There has been no updates, regarding the content to come in year 1, and the only thing we have gotten in the meantime is some skins and really underwhelming gamemodes.
The only exciting thing to happen since the launch of the game, was the introduction of the weekly missions. But that also turned out be extremely underwhelming after the first week.
Performance & graphical-wise, i think this is the lowest of lowest, in the battlefield series to date. I would almost call it ""amateurish"". Especially by the fact, that this is a AAA (Triple A) game.
The graphics has seen a big downgrade in comparison to Battlefield V and previous titles. The maps are large, but they also lack everything that made the previous battlefield maps interesting and funny to play on.
The whole aspect of specialits is extremely weird. The traditional four-class system has always worked well, but now it's been changed to having to choose and play a specific specialist out of 10 different ones?
To say the least, i don't the understand the reason behind the change. I'm not saying it's bad, but it really doesn't make sense on paper. Maybe it's due to wanting to have unique skins for every specialist? i don't know.
Something i would also like to comment on, is the gameplay.
It's fine. It's nothing special by any means whatsoever. It feels like a very generic first person shooter, and the guns are just fine enough to use. Some vehicles feel good to use. Some are good and some are bad.
The lore behind the game is actually really interesting and good, in my personal opinion. The whole world has gone to ♥♥♥♥ and WW3 is basically on the verge of happening. The reason why i am writing this however, is because this is pretty much nonexsistenst in the game, other than some item descriptions.
Instead, we have specialists who run around and say stupid & quirky ♥♥♥♥, especially towards the end game (looking at you Angel).
Right now, Battlefield V has more than double the daily steam players that Battlefield 2042 has. To say the least, i really don't much optimism for 2042's future. There is drama left and right, and there's even some speculation that the game will be cancelled by EA entirely. It almost feels like Anthem all over again, and that's not a good thing.

TL;DR:
Battlefield 2042 is disappointing, boring, buggy, poorly optimized and a waste of time, unless you have someone to play with + any editions above the regular one, feels like a scam in all honesty.",1655142554,1700853491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The lows of this game were very low and I'm disappointed I didn't get to enjoy playing this game during the first half of my experience. However I can say beyond a doubt that after easily putting in 200 hours in this game (a rare occurrence for me) the $60 price tag has been worth it. Not sure if I'd recommend this game for people looking to purchase it this late, but I hope that the lessons learned during the development of this game will hopefully ensure the next release of Battlefield will be a success from launch. Please enjoy the rest of this review as a throw back to when this game was often unplayable.

Update 13 (Negative): After Season 6 update the game will no longer launch along with about 75-50% of other players. How do you not catch this in pre-launch testing, and how the hell is it not yet fixed? EA and DICE are an embarrassment to game development.

Update 12 (Positive):
I've decided to give the game a final positive review. DICE has shown significant commitment to making the game as good as they can. It still has severe flaws that need to be addressed, but I'm enjoying the game again regardless. Since migrating to a computer with a more powerful CPU I've experienced no issues (however by previous hardware should have been more that powerful to run the game properly so I believe the game is still in need of serious optimisation). If you're considering whether to buy the game or not, I'd say don't. DICE are reportedly working on the next battlefield game already so I think this game is already on it's deathbed. But more importantly I don't think EA or DICE deserve your money with the way they screwed up the launch of this game. Letting it fail is maybe what the franchise needs for EA and DICE to get their shit together and actually deliver a functional game on launch for once.

Update 11 (Negative):
Never mind, they did nothing to optimise the game. Anything with 64+ players is unplayable. Fuck you EA and fuck you DICE. I'd refund this game if I still could.

Update 10 (Positive):
Who would have known? They spent 5 minutes optimising the game and it's made a remarkable difference. Frame rate is not as stable as I'd like but it's acceptable and most importantly, playable. The new game mode ""Shutdown"" is loads of fun and the return of ""All"" chat is a welcome change. I've been very much enjoying my recent time playing this game. It seems the game is on a good path. However I just can't shake the feeling that as soon as the game is about to become a gem, it's just going to get abandoned as the devs and publishers move onto the train wreck that will be the next launch of a Battlefield game.

Update 9 (Negative):
1 Week, that's all I got. 1 week of actual smooth performance and enjoyable experience before we ended up right back to the crappy performance I've come to expect from a product by a multi billion dollar corporation such as EA. And then these assholes have the audacity to announce that they are working on a new (soon to be) train wreck of a Battlefield game. And before you think to your self ""geez sounds like an issue with your computer"". I suggest you take a look at the barren wasteland that is the EA forums, littered with people experiencing the EXACT same issue as me, with 0 responses from EA or DICE. Why is my powerhouse of a computer on a clean windows install suffering all these nonsensical performance issues? Why to I manually create a config file telling the game to use all CPU cores at it's disposal for the game to run smoothly (again, this solution only worked for a week)? Why do companies with such pathetic ethics and quality standards keep, not only, surviving as a company, but also keep pumping out these absolute shittastic games? 

Update 8 (Negative):
How does a Intel i7-9750H, a RTX2070 and 40Gb of ram only produce about 50-60 fps on High video settings (other video settings make no difference in performance)? I don't understand how an issue that countless people have been having since the game came out is still an issue today? It's embarrassing.

Update 7 (Negative):
I figured out why I've been having issues. Turns out the geniuses at DICE and EA are even more incompetent that I could have ever imagined. I'm playing on a laptop, with a RTX2070 and an integrated graphics as part of the CPU. And yup, you guessed it, the game runs on the integrated graphics, and worst of all, even if I disable the integrated graphics so that only my RTX2070 is available, the game decides to run WITHOUT A FUCKING GPU, so I basically get 5 FPS in the menu. How is this possible? Only a corporation as incompetent as EA and DICE could have such a pathetic and nonsensical issue. And I'm far from the only one experiencing this issue. Good job guys, even when you're doing good, you somehow find a way to fuck it all up!

Update 6 (Negative):
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?!?!?!?!?! Everything was great, I was enjoying the game and having a load of fun. I play in servers with about 100ms ping, and it's been fine. But ever since the new season (specifically when the game became free on Xbox pass) it's been unplayable. Even with just 100ms ping, the game is rubber banding in this weird way where the game speeds up and slows down on loop. This has been happening for weeks and has gotten worse! I can't believe this game has taken such a step back.

Update 5 (Positive):
I can finally recommend this game again! I've been having an absolute blast in portal hardcore modes. Most of the issues I previously described have been mostly fixed. There are still severe stability issues that need to be addressed, but the game has been steadily improving. I still hate EA and DICE for launching an unfinished game, but credit where credit is due, I'm having a blast playing it. I hope the devs keep up the good work, there is still much to be fixed and features to be added but I believe this game is a diamond in the rough, a future gem!

Update 4 (Negative):
The lack of a proper server browser is proving to be very frustrating. The new content and map reworks have been a welcome addition to the game. Certainly helps make the game more fun. DICE are on the right track but not quite there yet.

Update 3 (Negative):
DICE has made huge progress. Still a buggy piece of shit that runs like crap. But at least it's a fun piece of shit.

Update 2 (Negative):
Still fucking sucks. They've made some progress but I think the game is fundamentally bad even if DICE fixes all the issues it will still not be a ""good"" battlefield game. I realized this after going back to BF4, a game that was also broken on launch. The difference is that it suffered technical issues not game design flaws like this pile of crap. RIP battlefield series. 

Update 1 (Negative):
How disappointing, the more I played this game, the more things fell apart. I won't bore you with a list of issues since countless players have already done that. The final straw was the game suddenly running like crap on my system, even after a clean restart, pinning my CPU at 100% while only using ""50%"".

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER BATTLEFIELD GAME UNTIL 2042 IS FIXED! Until then my confidence and trust in this series is broken

The input lag and such is gone now but sudden crashes with threats of losing save data is scary as f, but it doesn't happen too often. 

Quite disappointed that DICE have confirmed that season 4 will be the last specialist and will be focusing on feedback updates and (quote"" on ""quote) ""cosmetics"". 

I hope that in the future we don't have another battlefield 5 and star wars battlefront 2 where they made the game great and just abandons them in focus of something that is relatively worse when they could've stuck with the games and made it better and amazing.

Overall, I think the game is now playable with its updates and fixes but things still feel off here there and then, and good job Devs team, please don't abandon this game when you fixed it finally.

BF2042 has certainly came a long way from its well-deserved very criticized state at launch.  The devs, however new since the vets left at the state after launch, made good on the promise and actually made the game better. Kudos on them focusing on improving gameplay, season content and constant community feedback for the past 2 years. Give this game a go again when you undoubtedly buy it during a discount and see for yourself actual battlefield again. Me sticking around to play for another 456 hours is testament to their commitment in making bf2042 the gold standard of live service game that it is today. Also fuck you EA execs this is how bf2042 should have launched.

Its a model that demands your time and takes time from more casual games (What little is left without a BP anymore) and as someone who doesnt sit on one game it just gets old.

- Its a totally different game from Launch. Just short of a Destiny Taken King type Turn Around if only they didnt die on the hill that is Operators. But Classes are back, the Weapons feel good, The maps play alright given the circumstances and reworks.

- Dice as a Studio has once again come into their own and are competent with the Game Engine, This entire studio kind of flipped on its Head with Senior staff leaving for greener pastures. It was a painful walk through a confused and muddled vision of ""what the game should be"" between bugs, feature delays, season delays, and the infamous Operator system

- Its a good looking game, weapons and environments are nice to look at. The overall gunplay feels more relaxed but still rewards more perceptive/reactive players, Plenty of UI communication tools, A scoreboard (finally) and in game Voice/ Text chats (both. finally.) for communication 

- Theres a healthier balance between Classes & Operators & the Newer Maps play much better. Overall there is a lot more of a team dynamic in games with the rework to operators the introduction of a sub class system within them. People are actually playing Medic yay! The old maps are clunky and a poorly suited for what the Franchise generally holds in store (BF4 Level-ution anyone) and in general play pretty poorly with how open they are alone. Some maps have been reworked but it still feels a little too open in certain spaces

The Cons

- Its an EA game. Enough said

- Playlists are lacking, and theres very little focus on the other modes with Hazard Zone removing features simply to populate lobbies rather than address issues to make it stand out as another way to play (I liked the raid style loadout and economy systems in a more casual game its a bummer it went away) while Portal seemed more setup to become a crutch for a lacking Dev Playlist. Mostly generic or repeat servers serving only to grind XP rather than mix and match the Eras of BF have become the norm. Making 2/3 gamemodes seem like a lot of un-needed bulk taking from the core experience

- You never know what update is going to break the game for you. It started with S2 bugs but has followed down the line into S6 and the random choice to switch from Easy Anti Cheat to EA Anti Cheat which basically broke installs across the board. Same like when they Moved everything over to the EA App and phased out Origin. If its not the Game its EA Play disconnecting and refusing to work normally. The Invisible Hardware bug still plagues the game to the point Ive played a few hours since S6 dropped. In reguards to S2 everything was so broken you couldnt tell it was a AAA Game Studio. 

Overall. Its fun. its become my go to casual shooter in a world plagued by grindy BPs and generic Battle Royales. I havent paid for a Season Pass out of my own pocket since I got mine in S3 and Its kept me playing enough to finish all those Passes and rebuy the next with what you earn from the Pass. But with how Live Service works I cant recommend a game that is this ""old"" even if its gotten a new season recently. Its got issues but its been a complete turn around from Day 1 and in comparison to Games like Call of Duty with the MW3 DLC/Reboot/WZ Tutorial and Halo Infinite with its greedy begging for money to fund itself with cosmetics despite MS being worth billions. Gaming today sucks. Dust of the PS2/Xbox OG or ps3/360 and play the classics",1664690458,1700813836,False,0,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

- Black screen of death every 2-3 games, only option to resolve is to alt+f4 and restart the game
- Crashes happening from time to time
- Textures not loading properly
- Parachute bug : When you are on the floor sprinting, sometimes your character will ""fall"" for .5 seconds and the game thinks you're in the air so it deploys the parachute
- Recently they had a mouse bug where the mouse would just not respond in the game for a good 5 seconds and your character would stutter. They fixed this one quick as the game was unplayable, but each update a new one will appear.
- Can't bind/unbind as you wish and if you somehow manage to do it in the game folders, it will reset it next time.

And many more...

The gunsmith system and customisation is almost non-existent. It's very basic and every gun has the same attachments. But you can bet your ass you have 100 of cosmetics available. The stats of every gun also means nothings... Firepower of 60? Ok but the gun does 22 damage per bullet so what is firepower? AM40 has 30 of firepower but does more damage than the m5 that has 50 firepower, so what now?

Destruction has been downgraded. It was a fun mechanic in other BF games, but in this one there isn't a lot of it (remember the Shanghai tower in BF4?).

Specialists is also another bad thing. I'm sure they made it to appeal to the COD audience and to sell skins for your so cool over the top specialist. Except they are unbalanced and doesn't fit in a BF game; everyone looks the fucking same also instead of 2 armies facing each other.
