However, the company and publishers who've made this game are a bunch of greedy cun7$ that deserve no money from me and won't be getting it ever again. This game was only special because of what it could have been,  and the love and dedication that people put into the mods for this game truly completed it, as when it was released (in a rush i'm sure for that stupid 11/11/11 date) the game was a complete buggy Bethesda mess. I only enjoyed my time in the game being able to mod it and try the things that other people were making out. Since this game's release Bethesda has continued their dramatic decline into money hungry sh!tshills. Everything they've made it seems like post the release of this masterpiece seems to have had $$$$ as it's sole focus. 

Screw the game, screw the story, screw the engine it's fine it works. These people disgust me and you should support them. smaller and smaller studios have been making better and better games, no need to waste time on over marketed, soul-less, money grubbing, bullsh!t like this. I mean truly, the last good games Bethesda made were PERHAPS fallout 4, and for sure fallout new vegas and 3.

Anything newer has been obviously reaching for your wallet and somehow worse and worse in performance each release. The games aren't fun, their engine sucks. You want to experience these stories? watch youtube videos, they respect your time and wallet more than these b@stards.

Curious if the old workshop files are still live with those l@zyCun t$ trying to charge for other people's passionate mod work. 

It's infuriating. Todd Howard is a POS.  I'd have recommended this but nobody will see this review, cause Bethesda missing half it's chromosomes and can't come up with a new idea to save its' life.

This comment is specifically written on the off-chance that some Bethesda executive or employee might read it some day. You suck, and you destroyed the love I had for your games. I  will NEVER pay you money for a damn thing again. My attitude has only been vindicated by seeing how awful Starfield is. Not worth a cent.

Revisiting, in a more serious light this time.

Skyrim need no introduction, so I'll just say this.
The game has kept me entertained for half of my life now, whether it was my first run on PS3, or now, modded to Oblivion and back. The game isn't perfect, it's bugged, unstable, kind of stiff when you think about it, but it's people's comfort place for a good reason. Even these many years later, when i can speedrun some of my favorite locations with my eyes closed, the game is still fun to revisit and try again.
Be a vampire, or a vampire slayer! Wecome a werewolf! A mage! A master assassin or a member of the thieves guild! Build your own home with friendly necromancer neighbours, marry your favorite follower, or get a mod and take the Moonpath to Elsweyr! Pretty much anything is possible if you want it to be.

I feel that's exactly what runs this game the most these days - mod support and vast range of choice among them. Quests, items, places, companions...you name it. Friendly dragons? Sure, why not.

Who doesn't know Skyrim given it re-released so many times it probably has fridge version somewhere too. Unsurprising though, I think it still holds title of the best Bethesda title. If I ever need a 'bethesda game' this is typically the best choice. By saying that it's one of those games where you keep redoing the same thing like yet another tomb and still find some addictive joy of exploration in it. All TES games have that, so do Fallouts...apparently not Starfield ;p
It's probably not the best TES entry but it's best balanced in terms of looking good, alright systems and passable writing. Certainly most accessible entry as well and, again, 2nd 3rd and 5th life breathed into it through mods.
Just for appropriateness sake to the newcomers I should generally say it's a high fantasy rpg where its most defining features are huge map with plenty of places of interest to explore, not too much intrusive plot to stand in a way of said exploration and skill system working around getting better in something as you simply do it.

If you don't have any version of Skyrim on PC yet, I would recommend the Special Edition of this game unless you are interested in running very specific SKSE mods. (SKSE64 is now available and stable, but there a few older mods that haven't been ported over that are dependent on SKSE functions, which don't just drag and drop over)

When you sink over 600 hours into a single player game, you realise you can't criticise its faults as easily anymore. I could mention that Bethesda are awful at writing stories, and that all the NPC's have a personality of video game executives presenting at E3. I could mention that a lot of the magic disappears after your first playthrough, or that you need mods to add replay value, or that bug testing is a joke at Bethesda.

But I still played over 600 hours and bought all the expansion content, so I must like something in Skyrim, like the world design, and the vistas after jumping up the side of a mountain, or installing a 200+ mod list and having it work, or that first experience that every modern Bethesda game does when you first step out of the introduction cave into a massive open valley, and seeing a large town in the distance and deciding to ignore the main quest and run off in the opposite direction to see where you end up... or accidently killing the chicken in Riverwood and having to massacre the entire town as they exact revenge on your evil chicken slaughtering ways.",1478190674,1707676105,True,3,2,0.536322593688964844,0,True,False,False

Set in the sprawling, snow-covered province of Skyrim, the game immerses players in the life of the Dragonborn, a prophesied hero born with the power of The Voice, on a quest to defeat Alduin, a dragon who is foretold to destroy the world. This review assesses ""Skyrim"" based on its gameplay mechanics, story and world-building, graphical and audio presentation, modding community impact, and overall entertainment value.

Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 8/10 - Good
""Skyrim"" offers an expansive open-world experience, allowing players to explore at their leisure, from towering mountains to deep dungeons. The game features a wide variety of skills, from combat and magic to crafting and stealth, enabling diverse character builds and playstyles. While the freedom to choose one's path is a hallmark of the experience, some players might find combat mechanics to be less refined compared to more recent titles, with occasional clunkiness in melee combat and AI behavior.

Story and World-Building
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
Bethesda excels in creating a rich, immersive world teeming with lore, factions, and history. The main questline, involving the Dragonborn's battle against Alduin, is complemented by numerous side quests and stories that delve into Skyrim's culture, politics, and mythology. The depth of the world-building contributes significantly to the game's allure, encouraging exploration and interaction. However, some narrative elements can feel disjointed, and the impact of player choices on the game's world is sometimes limited.

Graphical and Audio Presentation
Rating: 7/10 - Good
Upon release, ""Skyrim"" was praised for its beautiful, dynamic environments and atmospheric sound design, including an iconic soundtrack by Jeremy Soule. Over time, the base game's graphics have aged, with textures, character models, and animations falling behind modern standards. Nevertheless, the game's visual and audio presentation still manages to capture the epic and mystical essence of Skyrim, aided significantly by the modding community's enhancements.

Modding Community Impact
Rating: 10/10 - Masterpiece
One of ""Skyrim's"" most enduring legacies is its vibrant modding community, which has continually expanded and revitalized the game with graphical overhauls, new quests, gameplay tweaks, and bug fixes. The ease of modding and the sheer volume of available mods have significantly extended the game's lifespan and appeal, offering tailored experiences that range from the serious to the absurd.

Overall Entertainment Value
""Skyrim"" offers an unparalleled level of freedom and immersion, making it a landmark title in the RPG genre. The game's vast open world, rich lore, and the ability to shape one's adventure provide hundreds of hours of gameplay. Despite its technical and mechanical shortcomings, the overall entertainment value is heightened by the game's moddability, ensuring its place in the hearts of gamers for years to come.

Overall Summary:
""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"" remains a monumental achievement in video game design, offering a deeply immersive and customizable experience. Its impact on the RPG genre and gaming culture is undeniable, offering a blend of exploration, storytelling, and player freedom that has set a benchmark for open-world games.

A must-buy all-time masterpiece for all RPG fans and those seeking an expansive, immersive gaming experience. ""Skyrim"" is a must-play title that offers endless adventures in a world that feels alive and ripe for exploration.

""Skyrim"" has cemented its status as one of the most influential and beloved games of its generation. Its legacy is not just in the countless hours spent exploring its rich landscape but also in how it has inspired a community of players and modders to keep the world of Skyrim alive and evolving. Whether you're shouting dragons from the sky, delving into ancient ruins, or simply gazing at the northern lights from a mountaintop, ""Skyrim"" promises an adventure that is as boundless as your imagination.",1706981324,1706981324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Picture this: I embarked on a journey so immersive that I forgot to eat, sleep, or even blink for days on end. I've emerged from my gaming cocoon a changed person - more like a potato than a human, but hey, who's judging?

Let me set the stage for you. I boot up Skyrim, innocent and full of hope. Little did I know, I was about to be sucked into a black hole of dragons, shouting, and more cheese wheels than I ever thought possible. Within minutes, I was hooked like a fish on a line, except instead of water, it was a sea of mead and molten lava.

The first thing that struck me was the graphics. Oh boy, they were so breathtakingly mediocre that I wept tears of joy. Who needs next-gen when you've got textures that look like they were hand-painted by a blindfolded toddler? And don't even get me started on the character models - I've seen more realistic faces on a Picasso painting.

But let's talk about the NPCs. These guys are like broken records stuck on repeat. I swear, every villager in Skyrim has the memory of a goldfish and the conversational skills of a particularly dim rock. ""I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee."" Yeah, yeah, we've all heard it a million times, mate. Get a new hobby!

And then there are the dragons. Oh, the majestic dragons! They soar through the sky with all the grace of a drunk pigeon, spewing fire and terrorizing the populace. But fear not, for I, the mighty Dragonborn, am here to save the day!

From the second your character wakes up you are pulled into this world that rivals the depth of tolkien himself. You are immediately given the problems of the world, that being dragons and war, in one of the most spectacular game opening I have experienced and we have only just begun. 

Once into the actual world you are greeted with a unique art style and with the help of Jeremy Soules soundtrack you are brought into the world of tamriel. The most mundane tasks like picking butterflies and thistles for alchemy turn into a sort of therapy. While the random encounters may be repetitive they have earned a special place in my heart. 

The quests, both main and side quests, just drive you further into the lived in world. From the thieves guild to the vampires each faction gives you a story and a call to action that truly makes you feel like more than the dragonborn. 

And lastly, where would skyrim be without the modders. The modding community has kept this game alive and thriving throughout the years. Taking the gift that were given and expanding on it like we have never seen. The cultural impact this game has had on not only myself but this generation of gamers has exceeded all expectation I had when I picked up my first copy on a fateful night at game stop. The only other game that I would compare this too is half life, both games have given people opportunities to expand themselves and test their personal limits when it comes to game development. There is no doubt in my mind that this game will continue to thrive and stand the test of time. Thank you Bethesda for this gift and thank you to the modders that keep this game going today.

You can create your own character, choose your playstyle, and explore a vast and beautiful world. Whether you want to save the world from dragons, join a faction, or just wander around, Skyrim lets you do it.

The game has a fantastic engine that allows you to mod it to your liking. There are thousands of mods available that add new content, features, graphics, and more. Some of the mods that I recommend are [SkyUI], which improves the user interface, [Ordinator], which overhauls the perk system, and [Immersive Weapons], which adds hundreds of new weapons to the game.

The gameplay is fun and engaging, with a variety of quests, locations, and characters to discover. You can fight with swords, bows, magic, or stealth, and customize your skills and equipment. Some of the most memorable quests for me were The Dark Brotherhood, which involves assassinating targets, The Thieves Guild, which involves stealing and sneaking, and The College of Winterhold, which involves learning and using magic.

The game also has amazing graphics, music, and voice acting. The landscapes are stunning, the soundtrack is epic, and the voice actors are talented. The game creates a rich and immersive atmosphere that makes you feel like you are part of the world.

The only thing that I think is missing from the game is a multiplayer option. Playing alone can be boring at times, and I would love to share my adventures with my friends. Luckily, there is a mod called Skyrim Together Reborn that allows you to play Skyrim in co-op with your friends or strangers. This mod is an overhaul for the game that adds new features, lore-friendly replacers, and translations for various languages. However, you should also be aware that this mod is still in development and may have some bugs or compatibility issues. You should also read the mod’s requirements and installation instructions carefully before trying it out.

Skyrim is the best RPG game out there for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, adventure, and freedom. It is a game that you can play for hundreds of hours and never get bored. It is a game that you can make your own. It is a game that you can enjoy with your friends. Buy it!",1356888195,1705782746,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

That is still mostly the case due to most Oldrim mods having been ported to SE, some vanilla quality of life improvements in SE, and many mods built for SE that either don’t have official Oldrim versions or simply cannot be ported to Oldrim.

takes 5 min to reach from level 15 conjuration to level 70 conjuration
takes another 5 min to reach from level 70 to legendary, rinse and repeat till maximum satisfaction.

how did i do it?
- i had 4 enchanted items with 27% conjuration magicka cost reduction
- left click set to conjure dremora
- right click set to conjure flame atronach
- quick travel to camps or mammoth sites to find a dragon
- while the dragon is alive, left click right click left click right click left click right click to a certain rhythm
- occasionally cast restoration or drink hp potion

voila eureka, even faster than cheesing through iron daggers.

Skyrim is an timeless, epic game with a massive world, endless possibilities and a very strong replay value.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has a relatively simple, but powerful story. Because this game is mainly focused on this story, I will spoil nothing. If you never played the game, this is something that you need to experience for yourself.

You start an empty character from various races, can customize almost every inch of their bodies and then start your adventure in the world of Skyrim. You are free to roam wherever you want, when you want, how you want, all at the very start of the game, after the tutorial. This game is the definition of “nonlinear” and freedom.

Right from the start, you get sucked into its beautiful open world, and can start leveling up your skills, picking some flowers, mine some ore, collect garbage to sell at vendors and finally murdering that bunny that you chased all the way to Riften.  

Even today, I still think Skyrim looks glorious. Sure, the textures can be a little rough here and there, animations are not as “flawless” as today’s games and flowers can look like cardboard cutouts, but for its time, this was revolutionary. There is just so much detail in everything. Wildlife, flowers, sunlight, moonlight, grass, mountains, it is all just great. Every cabin, every cave and every ruin is filled with countless items, details and decorations, and you can interact with almost all of it. Sure, this is a Bethesda game, so glitching and clipping is a thing, but that is the whole charm of this game. Seeing a bucket being launched at 320 km/h because it was too close to a table is just hilarious. 

Enemies are greatly designed and form a well balanced mix of beasts, monsters, bandits and supernatural beings.

Sound wise, Skyrim is a work of art. The sound effects, voice acting, and (ambient) music is just perfect. When walk around town, just wanting to buy some supplies, a calm and peaceful track plays in the background. When you get ambushed by a hungry dragon and the male orchestra voices play, you now that sh!t just got serious. 

The menu’s, controls and interfaces work great and the overall mechanics of the game are pretty realistic. You can become overburdened with all the crap you carry with you, you can attract vile diseases from certain enemies like the Skeevers (giant rats), you can experience serious problems or debuffs when not sleeping enough, it just adds more fun and challenge to the game. 

Combat works flawlessly and, with the right fighting style, can be intense and brutal. The beauty of the combat and learning curve, it is that you get nuked in the beginning by a Giant for example, level up your Heavy Armor skill, health and One Handed, come back to him, and shove that club of his so hard into his brown star until he finally gets the message that you are done with his sh!t.

The leveling system is also pretty unique, same as Fallout 3 for example. Instead of killing stuff and earn XP, you level all different skills by performing attacks or action in that category. Crouching past enemies undetected increases your Sneak, forging a million iron daggers improves your smithing, letting yourself get bludgeoned like a baby seal while wearing light armor increases your “Light Armor” skill etc. By leveling up your different skills, you earn general XP for your character level. With each new level, you can increase health, stamina, magika (mana) and choose a unique ability in the skill tree of one of your skills.

I especially love figuring out all the exploits the game has to level up your skills faster, try to move your horse over a 90 degrees slope, trying to get to space with the help of a giant and overall, fully explore (and exploit) everything this great game has to offer.

The best part of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is simply that there is just soooooo much to do. You got a gigantic world map with hundreds of caves, crypts, enclaves, towns, cities, outposts, ruins, tombs and bandit camps, all waiting for you to explore, conquer and plunder. There are (in my opinion) a million quests to undertake and, like many, I got so caught up in the side quests, that I actually reached level 50 and still needed to visit the Greybeards, who almost died of old age when I finally got there. You can experiment with your skills, different weapons, different play styles and overall, this game can hook you up for literal days in terms of playtime.

This is one of those games in which you actually feel really powerful when leveling up enough, and all your hard work is actually reflected through your damage output, constitution and overall feel. This sounds pretty basic, but a lot of games do not actually reward you with power or feeling of might and pride when you reach level 80 for example.

Enemies level along with you, keeping the game and experience gain for your skill balanced, but there simply comes a point that they stand no chance anymore and if you are willing to spend two hundred hours of play in a character, this time is rewarded. With Sneak and Archery leveled to 100, every arrow is a insta kill and five enemies can be killed in five seconds while you are hidden. 

This is also the only small problem with Skyrim. At one point, you are so stupidly powerful (all skills maxed) that there is just no challenge and point anymore. It will takes thousands of hours for this point to be reached, but eventually, you are just too strong. 

In the end, I think The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the best games ever made, and although it is considered a relic in present days, it’s legacy lives on forever in forms of memes, jokes, punch lines and references. It gives you worth for your money and in my opinion, every gamer is obligated to have this piece of art in their library.

Definitely recommend this timeless classic.",1705069451,1705069451,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If your debating on giving this a try please do! don't let others dissuade you from forming your own opinion on a game like this, the only reason it gets memed about being re-released cause Bethesda will never recreate the success this game had so they need to milk it out long as possible. i'm not gonna hold my breath for ES6.

While the developers pushed out a few patches, the game is still fraught with bugs, and numerous times I would encounter one of these issues on console and be unable to do anything about it except reloading my save and praying that fixed it. (90% of the time, reloading didn't fix it). I'm talking game-breaking bugs, too. Thankfully, dedicated players created the Unofficial Skyrim Patch, which you can easily install on PC versions and is a real lifesaver.

All in all, if you enjoy 'western' RPGs where you can build your character however you want, and you enjoy large environments to explore, letting you choose the order you complete objectives, this is for you. For those looking for a more linear experience, it might be a little overwhelming when you first walk out of the tutorial area and the whole country literally opens up to you. 

Combat moves in real time; there is no turn-based strategy here. It follows the same style as previous Elder Scrolls titles. With that in mind, now in 2017 it might feel a little janky, but it still holds up and is pretty easy to learn. Your character's skills (both combat and non-combat) increase the more you actually use them, which I personally really love. While different races at the start have a few points in specific areas, you can really build them however you want. Want an orc that's a real smooth-talker and favors archery? You can do that.

Considering this is the 5th entry in the Elder Scrolls series, there is background lore, and it will dump a bunch of terms unfamiliar to players at the start if they haven't played previous entries. (I was one of those people). Thankfully the game offers plenty of ways through dialogue, books, and quests to learn the story, and (the fun part) to build your own around it. For those uninterested in story, you don't really need to know or pay attention to any of it to progress through the game.

The major boon to playing on PC: MODS. The modding community for The Elder Scrolls has always been strong, and it's no exception for Skyrim. For those who enjoy a purely vanilla experience, you can do that, sure. But there are hundreds, if not thousands of talented and creative people who have essentially given access to free DLC, and you can make your own with the Creation Kit Bethesda released right here on Steam.

Speaking of DLC, both story DLC, Dawnguard and Dragonborn, are absolutely worth it. The 3rd DLC, Hearthfire, is really for those looking to add some new 'home-making' functionality to the game. With Hearthfire, your Orc archer from before can also own his own farm, raise a pair of orphans he found, and bake delicious pastries. I'm not joking. Personally, that's right up my alley, but for some it's not their cup of tea, so they won't be buying it. That being said, keep in mind the Legendary edition of the game comes bundled with all 3 DLC.

I feel bad I'm posting this review in 2017, when this came out in 2011. Oops. But that's about it. If any of this appeals to you, buy it. It's cheap now.",1506362020,1704664934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-OST
-Atmosphere! Arguably the strongest point of the game, especially combined with the music. It can be nice to just walk around and look at a setting that has held up shockingly well for its age.
-more mods than I know what to do with (I guess they're paid now? fuck that)

Now for the bad*:
-combat feels stiff and unsatisfying, even the unique death animations wear out their welcome pretty quick
-despite being the flagship feature, dragons are pretty poorly implemented and aren't all that exciting to fight IMO
-frequently rewards the player for breaking immersion (be real, you didn't naturally progress your blacksmithing skill, you made 500 iron daggers in a row and were suddenly a master)
-RPG elements have regressed from Oblivion, which was itself a regression from Morrowind in this regard
-allowing the player to become faction leader of all factions (with the exception of whichever civil war side you don't choose) in a few in-game days cheapens all of them (the mage's guild in particular stands out here, you can put the bare minimum into spellcasting and get to be archmage in an in-game week)

The game has plenty of side missions that are quite fun to do. The ability to create characters freely, from appearance to armor, and combine different classes is very cool so that the game doesn't get boring quickly (one day you can run around as a typical archer in light armor and the next day as a mage in heavy armor). When I got bored with the main storyline and side missions, I started modding this game, and you can make a completely different game out of it. The resource of mods is so huge that you can change whatever you like. For me, this game is already partly a classic, to which I will certainly return.

오랜 시간 나는 태양이 내리쬐는 드넓은 대초원과 얼어붙은 설원의 꼭대기와 어둡고 거대하며 끝없는 동굴과 낡고 오래된 고대의 유적과 수많(지는 않)은 도시를 다녔다. 나는 한때 마법사였고 전사였으며 도적이었고 사냥꾼이었으며 언젠가는 용을 부리는 구세의 기사였다가 9개 주에서 현상금이 걸린 스카이림의 공적이 된 적도 있었다. 나는 때론 종족을 불문한 청년의 모습이었고 때론 노인의 모습이었으나 대부분의 시간은 아름다운 인간의 모습으로 존재했다. 

내게 주어진 세계는 매번 새로웠고 도시 안팎의 사람들과 생물체들 역시 내게 자주 다른 모습을 보여주었다. 그런 즐거움에 빠져 세계를 도는 횟수가 많아질수록 세계가 열리는데 걸리는 시간은 늘어났으나 다행스럽게도 그 시간은 충분히 보상받곤 했다. 나는 기뻤다.


긴 시간이 지나고, 나는 이제 스카이림의 세계가 아닌 다른 세계들을 여행한다. 핵전쟁으로 황폐해진 폐허를 벗과 오랜 기간 거닐기도 하였고 갖가지 환경에서 스카이림의 괴수보다 더욱 커다랗고 다양한 괴물들을 사냥하는 것을 업으로 삼고 지내기도 하였다. 뙤약볕 아래 공룡들을 길들이며 섬에서 탈출하려고 애써보기도 하고, 아름다운 소녀들과 해변에서 비치발리볼을 즐기기도 하였으며, 지구의 곳곳에서 일어나는 응급상황을 전화받고 처리하다가, 또 여전사가 되어 활과 총을 능숙하게 다루며 초현실적인 세계의 비밀을 캐내기도 했다.

모든 세계가 항상 즐겁지는 않았지만, 대부분의 시간은 즐거웠다. 그러나 기쁜 곳은 매우 드물었으며, 스카이림만큼 기뻤던 곳은 없었다.


검은 화면이 전환되며 세계가 새로이 열리던 시간. 그리고 내가 온전히 누릴 수 있는 자유를 떠올릴 때마다, 나는 내가 게이머로서 참으로 기뻤던 시간을 기억한다.

아직도 선명하게 떠오르는 스카이림의 시작을 추억하며.

       nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
       that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we

It does a lot of things very poorly (e.g. optimization, combat, magic, some skill trees), some other things are just mediocre (e.g. dialogue options, writing/quest lines, some other skill trees) and a handful of things are done very well (e.g. music, visual world design, scale, general vibes/atmosphere). You'd think that would make the game around a 4/10 overall, but those few good things do some serious heavy lifting.

It's quite easy to fall in love with this game at first sight, probably thanks in large part to it's aforementioned biggest strengths being things that heavily affect surface-level appeal and initial impressions. I for one am guilty of becoming a white knight for Bethesda and refusing to acknowledge the game being any less than perfect. See below my first review of Skyrim.

""This game has to be my all time favourite. Although many people who were introduced to The Elder Scrolls series earlier than myself would argue that Skyrim is dumbed down and falls short of the greatness of earlier titles such as Morrowind or Oblivion, I absolutely love it. The game has great aesthetics, a huge amount of lore and best of all, an amazing modding community. Although i personally love the character customisation, questlines, skill trees, DLC, craftable weaposn and armor, combat style and quite frankly, every aspect of this game, i understand most of these arent everyones cup of tea. Regardless though, i would highly recommend this game despite it being released almost four years prior to this review. Also, can't wait for The Elder Scrolls VI! That is, whenever Bethesda decides to make it (The next Fallout installment is probably coming first though :/ )""

It is also quite easy to grow to hate this game. As they say, love and hate are two sides of the same coin, and a common example of this is when something you thought you loved betrays your expectations. As I said before, Skyrim is very good at creating a positive initial impression, but it also has a lot of issues. These may be easy to overlook at first, but are likely to become more tedious and obvious the longer you play. Add in a splash of overzealous fandom and it's not hard to see how someone might not realize how far short the game falls of their expectations until after they've already invested a lot of time and energy. Even if they don't go as far as seeking revenge due to a sense of betrayal, someone in this position may simply become extra harsh on the game out of a desire to push developers toward creating games that do actually live up to the idea they fell in love with. Once again, I myself am guilty of turning from fanboy to hater overnight for similar reasons. See below the edit I made to my initial review around this time.

""Addendum, I wrote this when I was 15 and had never played an RPG before in my life. Skyrim is hot garbage, Bethesda is particularly hot garbage. Power to you if you can enjoy the game, but from a critical standpoint it's absolute trash. Even for it's time, the only thing it impressed in was graphics, and even that field was kinda meh compared to a lot of less hyped titles coming out at the time. If you've never played an RPG before, then by all means, but if you're coming from something like The Witcher or a popular indie title, you're gonna find a clunky, extremely poorly aged mess full of glitches and poor writing. Talk about a 180 in opinon, huh? Guess that's what happens when you appeal to an audience of people who don't know any better, then those people grow up.""

The idea of a game like Skyrim - a high-budget first-person action RPG adventure with a huge detailed world, deep lore, tons of player freedom and so on -  done well is still very exciting to me, and seemingly to a lot of other people (see Cyberpunk 2077 initial marketing and hype). Skyrim isn't that, but it is one of only a handful of games to attempt that, and while it does fall short it's still pretty fun. I recommend you play it if you haven't already.

With all that being said, if I could choose whether or not to buy Skyrim for the first time today, I would not. The game is fine, but personally I would rather not support a company like Bethesda.",1383168733,1703315029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was amazed by the stunning graphics and the immersive feel of the game, which made me feel like I was really in a fantasy world. The game was released in 2011, but it still looks great today, especially with the help of mods that enhance the visuals and add new features.

The game gives you a lot of freedom and choice in how you play. You can follow the main story or you can ignore the main story and explore the vast map, which is filled with hundreds of locations, quests, and secrets. You can join different factions, such as the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, or the College of Winterhold, and complete their missions.

It is not a perfect game, though. It has its share of bugs and glitches, which can sometimes ruin the immersion or cause frustration. Some of the quests and characters can also be repetitive and bland, and the dialogue can be awkward and cheesy. The combat system can also be clunky and unbalanced, depending on your playstyle and the difficulty level. The game's user interface and inventory system can also be cumbersome and frustrating to use, especially on PC.

Despite its flaws, Elder Scrolls Skyrim is one of the best RPGs ever made and a must-play for anyone who loves fantasy and adventure. It offers a huge amount of content and fun for a reasonable price. It is a game that you can easily spend hundreds of hours playing and still find new things to do and see. It is a game that will make you feel like you are part of a living, breathing world that you can shape and influence with your actions. It is a game that you should not miss.

I watched every episode of that series until it ended in 2014, and my desire for the game and love for it's plot and aesthetic sorta died down. In 2018, I purchased a copy of the Skyrim texture pack for Minecraft XBOX One, and that caused my love for the idea of Skyrim to be reinvigorated, but not for all too long. This past year, I got a 10-year-old Windows 10 Desktop computer for free and chose to purchase this game and accompanying DLC. After playing the game, I came to the wonderful realization that Skyrim was exactly how I envisioned it to be all those years ago back in 2013---including the bugs! I can't describe why or how I love this game, but I can safely say this game is one of, if not objectively, my favorite game.

I think when I last played a elder scrolls game (marrow wind) I was more interested in other games and the story didn't have me too involved since it was such a open world, however this is quite different and they've clearly improved in many places, especially one problem I found was the old journal system, this is FAR better and steam workshop to upload mods just makes it so much better to do simple things like fix errors, better UI, optional beginnings and so on. I haven't touched many of the cosmetic mods, but this game is definitely worth the price. However I recommend getting it only if you have the free time. It's a HUGE world and there are a lot of things to do in it no matter if you choose to be a somewhat nice guy or a evil bastard.

Edit: With time, this game has aged like milk from how the company keeps reposting the same damn game over and over again that has huge worlds, but next-to-no content in this world that they boast about whilst also being filled with bugs that the far better and more competent modding community have fixed decades ago, at this point!

It seems Bethesda are great at making these empty shell of a game, but, refuse to actually put anything into this shell and get angry when others out there fill it up with their own things. To the point that they are once again attempting to do the whole ""paid mods"" thing that they tried to get away with last time with Fallout 4 and the creation club, however, they didn't learn their lesson from last time. Especially, as pointed out, the mods on the creation club are nowhere near as good as those for free and they were FAR too restrictive in regards to what mods added, including going on about lore and such when they violate that far too much themselves!

I've given up giving Bethesda any money or benefit of the doubt because they've shown themselves that they don't care about the games themselves, but how much they can squeeze out of you. It's especially apparent in the DLC  they release often being the equivalent to mods you get for free, with some excuses.",1334837343,1702468337,False,0,0,0.521183252334594727,0,True,False,False

[i] [The scene opens with sweeping shots of the majestic landscapes of Skyrim, accompanied by David Attenborough's distinctive narration.]

David Attenborough: Welcome, dear viewers, to the enchanting realm of Skyrim—a land of dragons, wizards, and, as we shall soon discover, a carnival of the absurd. As we embark upon this journey, one cannot help but marvel at the breathtaking landscapes that stretch before us.

[Cut to a serene scene of a dragon soaring majestically through the sky.]

David Attenborough: Behold the awe-inspiring dragons, rulers of the skies, their wings cutting through the clouds with a grace that belies their fiery breath. A majestic display of power and elegance.

[Transition to a shot of a character attempting to scale a mountain but continually getting stuck.]

David Attenborough: But, as we delve deeper into this intricate ecosystem, we encounter adventurers facing challenges of a different kind. Here we see a climber struggling against the whims of gravity, attempting to ascend Skyrim's treacherous terrain.

[Cut to footage of an NPC running endlessly into a wall.]

David Attenborough: Ah, the wall-runner, a curious specimen indeed. With boundless enthusiasm, it explores the boundaries of its virtual enclosure, displaying a commitment to discovery that transcends the laws of the digital realm.

[Shift to a scene of a heavily modded Skyrim with characters wearing absurd outfits.]

David Attenborough: And now, dear viewers, we delve into the fascinating world of modding. A realm where creativity knows no bounds, and the inhabitants of Tamriel don outfits that challenge the very fabric of fashion. Dragons as superheroes, guards in tutus—a vibrant tapestry woven by the hands of digital artisans.

[Cut to a character with the head of Todd Howard.]

David Attenborough: Behold the Toddasaurus Rex, a creature with an uncanny ability to persuade unsuspecting souls to embark on countless adventures, across platforms and generations. A marketing marvel, if you will.

[Quick montage of various bugs, glitches, and absurdities.]

David Attenborough: It appears that Skyrim, much like the ever-expanding universe, is in a constant state of flux. From interpretive dance dragons to mountain-climbing adventurers, the tapestry of Skyrim's existence is woven with threads of unpredictability.

[The scene transitions back to the chaos unfolding—the guards, dragons, mudcrabs, and cyclists.]

David Attenborough: And now, as we return to the theatre of the absurd, where banana-wielding guards, melodious dragons, and the mighty Toddasaurus Rex converge in a spectacle that defies comprehension.

[The chaos escalates, and David Attenborough's bewilderment grows.]

David Attenborough: This... this is perplexity! This is modding madness! This is Skyrim, a world where the extraordinary becomes commonplace, and the laws of reality are mere suggestions.

[The Skyrim theme swells as the scene continues its chaotic dance, with guards, dragons, mudcrabs, and cyclists contributing to the bewildering spectacle. The Skyrim theme echoes into the digital abyss as the scene fades out.] [/i]

🎶 Are you bound for Whiterun, my friend?
Remember me when you enter in,
In Skyrim's realm, where the dragons soar,
Tell them to shout, let their voices roar.

🎶 Speak to the Jarl and the townsfolk true,
In Whiterun's walls, where the sweetrolls brew,
And if you find a modder's lair,
Tell them to craft a world so rare.

🎶 Tell me sweet little lies, Todd,
In your tales of worlds abroad,
In Tamriel where the dragons fly,
Paint a picture with a radiant sky.

🎶 Whisper sweet little lies, so grand,
In the vastness of this open land,
Oh, Todd, tell me tales so sweet,
In Skyrim, where our adventures meet. [/b]",1701882265,1702423214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died.

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

It's hard to believe that after 12 years, Bethesda has managed to tarnish the legacy of Skyrim even further with its latest debacle, the Creation Club and the ill-fated attempt at reintroducing paid mods. What was once a groundbreaking open-world RPG has now become a sad testament to corporate greed and a blatant disregard for the gaming community.

Firstly, let's talk about the Creation Club. Bethesda had the audacity to repackage and re-release the same old content, slapping a hefty price tag on it as if it were something revolutionary. The so-called ""new"" creations are nothing more than recycled assets and uninspired ideas. It's clear that the focus here is on making a quick buck rather than delivering meaningful and innovative content to the players who have supported the game for over a decade.

The real kicker, however, is the reintroduction of paid mods. After the disastrous attempt nine years ago, one would have thought Bethesda had learned its lesson. Unfortunately, they seem to be deaf to the cries of the gaming community. The modding scene has always thrived on creativity, passion, and a sense of community. However, with paid mods, Bethesda is trying to turn this vibrant ecosystem into a profit-driven marketplace.

Not only are the prices exorbitant, but the quality of some of these paid mods is questionable at best. It's disheartening to see modders who were once driven by their love for the game now motivated solely by the pursuit of financial gain. This shift in focus has led to a decline in the overall quality and authenticity of the mods available.

The worst part is that Bethesda seems oblivious to the negative feedback pouring in from the once-loyal fanbase. The forums are filled with disgruntled players who feel betrayed by a company that was once known for its dedication to its community. It's as if Bethesda has lost touch with what made Skyrim special in the first place – the passion and creativity of its player base.

In conclusion, Skyrim's 12th-anniversary update, featuring the Creation Club and the misguided attempt at reintroducing paid mods, is a stain on the game's legacy. Instead of celebrating a beloved classic, players are left with a bitter taste of corporate greed and a sense of betrayal. It's a sad day for the gaming community when a once-revered title succumbs to the pitfalls of profit-driven decision-making.",1701812171,1701812446,False,4,0,0.522180259227752686,0,True,False,False

That being said, the base story holds up pretty well for a blind run, but afterwards it is done for.

The DLCs are mid-tier, with the story-driven ones giving you only an ounce of content, whilst leaving you thristy for a complete package, a.k.a unfinished products. Considering the base game used to cost 14,99 euros and Dawnguard and Dragonborn used to both be 19,99 [b]RESPECTIVELY[/b], uhh yeah, hell no.

Special Edition licenses were given for free to Legendary Edition license holders (Base + the three paid DLCs [not the HD Texture patch]) and while this is [i]nice[/i], the trade-off of having an in-game shop for [b]PAID RESKINS[/b] in your edition of the game (consuming resources) for a 64-bit translation is a bit on the scales.

The original 32-bit version could be modded spectacularly (my hours are living proof of this) as long as you keep a common sense and don't go overboard with certain nuances of modding. A third party modification known as ENB Series (made by a single dude) allowed to bypass the built-in memory limitation of the 32-bit architecture, by creating additional instances (observable in your task manager) of itself and hooking it with Skyrim, effectively [b]ELIMINATING[/b] the architectural downside of Oldrim and rendering Special Edition obsolete in this regard.

But of course, the original had to be [strike]taken down[/strike] hidden when the ""new"" version appeared, in order to segregate the players and, furthermore, the modding scene.

The ones who mod the hell out of their games will not be saved by the 64-bit architecture, in fact, they will suffer more from it. The congested littery mindset injected into Special Edition is palpable at best.

One thing which old Skyrim used to have lacking however, is the fact it was only available on Steam. Some mods deliberately do not work with cracked Oldrims (because some people are sad and bankrupt on the inside), like Fore's New Idles. Special Edition [b][u]CAN[/u][/b] be obtained on GOG, which kind of boosts its standing a little bit I must admit.

Nevertheless, the original remains superior. Copy-pastes with a few minor tweaks will never justify a full price. Having no conceptual ideas or skills whatsoever.

The soundtrack is pretty good and deserves a bit of praise.

I saw her light up when she played. It was beautiful watching her playfulness come out when she got shot with arrows and ducked her head. She hyped herself up while charging double flame spells. Hyperventilate breaths when she got caught sneaking. Excited she completed a story quest that tied into something else about Skyrim she didn’t understand yet. 

After she completed her own play through on the 360, we built a computer together and she discovered the joy of mods. Adding custom quests, replaying encounters with new gameplay elements, decorating her fancy house it was all joyous to her. I remember days she couldn’t wait to tell me about the new mod she added and how it changed the game and how excited she was to play it more. 

I liked Skyrim a bit, I like Morrowind better. But I will always love Skyrim and consider it the best Bethesda’s done not for the game, but for the way it made my then girlfriend, now wife so happy. It gave us an early way to communicate and to bond over playful things. It made me feel the same happy, excited kid to talk with her about video games like I hadn’t in a decades time.

I know it's confusing that I chose not to just do a new one on PC, but there's a reason: on PC I found myself cheating via the console more than I would like. Unlocking doors when lockpicking got too annoying, instakilling dragons when I didn't feel like fighting them; and I wanted to play the game through genuinely at least once.

 I'm a little upset that Bethesda decided to move to SKSE and leave this one behind, because as far as I can tell you cannot move over your saves without a lot of trouble and compatibility issues (mods), and I started my PC save before SE was really a thing. I imagine once I finish my PS5 game I'll start a new one on SKSE eventually. I'll obviously review SKSE if I get it to work right with my save.


Original review:

I have played this game a lot (compared to other games). I've owned it for about two years? Not sure about the purchase date but I'm too lazy to check. This is going to be a quick little review of this game. 

Bethesda, you really did well here. There is so much to do and it's extremely immersive and fun. ESO (Elder Scrolls Online) seems like an interesting concept of making an online version but from what I can tell the single player Skyrim seems a lot better- but this isn't a review of ESO.

Perhaps one of the best parts of this game is the awesome modding potential- there is so much you can do and add to make your experience truly one of a kind, whether it be house expansions, a new GUI, or something as simple as a texture fix. The modding community is amazing, so don't think that if you finish it through once you're done- there's always more to do.

Some of the quests are a little boring, but they keep you around discovering new places which is fun. Perhaps the worst thing i've encountered so far is how long it takes to obtain gold for houses- it takes a bit. But that doesn't really change my opinion at all.  One minor annoyance is the fact that if you alt-tab into another application (for me, discord) it skrews with the game so you have to restart it so make it work properly (however, you are still able to save before starting, you have to WAIT)

Overall, if you're on the edge about getting it, DO IT. It is such a good game and It doesn't get enough credit. Bethesda really outdid themselves with this game. HOWEVER- The game goes on sale a lot, so if it isn't on sale now, just wait a little bit. (Add to your wishlist and they will email you when it is on sale).

That said, this game borders on unplayable, putting even Release Cyberpunk 2077 to shame.
For some reason Skyrim's bugs have gotten the ""Funny haha bug"" reputation, when in reality, it's marred with game-breaking or even game-ending bugs.
From broken npc behavior, broken quest scripting, crashes, freezes, black screens, random damage outputs, bad physics resulting in insta-deaths, scripts just not triggering and many more.
I have played almost 200 hours here on steam, almost 300 hours on ps3, and many more on ""ill acquired"" versions of the game.
As I have stated above, I have experienced Cyberpunk 2077 on release, and beat the game.
11 years later after it's release, Skyrim has barely seen any fixes, which becomes an even more evident issue when ""Modern"" PC components and Operating Systems start popping up.
This would be an understandable issue if the game had been abandoned by it's Developer/Publisher, but this is far from the case.
Bethesda hid the DLCs for this version from the steam store in an attempt to make people buy the Legendary Edition.
Just like Dark Souls Remastered, this is, for a lack of a better word, a scam.
Dark Souls released in a deplorable state for the PC, so instead of actually patching the game or giving the people who bought that mess a working game they charged 20€ (""""""Discounted"""""") for what was basically a patch.
As it stands, the only way to actually play Skyrim nowadays is with one of the ""Enhanced Editions"", which I don't own, and most likely never will out of sheer spite.

TLDR: Unplayable in modern hardware (and even older hardware), either buy the ""Enhanced Editions"" or suffer through a frustrating bug filled slog...",1670962854,1701103007,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

It was the first ""real"" game I played, and at the time when I had first played it I didn't have much to compare it to. I wanted to play it vanilla now that I've had a few years of experience other games.

I recently started playing it again - I do have an older version which I imagine contributes to my experience in terms of the bugginess of quests breaking etc, and I do try to take into consideration the fact that this game is a decade old. However, overall the game play is repetitive and at times the story and experience feel sloppy and uninteresting. It feels like the quests are the same thing over and over regardless of the guild, or if it's the main quest, or anything - and primarily this has to do with the dungeon design and combat. 

It's overall /fine/ but given how many people love this game, and the face they've been able to resell it like 7 times gave me expectation that the experience would be more than lackluster.

The 2011 fantasy role playing video game Skyrim developed by Bethesda is arguably the most influential modern game of all time. It set an entirely new standard of quality for triple A games to attempt to meet.

You are Dragonborn, meaning you are destined to save the world using your special powers. The world is in turmoil from war, but then things get worse when malignant dragons start to resurrect and attack the world. In Skyrim you will create your own character and forge your own journey forwards. There are many routes to take but at the end of it all you will hopefully bring peace to the world and end war and dragon-related conflict.

Skyrim is the definition of value. It's amount of content is staggeringly large to the point where you could genuinely question whether the game can actually be 100%ed or not. It's a beautiful game and every location you come across is unique and memorable. One of the craziest aspects of the game is that all of those cool snowy mountains you see in the ""skybox,"" is actually not a sky box at all and is a genuine location you can go to yourself any time you wish.

The combat is super outdated in this game but it's functional and secondary to what the game is about. This is a massive scaled role playing adventure game focused on exploring and dialogue choices which is of course further improved by it's dedicated modding community. Looting and hoarding as much wealth and items as possible is also a very fun part of the game. There is so much to explore that you will never feel bored or like you have ran out of things to do at any stage of your playthroughs.

Skyrim is legendary so I have shown it some respect. Some of it's featured haven't aged super well but it's still very enjoyable and a must play to this day.

Part 1. 
New Elder scrolls you say, sure I'll snaffle the snack.

Part 2.
Well I guess another mouthful can't hurt.

Part 3.
Hundreds of hours in, and hundreds of snaffled mouthfuls of Bethesda's finest, you are now incapable of moving, your being is merged with your desk in an un-holy amalgamation of flesh, shoddily painted MDF, snack crumbs, and spittle. You turn in panic, realising the years that have passed, a cry escaping your lips, but your wife lies dead at your feet, eaten by the cat. Sugary tears, laced in MSG roll down your gargantuan frame with the dawn of your reality. Screaming you thrash. Screaming you flail. But your efforts are in vain. Todd Howard has you. Todd Howard will not let another flee. 

With a Herculean effort though you tear from your desk, crashing to the floor in a terrible fit. Paw over paw, your fat digits clamber, desperate for the door, desperate for salvation, desperate for a bath and low fat diet...seriously though, you smell like someone wiped week old bacon over a public restroom floor and used it for cologne. But within reach of the handle you hear his voice....it's Todd! You turn and he's there, shimmering like some Daedric trickster, There he cackles, his arms wide in mocking embrace. And where do you think you're going his eyes cry out....not from Todd. Never from Todd. You turn to lunge for salvation, but your hand is struck with DLC after DLC. But you are strong...aren't you. You mustn't look. Then a slap on your leg fells you and you roll to see the Special, ultra, legendary Edition, now with 3000 hours of extra content, and at no extra cost....new horse armour. OH GOD WHY WON'T YOU LET ME LIVE your mind howls, but it's too late. Your protestations ring hollow in your own fleeting consciousness as Skyrim claims you again. The warmth. The calming, familiar warmth. It is...happiness.

And you smile.

And you smile. 

And you smile. 

And you smile. 

And you smile.

The magic system is also as wide as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle. Every spell has 1 gimmick but doesn't interact with the world nearly as much as it should. It's like they went with the first draft of every idea they had.

Fix this shit maybe?

Suggestions to Bethesda to improve the games functionality.

-Toggleable World Map. (filter to show only mines, only caves, property you own, etc).

-Higher Base Carry Weight. (if you can carry 100k pieces of gold + 1000's of arrows, then realistically, we can have at least 500 starting carry weight).

-Higher Base Vendor Gold
-More Inventory Categories (i.e. Ores, Ingots, Soul Gems, Jewellery, etc)
-Whistle Button For Horse

-More Than Two Adoptable Children. (if you can own up to 8 houses, you should be allowed to send any 2 orphans to be looked after by your housecarls (even if you are a mostly absent father/mother due to adventuring, it's much better that some of these orphans at least have a roof over their head and a warm place to sleep)).

Yes, I realise that most of these things can be installed, or fixed by just using a mod for this or that, but it's not about that.

It's about not having so many issues here and there with the base game that you end up resort to using mods because the base game lacks so many things.

[Edit]: Beast form won't cooldown. The No One Escapes Cidna Mine bugged my fast travel so I had backtrack a whole hour of gameplay.

Skyrim is one of the best games that I’ve had the honor to play. There’s a lot of reasons and I’ll list some of them. Firstly for a game of 2011 it has some great graphics and physics. The scenery is some of the best I’ve seen in a game. The best sceneries in a long time with the second being RDR2 and GTA V. I know there’s a lot of annoying memes and people hating for just playing the game but honestly I don’t really care. 

Skyrim does so many things right, the main quest line, characters, side quests, guilds, and a strong sense of freedom and the encouragement to explore more of the world. Without mods, I could easily devote hours into it. Whether it’s to level up, finding cool weapons, or anything else, it’s worth the time. The world building is fantastic, the sounds and ambience is awesome. The creatures and enemies are all unique and plenty of dungeons are unique and some are very large and diverse.

The main theme of Skyrim is one of my favorites in a video game. A weakened empire on its last legs with the threat of a greater foe who almost crushed them in a massive war, and dragons returning and you being the Dragonborn. A beautiful country tearing itself up for independence, and joining dark guilds and restore them to power. The soundtrack is some of the best. My favorites being “From Past to Present”, and “One they Fear”. 

The DLC is some of the best also. Dawngaurd has many strengths, being a vampire hunter among the Dawnguard with an interesting backstory, more weapons and side quests, the option to join a vampire clan and become the leader if you decide is the best. The main them of Vampires is highly awesome and worth the try. The quests in Dawnguard are some of the best. With my favorites being going to the Soul Carin and traveling through the Forgotten Vale. And the selling point is that you get one of the best and most interesting followers in the game.

And of course Heartfire is a awesome also. Relaxing from a day of adventure and treasure hunting and building a large home and starting a family is cool. You can also store some of your best loot and display them where you could feel proud of your achievements.

And of course Dragonborn. One of the best DLC’s in Skyrim. Going to Solstheim again and fighting the Last Dragonborn. Awesome locations and good storyline to get you engaged. Miraak has to be one of the most interesting and best villains in the Elder Scrolls. And of course you can’t forget good old Herma Mora.

Overall Skyrim is an amazing game and even though you’ve probably played it, come back to it a while later. And for a those who’ve haven’t played it, give it a shot. You won’t regret it.",1699979871,1699979871,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was an apparently shameful expense for her to justify spending, and so I was told to tell people (should they ask) that it cost her only £40.

What it actually cost, I’m not sure. 

By the next Christmas, the house had been repossessed, and we began the process of packing our lives into cardboard boxes whilst awaiting the purgatory of an emergency shelter. One of the last rooms packed was my mum’s, and, whilst doing so, she uncovered two gifts she had misplaced before Christmas; Halo: Reach, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

Though all three of these games were voraciously played to a point far beyond the natural lifespans of their available content (even without the internet to access Xbox Live, I still managed to grind my Spartan through the notorious Warrant Officer ranks and beyond), Skyrim was the one that seemed to totally captivate a desire within me to immerse myself in the world held within its little silver disk. I wanted to experience everything it had to offer.

In early 2013, we were moved from the shelter to a council house, where, for the first time, we got at-home internet access. This opened me up to a world of Skyrim YouTubers playing on PC, with mods, and (after all the hours I’d already spent playing Skyrim) I wanted to emulate what I was seeing. I did this by enforcing certain “immersive limitations” on my playthroughs by doing things like: regularly sleeping and eating, restricting the use of potions, forbidding the use of fast travel, and refraining from treating my hirelings like begrudged bipedal pack animals. 

I’m convinced I eventually spent somewhere north of a thousand hours wandering, and exploring, and experiencing everything from the deep autumnal birch forests of The Rift to the edges of Haafingar’s desolate tundratic coast. I was totally and utterly enthralled by the depth of it all.

During all of this, the things in our life that were bad only seemed to ceaslessly creep towards ‘worse’, yet Skyrim managed to occupy and distract my mind enough to help float me through a time so low in my life that I almost can’t recall it. I’m not saying Skyrim fixed a broken 14-year-old’s life; however, I reckon it did help him find a bit of solace at a time when his home life was really not so great.

For me, Skyrim was a dense, content-rich world with so much in it to discover. It’s one of a small number of truly unique games I wish I could forget all about, should it allow me to experience it, once again, for the very first time.

I hope that one day I’ll return.",1699666751,1699666751,True,87,1,0.891142606735229492,0,True,False,False

Sua gameplay é divertida e intuitiva, mas para aqueles que procuram um grande desafio esse não é o jogo, Skyrim é um jogo fácil, até mesmo nas dificuldades mais altas é possível jogar sem grandes dificuldades, talvez o maior desafio inicialmente sejam os dragões e os trolls, que causam um dano bem considerável. Os puzzles presentes nas dungeons também são bem básicos e não geram um grande desafio., e as dungeons em si também não são tão interessantes, e chegam até a serem repetitivas.
Skyrim possui um sistema bem intuitivo de crafting, é possível criar equipamentos, poções, encantar e aprimorar itens, mas nada disso é essencial para a sua progressão, a não ser que o seu objetivo seja conseguir os equipamentos Daedra, por exemplo, você consegue tranquilamente adquirir um bom equipamento apenas contando com o drop de itens em baús e em corpos inimigos.
O sistema de dialogo e negociação é péssimo e não exige nada do jogador, desde o nível 1 você consegue persuadir tranquilamente desde guardas a generais e Jarls, diferente da franquia Fallout, por exemplo, onde se você não tem o nível necessário para isso se torna impossível persuadir e negociar de forma bem sucedida. O sistema de lockpicking é interessante e bem intuitivo, é preciso upar bem para conseguir abrir as trancas que exigem um nível maior, ou criar um save antes e ficar tentando até conseguir.
O sistema de sneaking é bem trabalhado, mas como não segui essa linha de gameplay não posso opinar detalhadamente.
A árvore de skills é um ponto positivo, grande mas não de forma exagerada e a medida que você vai evoluindo é notável a diferença que cada habilidade adquirida traz para a sua gameplay.
Um dos pontos que mais gostei de Skyrim é o sistema de magias e ""shouts"", aqui você não vai desbloqueando essas habilidades a medida que ganha nível, mas sim a medida que você explora o mapa e as dungeons, achando livros de spells com novas magias e as ""Word Walls"" com novas ""shouts""
O sistema de criação de personagem é interessante, cada raça possui suas vantagens e desvantagens, a personalização é bem abrangente e é interessante ver a forma como as pessoas tratam você dependendo da raça que você escolhe, mas também não é nada que mude a progressão da história, já que acabam sendo apenas frases soltas entre os diálogos.
O visual é bem datado, mas pode ser corrigido com mods, desde o mais leve que ajusta a saturação das cores até o mais pesado que transforma Skyrim em um jogo completamente novo. Os bugs são bem presentes, na maioria das vezes são coisas bobas como itens flutuando no cenário mas vz ou outra é possível se deparar com bugs que atrapalham a gameplay, como uma vez onde uma personagem de uma quest se tornou completamente estática e impossível de se interagir e foi preciso eu carregar um save para o início quest e refaze-la.
No geral, Skyrim é um bom passatempo (e digo isso com propriedade, tendo quase 300 horas de jogo), sua gameplay prende o jogador e suas quests sem muita profundidade tornam o jogo uma ótima porta de entrada para aqueles que querem entrar no mundo dos RPGs eletrônicos, porém, para aqueles que estão acostumados com jogos densos, com gameplay e sistemas mais complexos, Skyrim pode ser uma experiência bem broxante.",1699484033,1699484870,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But hey, for the few of you who've been living under a rock, or perhaps just waiting for it to be released on smart fridges (let's be honest, it's only a matter of time), here's a glimpse into the magical world of Tamriel's frostiest province.

Imagine a world where you're less ""Dragonborn, Savior of the Realm"" and more ""Local Delinquent with a Lockpick Fetish."" You'll spend nights perfecting the fine arts of thievery: lockpicking, sneaking, and the delicate craft of pocket-filching. Just picture it: The sun sets, the moon rises, and there you are, creeping into someone's house, only to be caught because you forgot to place a pot over the homeowner's head. Classic rookie mistake!

And if you thought learning a second language was hard, try leveling up in Skyrim. This game has more skills than that ""optional extra package"" they always try to upsell you on when you're buying a new car. From baking bread to battling dragons, from negotiating with giants to...well, yodeling off mountaintops (or shouting, same difference), you've got options! And none of them come with a smarmy salesman and an overpriced extended warranty.

So, whether you're seeking glory in the ancient Nordic tombs or simply looking to adopt a couple of kids after accidentally ""removing"" their parents (don't ask), there's a place for you in this vast realm. But a word of caution: Watch out for those pesky arrows! For some inexplicable reason, knees in Skyrim are arrow magnets. I swear, they should start an insurance company just for that.

In summary: If you've ever wanted to be simultaneously adored, feared, and confused by an entire continent, then Skyrim is your jam. Dive in, Dovahkiin, and may your knee armor be ever sturdy!",1698126501,1698126501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

mods add alot of replayability and so does waiting a few months. The main drawback of this game is overplaying from some kind of addiction like state and fear of missing out. Missing out on loot is a problem for some and if your a greedy person then this game will punish you with the carry weight, you can't take it all. Also as you lvl the game changes based on your lvl and really certain areas or quests need an early game attempt or low lvl to be fun and you may be saddened that it was too easy or silly since you are so over powered later game.

This is why, I try to shy away from 'modern car racing titles' as simply; they are, far too good. After avoiding the gleam of ' photon realistic video gaming glow' in other, fellow wayward travellers--- after they have given, glanced or glitched into forgetting or being semi-non ; aware: that any other RPG game title from yesteryear could have broken through this snowy crust to produce this kind of an outstanding accomplishment. That, the factor reduced: does not simple equate to a case of 'Emperors New Clothes' .  But is part of a legacy none- the less. Very much in the same way, that as if a family had adopted an electronic dog, with seemingly no flaws--- and one added criteria bonus that simply the electronic dog does not need to be 'cleaned up after' . That, the game is so breathe taking and yet homewardly forlorn--- that once encountering minor flaws; such as comparing a perfect dog and a 'perfectly behaved' - electronic dogs' mannerisms .  That one starts out trying to find the creases and the automotive failures to lessen, or offset ones' experience- in order to work in or establish footholds into the icy peaks of the story, the saga and the experience. That this, ability function or recognition is what could have been the very scribbled notes, that gave birth to ' Character Class ' in the first place. With this offset in mind, just like that of being or becoming aware of 'levels and grading' that the over aspect of two central uprights begin to descend on the player. Causing a potential 'Bell-curve & bell-curve Rift' in order to astatine the ability function.  That XP could be seen as the Running Race, ( and, its expectations) : the Character or Characterisation the figurative end-line with only 'encumbrance' to hold the player back, As with other 'Laws of physics' to lash down the horizon to that of the player arc or bell-curve.  Hence, the name: Skyrim. (quite, neat i think ).  As with games of yesteryear, that the Player Two; owing to 'graphical interpretation' on earlier computing systems was always: was the imagination.  When it comes to interpreting (if), the game engine and it's experience is truly made from 'genuine wonder-lust'  ( particles, crystals, pixels--- if you will ) --- then, most often that the sense of 'wonder-lust' comes, or came abroad in the exploring of the native world in which the crucible of the cannon takes place. Owing, not only to the game world itself: it's immersion--- but chiefly; like that of the sense of adventure; all around--- both dwelling in the past, also calling into the future--- was, the ambient score and over-line music. Which is so forgettable and sewn to the experience that it does become and does not become an extension to one of the natural senses. The Legendary: Player Three, has entered: The Game.

Set in the vast, breathtaking province of Skyrim, this game invites players to immerse themselves in a rich and expansive world filled with dragons, magic, and intrigue. As a devoted fan who has spent countless hours exploring the land of Skyrim, I'm excited to share my detailed review of this epic fantasy adventure.

Gameplay (10/10):
Skyrim sets a new standard for open-world RPGs with its dynamic gameplay and immersive world. The game offers an unprecedented degree of freedom, allowing players to choose their path, be it as a noble warrior, stealthy rogue, or powerful mage. The intuitive leveling system and perk tree enable diverse character customization, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. Combat is satisfying and fluid, while the addition of dragon encounters adds thrilling, epic battles to the mix. The radiant quest system ensures that there's always something new to discover, making Skyrim a game that can be played for hundreds of hours.

Storytelling (9/10):
Skyrim's main narrative, centered around the return of dragons to the world, serves as a solid backdrop to the game's exploration and player-driven storytelling. The true strength of Skyrim's storytelling lies in its side quests, which are often as engaging, if not more so, than the main questline. The world is teeming with fascinating characters, each with their own stories and quests, creating a sense of immersion rarely seen in gaming.

Character Development (9/10):
The character development in Skyrim is deeply satisfying. The freedom to shape your character's skills and abilities as you see fit, combined with the vast number of available quests and factions to join, provides an unparalleled sense of agency. The game's numerous companions offer unique personalities and stories, and the modding community has expanded character customization options even further, making it possible to create truly unique adventures.

Graphics and Sound (9/10):
Skyrim's visuals, while showing their age by modern standards, are nonetheless enchanting. The game's art direction creates a stunning, atmospheric world that feels alive. The iconic soundtrack, composed by Jeremy Soule, adds to the sense of immersion, with sweeping melodies that evoke the grandeur of the Elder Scrolls universe.

Skyrim's influence on the gaming industry is undeniable. It set a new bar for open-world RPGs, inspiring countless other developers to create vast, immersive game worlds. The game's modding community has contributed to its longevity, with player-created content extending the game's lifespan and showcasing the power of player-driven creativity.

My personal journey in Skyrim has been a remarkable one. From slaying dragons atop towering mountains to unraveling the mysteries of the Dark Brotherhood, each playthrough has offered a new and captivating adventure. The game's modding community has allowed me to continually revisit and reshape the world of Skyrim, ensuring that the game remains a beloved part of my gaming library.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a monumental achievement in the RPG genre, offering a rich, immersive world filled with endless adventures.

And yet, this game has impressed me over my expectations with how good both the side missions and main missions that it has. 

Skyrim must be enjoyed to the fullest, doing every quest you can, travelling by foot or horse as much as possible, exploring the lands and climbing up mountains and cliff-sides you weren't meant to; That is the truest and fullest beauty of Skyrim. Despite being a single player game, it is unfathomable how much of an experience it is to just take some time from doing anything at all and just...

[h3]Episode 1: The Skyrim Horse[/h3]
[i]Narrated by David Attenborough. Forward by ChatGPT.[/i]

[Opening scene: A sweeping aerial view of the majestic land of Skyrim, with its towering mountains and lush forests. The camera slowly zooms in on a solitary horse grazing peacefully in a meadow.]

David Attenborough: ""In the ancient land of Skyrim, a land filled with wonders and mysteries, there exists a creature that defies all known laws of physics - the Skyrim horse. These hardy creatures roam the vast and treacherous landscapes of this enchanted realm, seemingly impervious to the forces of nature.""

[Cut to a close-up of the Skyrim horse, a magnificent steed with a sleek black coat and a wild, untamed mane.]

David Attenborough: ""Our story begins with this remarkable creature, a true marvel of nature. To the untrained eye, it may appear as just an ordinary horse, but in reality, it is a master of defying gravity and the laws of physics.""

[Camera pans to the horse suddenly launching itself into the air, soaring high above the treetops.]

David Attenborough: ""Behold the Skyrim horse in its natural habitat, a realm where gravity is but a mere suggestion. It is said that these creatures have evolved to adapt to the harsh conditions of this land, and in doing so, they have developed a unique ability – the power to defy gravity with every bound.""

[Cut to a montage of the horse performing a series of gravity-defying stunts: leaping off cliffs, running up vertical mountainsides, and even walking on air.]

David Attenborough: ""Here, we witness the Skyrim horse leaping off a precipice with grace and ease. It is as though the laws of gravity hold no sway over this magnificent beast.""

[The camera follows the horse as it charges up the side of a mountain, effortlessly scaling sheer cliffs and defying the laws of friction.]

David Attenborough: ""No obstacle is too great for the Skyrim horse. With sheer determination, it can conquer the steepest slopes, scaling cliffs that would send any other creature tumbling to its doom.""

[Cut to the horse walking on the surface of a lake, its hooves barely making a ripple on the water.]

David Attenborough: ""And here, the Skyrim horse walks upon the very waters themselves, as if it possesses the divine power of walking on air. Its defiance of the laws of buoyancy is nothing short of extraordinary.""

[The camera pans to a group of awe-struck Nords watching the horse in amazement.]

David Attenborough: ""Even the hardy people of Skyrim, known for their resilience in the face of adversity, are left in awe of this miraculous creature. They have woven tales of the Skyrim horse's feats, believing it to be a symbol of the land's mystical enchantment.""

[Cut to the horse, now back on solid ground, galloping at breathtaking speeds through the dense forest.]

David Attenborough: ""But while the Skyrim horse's ability to defy the laws of physics is a sight to behold, it also serves a crucial purpose in this unforgiving land. It allows these creatures to navigate treacherous terrain with unparalleled agility, ensuring their survival in the wilds of Skyrim.""

[The camera follows the horse as it disappears into the dense forest, leaving only the sound of its hooves echoing through the ancient woods.]

David Attenborough: ""And so, the Skyrim horse, a true enigma of nature, continues to thrive in its mystical homeland, where it defies the laws of physics and captures the hearts and imaginations of all who are fortunate enough to witness its extraordinary abilities.""

[Closing scene: The Skyrim horse disappears into the forest, and the camera pans up to the vast, endless sky.]

David Attenborough: ""In Skyrim, where magic and mystery are woven into the very fabric of the land, the Skyrim horse stands as a testament to the wonders of the natural world. It is a living legend, a creature that reminds us that in the wilds of this world, there are still mysteries waiting to be uncovered and marvels waiting to be admired.""

[Fade out as the camera continues to focus on the boundless sky above, highlighting the mystical aura of Skyrim.]

The things I enjoyed the most from the previous titles have been removed for ""streamlining"" purposes (Spellcrafting, fun skills like Acrobatics, detailed item enchantment, levitation and feather spells etc.). The good news is you can mod some of it back in, which I highly recommend. The world is big and looks great, love the concept of dragons and certain enemy designs within the world. Unfortunately a lot of the quests play out the same and it gets repetitive fast. At a certain point, it begins to feel like a slog.

Succinctly, I do recommend this game if you haven't played it or any of the Elder Scrolls yet.

That being said, in some regards it is sad that Bethesda gets away with neglecting to patch their own game while relying on community-made mods to fix basic issues such as gameplay-related or visual glitches in the game. A lot of community-resources get directed towards making the basic game function as its meant to rather than being able to add on to the game in new ways. With the addition of community-generated content as DLC requiring micro-transaction spending, it would be nice if Bethesda could at least keep up with patching out bugs, etc, rather than relying on players needing to explore community-made patches to have the basic game as fully functional.

Even without DLC, community-made mods enable so much extra content that it's questionable whether the DLC is even necessary to really enjoy the game.",1665154446,1695326935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think we can all remember the first time we picked up this game, we were blown away, the amount of detail, the things you could do, places you could see, for 2011 it was mind blowing and for 2023 its... well still mind blowing! I am someone who doesnt play fantasy games at all, with Skyrim and the other elder scrolls games being the only exception, I think thats really saying something. The way it draws you in with its stunning visuals, heart melting soundtrack, Its just beautiful theres no other word for it. When I play this 'game' I am fully immersed in a way literally no other game has even come close to replicating. I feel this sense of belonging in this world and this sense that I can do anything and be whoever I want. Its so... Homely.

Recommend mods for:

- magic balance overhaul and more spells
- level cap unlock/higher level cap
- Learning unique item bufffs
- More mage robes

Pros:
- Some quest leave you with unique buffs that are very nice to have
- Great story even in sidequests 
- Lots of hidden subquests and activities
- late in game even basic dungeons get better enemies so it stays a challenge 
Cons:
- late game complementary quests can be extremly grindy
- magic system needs mods to be use it's full potential, otherwise it is lackluster (more damage with levels and quicker heals)
- armor is easy to max out as a mage or with smithing with cap on 550~ or so, best invest in max health and magic resistance at that point
- building a house is the most not-worth-your-time activity in the world, just get a mod for one of the basic houses

Games that have no business having a large-scale open world getting one, and the entirety of it is an empty, unrewarding, linear mess. No complex movement mechanics to be had here. It shocks me it took until Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring to actually have proper mechanics for scaling open worlds somewhat vertically. A lot of the games map feels deliberately designed to guide players along a path for the sake of story and lore. 

This isn't always a bad thing if the story is actually good, but that is not the case with Skyrim. I never have played a game that is so full of lore and discovery that feels so barren, soulless, and uninspired. It's just textbook Eurofantasy with no semblance of real emotion or tension. It just feels like I'm watching a story unfold before me, and nothing matters. It just feels like a product of its time, and I don't really understand how anyone can view this game as even close to good. It feels plagued by nostalgia and the fact that open world games were somehow much worse than this generally before. This was many gamers first experience with an open world, and it displays just about everything wrong with them. 

The combat mechanics are so bad too. They just feel like Runescape levels of depth, and that game is free to play, and targeted more towards children, so of course it will be somewhat simplistic. The simplicity of this game isn't even satisfying in any way. I just feel like fights are won by me swinging my weapons the same way over and over again until something dies. There's no fun in it, no strategy, and no real purpose as a result. I tried several builds across several different platforms, and no avail. I have tried so hard to appreciate this game, and all attempts have failed. Other Bethesda games suffer from this problem, but at least in games like Fallout, some weapons do have special mechanics such as knockdown or increased knockback or swing speed. Most things in this game barely have any semblance of that. 

Overall this has nothing going for it, but the nostalgia of it being babies first open world game. It is still shocking to me that we really did not get a truly deserving open world experience until Elden Ring; where exploring things actually reward people with unique armor sets or weapons that function in a variety of different satisfying ways; to where there's something in it for everyone, and sometimes those things are not able to be used with the character you made; which makes you want to play the game again. Skyrim has none of this. You sit through an excessively boring story, deal with unsatisfying discovery, and are rewarded with the most boring final boss I've ever had to sit through in a game. Wow; the dragon functions exactly like every other dragon in the game!!! Flies around and you can't deal with it until it lands and then you just walk up to it and fight it like literally every other enemy in the game. So satisfying! What a conclusion to such a shit game. At least it fits the vibe of the game being a boring slog I guess. 

I do not see the appeal for this game. I never will see the appeal for this game. It's the most soulless, uninspired, underdeveloped AAA game I have ever played. I don't think anything will come close to topping how boring and pointless this game is.

We had a guest came to the hotel i work in and he was going to stay here for a while. He was ordering food from outside all the time and we was just saying hi  to each other when he comes in for picking up his order. Me as someone who's curious i always talk to guests and ask what they are doing,who they are what they do for a living etc. but this guy was a bit shy and kind of discrete. One evening after a while he's stayed in the hotel, another food delivery came in for him. And when he came to pick it up i told him how he is and some small talk. I asked him what was he doing for a living he merely answered '' i am just someone who likes to play games '' but i knew that wasn't the case and told him jokingly naah you're joking with me. And at that time he said no! I even got a tatto from my favourite game. And after that slowly pulled his sleeve up and show me tatto he's got expecting me to not know anything about it. It was the logo of the Skyrim and was my pc background in the past. The moment i saw his tatto, my eyes got lighten up and passionately told him thats skyrim! He wasn't expecting me to recognize it or played the game at all but as you can imagine that wasn't case. After my recognition of his skyrim tattoo that shy, discrete guy went off and a new guy with a big smile and easy to talk came in. And we have had great conversation about games,future, and life untill our conversation was interrupted by some other guest. 

It was thanks to this game i could bond with someone whom they thought that we did not have anything in common. Different cultural backgrounds different proffessions different languages and different life styles until two dudes has nothing in common found out they were huge fans of the same game. That's the proof of power of Skyrim.Sad thing is this whole discovery was happened at his last day. And we couldn't exchange communications.

After spending over 300 hours in the realm of Skyrim, I can confidently say that this game has left an indelible mark on me. I've slain dragons, uncovered hidden tombs, and forged epic legends. Yet, what continues to amaze me is how I still find joy in the simple act of strolling through the enchanting forests of this magical world. 

Skyrim's ability to keep me enchanted, even after completing countless quests and mastering various skills, is a testament to its enduring appeal. It's a game that rewards both the thrill of epic adventures and the tranquility of quiet moments in nature.

Trying to play it years later, I expected a good game based on the hype and good reviews. I don't think it is one. And I don't think it's just because it's old, DA Origins or Mass Effect came out earlier and are great games even today. 

Some of my issues:
- The world may be big, but it's empty and repetitive. I don't feel it's worthy of exploration, and exploration is like the only thing this game has to offer.
- The combat is awkward and clunky. 
- Most quests are surface level repetitive fetch quests and chores that I don't care about.
- The writing is non existent. The NPCs are just there. They don't really do anything, they are just decoration. I literally don't care about a single one. Good characters and companions with their own stories is my favourite thing in RPGs. And it's a pity it's not present here. 
- On the same note, is it even an RPG if you don't have any choices and what you do doesn't matter at all? Your only choice is where you go and which quests you do, but if you do them you just do them them the one way you can. 
- The bugs are a feature at this point and were honestly the funniest and most enjoyable part of the game. And that is depressing.

Honestly I'm not sure what to do in this game. Unless you have a Thomas the tank engine characters mod or the AI companion that roast you all the time, the game is just incredibly shallow and boring. The only enjoyment I can see people having in Skyrim is modding it to the max and seeing how many cheese wheels you can drop in until the game crashes. I see the value of streamers doing the most unhinged stuff for entertainment. 

 But actually playing vanilla Skyrim? Not so much.",1693728155,1693728155,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Back in 2013 my ex classmate showed me this game at his house and I decided to give it a try.
I had a garbage internet, it took me 3 days to download this masterpiece on torrents.
When it was launched for the first time it was mind blowing.  I actually spent 12 hours each day playing this game for the whole summer. And because I was still a child the first playthrough took me approximately 900 hours... There is no need to tell about the quality of this game, you already know everything.

The positives

+The best gaming world of any game ever, one that is also beautiful and feels alive
+Diverse builds
+Really replayable
+A ridiculous amount of content, although not all of it is very well made
+Fantastic mods
+The best gameplay mechanics of any game, ever
+Unbelievably good soundtrack
+Second best exploration of any game ever, only surpassed by Elden Ring
+Lots of diverse activities
+Excellent level design in some places, almost FromSoftware level
+Great progression
+Amazing atmosphere
+Very immersive
+Fantastic DLCs

The negatives

-Combat is very lacking and boring with almost all builds
-The main story is way too short
-Animations are very lacking, though that's more acceptable for a 2011 game
-The voice acting is mostly below average and the sheer amount of recycled voice actors only adds to this issue
-The game is still very buggy
-Too many mindless fetch quests
-Movement is pretty bad
-AI is absolute garbage
-The world feels too small and the cities feel underwhelming. The cities are small in size and there are too few inhabitants
-The shouts are not very interesting to use due to their cooldowns, which makes them bad rewards from exploration
-The money system doesn't work very well

1. It was great when I didn't need to buy this game again.

2. The Fact I own Special Edition,but the game makes my PC SUPER LOUD LIKE A COW TAKEN CONTROL OF TRACTOR!

3. I don't feel like my life amounts to anything when I return to a video game sole objective to make me angry about myself.

4. I am sure that my own age and my current understanding of ""FUN"" is bs like some East Coast news ad.

5. My PC was able to play this game,then I got too tired to even attempt to focus on anything,because it seems like all of it is a pile of bs.

6. I am extremely annoyed from  Bethesda Game Studios logo icon looking like ROBLOX, also as a company following media trend such as FaceBook and Twitter changing names which is like wiping bear poop inside a fire barrel to make all people around giving you the look like ""So what we're in JarHead movie now like come on.""

7. ABSOLUTELY MAD ON UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ON SPECIAL EDITION WITH THE FORCED ADDED CREATION CLUB UPDATES! 

8.  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim makes me think this game was designed to be Wii Fit Trainer because IT'S SO OLD AND IM SO IMPATIENT! 

9. At least you can ignore the community users with hollywood movies icons who have steam status from 2003-2004 acting like a know it all and in person will absolutely close their eyes and talk to you about nonsense gibberish till the point you push them into bear pies.

10. The people who can mod their skyrim have a heck ton more better PC than mine also I'm very annoyed with this game just making me more angry than I have ever been before.

11. Not very into ROLEPLAY, PSYCHO HOUSE PARTY VIBE, THE IMAGINARY FRIENDS AND FAMILY BS its so frustrating to me like some LGBTQ Daddy dates Daddy online simulator.

It makes me wonder what's the point of this game other than making me mad.
It makes me wonder what's the point of this game other than making me mad.
It makes me wonder what's the point of this game other than making me mad.
It makes me wonder what's the point of this game other than making me mad.

12. I overall think my life sucks even more when I play this.

13. This game just NOT GREAT FOR ME!

DONE BINGO TA DA WOW WOOOOOO! YEAH THAT'S RIGHT COME ON WOO! BS BS BS BS

14. Making a review like this is like eating hamster and Guinea pig pet food and asking why have I thought it was a great idea and the answer is BECAUSE ITS BS!

15. BS game and BS community and BS Veteran status of Old Accounts and acquaintances this game should be covered in bull bs.

16. Chuck Charles this with your Local News  = ""THIS GAME IS BS!""

17. I'm Adult who plays a game where you can get aggressive with your room and sleep on the floor  BECAUSE YOUR BED IS BROKEN FROM A BS ENTERTAINMENT INTERACTIVE CRAP BREAK TIME!

18. This game back in 2013 had a wide spread of angry silent annoyed bs life people,but then they figured out BS WAS THE GAME!

19. I am bs so is this bs game.

20. ME and I or IM  or MYSELF CONSIDERS THIS GAME AND ITS DEV PLUS COMMUNITY FULL OF BS YOU CAN BUY FROM A BUFFALO FARMER FOR $50 A BAG!

21. F this game and f my veteran status from New Account THIS ONE to old Account OLD ONE!

An Epic Adventure Awaits, Thanks to Skyrim!

If you're a true Skyrim lover like myself, you'll understand the sheer magic that this game has to offer. Skyrim isn't just a game; it's an immersive journey that transports you to a world filled with breathtaking landscapes, intricate lore, and endless opportunities for exploration.

From the moment you step foot in the rugged and diverse province of Skyrim, you're greeted by an open world that feels alive with its bustling cities, tranquil forests, towering mountains, and mysterious ruins. The attention to detail is simply astounding, with each location meticulously crafted to draw you in and make you feel like a part of this fantastical realm.

But it's not just the environment that makes Skyrim exceptional – it's the rich history and compelling stories that weave throughout the land. The depth of the lore is truly impressive, and every NPC you meet has a unique tale to tell. Whether you're unraveling the enigma of the Dragonborn, delving into the political intrigue of various factions, or simply embarking on side quests that seem almost as important as the main story, you're constantly engaged and invested in the world around you.

And let's not forget the exhilarating combat! Whether you're wielding a sword, casting powerful spells, or sneaking your way through the shadows as an agile thief, the combat mechanics offer satisfying and varied gameplay. Plus, the ability to customize your character's skills and playstyle ensures that no two adventures are ever the same.

Skyrim's longevity is also a testament to its exceptional modding community. The sheer creativity and dedication of modders have brought even more life to the game, with thousands of mods adding everything from new quests and characters to enhanced graphics and gameplay mechanics. This means that, even after countless hours, there's always something new to discover and experience.

In conclusion, Skyrim isn't just a game; it's an ongoing love affair for anyone who appreciates the art of storytelling, exploration, and epic fantasy. It's a masterpiece that continues to capture the hearts of gamers around the world, and if you're a true Skyrim lover, you'll find yourself returning to its enchanting world time and time again.

Ralof: ""Look at him, General Tullius, the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.""

- This is what I wrote a while ago, after 654 hours on steam.

I mean, a lot of games are really nice and give you lots of hours of fun (and other good feelings), but few of them are life changing.
For me, Skyrim was life changing. Actually, it still is life changing, because that's the point: you may not play the game for months or years, but it's still a big part of you, because, somehow, it is part of what you are made of.",1585258819,1691455569,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Only today, in 2023, have I finished a single play-through with every main story and side story completion, from both the base game and the DLC. Only today have I gained all Steam achievements and beaten the two optional endgame boss fights. 
On Steam I have 477 hours, but I likely have over 1000 across every platform. I have 105 mods on my current game, and i consider that a light amount.
Is this game perfect? No, not at all, I have developed a nervous reflex of pressing F5 to quick-save before anything that could crash my game. Is this game pretty? for 2013, yes, by modern standards it feels a little washed out. Is it the best Elder Scrolls game? i can't say for sure, i haven't played them all.

Spending many hours on gathering the materials from the wilderness and vendors in the city does not make my game bored.

to be honest despite everything i still kind of love skyrim and it also kind of helped me to get through the dark times,
because its unique yet kind of familiar world, that filled with medieval, phantasy, magical atmosphere vibes got me drowned in it.
i've been wasting too many hours on real life, but i tried my best to spend as much of it as possible on millions of quests like saving towns from a dragons, building manors and clearing dungeons full of undead or a reclusive cannibal cults...
buying and selling stuff, smithing armors and weapons without claiming to be the best blacksmith in whiterun, enchanting items using souls of defeated foes or annoying characters like nazeem, learning the art of war by dodging arrows in the knees, learning magical skills and spells by burning innocent goats and deers, learning alchemy by eating and mixing random sh*t, sneaking through the shadows, stealing people's clothes and booze, lockpicking houses and chests, searching for a daedric artifacts, shouting my way through the followers, dying from falling out of the mountains while trying to find shortcuts, farming and cooking,  talking to a doors or a trees or a dogs and such, taming bloody dragons, shouting as you've never shout before and many many more billions of things...
yet no matter how many years i've spend on endless adventures and countless, though unique characters, most of which i can't even remember, skyrim can still surprise me and show something new or make me laugh once again...



my overall thoughts:

i know that it is quite far from being a perfect game, but it just gave me too many emotions and experiences, after which it is undoubtedly deserves a special place in my heart < 3

It is a game that transcends the boundaries of what we thought possible in the realm of open-world RPGs. From the moment you step foot into the vast and breathtaking province of Skyrim, you are transported to a world teeming with life, wonder, and limitless possibilities.

First and foremost, the sheer size and detail of Skyrim's world is mind-boggling. The landscapes are exquisitely crafted, from towering snow-capped mountains to dense forests, sprawling tundras, and ancient ruins. The attention to detail is astonishing, making every nook and cranny of the world feel like it has a story to tell. Exploring this vast realm is a joy in itself, as you stumble upon hidden treasures, encounter unique characters, and uncover captivating lore.

The freedom of choice in Skyrim is unparalleled. You can be whoever you want to be, shaping your destiny as you see fit. Whether you choose to be a valiant knight, a stealthy assassin, a powerful mage, or anything in between, the game allows you to play to your preferred playstyle. The character customization options are extensive, ensuring that your hero is truly your own creation.

The main questline of Skyrim is engrossing, filled with intriguing characters, epic battles, and unexpected twists. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as you navigate political intrigue, ancient prophecies, and the return of fearsome dragons. The writing is top-notch, with memorable dialogue and morally complex choices that truly make you feel invested in the outcome.

Yet, Skyrim's brilliance extends far beyond its main story. The game is overflowing with side quests, guilds, and miscellaneous tasks that immerse you even further into its world. Whether you're joining the secretive Thieves Guild, becoming a member of the warrior-focused Companions, or delving into the enigmatic world of magic at the College of Winterhold, there's always something new and exciting to discover.

The combat in Skyrim is satisfyingly dynamic. Whether you prefer close-quarters melee combat, ranged archery, or unleashing devastating spells, the game caters to your preferred style. Engaging in battles with ferocious creatures and bandits feels intense, and the variety of weapons and magical abilities at your disposal keep the combat fresh and exciting throughout your adventure.

What truly sets Skyrim apart, however, is its modding community. The game's flexibility and mod support have given rise to an astonishing array of user-created content that enhances and expands the experience in countless ways. From graphical improvements to gameplay tweaks, new quests, and even entirely new lands to explore, the mods breathe new life into the game, ensuring that you'll never run out of things to do.

Finally, the hauntingly beautiful score and atmospheric sound design elevate Skyrim to another level of immersion. The sweeping orchestral compositions perfectly capture the grandeur of the world, while the ambient sounds of nature and bustling towns breathe life into the game's environments.

In conclusion, Skyrim is a gaming experience that will stay with you long after you've set down the controller. Its vast and richly detailed world, compelling quests, freedom of choice, and the unwavering dedication of its modding community make it a game that stands the test of time. Whether you're a veteran RPG player or new to the genre, Skyrim is an absolute must-play that will leave you longing for more adventures in its mesmerizing realm.

Nazeem, the infamous NPC from the popular video game Skyrim, has become a subject of both memes and community discussions since the game's release in 2011. Though his character may seem unremarkable at first glance, his boastful and condescending attitude has made him a target for humorous mockery and lively debates among players.
Nazeem, a resident of the town of Whiterun, is known for his oft-repeated line: ""Do you get to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying? Of course, you don't."" This seemingly innocuous comment has gained notoriety and has been widely memed and parodied by the Skyrim community.
The line's ubiquity in the gaming community has led to countless humorous variations and remixes. Memes featuring Nazeem often include references to the Cloud District and sarcastic responses from other characters or players, highlighting the repetitive nature of his dialogue. These memes have become a way for players to bond over their shared experiences and frustrations with Nazeem's self-important attitude.
In addition to the memes, discussions about Nazeem have flourished within the Skyrim community. Some players find his character irritating, often going out of their way to avoid interactions with him. On the other hand, some players find him amusing and enjoy engaging with his haughty demeanor. These conflicting opinions have sparked debates on forums and social media platforms, further fueling the fascination surrounding Nazeem.
Beyond his meme-worthy status, Nazeem's presence in Skyrim reflects the game's commitment to creating a diverse cast of characters, each with their own quirks and personalities. The fact that a relatively minor NPC like Nazeem has garnered such attention and spawned a community-driven phenomenon speaks to the depth and impact of Skyrim's world-building.
In conclusion, Nazeem, the self-important resident of Whiterun, has become an iconic figure within the Skyrim community. Through his memorable dialogue and divisive personality, he has inspired countless memes, sparked debates, and become a symbol of both frustration and amusement for players. Whether you love him or find him exasperating, there's no denying that Nazeem has left an indelible mark on the Skyrim experience. So, the next time you visit the Cloud District, remember to savor the jokes and discussions surrounding this enduring character.",1493209286,1687474061,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

- Found my soulmate (might be a werewolf, jury's still out on that one)
- Became the adoptive parent of a tiny army (seriously, I can't remember all their names)
- Threw together a luxury estate (though, I'm pretty sure there are still draugr in the basement)
- Started a canine refuge (just call me the Dog Whisperer of Whiterun)
- Discovered I'm the Nord reincarnation of God (no big deal or anything)
- Turned my divine 'whisper' into the dragon equivalent of a roach spray (they really hate it when you Shout at them)
- Mastered the culinary arts (who knew Giant's Toes and Skeever Tails were so gourmet?)
- Became a vampire, cured myself, then became a werewolf (it's been a wild week)
- Subscribed to the ""Sword in the Face"" school of conflict resolution (diplomacy, what's that?)
- Explored every dark, cobweb-filled dungeon (surely the next one won't be full of undead)
- Turned into a kleptomaniac for sweet rolls (I swear it's for a quest)
- Took on the Jarl's responsibilities (pro tip: always let Lydia handle the paperwork)
- Engaged in the world's most intense staring contests with dragons (Dovahkiin? More like Dovah-kin-optometrist!)
- Became a professional butterfly catcher (the pay is awful, but the job satisfaction is unbeatable)
- Killed a chicken, sparked a civil war (those Nords sure love their poultry)
- Carved a career as a home decorator (all those troll skulls aren't going to display themselves)
- Woke up from a wild night in Markarth with a Daedric Prince (note to self: no more mead challenges with Sam Guevenne)
- Almost became an unwilling sacrifice to Boethiah (oops, read the job description next time)
- Developed a knack for befriending eldritch horrors (Hermaeus Mora sends his best regards)
- Died more times to random frost trolls than the World-Eater (so much for being the Dragonborn)
- Invented a new sport: Sabre Cat rodeo (the key is to not let go)
- Realized that becoming Thane is just a gateway drug to hoarding decorative weaponry
- Mastered the art of shouting people off cliffs (I guess that's one way to avoid small talk)
- Caused an extinction event for the local mudcrab population (sorry, PETA)
- Perfected my archery skills on the ever-elusive ""knee target"" (I used to be an adventurer like you...)
- Discovered that a life of crime pays (until you try to sell stolen goods back to their original owner)
- Became a part-time bard (still working on that ""Ragnar the Red"" cover)
- Made a hobby of collecting dangerous Daedric artifacts (who needs safety when you have unlimited power?)
- Started a fashion trend in Whiterun with my exquisite Fur Armor couture
- Accidentally caused a mammoth stampede (Fus Ro Dah does not translate to ""gentle persuasion"")
- Got a horse that defies gravity (Shadowmere's mountain climbing skills are top notch)
- Invested heavily in cheese wheels (they're the future of Tamriel's economy, I tell you)
- Became a certified dragon dentist (all those Dragon Shouts really do a number on their oral hygiene)
- Found a glitch in the matrix (why do guards keep talking about their sweetroll theft trauma?)
- Took a casual swim in the Sea of Ghosts (spoiler: it's just really, really cold)
- Turned every single ruin into my personal undead extermination playground (take that, Draugr)
- Successfully played hide-and-seek with an Elder Scroll (I swear, I left it right here!)
- Managed to master the lost art of ""arrow to the knee"" joke-telling (they never get old, right?)
- Ventured into stealth-archery (because why fight fair when you can one-shot enemies from the shadows?)
- Learned to speak Dragon fluently (still working on the accent though)
- Unintentionally started a Nirnroot farm (those things glow brighter than my future)
- Single-handedly increased Skyrim's mead consumption (Honningbrew, if you're listening, I'll take a sponsorship)
- Became an unlicensed pharmacist (all those questionable potions have to go somewhere, right?)
- Perfected my Fus-Ro-Dah-powered home run (who knew giants could fly that high?)
- Kept finding mysterious ""Notched Pickaxes"" (does anyone know a blacksmith named 'Steve'?)
- Opened a therapy clinic for giants with post-traumatic adventurer syndrome (you'd be surprised how many suffer from it)
- Accidentally released a notorious evil dragon from an ancient seal (oops... my bad, sorry Skyrim)
- Played matchmaker for an entire town (Riften has never been so lively... or awkward)
- Got lost in an alternate universe (also known as Apocrypha - 0/10, would not recommend, the tentacles are not friendly)
- Started a mammoth tipping business (tip: they tip back... hard)
- Became a shout DJ at the local tavern (beat-dropping Fus Ro Dah is a crowd pleaser)
- Got a pet dragon (he's a good boy, just a bit fiery)
- Made it on the Thalmor's most wanted list (finally, my actions are getting the recognition they deserve)
- Became an amateur entomologist (who knew torchbugs were so fascinating?)
- Beat the Ebony Warrior at arm wrestling (that one took a few reloads, not gonna lie)
- Entered Sovngarde and came back just for the fun of it (travel reviews: 4/5 stars, needs more living people)
- Single-handedly decimated Skyrim's cabbage stocks (I blame my horse's voracious appetite)
- Started a support group for people who can't fast travel because enemies are nearby (we meet on Tuesdays)",1687438291,1687438351,True,2,2,0.531189501285552979,0,True,False,False

I can't bring myself to like this game. I know that it's a touchstone for a lot of gamers - which is fine - but I just can't get invested in this game in the way that so many others have. Plot, characters, leveling, crafting, art direction, combat, BUGS; no amount of mods or rose-tinted glasses can fix how bland and lifeless these things are for me.

I'm going to assume that if you're reading this review, it's because you're new to RPG's in general and have heard good things about Skyrim. If that's the case, then there are so many better places to start. I don't want this review to be a bunch of negativity, so here's what I would recommend:

-Dungeons & Dragons/Pathfinder; Go to your local game store, buy a Player's Handbook and some dice, roll up a character, and join a group. This is absolutely still the best way to get into RPG's and it's the kind of game that you can literally play FOREVER. Plus, if you don't have a local store, there are a couple of different ways to find groups to play with online. Put yourself out there!

-Super Mario RPG/Paper Mario/Mario and Luigi, Superstar Saga; These are all very simple RPG's that still have an engaging amount of depth in their mechanics. They're all charming as heck, and are definitely worth your time. You can find Paper Mario and Mario and Luigi on the Nintendo EShop. As for Super Mario RPG... well lets just say that there are less legal ways of easily acquiring that one these days. [spoiler] ROMS [/spoiler]

-Bug Fables; It's Paper Mario, but it doesn't have any Mario characters. You can find the demo here! https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bug-fables-an-exploration-rpg-full-of-bugs#/ The full game is also available on Steam.

-Cosmic Star Heroine/Chrono Trigger; Both are great story driven games made in the JRPG mold, with the only real difference between the two being their aesthetics. You can find both of them here on Steam, but if you're going to play Chrono Trigger I would recommend the DS port.

-Literally any Dragon Quest game; They're a bit old-fashioned, but many gamers find the simplicity to be charming and relaxing ( it's like how you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't like Kirby). The fan favorite is Dragon Quest VIII and you can find Dragon Quest XI here on Steam.

-Path of Exile/Torchlight/Borderlands 2; Diablo may be the game that created the ""loot-grind"" genre, but these games are definitely holding up the legacy in a much better fashion. Path of Exile and Torchlight are presented in the traditional isometric view while Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter, with all of these games centered around killing dudes to get lots of weapons so that you can find the one weapon that you actually want... which is much more fun than it sounds. You can find all of them here on Steam, and Path of Exile is even free to play!

-Monster Hunter: Do you want an RPG with fantastic combat? Do you want an RPG you can play with your friends? Do you want to explore a cave-punk fantasy world? Do you not care about villain monologues or saving the world and just want to FITE BEEG MONSTAH? Then you should try out Capcoms' legendary action-RPG series. MH: World and MH: Rise are both available here on Steam, and you can't go wrong with either.

-Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow/Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night/Hollow Knight; Most Metroidvanias would fit on this list, but for my money these are the ones that best combine exploration with stat juggling and reflex-based combat. Hollow Knight and Bloodstained are available here on Steam and all of these games can be found on the Nintendo EShop.

-Fallout New Vegas: Hey, do you want to play a Bethesda game made by people who actually know what they're doing? Look no further than arguably the best game in the Fallout franchise. Check out H.Bomberguy's epic review of the game here for a more complete explanation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzF7aHxk4Y4

- Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon/Dread Delusion; If the only thing that can scratch your itch is a first-person fantasy roleplaying game, then these two might be what your looking for. They're not out *yet*, but both of these games are full of passion and promise. Both are in early access here on Steam if you're curious. https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/

Hopefully I've given anyone interested a decent assortment of titles to choose from. I tried to pick RPG's with easy entry points rather than something more intense (like Dark Souls or Disco Elysium).

72850,139827179,76561198126290878,0,14,237,0,226,1691598668,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is an iconic open-world role-playing game that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. With its vast and breathtaking world, rich lore, immersive gameplay, and boundless exploration, Skyrim stands as a true masterpiece of the fantasy genre.

One of Skyrim's greatest strengths lies in its immersive and beautifully crafted world. The province of Skyrim itself is a sprawling and diverse land, filled with towering mountains, dense forests, ancient ruins, and bustling cities. Each location is meticulously designed, capturing a sense of grandeur and wonder. The attention to detail is astounding, whether it's the awe-inspiring architecture or the subtle environmental effects that bring the world to life.

The game's lore and storytelling are equally impressive. The Elder Scrolls series has always been known for its deep and intricate lore, and Skyrim continues this tradition. The world is steeped in rich history, with numerous books, legends, and factions that add layers of depth and intrigue. The main questline is engaging and filled with memorable characters, but it's the countless side quests and random encounters that truly make Skyrim shine. Each quest feels unique and meaningful, offering glimpses into the lives of the people inhabiting this vast world.

Skyrim's character customization and progression systems are robust and rewarding. From choosing your race and appearance to deciding on a playstyle, the game offers immense freedom and flexibility. Whether you prefer to wield a mighty sword, cast devastating spells, or master stealthy tactics, the game caters to a wide range of playstyles. As you level up, you can invest in various skills, unlocking new abilities and becoming a formidable force in combat.

Speaking of combat, Skyrim strikes a satisfying balance between accessibility and depth. The real-time combat mechanics feel fluid and responsive, allowing you to engage in thrilling battles with a wide array of enemies, including fearsome dragons. The addition of shouts, powerful abilities that you acquire throughout the game, adds an extra layer of strategic depth and spectacle to the combat encounters.

The modding community for Skyrim is legendary, and it greatly extends the game's lifespan. The ability to modify and enhance various aspects of the game, from graphical improvements to new quests and gameplay mechanics, allows players to create their own personalized Skyrim experience. This vibrant modding scene ensures that there's always something new to discover and keeps the game feeling fresh, even years after its initial release.

It's worth noting that Skyrim, despite its numerous strengths, is not without its flaws. Some players have criticized the game for occasional technical issues, graphical glitches, and NPC AI inconsistencies. However, these minor blemishes pale in comparison to the grandeur and depth of the overall experience.

In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a monumental achievement in the world of gaming. Its breathtaking world, rich lore, immersive gameplay, and endless possibilities for exploration and customization make it a truly unforgettable adventure. Whether you're a fan of fantasy RPGs or a newcomer to the genre, Skyrim is a must-play title that will captivate you for countless hours and leave you with memories that will endure long after the game is over.

I am just to scared to finish the game, and therefore it stays my oldest game in my library for the longest time needed ever. 

So after more than 250 hours of play this game, including all DLC. 
there is still plenty to do, thanks to NEXUS you can download even bigger and better mods. 
cos remember, this game is already 5 years old
for example, better graphics, more quest, more player homes, more weapons ect ect.

But, no just kidding there is no but.
i recommend this game who love a good story line, and many opportunities in the game you can follow.

Should probably just update the SE-version.. I have had some genuinely great times with Skyrim, but also some of the wonkiest moments in gaming history. So I have been playing around as a sneaky cat girl slaying humans in a vaguely iron age scandinavian dreamworld where everyone is named Sven.. On my long journey I made friends, killed said friends, slayed some dragons, hanged out with daedras, cooked food, drank mead, became a ranking member of the Thieves Guild, swaggered in the Cloud District and collected truckloads of insectoid eggs beneath a spooky tower..

Did I have a great time? Well, yes.. Kinda..
Was it smooth as silk and without any flaws? Hell no..

Skyrim is one of those weird games. On paper it has tons of story, a completely egalitarian world where everyone is living a dream (until they get the legendary arrow to their kneecap and end up on patrol duty) and a lot of free time to dawdle about. Is the time well spent? Well that is the main question. The combat feels clunky at times, the stealth game is kinda ass, the magic is the worst of the lot and somehow me being the head honcho of both the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood and the mages guild all at once feels a bit, well, weird.. Some choices have little to no consequences, others you can't really fathom until it is to late.

The best thing that has come out of Skyrim in the end is its mutating nature. By now there is almost an internet rule for all the weird things people have modded into this game, so should you fancy it, there is probably a mod for it.. In the end however this is a fine piece of entertainment and I highly recommend it if you like high adventure and sprawling worldbuilding. If you are going to play this game do yourself a favor and AT LEAST download “The Paarthurnax Dilemma”.. Everything else from anime-waifus to improved mudcrab physics is optional, the dilemma is not..

Oh boy, where do I even start with this game? 🤔🎮 Skyrim is like a magical 🧙‍♂️adventure on steroids! 🏔️ From the moment you step into the world of Skyrim, you're greeted with stunning landscapes that make you want to shout, ""Fus Ro Dah!"" 🗣️💥

🤷‍♀️ I mean, who needs a social life when you have dragons 🐉 raining fire 🔥 from the sky? And let's not forget about the NPCs! They're so realistic, it's like they have a mind of their own! 🤯 Except for that one time when a guard took an arrow to the knee... 😂🏹

The questlines in Skyrim are as addictive as sweetrolls 🍞🧁, and the possibilities are endless! Whether you want to be a stealthy thief 🦝, a fearless warrior ⚔️, or a powerful mage 🧙‍♀️, Skyrim has got you covered. And if you get bored, just take an arrow in the knee and become a town guard! 🎯🏰

The glitches in Skyrim are practically a feature at this point. 😜 Who needs bug-free gameplay when you can witness a flying mammoth 🐘 or a horse doing acrobatics? 🐴🤸‍♂️ It's like watching Cirque du Soleil in the land of dragons! 🎪🐉

But you know what? Despite the occasional wonky moments, Skyrim has a special place in my heart ❤️. It's a game that can make you laugh, cry, and then laugh again when a giant sends you flying into the stratosphere. 🚀😂

So grab your sword, charge up your magic, and embark on the adventure of a lifetime! 🗡️✨ Just make sure to stock up on cheese wheels for those dragon encounters... 🧀🐉🏔️",1615226436,1684704013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You do the same thing, you wander around the same places, you fight the same bandit whether he's level 12 or level 48. Magic sucks, the game is totally broken and easily beaten with the same stealth archer build every playthrough. The artificial intelligence is a joke, enemies get stuck on walls, enemies can be cheesed and kited in almost every situation that involves a dungeon or a cave. The game can glitch out anytime it wants to, their isn't one reason to explore anything in this game with fast-travel being enabled. The single-player original experience is so disgustingly short that you basically HAD to buy the DLC content just to get more life out your purchase. The mod content that is free, is amazing, but the mod content that they have tried to convince people to buy (and they have) is hilarious. Virtually everything in Skyrim has been done better in every other RPG, even as far back as Morrowind.

This game has had a long life. It was released when I was still in college, and the fact that I could still load it up and find something new today is impressive. This is partly because even though I've done several new games over the years, I tend to lose interest due to some other game, and never actually finish this one.

1: The main game story is short and boring AF. Sorry but it is. Can be conquered in 10 hours or so. Here is the story in 2 sentences. 
[spoiler] A guy has the power to speak dragon and learn their abilities. He has to kill an evil one who wants to destroy the world, The end. [/spoiler]

2: The graphics SUCKED, especially for the time it came out. 

3: The movement and combat are horse manure and oh so clunky. There were MANY other games out there at this same time, in the same vein that had nice, smooth and fun movement mechanics. This feels like something I would have played back in.... Oh WAIT!!! I did. Back when Marrowind released. *smh*

4: Dragons are massively bugged to this very day and often fly backwards and get stuck in the ground.

5: Used the same game engine from 15 years before its time

6: Touted as having 200+ endings. Lies. Changing one MINOR detail does not constitute an ""Alternate Ending"". Like re-branding a pack of skittles as a new flavor blend just because you took out all the yellow ones. 

7: Still wasn't even close to as good as Marrowind.

8: Final boss fight feels in no way epic or unique. Just fighting the same dragon you have been fighting but bigger and cooler looking but an easy kill even without crafting OP gear.

Upsides

Side quests are mostly cool. Lots of treasure to find. Crafting can make you OP beyond words. 

PS: I did not leave this review to help someone choose to buy this game because I dont know why you would, I did it more to piss off all the fanboys who somehow made this turd one of the most popular games ever. Like the year Madden won game of the Year. Morons.  

I can hear all the fanboys now exploding in their chairs and pants when they see my thoughts on this. Hope you wore your brown pants today gents.

My son got this game from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The Skyrim is an RPG i.e., a Role Playing Game, Kindly don’t misinterpret it as Rocket Propelled Grenade (: -\), However the Energy you can put into it for leveling and improving character states is nearby. Having gone through the very humble 90 levels of improvement, I can say it require some serious amount of focus and retries, which is a fa.c.tor that takes some toll. The game consists of leveling system for enemies, items, characters and weapons. the main character\player level is gained through completing various main and side quests, this level progress makes the levels of enemies and items adjusted so that the gameplay can remain enjoyable. Weapons states becomes higher with leveling as well. The Game allows you to try so many varieties of weapons that a normal human, who may be a gamer, with would not even aware of existence of such vocabulary of weapons. This was my thought when I first played Oblivion and the Skyrim made it more memorable. The spell casting, is what makes the combat magical, given that I human, not aware of fighting mechanics other than shooting bullets, guns and vehicles. This is immersive as hell. Game allows you to choose your class by fighting style you want to play. If a human prefers more worldly combat, it can choose swords, shield and glorious medivals items... for other worldly combat it can choose spell casting for damage from distance as well as magical restoring the lost self damage by their huge Magika (Fast brain stat). skill trees like Restoration, Destruction, Illusion, Alteration, Conjuration etc. require the use of Magika. Small amount of This also helps with Strength, Agility and Armor. Avoiding most of the combat is also possible by sneaking, going invisible etc. The First person sword play is fantastic and engaging, player can use Swords, Bows, Axes and Hammers. Finishing moves are different for various weapon class, resulting in instant takeout. Bows and Arrows in combination of medival world puts you ages behind the current technology. The Skyrim open world is great to explore and most of the exploration require time taking yet enjoyable walking and horse riding etc., after that fast travel option becomes available. Caves are full of trapes and leveled creatures and contains good variety of in game items and weapons from fallen enemies.    

Graphics

The huge open World of Skyrim is full of colorful vegetation. Trees, pathways, flowing rivers, snow mountain range are realistic. smoke effects in caves as well as climate changing effect of outdoors gives sense of realism. The tree leaves animate with wind effect. The day night cycle is present with gradual change in outdoor lighting. Flames, sparks, magical effect all are great in visual appeal and pleasant to watch in combination with indoor lighting. Every unique variety of creatures, characters, items and weapons is in good looking details.

Characters and Animation

The characters are high in geometric detail and animation is not quite as jerky. First person view provides good details on models of weapon. Creature and other player classes have unique character models. The Huge Dragons in Skyrim world looks very detailed and player can admire the detail when it comes to the close combat.

Sound

The atmospheric sound is immersive and player can get lost in huge open world. Dialogs are not very repetitive and adds to realism. caves, rivers and other indoor areas are alive with sounds of flowing water, fire and other creatures usual natural indoor-outdoor sound. ice storms are also loud and atmospheric.

Story

The main quest is long and takes good amount of time to complete. It is quite rewarding regarding in game items. side quest some time also provides unique in game items, weapons etc.  

Conclusion

The experience is worth the playing of game, while admiring the beauty of medival world representation... but The Game is very time consuming given the RPG mechanics. 

Overall, 9/10

Developed by Bethesda Game Studios, Skyrim takes place in the province of Skyrim, a land of frozen tundras, towering mountains, and ancient ruins, where players take on the role of the Dragonborn, a hero with the power to slay dragons and save the realm from destruction.

One of the game's standout features is its open-ended gameplay, which allows players to approach the game however they see fit. Players can choose to focus on the main questline, or they can explore the world at their leisure, engaging in side quests, interacting with NPCs, and discovering hidden treasures and secrets.

The game's combat system is highly refined, with a range of weapons, spells, and abilities that players can use to take on enemies, including the game's iconic dragons. The game's leveling system is also unique, with players able to customize their character's skills and attributes to suit their playstyle.

Visually, the game is breathtaking, with a world that is both beautiful and dangerous. The game's sound design is also exceptional, with a dynamic soundtrack that adds to the game's atmosphere and sense of adventure.

Skyrim's modding community is also one of its greatest strengths, allowing players to further customize their experience with a range of user-generated content, from new weapons and armor to entire new storylines and quests.

Overall, Skyrim is a masterpiece of an RPG that offers players a world that is both immersive and believable, and countless hours of gameplay.

Game play is dull.
Character gets stuck.
Game crashes a lot.

Skyrim is a masterpiece of role-playing games that has captivated players for years. The game is set in a vast open-world filled with countless adventures, treasures, and dangers. Skyrim is a game that you can spend hundreds of hours exploring and still find something new every time you play.

The game's graphics and soundtrack are stunning and immersive, with epic scores that accompany the player's journey through the wilderness, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins. The sound effects are equally impressive, and they add a sense of realism and intensity to the game's combat and exploration.

Skyrim's gameplay mechanics are robust and diverse, allowing players to choose from a wide range of playstyles, including archery, magic, and melee combat. Players can also engage in crafting, smithing, and enchanting to enhance their weapons, armor, and potions.

The game's questlines are intricate and engaging, with many branching paths and choices that have significant consequences on the story's outcome. The game's factions and characters are memorable, with unique personalities and motivations that make them feel alive.

Skyrim's modding community is one of the most active and creative in the gaming world. With thousands of mods available, players can customize their game experience to their liking, adding new quests, weapons, and even entire new worlds.

However, the game is not without its flaws. The game's AI can be frustrating at times, with characters getting stuck or behaving erratically. The game's combat mechanics can also feel repetitive after a while, and some players may find the leveling system confusing or overly complex.

Despite its flaws, Skyrim is an unforgettable gaming experience that should be on every RPG fan's must-play list. Its stunning graphics, immersive soundtrack, engaging gameplay, and endless replayability make it a timeless classic that never gets old.",1680624187,1680624187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]What It Is:[/b]
A very Bethesda RPG experience with some deep series lore and what was, at the time, a pretty expansive ability to accept modded content, moreso than Oblivion.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Set foot into Tamriel once again, the legendary province of Skyrim. Birthplace of the nords, slayers of dragons, and some idiot trying to jump up a mountain so he can force shout a goat off of it. Yeah it's a bit ludicrous as far as RPGs go but it's fun!

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Not hard, it's a very dumbed down RPG experience. That's not to say it isn't fun, but you aren't going to be breaking out the spreadsheets for this one folks.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
This older version of the game does need a lot for the graphics and the optimization of those graphics. It runs a lot less smoothly, but I don't know if that makes it any less stable.

[b]Audio:[/b]
The voice acting is pretty lackluster, but the soundtrack, dragons, shouts, and other general effects are really great. I would say using Sounds of Skyrim pushes this even further into perfection territory.

[b]Replay Value:[/b]
Insanely high with the myriad of mods and alternate stories you now have access to through the Nexus. I'm going to mention Nexus a lot. Because while this game does hold up on its own it is so much more with mods.

[b]What I Like:[/b]
Skyrim continues to permeate internet culture, and there's good reason why. While many berate the game for its numerous bugs and general lack of depth when compared to its sister titles, Skyrim is a fun experience for gamers of all types in its vanilla form. If you're a hardcore gamer, enjoy the delights of breaking the skill system to become a walking god. If you're a softy, just sit back and take in the countryside and cave systems of the Nordic lands.

The game really shines with its huge selection of mods from Nexus and other sources, many of which improve upon the aforementioned bugs and serve to deepen the experience Skyrim can give you. Make Skyrim a survival game if you want, or make it have guns, or even make yourself a chicken. Lots of things are possible with the mods, including enhanced ENB graphics.

[b]What I Don't[/b]
There are far too many rereleases of this game, causing fracture in the modding community. Aside from that, there are (as stated) numerous bugs and issues within the game which really need to be fixed via community patches to get the full pleasure from the game.",1577932026,1679439056,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Final Verdict:[/b]

Skyrim is the gift that keeps on giving. With countless re-releases and remasters, Bethesda has proven that they will milk this game until the end of time. But hey, who needs new games when you can just keep playing Skyrim, am I right?

Sure, the graphics may be outdated and the combat clunky, but who cares? You can spend hundreds of hours exploring the vast open world, slaying dragons, and shouting at everything that moves. And if you get bored of the vanilla game, just add some mods! Want to turn dragons into Thomas the Tank Engine? Done. Want to replace every NPC with Macho Man Randy Savage? No problem.

And let's not forget about the constant stream of re-releases. Want to play Skyrim on your toaster? There's a version for that. Want to play Skyrim in VR? There's a version for that too. It's like Bethesda is daring you to keep buying the same game over and over again.

But let's be real here, we all know the real reason we keep coming back to Skyrim.

The combat is fun.

Almost all of the story is discovered through the main quest, unless you read books left lying around.

The character progression has a large variety to try out (replayable multiple ways).

There are lots of side quests.

The world is a good size.

Cons:
The graphics engine was not new and has been used in games prior to its release.  Although, there have been a few updates to the engine during its production.  The engine was dated prior to its release.

The engine, over a decade after its release, is dated.  You cannot play this game over 60hz or you will experience an unplayable game.

The graphics are dated.

The game crashes.  You must save very often.

The physics system is buggy.

NPC's have pathing issues, spawn in the air, spawn lying down and spin upwards to stand, etc.

The UI is a mess and inconsistent.  As an example, some dialogs on the PC will use Y/N for yes no questions and others will use Enter/Tab.  It's obvious that the UI was a port from a console and that this game was not re-designed well for the PC.

The dungeon design is inconsistent.  In some dungeons, the loot is horrible and others a magnitude of 20x the loot for the same combat situations.  It's obvious multiple designers kitted out dungeons and didn't follow a standardized loot model.",1677137837,1677137837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

72850,133385529,76561198291592126,0,6,598,0,598,1493066755,"Strap in, because I'm about to tear Skyrim a new one.

Let's start with the graphics. Sure, they might have been impressive in 2011, but now they look like dog shit. The textures are muddy, the character models are ugly as sin, and the environments are bland and uninspired. And don't even get me started on the animations. They're clunky, stiff, and downright laughable. I've seen more realistic movements in a marionette show.

But it's not just the graphics that suck. The gameplay is a mess. The combat is sluggish and unresponsive, and the AI is dumber than a sack of hammers. Enemies just stand there and let you hit them, and the only challenge comes from the game's broken difficulty scaling. And don't even think about playing as a mage. The spells are weak, the animations are embarrassing, and the entire magic system is a joke.

And what about the story? It's a clichéd mess that's been done a million times before. You're the ""chosen one"" who has to save the world from some vague threat. Whoop-de-freaking-do. The characters are forgettable, the dialogue is wooden, and the voice acting is abysmal. It's like the developers got a bunch of interns to record the lines in a broom closet.

And let's not forget about the bugs. Holy shit, the bugs. Glitches, freezes, crashes, you name it. It's like the developers didn't even bother to test the game before they released it. And when they did release it, they didn't bother fixing any of the issues. They just left it to the modding community to clean up their mess.

And what's with the UI? It's like the designers were trying to create the most confusing and cumbersome interface possible. Navigating through menus is a chore, and trying to manage your inventory is a nightmare. It's like they were actively trying to make the game less fun to play.

Overall, Skyrim is a bloated, buggy, broken mess of a game that's only popular because of its modding community. If you want a good RPG, play something else. Anything else. Because this game is a steaming pile of dragon crap.",1677106739,1677106739,False,1,2,0.487895727157592773,0,True,False,False

Also, how many times will a random npc interrupt a dialogue to say something stupid? Or stop a fight to deliver a message to me?

Even with that experience, I can't describe it as anything more than a bland time waster. It's miraculous; Bethesda somehow developed an RPG that hates any form of roleplaying beyond the most superficial layer. Every part of this game presents the bare minimum to pass as acceptable. I'll break them down as follows:

1) Combat is entirely button mashing and waiting on cooldowns with little strategy. Sit in front of enemies, slap them a couple times, wait for your stamina to regenerate, rinse and repeat. If you're playing a melee character, the default playstyle in just about any RPG, this is the entire game without exaggeration. Playing a mage build? Cry. Early game magic sucks ass, and even with a leveled up character you still end up mashing a single button so you can wait on a cooldown. The game's only meaningful difficulty comes from enemies with inflated health pools that behave exactly the same as the trash mobs you've been fighting with 10% of your brain capacity. At least playing a stealth archer is decently fun, which is good because it's the single viable build that nearly every player will end up gravitating to like a black hole

2) The huge map is largely empty, populated with copy-pasted fortresses and mind-numbing cave systems. The frost-coated landscapes of Skyrim are pretty at a glance, but quickly blur together into a grey mush as you realize nearly every area in the game is the exact same. Navigation doesn't consist of exploring for secrets or engaging with the world's layout; simply bring up your fantasy GPS and boot up Tamriel Maps so you can walk in a straight line for ten minutes. The same could be said for some of Bethesda's other titles, but Skyrim certainly puts the least effort into hiding how barebones its auto-generated map really is. The only decent areas in the game are the couple of curated towns like Whiterun and Solitude, but those locations are rarely populated with interesting things to do.

3) Quests are extremely simple, rarely presenting meaningful choices beyond ""hehe, wouldn't it be so random and evil if you just killed this guy and failed his associated quests?"" The surrounding narrative sucks too. I feel no need to elaborate on this point, considering that barely anybody finishes the game's main questline. Some of the lore is kinda neat, but instead of complementing the actual game you interact with, they're regulated to random books you can read. Don't get me wrong, I love some good environmental storytelling; I'm a huge fan of the Souls games. However, the lore in Skyrim doesn't overlap with the actual player experience. Instead, it truly just feels like booting up an in-game pdf and reading some fanfiction about the in-universe cosmology.

I can believe that many people, including Bethesda themselves, have a strong fondness for Skyrim. It's a decent gateway into more interesting roleplaying experiences that came before and after, including GOAT titles such as Fallout: New Vegas and Elden Ring. However, anybody still holding it up as a great game is huffing some major copium. For nearly every disease plaguing modern AAA game design, you can trace their infection back to Skyrim, patient zero.",1676447697,1676473586,False,16,2,0.558965146541595459,8,True,False,False

Skyrim is a great game! It's I'll list the pros and cons
Pros
Open world-
A lot of items-
Lots of mods in the community-
More than over 100 quests-
So many places to explore-
Difficulty settings (I don't know but I like it)-
Has a lot of lore to it-
Able to replay it for a different approach-
.
Okay now here's the cons
Cons
Has a lot of bugs (get a wooden plate, run at a wall and see what I mean)-
The storyline feels forced onto you-
Not a broad range of voice actors (seeming how the Jarl sounds like this farmer I met on the road.)-
Small cities-
Dragons are so stupid (In most legends they're serious threats, in this game they're just souls for you... yeah.)-
.
So thats the pros and cons from my point and angle and I personally like the game alot so I'm going to put it down as positive.                                  (Be hit by a giant and become a eagle lol)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanna start doing reviews and Skyrim HAS to be the first game!
my hours on steam dont reflect the time i played bcs reasons, but i had roughly 2k hours before so i played my fair share;

skyrim was my first big game/rpg and i had never experienced such freedom to explore and mysteries to uncover, everything from this game captivated me to just play more and more but sadly most of it is nostalgia, u most likely wont feel the same way, the game is dated even tho mods help a ton and at this point are essential;

so in summary, probably u watched a video about how awesome this game is or some friend talked bout it and now u want to try it out, know that most players have nostalgia and there are better games out there, but even if u wanna play it i highly recommend installing some mods, the UI and the combat are the clumsiest part, the game is foccused on exploration so there is no order to do things, take your time, appreciate the scenery while listening to the music and the atmosphere, do the secundary missions and guilds
in the end just try to have a good time and see the beauty in and of skyrim

This game was a real change in the industry and it marked a whole generation.

This game was far from perfect but it worked. 
Its dungeons were pretty repetitive, the NPC variety was low and its system combat was fun but simple and again, repetitive.
But the exploratory feeling that you get the first time you play this game masks the majority of its issues. 
Also the story around dragons is marvelous. 
Not to mention that the ice ambient is one of my favorites.


Apart from that, this game has grown pretty bad.
Animations look horrible nowadays, and open world standards have improved too much, leaving this game too obsolete.
I am still remembering this game, probably for a newcomer it is much easier to clear the game.


I am [b]still recommending this game[/b] and I hope to see a kind of remake of this game because it really deserves it.

My play time in this game across multiple titles, versions, etc., is not reflected in this number. I've been playing it since just after it came out and my cousin loaned it to me for my birthday.

If you REALLY want to know something about the game, just know that it's a wildly entertaining power fantasy with some questionable mechanics. Something in the game WILL break while you're playing. 50/50 if it's hilarious or entirely locks you out of progressing without reloading a previous save.

Beyond that, standard fantasy RPG tropes abound. Magic isn't really that good beyond mid-game. The most powerful damage spells are really only good as son as you unlock them. Level beyond that and their usefulness drops with each level. That said, the other schools of magic can provide you alternatives to leveling other skills - Illusion lets you go invisible at higher levels, bypassing the need to level sneak for instance - and magic in this game is fun, but not nearly what it was in previous installments.

stealth mechanics are decent. The indicator for how visible you are is fairly intuitive in the form of an eye that opens more and more until you're spotted and stealth is broken. Level up the skill and you can take advantage of damage multipliers for attacking while hidden. There's a meme in the community about ""stealth archers"" for a good reason; it's arguably the easiest way to play the game. Nobody will see you, you will do insane damge, and every combat encounter is over before the enemy even knows what happened. 

Physical combat is straightforward. Pick your preferred weapon, preferred armor class, and go hit things until they fall down. Blocking is a thing and can and will serve you when you're getting swarmed, but those instances are rare and most enemies can simply be battered down without much effort on your part. Kill move animations keep it entertaining, though they get kinda samey after a while. 

Visually the game is still gorgeous in its natural state. Character models are definitely dated, even with the updated graphics of anniversary or whatever, but the environments are just beautiful. Sound design is excellent, the voice acting is... Good. I've defintely heard worse, but the ""Nord"" accent is just weird. 

Honestly, if you like open world games, like fantasy RPGs, or are looking for something with a huge amount of ridiculous and slightly insane lore (look up ""Dragon Breaks"" and tell me that's not nucking futs) then you have absolutely nothing to lose by giving this game a try. Worst case you appreciate a few memes a bit better because a guard tells you about when he used to be an adventurer or asks you why you're upset. Best case scenario, a thousand hours go by and you can speak a few words of Dragon and have a character that can one-shot gods while laughing off ten times as much damage as you can dish out, and that's BEFORE you start modding the game and opening up THAT can of worms. 

Seriously, play the game without any mods all the way through the main story plus whichever side-quests you want to check out vanilla first. No mods, on Creation Club, just the base game/DLCs. THEN start adding in player-created content, because HOO BOY does it change everything.",1675267638,1675267638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When this game dropped on 11-11-11 that was the beginning of the end, of Bethesda lol. It's basically the unholy accumulation of all the normies favorite mechanics from earlier games and with the visual flair to boot. It taught the company that they can get away with the bare necessities for what made their games so popular and good and thats why Fallout 4 came out the way it did.....................
Skyrim is probably my most played elder-scrolls game despite not being my favorite, I don't find it as mechanically interesting as Morrowind nor half as charming and well written as oblivion. Despite this though I have grown to appreciate the simplicity that Skyrim has to offer, it makes Skyrims more impressive dialogue and quests impact you just a little bit more.
However this effect is only achieved because most of Skyrim feels flat and stagnant so when you finally do stumble upon an actually interesting quest or storyline you can't believe what you're seeing cause you really don't expect there to be anything that substantial.
There is allot of fun to be had in the open world, but aside from that there isn't really much else here. The magic system from previous games has been stripped replaced instead by premade spells with pre-determined effects. There is basically no interesting spells in vanilla. There are a very minuscule amount of weapons and armors for you to pick from in the vanilla game. The vanilla game just feels empty as fuck.
Thankfully Skyrim mods still get made to this day lol",1436212026,1675191735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This version is in all ways superior to the Special edition if you want to take ownership of your purchase. And it is hidden from the store proper. The expansions are marked up like a daddy-forsaken pole pilot with a fondness for V Twin-straddling adipose hairballs excreted into chaps, with three fewer front teeth than a meff maven. Also hidden from search in the Steam store, sharing in that outcome the due shame for the former, whilst punishing the latter worse than present society would abide. There is no option to buy the complete 32 bit Skyrim on Steam, even hidden.

Because Todd & Co doesn't like you.

They don't relish your access to the pinnacle of their creation, they resent modders doing the job better than the rented mule IP custodians were allowed to. You will own Arbitrary Coins (after you buy them for a rate competing with decent whiskey), Buy Skins, and Be Happy.

IF you merely choose to throw away your labor and resources whilst celebrating the elevation of your oppressor, proclaiming all the while how privileged you feel, the Special Edition beckons to you. It runs fine, and looks better than vanilla Skyrim. Which is good indeed, since any mods that get you chuffed will be immolated when the next patch comes through whilst you sleep or earn wages enough to buy Todd another disposable bidet, allowing you the auspicious privilege of broken saves, diminished QOL, a Kulak-worthy inventory stripping, and the instant absence of all the loot you stashed in that player-made bolt hole the next time you make your escape into your previously welcoming safe space.

""What do you want?!"" I want Legendary Edition to remain an option. Todd need not even give it any more attention. Modders made it more stable than Todd ever did, made it look better, and balanced it to supremacy. He could be collecting $50 for the complete 32 bit experience, and I would buy it for every additional PC I installed it on, since mods really make the expense something beyond compare. But Todd chose to charge money for mods, basically. And they don't work very well. When you buy ice cream from a given vendor and you run a 37% risk of dysentery, you don't buy the ice cream. Well, Todd? Well, Steam? Yarr matey. Full sail, broadside canons load heavy shot, And ready chain shot on the bow tubes. Full ahead flank out into the Open Seas!

It is very cool to walk around places you know, talking with people you recognize, and in general just immerse yourself in your target language while understanding far more than you would if the material was entirely new (assuming you've played Skyrim before, that is). I haven't tried French yet, but the Japanese translation is really interesting - after a short adjustment period, the default guard quips and bandit verbal harassment has become almost as wonderfully normal and hackneyed as the English ones.

There's a problem with Skyrim versions and SKSE that requires some work, though. If you want to play with mods & with Japanese VO etc, you have to:
1) Install Skyrim in English (steam settings, not in-game - this will reinstall all the localized files)
2) Copy Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim\TESV.exe to a safe place.
3) Install Skyrim in Japanese.
4) Replace the outdated japanese TESV.exe with the one you copied earlier.
5) Install SKSE, mods, etc as usual.

Good luck reading the handwritten font that books are written in if you're playing in Japanese though. I've read several books in the language, both modern novels and chunky old tomes, but deciphering these books is beyond me about 50% of the time.

I love the fantasy setting, I love the huge amount of skill trees and perks to build around, I love all the different gear and magic available to use- it's really just an incredible RPG that can play differently every time you boot it up. 

The score of this game is fantastic; every time I pick it up and hear the Dragonborn theme on the main menu, I'm drawn in all over again. This sentiment extends to the dynamic music changes as different events play out in the overworld too, ranging from a random bandit whose ire I've drawn to a feisty dragon zooming in to get clapped. I really enjoy the fact that I can basically hear what's happening before I'm able to visually take it in.

The combat, while one of the lower points of the game, is still far from poor. There's not a lot of depth to the melee combat; you're typically just trading beat-sticks and stepping back or blocking to mitigate damage, whereas the enemy will just walk towards you in a straight line. That said, I do think there's plenty of room to spice it up for yourself with the inclusion of off-handing a spell, managing your shouts and powers in combat, or using bows/crossbows as a support for a companion. I could make the argument that this generic style of combat was necessary in order to include all of these different gameplay styles, but Dark Souls has just as many options and combat is its shining feature.

The amount of content is staggering as well. I truly think I could do multiple separate playthroughs that take dozens of hours apiece and not repeat a quest, (other than the intro and probably the quests to unlock Unrelenting Force because that's the most OP shit in the game and I love it). There's plenty of factions that have their own questlines, there's a civil war you can choose to get involved in, there's the destiny of the Dragonborn to uncover, cities to champion- there's just no end to what you can do in the land of Skyrim, and I think it's great that all of these are options.

Obviously Skyrim is a good game; it's been released like five separate times over three console generations in the last ten years. It also goes on sale all the time- you could pick up the base game + DLC for super cheap and already have a couple hundred hours of content to go through if you wanted to peruse it all, or you could dive into the modding scene and add a ton of stuff to the game: weapons, quests, armors, better graphics and textures, all of that. There's also weird sex stuff if you're a degenerate, but no judgement. Actually strike that, if you're gonna download that stuff, big judgement, go outside instead.

Even at release it was obvious that the mechanics of Skyrim were mostly unchanged from earlier entries in the series, going as far back as Daggerfall in 1994. The paint job was good enough to make up for it, but it was all just uninspired and kind of bland. It has the feeling of a game designed by engineers, not artists.

Today we're spoiled. And it's haaaaard to play an RPG with a main quest this bad, almost no variety in dungeons or environments, awful writing, repetitive voice acting, stiff animations, plastic facial expressions, etc. Virtually every RPG that has come out since puts it to shame.

I appreciate The Elder Scrolls as a series, and especially the early games, for being some of the first big fat fantasy worlds gamers got to explore. But Skyrim kind of sucks, and it's the last one I would go back and play today.",1635764722,1674195155,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly I've probably spent more of my time modding and troubleshooting this hock of shit. So even if you do mod it chances are you'll run into problems where the game won't start, an increase in bugs and clunk, or even the game deciding that it can't find textures that it already has by default even after uninstalling the 1000 mods you had.

Do expect:
- Falling mammoths and little girls, FTL-travelling cows, and other oddities.
- Extremely polite wildlife, that will only hunt YOU, but rarely each other.
- Paper thin NPC characters, who sound the same when talking about their daughter's gruesome death as when talking about their breakfast.
- A truly staggering amount of never to be patched bugs, glitches, and the like, that has become a stuff of legends.
- So much fun on your adventures, that you will stop caring about all of the above.

72850,129889844,76561198157328031,347,12,790,0,784,1697306509,"I like reviewing games. I like trying to put something as abstract as an experience into specific words. But I often write too many positives, shying from negatives thinking if I play it more I'll get it. Just by instinct, in appearance, I personally shy away from open worlds and that therefore I shouldn't comment. Just an indie game worshipper. But, truthfully, I have a lot of problems with this game in the current amount I've played. So I will write a negative until further notice.

I really, really want to like this game. I really want to be able to sink my teeth into it. I love the idea of the world and the setting. I want to look weird humming on the Dragonborn theme obsessing over the world. Everyone seems to rave on about it, as among open worlds as among one of the better ones and if thats the case all I think is 'how?' How is this such a classic? What am I not fundamentally getting? Am I impatient? No... I am very patient when it comes to having something to do and focus on. Am I uncreative? Possibly... I'm not 100% used to RPGs or open world sandboxing per se, maybe I'm not 'setting my own role play' well enough. But honestly at the core, I feel like there should be something enticing in the first place to do that. And there just isn't.

What are my main gripes? Well, it takes way too bloody long for anything to happen and is very bland and homogenous in the core aspects. Maybe things pick up later down the line, maybe. But that's only inevitable, once you've explored everything and got the fast travel. The actual manner of getting to that point though? Just not fun.

First, the movement. You have to painstakingly trek from place to place. To progress any level of the story or even your abilities, you have to walk. And walk. And walk. You can't even sprint, you run out of stamina if you do that. You walk, spring, take a breather, and walk. So you just walk. Until you find what you need. Then you walk all the way back. You have to trek up a whole mountain for I don't even know how long just to learn one of your most fundamental basic abilities, the shout. There is a fast travel ability once you find it, but only if you've already gone to the place. If you are going to waste my time for 13 hours in this way before I've got even the slightest grasp of the world or a novel mechanic, why bother? It also gives a feeling of a not flowing story-if you are to have an open world, the idea is that the world is open, my experience is open. So when you paint down a linear 'core' path in the first place and say 'meet at blank to do blank, now meet at blank to do blank', it really kills the immersion.

Maybe I play the game wrong-maybe wanting to immerse myself in the story and go point to point is not the right way to play. I took tips-explore freely, as you are going down a path. Using the stroll from place to place as a moment of reflection on the scenery. The issue of taking way too long for stuff to happen for no real gain is still there though. You walk and see the vast wilderness. Cool, but it doesn't feel distinct enough to the other snowy mountain you saw. It feels all rather grey in style. But an even bigger problem is the wandering is contrary to your goal-it is just one big empty space separating you and from where you need to be.

I think utilizing wandering is an excellent idea in games-let me mention one game that does it brilliantly-The Witness. Not just because all the areas feel fresh and distinct but because the nature of the world means completion happens at every point in the map, always. So you are always finding something to do. In Skyrim, all your main progression is at specific points you need to get to. Sure there are quests and other things scattered and I'll get to that but basically, it means you don't get any satisfaction towards the game during the wandering period. Making an excuse that I just need to be patient and find my own way to pass the time is not going to cut it given the context of this game. Aren't I supposed to be fighting dragons or something?

Maybe you come across a village, find a dungeon, explore it. But it doesn't feel satisfying. Because it doesn't feel any newer really. There may be a few tidbits mentioned that maybe you could explorer 'more' lore to-but it has no real depth of impact to me and doesn't feel it ties into a larger whole. Sure, that's also basically real life but is that what I want from a game? No. Everyone you talk to sounds so bland and disinterested too. Which is annoying since that is how you are supposed to learn about the world you are in. I naturally want to hear everything they say but I just get annoyed half the time. I think I'd much rather get my tutorial from the infodump text sheet style of tutorial, seriously. Sometimes they give crucial information on how to get somewhere but I just miss it because zzzzzzz...

But even worse, the combat feels while in some sense 'solid' and I wanted to view it as a positive but it just, feels really really boring. Your attack options are... swing a sword! And swing a sword. Maybe block, wait then swing. I personally use a bow, since it is the most interesting. Crouch and aim, now I have some actual layer of skill. For a combat focused game, there is no satisfaction to the combat. Just who swings at the other the most wins. Maybe you use magic and just hold it down on them and they get status effects. Sure, maybe there is a better depth there. But nothing feels any different, especially not when starting out. Woooooow... I already feel so sluggish and that certainly doesn't help matters. 

I come across a dragon at some point while trekking. Cool, great to fight a dragon! The only issue is in my current state, it feels there is absolutely nothing I can do but walk my slow ass backwards because I have basically no good tools to fight with. So why place me in that situation in the first place? This doesn't feel like the interesting kind of 'undefeatable souls boss' to return to later after getting pummeled, it just feels like an annoying obstacle badly paced with the tools I've been given. I'd want to have those tools to fight properly, but that doesn't occur fast enough and probably requires yet more walking place to place.

One other thing I take note of though that cements all my points is that this isn't a good RPG which I've been told before. People play it to 'fuck around' and mod it and shit. Which is of course great, that is what open world games are good at. But the base game should also be fine with solid mechanics. When someone showed me the way you actually deal with shop in this game is by sticking a bucket on someone and stealing, it just felt like removing a core element

So, the combat is boring. The movement is sluggish. The world is homogenous. The immersion and pacing is completely killed for me. I've spent 13 hours and little has happened.

I feel perhaps people begin to expect monotonous nonsense as something to truck through in games. And don't mind sinking time into doing nothing. But not me. I like my game to be more consistently a great or interesting time throughout.",1672610297,1672614373,False,0,2,0.495867788791656494,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying I'm a modder and an intense one at that. I have recommended the original Skyrim edition because of its modding capabilities and how many mods are out there for it. The special edition simply does not have near as many. 

Now i will focus on the actual game without mods. Skyrim is a timeless game. The only games i can think of that have had a longer lifespan than Skyrim are Doom and Counter Strike, People will still be playing this game for at least another 5 years maybe 10. There's a good reason for this. The freedom to move about is very involving however the actual open world outside of cities can feel quite empty with a lack of enemies in the wild. This can be fixed by mods. The combat system was very intuitive for it's time but can now feel rather clunky and simple. This can be fixed with mods. The game can be VERY buggy but as they say "" it's not a bug its a feature"" There is so much to do in this game that I have dumped hundreds of hours into this and will stay dumping hundreds of hours more because like I said there is so much to do and even after 500 hours there is still much left to uncover. I have completed all of the DLC story lines multiple times both with mods and without.

I'm going to go into detail about specific mechanics of the game to expound about the core aspects of the game.

First off, the companion mechanic allows you to develop an authentic feeling relationship with your companions. I've never played a game where you can marry companions or other NPCs so that is something that separates this game from others.I will say that their AI can be really stupid sometimes. When you're trying to stealth attack specifically Lydia will go balls to the wall and just clobber on the nearest enemy as soon as she spots them ruining your stealth approach. Due to situations like this stealth is a useless and non-existent mechanic in this game.Another aspect is the ability to adopt children. No other game includes that that i've ever heard of.

Now let's focus on the combat. The combat system at the time it was created was ground breaking. People lost their minds over the ability to equip fire hands and a sword in the other. There are still few games that allow you to have a set up like this. Nowadays in comparison to other first person RPG combat games the combat system can feel clunky and very repetitive as you're just swinging your weapon chaotically and raising your shield to block. Most games in the modern day include a dodging mechanic which is either a sidestep or a rolling move. This is non-existent mechanic in the game however this can be fixed with mods.

Now on to the skill tree and upgrade system. The skill tree is not very intuitive as some skills feel out of place and they cannot be unlocked until later in the game and its feels like it should have been able to be unlocked much earlier in the game. The UI for it is very pretty however and very unique compared to other games whereas most modern games like this take Elden Ring for example have a very complex unlocking system and it takes time to learn. With Skyrim you can simply scroll through the constellations and see how the skills build up and plan accordingly of what you want to unlock and when.

Now on to the main story and DLC story content. The story is rather simple but the relationships you build with the characters involved in the stories feel very real and authentic. The characters speak in a natural tone and say things that if this were real life they would be things that somebody ( or something) would say. There arent many choices you get to make in the stories other than the major choice you make in the civil war. The correlation between stories can feel very strange because you can go all the way through a storyline beat the final boss of the main storyline then come back to a secondary story and people speak to you and treat as if you have not become something of a god and have saved the world so depending on the path you've taken it can feel very awkward. You have to abandon the sense of lack of correlation between the stories .

This is all that I will leave a review for as this is very long winded already. I could write for an hour on this game but I will elave you with this, Skyrim is an amazing game and set the precedent for how modern open world RPGs operate and every game since then has taken concepts from it and have developed it. I didn't get into this game until many years after it's inception so I don't like this game purely because of nostalgia but because this is a genuinely well made game. Of course there are problems and much mroe than modern open world games but that is because open world games were still in their infancy when this game came around. Bethesda is known for leaving bugs in and I think that is an endearing aspect of the game and why people will continue to play it because with every play-through something strange and new will happen whether it be because of strange bugs or simply because they put so much time into this game that there are always new things to discover. If you have read this review i appreciate you and if you've never played this game I highly recommend it!",1672153275,1672153298,True,1,0,0.521620273590087891,0,True,False,False

However, some players and critics have criticized Skyrim for its repetitive gameplay and quests, and for its bugs and technical issues. The game's combat and character progression systems have also been criticized for being unbalanced and shallow.

At the time the graphics were pretty nice (though I do think they're heavily dated now). Where the game excels is character creation and choosing what kind of path to follow as you build the character. Combat is generally easy and still fun. The story is honestly pretty mild and nothing special, and given how these games work it's pretty much impossible to have any good character development.

I found it not to hold up as well on replay. If you complete the game the first time around, there's not much new to see playing it again. The quests are the same.

Those minor things aside, the game is a well-deserved 10/10, probably in my top 20 all-time list. Even if you only play it once you have probably at least 200 hours of high-quality play waiting for you.",1670630034,1670630034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But this game is a steaming pile of garbage that people pretend is the greatest video game ever made. It's a mediocre RPG and an okay action game. WHEN IT WORKS. Nearly every single system is heavily flawed and cumbersome if not actively broken. This is a handbook for how not to make a game. The engine is bad. The scripting is bad. The ai is bad. The performance is bad. The world level map quest and combat design are all total crap. Some of the quests are alright but most of them suck, especially the main story. There are some individual elements that work out well, namely the art style. Watching this game be played by other people is the best and only way to squeeze any actual enjoyment out of this garbage. If you're a tiny brained easily amused simpleton chasing the trail of dopamine squirts on your way to a false sense of happiness, be my guest to waste your time on this bundle of operant conditioning stuffed into a pile of cheese wheels.

This game was fine in 2012 as a slightly improved Fallout 3 with dragons. Just like Oblivion was fine in 2008. But ultimately this is such a product of its time that there is no joy that can come out of this program that isn't viewed through the rose tinted goggles of nostalgia, or ironically enjoyed for the memes, or high off your mind on mushrooms. Todd Howard is a hack of a director and if this is your favorite game of all time you have all the taste as diehard Nickelback fans who claim they're the greatest band in the world. Because this game is just the Nickelback of RPGs. It's FINE, it's JUST OKAY, it's nothing special. And if you understand and accept that then you'll get exactly what you pay for.

Oblivion was a monumental landmark in open world game design. Fallout 3 was a monumental landmark in open world game design. Fallout New Vegas was and still is one of the greatest games of all time. Skyrim is a monumental landmark in pure visual aesthetic. But in gameplay it's just okay, AT BEST. But ""just okay"" is not enough to play something over a decade old. If Starfield and Redfall are just Skyrim in space or on a new engine, it's going to suck too. Bethesda are overrated and so is this game.

Я прирожденный убийца. Только попросите меня и Я пробьюсь через сотни бандитов, чтобы прикончить их главаря. Я убью самого императора за хорошее вознаграждение.

Я отличный вор. Вас интересует кольцо с бриллиантом, которое супруга ярла не снимает никогда? Я принесу его вам

Я идеальный наемник. Мне можно поручить что угодно. Я залезу в любую задницу мира ради древней скрижали.

Даже боги и Даэдра доверяют мне важные дела. Они знают, что Я выполню всё, что угодно, лишь бы этот проклятый значок задания перестал мылить мне глаза.

У меня есть только один недостаток. Если вы попросите меня сделать что-то, Я всё исполню, не сомневайтесь. Но вот когда это произойдет, не знает даже Хермеус Мора.

Я зачищаю очередное подземелье и нахожу искомую эльфийскую чашку. В двух шагах от подземелья находится форт, который меня кто-то и где-то просил зачистить. После зачистки Я вижу вдалеке медведя и вспоминаю, что одна девушка просила меня добыть 10 шкур этих животных. После охоты Я замечаю, что вещи складывать больше некуда и иду в близлежащий город, чтобы сплавить барахло. По дороге на меня нападают вампиры и на теле одного из них, Я нахожу записку, которая добавляет еще один, мурыжащий взгляд, значок задания на мою карту. Потом меня находит гонец, который говорит, что возрождается какая-то там королева волчица и во всём Скайриме только мне не лень пойти и прибить её. Уже вся карта усыпана этими проклятыми значками заданий. Десятки городов, сел, домов, фортов и везде Я кому-то что-то должен!!!

После недели таких мытарств, Я со словами ""Да ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ вы со своими проблемами сами, уроды недоделанные"" сваливаю в заброшенную, в тайге, хижину, ловить рыбу в ближайшем озере. Я живу там тихой мирной жизнью, пока меня не находит очередной гонец! (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Как он меня нашел???) С сообщением, что в какой-то жопе мира открылся музей.

Всё это время эльфийская чашка, о которой вы мечтали с 3 лет, пылится у меня на дне рюкзака. Получите вы её лишь тогда, когда меня волею судьбы занесёт в ваш богом забытый городок (потому что имбецил, который мною управляет, не хочет пользоваться фаст тревелом). И не дай бог, вы словите глюк и не захотите забирать у меня эту чашку. Я вам её засуну туда, где драконы не летают и фалмеры не кукарекают.

And yet, it's not a bad game. It's one of the defining titles of the 7th console generation.

I can't really explain the appeal. Part of it is probably the endless hype and excitement from when it came out--12 years ago, I can still remember how bad I wanted to play this game--but it's not just nostalgia. There are plenty of other western RPGs with open worlds (bigger ones, even) that don't hit the same either.

There is one specific thing I enjoy about this game which I can point out, at least: how broken it is. It's kind of strange, but I think the game is much more engaging *because* it's a mess. Trying to get unstuck from weird level geometry, breaking out the console to fix glitched questlines, creating totally busted equipment...it's fun. The way I think of it is, after the enemies in the game are no longer a threat, you start playing against the software itself, trying to hack, cheese, and exploit your way through to the end.

It has good mods and story behind it and its fairly long as well and with all the mod support you can truly make an full experience for yourself. in fact i am gonna go and see of my dad would play it his up in his years but i like to see how he will take to it as he enjoys the good old gortlet legends type of games that are old school dungeon crawlers.

This is one of the best games in my steam library, and I have some pretty good games. Lets get the worst out of the way first. (There's not much) It can get a little repetitive when it comes to dungeon raiding, but that's only if you never change your play style. Some of the animations are a little sketchy, but that's only compared to today's games. Now that that's out of the way, lets get to the good stuff. This game is amazing. The world is HUGE and has so many places for you to explore. Its got all of the things you need to RP if that's your style. (inns, carriages, fancy clothes, random items, ect.) It is a full on RPG with a skill tree for everything you could think of. (pick-pocketing, lock-picking, archery, 2 handed, 1 handed, BEING A GOD**MN WEREWOLF, ect.) Its got so many quests that you probably wont ever find them all without using a guide. The playtime on this game is the longest on any game I have ever played excluding MMOs. It seems the only thing this game is missing is online multiplayer. If ALL OF THAT is not enough for you, there is also a HUGE selection of mods in the steam workshop for you to add to your game and make it EVEN MORE EXTENSIVE. There is everything from Lord of the Rings weapons to Flaming horses to THOMAS THE TRAIN DRAGONS in the workshop. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?

Further reading. It's really, really good - with one small caveat: vanilla Skyrim is one of the most dull, uninspired RPG experiences imaginable. They dumbed-down or removed completely systems from the previous titles that didn't need to be, and only made the game world/player experience richer. Playing 'nilla Skyrim is like watching paint dry.

However, as someone who's been modding/playing modded ES games since 2003, and a lifetime Premium member of Nexus since '05, I can assure you that taking the time to learn properly how to install mods to your Skyrim will give you the best RPG experience possible. The sheer amount of mods out there guarantee, that if you patiently search for what you like and test what works, you can custom tailor the ideal single-player fantasy RPG for yourself. And you may find yourself so enthralled with your adventures, the main quest takes a back seat to all the wonder you uncover at every turn. Bethesda created a wonderful framework for us to sculpt into something beautiful. It's just up to you to decide if the task is worth it.

I should add the main reason I haven't switch to SSE yet, despite wanting to do so, is that not all of my 500 some mods I play with are fully/officially ported yet. And I'm just far too fond of some of the characters I've created over the years.",1667207712,1667207878,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I believe the above provides the gist to why everyone should play Skyrim, but to add some more detail about actual gameplay here are some highlights:
- Inventory management,
- First and/or third person play you choose at any time,
- Fun combat,
- You will do battle against various types of dragons in the main quest line, but also through random encounter battles with dragons that spawn without warning throughout the world,
- Also, dragon fights are much more than just a wow factor you want to fight and defeat them for a real reason that is directly tied to a gameplay and is also baked into the lore of the world itself,
- Custom crafted armor and weapons, accessories, enchanting, spell configuration, alchemy, extensive skill trees for all play-styles, and dungeon diving,
- The base game is gigantic on it's own and then there are multiple DLCs that not only expand the map but also add depth to the game with unique items, spells, races, and powers. One such DLC also adds a more in depth base building mechanic that is awesome. You can own homes in the base game and make them yours, but this particular DLC adds so much more.
- Remastered graphics, you can play the game on a potato computer or crank it up to ULTRA-bliss on a powerful PC and in either case you will love playing Skyrim.
- Also, Skyrim has one of THE BEST character customization tools I have seen anywhere.

My personal recommendation is buy the remastered version with better graphics and purchase the ""all DLCs included"" bundle they are definitely worth it and the DLCs are togglable meaning that even if you own them you don't have to use them and can play the base game as much as you like. I absolutely love playing this game and after multiple character builds, base game and then game with DLCs, and literal real-world years of playing I still love starting a new save file and replaying the entire game from zero to this day (09/18/2022).",1663552387,1663552387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coming back to re-review the product that nobody has wanted or needed a review for in the past nine years.

This is an eminently [i]playable[/i] game, but miserably simplistic in order to not over-tax the minds of the lowest common denominator.  It's optimized as a cash grab (as a decade of re-releases has abundantly shown), sacrificing complex decision making mechanics for low-commitment multiple choice which insults the... less linear of mind.  This is high fantasy for CoD players.

The plot is bad.  That is not an opinion; it's objective fact.  It is utterly ignorant of fundamental plot structure, driven instead by a pandering to instant gratification.  It takes about one hour of play to be identified as the Messiah-du-jour—a plot point which would generally be reserved until late in the second act.  Where exactly do you go from here?  Well... you don't.  You jump directly to the top, with little exposition, character development or rising action.  I mean, shoot—you start out at your own execution, which is violently interrupted by the BBEG for no apparent reason.  Isn't that supposed to happen at the [i]end,[/i] and with some sort of justification beyond [i]""I'm too sexy for this plot""?[/i]  [spoiler]And then, in the final hypothetically climactic battle, you're not actually a heroic warrior so much as a pro-active meteorologist.  [i]Wah-wahhhhh.....[/i][/spoiler]

Let's talk about the dialogue.  It's awful.

Avenici (having just heard the magically-broadcast announcement of a newfound Dragonborn by an elite band of legendary monks, followed immediately by an account of the PC devouring a dragon's soul, and speaking directly in front of the Nord subject's autocrat brother who could have him executed for essentially no reason whatsoever):  [i]""Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here? Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, ""Dragonborn.""""[/i]

Hrongar (having had his race and system of beliefs pointlessly slurred by a bureaucrat of gross and—as it turns out—shockingly ubiquitous stupidity): [i]""Why, you puffed up ignorant!""[/i]

Nazeem (smugly superior, unsolicited, and EVERY FRIGGING TIME YOU GET WITHIN 10 FEET OF HIM):  [i]""Do you get to <the largely unavoidable public space just up these steps> very often?  Oh what am I saying, of course you don't.""[/i]

One can only conclude that Bethesda left the writing up to a motley assortment of middle school students with limited life experience and questionable literary tastes.

A brief, very incomplete point-form list of further sins:
-'Classless' system which results in every character becoming a stealth archer
-Quality Bethesda user interface
-Bethesda QA and support
-Further deprecation of skill system, including key play elements (notably acrobatics)
-Complete deprecation of stat system
-Reduction of magic system to idiot simplicity/utility
-Nonsensical 'conveyor belt' dungeon design for convenient pseudo-exploration
-Idiot-friendly 'puzzles' (attempted aversion by suggesting that these are to keep undead [i]in,[/i] but if there's a convenient rear exit...)
-Inconsistent setting details (ie: Khajiit are not allowed into cities... unless they're player characters, in which case nobody seems to care)
-'Colour' NPCs are often obnoxious, and cannot be interacted with in any meaningful way.  Speaking of which...
-M'aiq the Apologist

What a sorry dog's breakfast of disappointment.  But... it [i]is[/i] playable, if you're willing to lower your expectations.  And thank god for the modding community, without which Skyrim frankly wouldn't be worth the time and money.  Consider this a 'thumbs sideways', and a promise to myself that I will not forget Bethesda's exponential decline in quality when TES6 finally drops.",1327714836,1663093464,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1662990634,1662990634,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

There are of course several takes on ancient Nordic culture in the art styles of games (a standout is God of War), but Skyrim's Norse art style preceded many other prominent styles and likely inspired them. The game has a great deal of fun quests with freedom of choice in mind. However, there are two large weaknesses:
-Using a lot of magic spells mid to late game is simply not viable.
-Settling the differences between the Empire and Stormcloaks to fight the dragon menace. That meeting not only takes way too long and tanks the pace of the campaign, it also has little to no effect on the player relations with the factions. If you're siding with the Stormcloaks and essentially decide against them with every concession, they don't seem to mind. Granted, it does actually change what territories are controlled by which factions, but surely the Dragonborn would be held accountable for turning the table on one of the factions?",1662477494,1662477494,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Перевод:

Немного о том, как все было:поначалу я не очень был знакомый из серии и Скайрим как игра мне не нравилась. Прошло время игра набирала популярность и мне стало интересно что же за Скайрим почему он такой популярный.купил я его в стиме за 8 долларов, честно думаю он стоит своих денег. С самого начала игры мне понравилась атмосфера Скайрима она совсем не такая, как в других играх. Эта атмосфера живая с собственной душой. Играя в Скайрим, ты попадаешь словно в другой мир, мир драконов, геройских сказаний, мир насыщенный расами и народами, проникаешься, их культурой, обычаями, мифами. Игра на столько интересная, что можно играть часами.и она будет тебе нравиться. Геймплей: здесь можно описывать очень много, но я опишу самое основное только то что стало изюминкой для меня. Так вот с помощью двух модификации на спутника и на инвентарь я создал собственную гильдию, назвал её ""Серый коготь "" и вместе с шестью спутниками прошёл все квесты и основную линию Скайрима. Разнообразие брони, и навыков, помогло мне сделать из них непобедимый отряд. После мода на лошадь для спутника, я сделал их конным отрядом, с помощью которого мы уничтожали нечисть Скайрима. В какой еще игре можно такое ни в одной с тех что я знаю. Плюс игра имеет отличную музыку композитора Джереми Соул, что отлично вписываеться, в игровой процесс.",1462697903,1662239038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is an all time classic, even though it is well over a decade old. If you've never played the game as is, it could be worth it your first time through, just so when you get to the actual meat of the game (aka the hours and hours you'll spend ripping out your hair modding this game to the point of crash-to-desktop), you'll appreciate what the community has done to make this game replayable, though I would argue the special edition is the version you should get, since the game is *still* being updated with new mods, thanks to the dedicated modders of the community.

A word of wisdom as well - when modding, decide what you want the theme of the game to be. You want to do some wizardry? Heavily invest in spells. Want the game to be more of a hack and slash adventure? Invest in weapon/armor mods, combat mods that'll change up how you and the npcs will attack, etc etc. That being said, you will find this to be quickly impossible and you'll find yourself making a monstrous Frankenstein in your mods folder. This, of course, is natural, and you should enjoy it. Just keep in mind, install your mods one at a time.

Skyrim is one of those rare mythical games, everyone talks about it, most people played, and dare I say it possibly influenced other games which its overwhelming success. In bland terms some may call it an rpg, though I would argue its not a very rich in terms of player choices in the quests. Nevertheless the lore, game play and world building make up for any deficiencies. I may be a bit biased since I love the lord of the rings universe and to have a rpg like this in a similar fantasy world is breathtaking.

I would also like to point out that the game is very customizable with a endless array of free modifications online, completly transforming your experience as you see fit, want to add Shrek to Tamirel? go for it, maybe sonic too? Why not. I'm a personal fan of the re-skin ones.

[list]
[*]The rare bugs encountered had a negligible impact on the experience, on the overall.
[*]A poor checkpoint system that doesn't save often enough considering death is behind any corner. A manual, fast save is recommended any time.
[*]An interesting character development tree, where the abilities improve only with their use. There are also many disciplines that can be undertaken, giving the player a wide choice about the character development with countless different combinations.
[*]Fast travel unlocked in any explored area is very useful, especially when the destination to reach is very far and would require at least more than 30 minutes to be reached by foot or horse.

        [td]A game I'd definitely recommend to anyone who likes the genre. For those who like reading guides, I recommend to try using the official one (or a good free on on the internet) because for sure there can be a benefit with extra suggestions and recommendations on many topics this game covers. The main plot alone lasts about 26 hours. With the secondary quests, the number increases by a lot. Definitely a game worth trying. [/td]

He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Miner Hog Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them. Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands.",1645654948,1660597636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: in most reviews.
Cons:
1. No quick key for a secondary weapon. You play with two weapons (it is allowed by the game, so some players can actually choose this option), but had to use some magic with your left hand? - Go F yourself and equip your second weapon for the left hand through the game menu EVERY TIME.
2. Dumb menus, inconvenient for use with the keyboard and mouse. You'll lose the count of situations when you click on one dialog option or an object in an inventory, but get chosen the other one. Somebody should tell the developers, that the list of objects is not the most convenient and effective representation among the possible ones.
3. The procedurally generated beasts (dragons and vampires, sometimes giants) are quite effective in decreasing the cities' population. You don't kill the beast in at least a minute? You cannot concentrate his aggro on yourself? - Sorry, you'll never meet some of the mortal non-primary quest-givers by the end of the game. That's called unique playthrough, you dummy. At the moment of attack you have better things to do and don't want to fight the next-in-a-row dragon or at least this particular one? You have an interesting quest or maybe you build a house? - Forget it, the beast is always more important! Roam the city after the battle, try to find all the corpses of the quest characters to resurrect them with cheats - the missed ones will disappear from the game within a couple of days. Cool.
4. Dumb difficulty level, which imitates the work, since it influences only the amount of damage you deal to others and get in return. No behaviour changes, the world and its population is stable and unchangeable, like a decoration.
5. Most of the quests are short and flat. One or two choices, which slightly change the outcome of the quest (mostly the amount of gold or the final present) or the way of its completion. No influence on anybody else in the world. You can be a filthy murderer and a noble paladin at a single time. Give candies to children, kill their mother, rob their house, help their father to find the lost family ring - the guys will be thankful, happy and even pay you. A true hero is in the city.
6. Auto-leveling. What's the point to get the next level, if everybody around does the same immediately for free? You improve your speechcraft? - Sorry, but the draugr is more practical and gets promotion in martial arts.",1483898526,1660401458,False,6,0,0.459390789270401001,7,True,False,False

Now I could write page after page about this game, but I will keep it short.

Pros:
+ vast Open World
+ densely populated world
+ vast amounts of sidequests 
+ interesting and intriguing main quests (could be better, but they're more than fine)
+ a lot of choices to make
+ a lot of possibilities to customize your character (appearence and playstyle)
+ rewarding progression system
+ extensive mod support

Cons:
- doesn't hold up as good graphically as other games (still good, irrevelant with mods)
- characters and quests sometimes (seldom) repetitive
- not exactly challenging

The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is good game overall with neat lore, plenty of things to do, good amounts of exploration to be had, and limited replayability.

There is a lot of lore in Skyrim that can be found around every corner and the main story itself is solid enough. There are hundreds of quests and side quests to keep you busy and in my opinion all of the missions were good or better and not too tedious. There is a vast amount of dialogue and many social character interactions in the game as well. Also there are a lot of places to explore and combined with horse riding the map is very fun to just wander around, often times random encounters occur or interesting character interactions that are really a nice touch.

A good amount of hours can be put into this game.

The major flaw of the game is that combat is only left clicking no matter what type of character you decide to roleplay and it becomes extremely boring because each encounter is identical to the last... and a huge chore. For me this flaw ruins the replayability of Skyrim and I look back on almost every encounter as being boring and a drag. The absolute monotony of the combat in this game cannot be understated. You simply left. click. everything. over. and over. until. it. dies... And that's it. Which is why I dislike FPS games but at least in an FPS your dull and numbed brain is slightly stimulated by the fact you have to actually aim. Fighting in this game is a fucking laughingstock.

In the long run, the atmosphere, worldbuilding, and immersion are not strong enough to justify playing with the combat being what it is.... and trust me I wish this weren't the case.

I would like to play the game again far in the future on the easiest difficulty and report back if it's any more enjoyable for me that way. I strongly prefer to play Fallout: New Vegas on the easiest difficulty and hardcore mode with the aim of delineating the game as much as possible and getting the combat over with as fast as possible. I find there is no satisfaction to be derived from such a shallow combat system.",1413585753,1659678578,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I came back a second time after 6 years and unfortunately riding a horse isn't as exciting anymore and the rest is a mediocre experience.

In my opinion the creatures of Skyrim are boring. It lacks both the creative hybrids of Morrowind and the traditional fantasy of Daggerfall. Instead, you are left with real-life animals such as bears, tigers, deer, and wolves. The creatures that are creative are secluded into specific areas such as spriggan and giant camps or Dwarven ruins. Interesting creatures are important for building the world as they are the most common enemy encounters while traveling. That, or the generic bandit.

The architecture of Skyrim is similarly uninspired. There is nothing close to the scale of Vivec. The best example of a Nord Nord city is Dwemer (you can decide whether I mean Markarth or Blackreach). The best building is in Sovngarde, which you get to see for about 30 minutes. It's not as though there isn't a good real-life basis. They could have done Scandinavian longhouses, upturned boats, or went fantastical and carved the cities into the ice. Cities like Morthal and Winterhold are barely trying. Look, not every city had to be sprawling, but the least they could have done is brought some more quests to these locations. Mortal has the obligatory city quest, ""Laid to Rest"", then fades from existence.

The guild quests are all played [spoiler]crooked[/spoiler]. For some reason the writers decided each needed a [spoiler]twist[/spoiler]. Unfortunately, this means they don't age very well on subsequent playthroughs, where the logical inconsistencies are more apparent. [spoiler]The classic: why can you be arch-mage with so little spells? How did the Silver Hand get into Whiterun? Why is Astrid so naive?[/spoiler] Unfortunately, the game does not properly explore the concepts it presents and instead readies the next bombastic scene. For example, [spoiler]killing the emperor is made to be such a big deal when you have never interacted with him before. He's literally just a title.[/spoiler] Killing a Jarl would have been much more consequential morally and gameplay-wise.

One of the biggest cases of missed potential, other than the entire Civil War, is in the College of Winterhold. For some reason nobody in the College cares about the Falmer, which is a massive addition to the Dwemer story. A quest where the player make some contact with the Falmer which is non-violent would have gone a lone way. They could have even put an easter egg Falmer merchant and it would have been more interesting. Instead, every Dwemer ruin is full of these guys but for all the dead adventurers, nobody investigates. There is one quest examining the Disappearance of the Dwarves with [spoiler]Arniel Gane[/spoiler], but it's practically played for comedic effect.

I didn't find myself attached to any of Skyrim's characters. Delphine and Esbern are astoundingly unlikable. That didn't help the main quest. Side note: one thing you'll notice about Skyrim is that it doesn't give you any opportunity to deal with characters you don't like. Everybody hates the Black-Briars and Silver-Bloods, but you can't help Mjoll deal with them. Not only are they essential, but even if you did kill them, if the game doesn't react, it's not fun. The Dark Brotherhood members give you generic lines like ""make it swift"" or ""don't get caught"" when you ask what they think about your current job. Why do I care when half of them get [spoiler]slaughtered[/spoiler]. At least Cicero and Astrid have good voice acting, though. Seeing a character like Serana in Dawnguard, who reacts to events in dialogue, shows what could have been here.

Combat is severely hampered by the simplification of mechanics. Granted, I played on legendary which was a mistake. The lack of spell variety exemplifies this. There's no burden, drain attribute, or fortify mechanics that used to make combat tactical. Stealth or pure melee combat is always going to get stale after a while. There are no movement or quality of life spells. Alteration lacks levitate or jump. Mysticism teleports are gone. I get the cities are closed, but man the overworld would be fun to fly through. There isn't even a way to run faster. Perk progression is pretty boring, though the system can be good, as in New Vegas. A mixed system with interesting perks and impactful skills and attributes would have been best. It's like they forgot how fun is was to feel a skill like acrobatics level.

The main quest is ignored by most players for a good reason. Alduin is wholly one-dimensional with no motivations, just nature. It's a severe downgrade from someone like Dagoth Ur. You know the whole villain motivation chart. Perhaps they could have had a lieutenant to replace Paarthurnax to be interesting or Alduin was the total evil. My biggest complaint is that the world does not change according to the story. This makes it feel lifeless and stagnant. Morrowind made you feel becoming the Nerevarine through reputation and dialogue. The most acknowledgment you get that the world is not in stasis in Skyrim, are one-liners from the guards. It's pretty pathetic, and the heavily simplified dialogue system does not help.

Side quests in Skyrim are generally pretty bad. I wouldn't bother with many besides ""Lost to the Ages"", which is fantastic, and the Daedric quests. The Daedric quests are predictable and most of the time they [spoiler]just ask you to kill the guy following you, who you met 5 seconds ago[/spoiler], but at least they have the budget. Minus Mephala. And Vaermina literally just says [spoiler]""kill him because he'll betray you lmao""[/spoiler] in the last 5 seconds. A lot of Skyrim's miscellaneous quests are fetch quests, which are always bad. Here's the difference with Morrowind's fetch quests: at least they had context and went towards progression in a guild. The guy asking you to run a steak to the Jarl's steward is just going to give you 5 gold and no roleplay value.

If there's anything good about Skyrim it's exploration and grinding shout completion. The dungeons have more depth than Morrowind, but they're not masterpieces either. It's very regular with the puzzles and draugr boss at the end. The DLC improve on this somewhat. Modding is also nice, but I have trouble calling that a positive for the base game. Sparing the complacency they bring to the developers, mods take time to download, have their own variable quality, and usually cannot fix issues with the game that are intrinsic to its identity.",1659079122,1659079122,False,2,0,0.470930248498916626,0,True,False,False

However, I was soon captivated by the world building, the lore, the nice mechanics and the gameplay, as well as the writting and the quests.

Skyrim does have its flaws and after over 600hrs in the game I can assure you that the good parts of this game definetly outweight these.

I recommend you that you should always play it vanilla (unmodded) first to get a taste of the original experience. But the good thing about this game is that no matter if modded or not, with a simple change in playstyle it feels fresh and vibrant again even thou it is the same game.

Sure it has its flaws and bugs courtesy of Bethesda but the sheer amount of content in the form of dungeons, quests, skill upgrading and more makes the game so addictive regardless. It also adds very nicely to the lore, even if the main questline has its issues. I particularly like the DLCs (especially Dawnguard and Dragonborn) which had incredible stories and added so much content and lore that I just adore.

This game is probably in my top 5 in terms of total hours across all platforms for good reason. After already playing vanilla so many times through being able to mod the most modded game of all time turned Skyrim into a whole other game entirely. Overall it just holds a special place in my heart.

Skyrim is a staple in my world of gaming; an absolute necessity in any game library.
From the moment you first open your eyes in the back of a wagon—no, from the moment you see the “Bethesda Game Studios Presents,” and hear that brilliant Jeremy Soule soundtrack for the very first time… you are instantly transported into the world of Nirn and the great lands of Tamriel.
This game plays well even eleven years later. Bethesda successfully created a format and standard by which I now hold every game accountable to with the release of Skyrim. They set the bar higher than it had ever been. Many games released today fail to reach it.
Skyrim is an epic, and I can literally go on and on shilling for it all day with no shame. I love this game and everything it has brought forward in the gaming industry since it’s release.

But I do not recommend this game unless you plan on spending some time and energy modding it. The role-playing aspect of the game is nice, though at times underdeveloped and stale. The combat becomes repetitive and bland over time. The bugs are rampant without the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Patch mod, and while it's fun to play and laugh at the sometimes wonky mechanics in the base game, it doesn't hold water after the first playthrough for me. The modding community is the backbone and lifeblood of this game, and if there hadn't have been thousands of content creators providing amazing mods available to download, I would've never gotten into this game. 

Thank you modders for such a wonderful experience playing this game.

I wish it was Co OP though as single player games like this I get bored after an hour or so.If I was playing this with cool people or just someone who knew the game really well, I think I would like it more but I know some of you would like it less.

I never tried the mods so if someone wants to comment about that to me.I heard about a nude mod.

Still a cool game 4 sure.


If you like Skyrim check out Dragon Age Origins.It is only 2 years older than Skyrim. Buy it on GOG for $5 though as the expansions run better.

A MUST HAVE for any fan of Fallout, Elder Scrolls, or other Bethesda Game Studios series fan out there. It is one of the best Role Playing games you will find out there. Basically, its like a near End Times game has satisfied most players. It has the ability to take any shape you want via mods. If you want a Dark Souls spin-off in Skyrim, there's mods for that. Want a really strange Star Wars or Halo? There's mods for it. With its three DLC, there's no end to the game. It is worth that $20.

I bought it when it was new, and liked it. But I was very busy IRL and the times I could play ended up getting further and further apart. And ended up forgetting about it 50 hours in.

I've had some more time recently and decided to fire it up again with a brnad new character. I'm now 150 new hours in, and I'm hooked. This game definitely stands the test of time. If you love open world RPGs, this is a classic. So many ways to play it, and none of them are wrong. You don't have to play any of the previous Elder Scrolls games to enjoy this one just as much.

Now it is clunky and dated, with it being released and re-released so many times that it is clear that it has just become a cash grab. It was impressive when it came out, but now it has been out for over a decade, and it has not aged well. 
Skyrim suffers from what many open world games do, it is spread too thin without enough of a basis in order to provide a good experience while playing. Its map is large, but so many parts of it feel the same, and so many parts do not feel unique. The base combat is simple to the point of boring, and many mechanics reduce to number checks. Speech provides small benefits, but often if you make a minimum requirement it unlocks a new option for dialogue. Most skills that do not affect crafting or combat are like this, and it is unfortunate.
This game has left its mark on gaming, but I really don’t think it is worth coming back to. Many people feel such nostalgia for it, but it does not hold up well. When compared to newer games, Skyrim falls flat, and it isn’t worth getting a bad old game that has been re-released as a cash grab.",1654912189,1654912189,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

earning ability after ability as well as honing your skills and just doing the fun little things in the game make it worth while. you can get some mods for free from one of the mod sites, you can expand the game play as well as the mechanics of this diverse and amazing game. by adding loads of additional content as well as even adding new areas to the game if you get sick of doing the same thing over again. this game can go in any direction and you can just do anything you want to make your experience the way you want it to be. 

I recommend paying for this game.

Likes:
- The Elder Scrolls lore is detailed and rich
- The over world of Skyrim is detailed with literal boatloads to do in any given place.
- Mechanics and leveling are not hard to understand, the more @ss you kick, the bigger your foot gets in most forms of combat
- The DLC and overall questing will probably keep you busy for literal years. 
- Modding with both the Workshop and the Nexus will have loads more content as well of varying degrees of quality.
In short it deserved it's various GOTY awards back in 2008.
Gripes:
- While I'm not much a stickler for high fidelity, the original is definitely beginning to show it's age, which is something to be expect of a literal decade old game.
- While the Game world is expansive and highly detailed, it gets rather samey for most of, probably contributing to why I don't hear about many 100% speedruns for it.
- And now onto Bethesda and effin [i] Todd [/i]...

There is no shortage of grievances with how this game has been handled by it's company and it's various distributors after it's launch. From the paid mods, to not listing the launched version on Steam, to even re-releasing this game over the literal past decade on various platforms and special editions, it's no surprise that people have begun to dislike Bethesda over the past tenth of a century. I'm pretty sure I'll be seeing Skyrim re-releases on my deathbed.

So, weary traveler, if you find this review by wandering off the beaten internet path and you have a machine that can't quite run the Special edition, I do recommend buying this if you can if not the Steam Store, then maybe off an Eastern Euro keysite.",1654149840,1654149840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game isn't on steam anymore. Just the special edition.

Vanilla game: 6/10
-Main story had much left to be desired.
-Side quests wasn't very good.
-factions quests were terrible. Do 3 tasks and all of a sudden you're a professor of Winterhold? Doesn't feel like I earned it.
-Too much repetition. Most quests are just fetch quests. 
-caves and dungeons all feel the same. puzzles don't really spice things up.
-lore is pretty good.
-soundtrack is great.
-combat feels weird and stiff on mouse and keyboard.
-Bugs.
-fighting dragons is a chore. Trying to sell something in Riverwood only for that to be interrupted by a dragon attack gets really annoying.

Dawnguard DLC: 7/10
-great characters. Wish more companions talked as much as Serana.
-New areas are left to be desired. Castle doesn't have much, and neither does the Falmer/Snow Elves land.
-New weapons, abilites, and armor is a plus.

Hearthfire DLC: 2/10
-basically just one big fetch quest to what, build a house? Not worth it.

Dragonborn DLC: 8/10
-Great new location. Solstheim feels alive with people, locations, and quests to do, unlike the Falmer world in Dawnguard DLC.
-However, stuff is still relegated to fetch quests and repetition.
-storyline is pretty good, and the lore adds to it as well.
-call back to Morrowind, though not sure what it would leave for the player.

Game is overall decent. It can be addicting I must say. It's just not as good as the previous entries in the franchise.

Full of rage quit inducing glitches, crashes and bugs, you still gonna love every game they ever made!
As an adult, being wise to mod source safety at least, feel free to explore the huge assortment of bizarre and VERY adult mods and have MUCH fun! If you are a parent with a kid under 18 though your kid generally may NOT play Skyrim. There are plenty reasons why, some explained below. There are some work-arounds to this.

Skyrim is an 18+ yeah? Please! don't try to tell me only 18+ play this though.
TAKE NOTE THEN! (Especially if you always moderate your kid's internet/gaming?)
Bethesda have a somewhat grim and grime covered art and story. The game is an 18 which tries to adjust the player base to adult by default but it is very likely crawling with underage players. This combined with the massive assortment of sexy mods and even sexual content mods though is somewhat eyebrow raising. When you consider that a certain % of the game's players are under 18 and being quickly exposed to quite adult mods on steam and VERY adult mods outside steam (N**us/Lo****lab)? Eyebrow raising. Who cares? Obviously nobody. But you might! For this *mods content child safety risk* reason ALL of Bethesda's highly mod rich games get a -10/10. The filth that can and is being added to the game for years via mods drags the score down into oblivion. You don't have to install those but you cannot help but see it while you browse mods. Some Skyrim modding communities are riddled with fetish, perversion fantasy and pornography fans. It is ignorant of those mod creators to assume all downloads of their mods are by 18+ legal players. You innocently go off looking for new mods not on Steam and next thing you know... Uhm... I ... D... !!! Just NO! 

DO NOT permit your kids to play this game without frequently checking their mods list or first reviewing the mods available for this game. Fallout 4 ect uses the same engine and editors for modding as Skyrim so also check their mods list for that if they have it? Add at least the two mad adult mod sites to your HOST file so they can never be visited? ""127.0.0.1 sketchysourcesexyskyrimexemods.org"" etc? <-Example fake url.
If your kid is all rage bubbles and snot tears over no Skyrim allowed because 18+ advice offered here? Just install it yourself add a few handy popular mods yourself and tell them they MAY NOT LOOK FOR OR ADD OTHER MODS because some mods are very risky and can hack your steam and others have content you think they are not legally allowed to see ..etc, etc? I don't mean blood splashes etc...

Even if you do not mod the game it has an odd 18+ humanoid corpse mechanic. You get attacked by some otherwise cute female bandit at a farm who wants to kill you and wont give up so you have to kill them, they turn and die then fall over a fence. You go to loot the dead bandit. ""Take all"" leaves the bandit female bent over fence with their butt in air in just panties and a bra?! You would think after Morrorwind/oblivion panties/bra corpse age old cringe that they would add a less revealing corpse skin... Nope! Oh well. 18+ it is.
I am not aware of any mod that tries to make the game a PG rating by changing said disturbing corpse skins, removing blood splashes, burned corpses, cultist torture prisons, mass graves etc? The game needs it I think so younger players can ""legally"" play the game. A massive mod project I'm sure. 

Your ""competent"" kid might even start making mods... !? I made one with no clue how to at the start.
Within 15 hours in Skyrim Creation Kit, NifSkope, OutfitStudio, Bodyslide Studio, Gimp+Paint.net and allot of reference reading online I made a very skimpy druid leaf and leather straps armour add-on edited from another imported .dds/.nif set, sadly it is way too sexy, is only half my work and so I do not make it public anywhere. (Is based off the ""DX Druid UNP armour"" for SE/LE but I converted for normal Skyrim and bodyslide converted from UNP small to CBBE small/petite. I added several different sized daggers, small bags and made her top/leg armour considerably more revealing. Changed the entire set to have more vivid leather tan and leaf green colours also. Tried to add as an .obj cute blue glasses but was a bit over my head with that. Her 2nd leg armour is particularly ""au-naturale"" and reveals all. Is a female only set. Making Skyrim reskins and custom armours is apparently easy to do after a short but steep learning curve? Hence the massive assortment of sexy skins, mesh remodels and armours?

While the obligation to keep 18+ games with 18+ players only is up to the user's discretion, please be advised about the other huge amount of 18+ content available for this game! If you are 18 and not offended by such player added content or even enjoy it... get stuck right in! Best adult gaming you ever had I'm 100% sure!
With the adult mods BIG caution BIG comment out of the way... I would say this game made it's mark in history and for that, will never die. Skyrim is forever. Just watch how your <18 year old kids add/browse mods is all? It seems nobody else is so it is up to you if you think your <18 kid might become curious or whatever at such mods. You also have a serious legal responsibility (in some places very much so!) to prevent in every way you can any access to adult content for your kids safety and non disturbing online experience. End of. 

Game is VERY much for adults only I'm afraid, too good for kids, sorry!

I would even go as far to say this was the peak of Bethesda's creative capabilities. Truly a solid experience to remember with beautiful graphics, meaningful quests/story and unique dragon AI! Let's not forget the endless amount of player made mods to make your game truly different with each playthrough. 

This makes it the second time I've gotten 100% achievements in Skyrim. First was on PS3 back in 2012, now 10 years later I did the same on Steam and had a blast doing so. Surprisingly, this game seems to have less bugs than any of their Fallout games, but that doesn't mean they're not there. A few times I had to tcl my way through doors that were bugged or had to spawn an NPC next to me that was somehow disappeared from the game. I'm also not sure why Bethesda decided to ""unlist"" this version of Skyrim AND it's DLCs, when this version is much friendlier to modders, as well as being more stable overall. People have made guides on how to find them, plus guides on any issues you might run into while playing, making it quite easy to fix any hiccups. 

Overall, Skyrim is still one of my all-time favorite RPG's, but it's 10 years later and we're still waiting for Elder Scrolls 6... 😪",1653686783,1653686783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beautiful open world, with a lot of interesting quests lines. Yet, outside the quests the world feels very sterile and not much is going on in it. There certainly is a lot to do, and the undying modding community still provides fresh, albeit uncanonical, content. However after playing through the game once you've seen all the game can offer numerous times. The story is interesting enough to get you through the game once, maybe twice but that's it.

This could be said about any Elders Scrolls game.

Unless there is a mod exclusive to Skyrim Legendary Edition, go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 (in layman's terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE). And if you haven't played Skyrim yet, you have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 9 years (and counting). Amazing first time experience & the biggest modding scene to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of playability.

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Open-world fantasy RPG

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
After the introductory cutscene, you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let's be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehow, whether intentionally or not, end up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.

Join various factions ranging from the honorable Companions of Whiterun to the mysterious Dark Brotherhood. Complete quests to obtain various riches ranging from special enchanted weapon artifacts to brand new player housing. Follow the main quest and find out what is the reason behind dragons returning to Skyrim and what how exactly you are involved with everything. 

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
In 2011, Skyrim's graphics were considered pretty amazing. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weapons, armors, wildlife, enemy types, dungeon types etc. In 2020 standards, the game might look a little rough around the edges, but overall the entire package is very well presented. To be clear, Skyrim Legendary Edition lacks new graphical effects that are present in Special Edition (e.g. godrays).

In any event, if you don't like something (or dare I say anything) about the graphics, the issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing textures, adding new visual effects, adding an ENB, etc.).

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
In the beginning, you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reason, you are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cart, including yourself, is about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sight. After escaping, your story is up to you to make or discover. 

Pursue the main quest and find out what that dragon was doing at the execution and what your role in these events is. Or choose to pursue other faction quests and enter the ranks of various guilds around Skyrim. Or ignore everything and just wander in a direction until you reach a new unvisited landmark and explore what lies ahead. 

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•Skyrim is reputable for having a big, open-world where one tagline for advertisement was ""if you see it, you can go to it"". In most cases, this is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim's borders). If you see a mountain in the distance, by all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thus, there is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.

•The non-radiant (non-repeatable) quests in Skyrim are pretty good. There are many stories for you to unravel and be a part of. If you are finding a questline to be a bit boring, you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future. 

•You really are free to build the class/playstyle you want to; if you want to get better at Skill x, just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don't. 

•Mods. Modding Skyrim becomes its own game once you enter the wormhole of modding. If you can imagine it, someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a city, revamp the game's perk system, add a custom follower, or change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage, there's a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you ""I've spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point"". Most, if not all, mods are available in both LE and SE, and certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven't already been converted.

•BUY SPECIAL EDITION instead of Legendary Edition unless some mod that you can't live without is only on Legendary Edition and not on Special Edition.

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•You will probably encounter various NPC's that share voice actors given that there are so many NPC's (usually given backstories) in the game and a limited amount of voice actors during the making of Skyrim. Although usually the important NPC's are uniquely voiced which is a plus.

•I think most players agree that the Civil War storyline overall isn't very interesting/is pretty buggy in the vanilla game.

•In modern day standards, the combat of Skyrim is pretty awful, particularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn't feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attack, you won't really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very ""floaty"" and otherwise unimpressive.

•This pertains only to Skyrim Legendary Edition: to play Skyrim LE stably you most certainly need mods to fix the memory leaks/limited memory capacity for the game as the 32-bit infrastructure is really constricting on allowing you to play the game at peak performance. 

•The modding process can be pretty overwhelming to newcomers. Veterans will tell you to test mods one at a time because if you should choose to install 10 mods at once and the game crashes to the desktop at launch, you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn't expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don't need. 

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
For Skyrim LE: 8.5/10
For Skyrim SE: 9/10

Minor bias as Skyrim LE was the first PC game I bought on Steam; buy Special Edition > Legendary Edition for better performance; great game, wish I could play it for the first time again; also wish Bethesda would stop porting it already.

A fantasy game based on a Nordic Country, where magic is a thing and warriors and mages are the norm. Lots of caves, dungeons and you not only can chose a race for yourself as well as team up with one of the two main political forces in the field - one is your old Cyrodilic Empire, the other is a local movement of Nord tradition, lead by an ambitious character, Ulfric. Whether you side with one of them, you'll have to deal with lots and lots of bandits, mages, wicked monsters, witches, and so on - so, life is never boring in these parts. You can even go vampire-hunting in a wonderful quest line where you end up with... a wonderful Vampire Companion!... Go figure - an amazing part of the game. Highly recommended 
- as well as getting the phenomenal Caliente's Beautiful Body Enhancer Mod (if you do love beautiful female bodies like me).
All that said, there you will find: A HUGE Map (so great to enter so many buildings, caves and dungeons, never boring), lots of activities and quests, lots of improvements you have to grind for (both in abilities and magic powers, as well as a lot of interesting quests that reward you nicely).

Skyrim presents you with a large world, a variety of skills, and the seeming illusion of freedom, but all of this boils down to watered down, surface level mechanics that encourage neither exploration nor roleplaying.

The skills are designed without any roleplaying in mind: there is nothing that limits you from becoming proficient in everything possible, which means there can be no defining characteristics of a single class which can not be overruled - we should remember Hegel, that identity is the identity of identity and non-identity; that without the ability for a role to not be, there is no role that can be.

The world is designed with fast travel in mind, making it inhospitable to exploring on foot, rendering the world a gimmick to draw players in without being experienced or used anywhere close to its full potential.

Speech and choices in the game are rendered practically inert, destroying any idea of this being a roleplaying game, instead of a sequence of the same, repetitive, uninspired quests over and over again with no real investment beyond the player's boredom and no other way to waste the time.",1650699417,1650699417,False,1,1,0.484375,0,True,False,False

[h1]Can this game be fun without mods?[/h1]

Answer: Yes, but you really [i]really[/i] should still install the Unofficial Patch.

[h1]Can this game be fun with mods?[/h1]

Answer: Yes, but the longer you go modding the game up and down, and seeing that most of your mods may be [i]fixing[/i] the game rather than adding to it, you may eventually realize how much potential this game could have had, and how little Bethesda and Zenimax actually care for the Elder Scrolls in general. 

[h1]To anyone who hasn't purchased this game yet...[/h1]

You've probably seen all the titty mods on youtube, all the stupid tiktok and oblivion NPC memes. But is this actually a good game to play? I've [i]recommended[/i] this game to you, the reader, as someone who has put in over 1100 hours into Skyrim on the Xbox 360 (no mods, pure vanilla). I've only recommended this game because I think it [i]actually is[/i] a decent playthrough on vanilla. Play this crap, explore the different classes and combinations, play through all the questlines and [i]do everything without mods... until you get bored.[/i] But heed this advice: [b]don't expect much for a game released in 2011 after being put on the back-burner for Fallout.[/b] I've spent so many hours searching for mods, installing mods, being frustrated at mods, and even making some small mods. It's a whole other Skyrim. But damn, the original game could have had a lot more love to it. Definitely. I love the fun I had playing vanilla, I adore and applaud the effort from the modding community into everything they've done to compound the fun, and I am [i]pissed off[/i] to no end at the fact that Bethesda seems to want to out a garbage MMO like ESO, then consider themselves ""done"" with The Elder Scrolls for the decade. Skyrim by itself is barely a playable game, and it isn't much a step up (graphically or gameplay-wise) over Oblivion. The next Elder Scrolls game should have much higher standards than this.

[h1]Something else you should really know before buying...[/h1]

There are (at least) three main editions of Skyrim because Bethesda loves to milk this decade-old dead cow. There's Skyrim: Special Edition, and there's the original ""Oldrim"" OG Skyrim, released in 2011, and there's Skyrim Anniversary Edition with all the Creations and other boring crap. I won't ramble about the differences between each version, but if you want to get into modding this game, just know that 

1) Oldrim has been removed from the Steam store at the request of Bethesda, but you can still access it through a Google search
2) You cannot run Oldrim on a PC that doesn't support 32bit 
2) You should pick between OG Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition, as it will affect what mods you can install. Generally, Skyrim SE or AE is a better choice at this point (April 2022) but just know that a lot of the OG mods (save for the more popular ones) won't run on SE or AE unless there's a port made.

It is as close as you can get to a perfect world for you to adventure in, despite the glitches that can ruin some parts of the game, like the Markarth part where when you do the conspiracy, when you get your stuff back, your quest items don't return. If you want to know how to avoid glitches, you'll need a guide on what to watch out for. I'd say the glitches are the only bad thing about this game, but for one of the early games of its time and how much fun you can have with glitches as well, it's not too bad.

Great graphics, great music, great characters, great story, and loads of hours that you'll waste into this game. However, I find that you have to be a certain kind of person to be able to actually want to marry most characters in this game without mods, almost none of the male bachelors are desirable, and the few that are can be found in the Company of Champions, where most of the desirable bachelorettes are.

Speaking of mods, if you don't like certain mechanics of the original game such as combat, there are mods which change a lot of fundamental things about the game, such as how health, magic, and stamina are, as well as they can change inventory organization, and your level up trees. Sky is the limit for what you can modify in the game.

I'd be a hypocrite to focus only on the negatives after this much time spent in Skyrim. I'm a completionist and have just finished virtually coring out the entire world from one side to the other, enjoying countless adventure in the beautiful, unforgiving homeland of the Nords. It's astonishing how much work went into building it, and the minds that contributed to the lore.

OK OK, so let's quit the back-slapping and highlight some of my favourite moments where I realised that as gorgeous as this game was, it was also more broken than anything I've ever played. Utterly ramshackle in some regards. The devs clearly pumped all of their budget into bespoke dungeons and fabulous models and brilliantly penned lore, and none of it into trying to breathe life into it. The dialogue is mostly dispassionate, spewing from inanimate faces of wooden NPCs. I can't tell you how many times I heard characters mispronouncing names of things which I thought had already been established as canon. The glitches are spectacular, the autopilot AI makes for some avant-garde scenarios, and all-in-all the game doesn't end so much as it just kinda grinds you down until you anticlimactically stop playing it.

Special shout out to:
[spoiler]
- Paarthunax glitching out halfway through giving me final instructions on how to defeat Alduin, being dragged upwards into the sky like a retarded puppet as his voice trails off into the distance. I could still respond, but had no idea what I was responding to.
- Several tracts of main character cutscene dialogue inaudible because other NPCs decide to walk right in front of them and just strike up a conversation. Rude! Don't even get me STARTED on the mouthy Spectral Assassin.
- I think I googled something starting with ""skyrim bug fix..."" about a hundred times. How come the NPC just didn't open the door when they should? How come Alduin just doesn't show up during the Elder Scroll cutscene on the Throat of the World, leaving the NPCs standing like idiots indefinitely? How come the Hircine quest allowing me to access the functionality of the Werewolf just kinda never happened? It's like they just skipped beta testing and shipped it as-is.
- Why is my wife sleeping downstairs in the cellar on a straw mattress after I decked out our Proudspire Manor to be fit for a Jarl?
- Characters telling me they hate me for ransacking their city and murdering their friends, then inconsistently expressing their delight immediately afterwards when I hand then the gems/book/grapes they asked for and showering me in septims.
- ""Knock it off, follower!"" I yell as I watch them stuck in the horse riding pose, gliding around behind me while glitching thigh-deep in the ground.
[/spoiler]

Oh man I could go on. In the end I would say this game, for all its woeful incompleteness, is really fun when it's just about rambling through quests leisurely without focussing on the endgame. I would recommend:

- Avoiding cloaks! It's so much more immersive if you can see what cool armour you're wearing. I went through the entire game staring at a red curtain, which stunted my sense of how my guy's swag was improving.
- Convenient Horses. If you're a packrat, the game is literally unplayable without this.
- In early game, just ride places. Save Fast Travel for a later stage when you've really opened up the map. It contributes to a sense of belonging within the world.
- Avoid doing all the quests you're given. It's actually a more fun (and less arduous) experience if you decide what kind of person your character is and limit yourself ONLY to that arc. If you're a thief, avoid the Companions or Mage's Guild questlines. Role play!

It's been real Bethesda. Can't say I'm going to sign up for another of your Elder Scroll titles until your vacuous characters have been given some personality, but I commend you for a stunning, sprawling experience nonetheless.",1649449596,1649449596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is my favorite game of all time. I've played hundreds of hours of this on my old xbox 360 from when it first came out to even now every once in a while. The massive world is filled with an insane amount of content and stories to be discovered. You can walk into any random direction and stumble across so many different shacks, caves, cities, and enemies.

The combat is not the most challenging of any game, but you can create many different styles using different combinations of magic, weaponry, and shouts. My favorite was a combat archer where I would use the slow time shout to use a bow in close range and fire arrows like a machine gun.

It's not the best game of all time from a technical perspective, there are plenty of bugs. It's also been milked by Bethesda more than one would believe. But despite all that the simple fact is just that it's super enjoyable.

Regarding the DLC, Dragonborn and Dawnguard both add great additional story lines that just expand the world that much more and add even more content to the world. I greatly recommend getting them if you want to have more things to explore. Hearthfire lets you build your own home if that's what you're interested in.

""Dude I played his really cool game over Summer vacation. It's called Skyrim. It's set in this fantasy world on a continent called Tamriel with wizards and elves and nords and imperials and Khajiit cat-people and lizard-people Argonians. Skyrim is a specific province of Tamriel, it's the furthest north you can go in Tamriel so it's mostly cold and tundra. The game lets you do like, pretty much everything. You can wield swords, cast magic spells, wield big war axes, hammers, maces, bows, daggers, and knives. There's different kinds of elements for your spells to. There's frost, fire, and shock, but there's also dragon shouts. Your character is the only Dovahkiin in the game which means Dragonborn because you have the blood of a dragon, but you're still a man. The dragons in the game are really cool. You know how dragons are supposed to breath fire right? Well these ones do it just by speaking their language! How cool is that? They're like these intelligent dragons that breath fire just by talking to each other. You can also use sneak to play a thief character. You can steal pretty much anything and everything in the game if you want to. There's also various different clans or factions that'll give you quests and help you out in your journeys. Oh man, and you can also go pretty much anywhere in the game. The only invisible walls in the game are around the edge of the map, so you can't leave, but Skyrim itself is just this huge open playspace that the entire game takes place in.""

It should be noted that the original 32 bit version of this game has been flagged as hidden at the request of the publisher. You may have to find a friend to share a link in order to purchase it. If that does not work, it is possible for them to buy it for you as a steam gift.

Other versions of this game can be moded of course. However some mod authors never ported their mods over to the newer versions. That being said, make sure the mod you want is compatible with your game version.",1648041665,1648041665,True,23,1,0.685385584831237793,0,True,False,False

Ralof: Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.

Lokir: D**n you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could’ve stolen
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me — we
should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!

[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]

Lokir: And what’s wrong with him?

Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
King.

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if
they captured you… Oh gods, where are they taking us?

Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.

Lokir: No, this can’t be happening. This isn’t happening.

Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?

Lokir: Why do you care?

Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home.

Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m…I’m from Rorikstead.

[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

General Tullius: Good. Let’s get this over with.

Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do
with this.

This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I
was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

I'm sure that anyone reading this will have already heard pretty much all there is to know about Skyrim, all of its virtues and all of its vices by now. Instead of putting up one more review on Steam gushing about how fantastic it is, I would like to share my story about Skyrim.

I first remember hearing about Skyrim in passing in middle school, some people in classs talking about it, saying how awesome it was that characters could actually die, even if the game didn't intend it, and the thrill of fighting a dragon. At the time I thought nothing of it, as I was a bit of a Nintendo freak.

Then about a year later, a few months after I started using Steam, I saw Skyrim on sale in the autumn sale, so I piced it up and played it for about a week or two. It was as a Redguard, and after about 40 hours and being around level 15 I stopped because it just wasn't grabbing me. ""What's the big deal?”, I thought. Your character isn't voiced? And why would I ever use a sword if it does less damage than a mace ( I didn't know about the swing speeds)? In short, I thought it paled in comparison to other games I was playing at the time with more focused stories like Arkham City or Zelda.

A few months later, having burned through a number of other games, I decided to give it another go. I played as a Nord this time, and within a few hours I was beginning to love the world. I salivated at the opportunity to learn more about the lore and mythos of this fantastical world. I eagerly completed each quest , trying to take my time a bit because I didn't want it to end. My jaw dropped when I looked out upon distant mountains and valleys that seemed to stretch forever. My heart pounding as the song of the Dragonborn played as I fought dragons atop snowy mountain peaks. I was continuously surprised at the twists every quest took, the Companions being werewolves for instance. In short, I had never seen anything like it, and to add to the immersion, I started to RP a bit to make it feel a bit more real.

After that it was off to the races. In the following years I would play for weeks as my Khajit thief J'dar, playing through the incredibly long and twisting Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood questlines. I would play as an Orc mercenary, making heaps of money doing work across Skyrim. I would play as an Imperial legion soldier named Helvo who helped reunite Skyrim and drive back the dragons. and last as a Dark Elf mage named Helsram who, with him I finally completed the last major questline, the College of Winterhold. I have gotten more value out of this game than out of many of my other games combined.

This game is so much more than the some of its parts. This game is not really a game, it's an experience, a digital vacation, an unforgettable journey... and my favorite game of all time.",1403878650,1646671655,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am telling you if you havent tried this game, BUY IT!!!! BUY IT NOW. Best game i have ever played hands down. This game offers:


1. a Robust talent system that lets you play HOW YOU WANT, this is the core belief of the developers at bethesda. They go out of their way to allow you do do WHAT YOU WANT. There are ZERO limits on how you play your character. You want to be a paladin of righteousness be a paladin, you want to steal and murder, steal and murder. This game does not restrict you.  The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and FF15 are both based on this game. 
2. A ENORMOUS amount of content, I have  played the same save file for over a year and I still have not explored every dungeon. 3000 plus hours.
3. replay value, try a differnet style of play, be a rogue, be a mage.. be a spellsword, there are many possibilities.

4. there is more content, Bethesda made an entire empire and each version of elder scrolls is a different region of the empire, Try MORROWIND and OBLIVION. these are both also excellent games.

Morrowind was the first one i played and it was rediculous
never before have i played a game that allows you to steal EVERYTHING. I mean EVERYTHING, candles pillows, plates kinives forks, you name it. Its not bolted down, you can steal it. 


It has some issues where you could ruin your game by killing a quest giver and some problems where you ended up super powerful and could not be killed and had the ability to fly(yes thats right fly, total GODMODE). It got boring


Skyrim being a more recent game has these issues fixed and more robust content. I have tried the MMO they made and i found it has ruined the franchise. This is too intense of a serious RPG to have gone mmo. 


5. This developer BETHESDA is a serious RPG enthusiast.  Skyrim puts you in charge of everything with your character. EVERYTHING. If you want to make a wierd looking frog alien, YOU CAN DO IT!!!. 


BOTTOM LINE 

BUY THIS GAME!!!

worth every cent. Its a masterpiece
