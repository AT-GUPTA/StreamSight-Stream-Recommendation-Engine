At the time I posted this review, I was trying to do my part in defending the game against accusations of pay-to-play scam and other colourful things, that were all coming from a place of ignorance.

As it turns out, Artifact lost that battle against ignorance.

To be fair, it's probably on Valve for trying to shake things up too much, as the target demographics for card games is notoriously young and big on first impressions, so in hindsight, going right away in a direction that far from the classic ""heavy on dailies, most likely pay-to-win but not at first glance"" model was probably a recipe for disaster.

The core gameplay is SO GOOD but valve wasted it with their stupid decisions.

There is very little outplay in all the other cards games. Other card games basically play itself with RNG, you just decide which card to play and when. In Artifact, you play the game, you decide which cards are played and when and where(lanes). You have an abundance of mana, but restricted ways to use it, and it's all up to you to outplay and mindgame your opponent by choosing which lanes you are putting your heroes and how you manage your initiative mechanic. You have to think 3 turns ahead on all boards. It's 4D chess. Simply a brilliant game.

It could have been the type of card game for a niche audience of card game players who love to play 3D chess in their games and who think half a dozen turns ahead. But it was also a game that no-one really asked for either.

Its announcement at a TI wasn't received well at all, but only because every TI has hardcore Dota fans that couldn't care less about a card game, even if it's a part of the franchise. Now if Artifact was announced separately, that would have been a different story perhaps. Richard Garfield tried to make this game too much like Magic the Gathering - not MTG: Arena, but the regular CCG, with cards you pay real money for. And this was one of the main problems with the game on launch.

Not only did you have to pay $20 or so for the game, cards that made you ahead of the curve had to be purchased with real money. But what annoyed me more was the draft games and the ticket system at the time. The objective was spend a ticket and then to win 5 games, but if you lose 2 games, you don't get that ticket back...and the only way to get new tickets was to buy them with real money. Since then the system changed because Valve saw the massive backlash and relented. But by then it was already too late. Player numbers shot down in a space of a couple of weeks, the game wasn't getting patched that much, and new cards weren't coming.

But to those who are interested in playing now, then they'll be happy to hear the entire game is 100% F2P. However...

It has complex game mechanics that not everyone is happy/willing/comfortable to learn. Unlike something like Hearthstone or Legends of Runeterra or Shadowverse, it isn't the type of game that can be picked up and played quickly. Games last for a long time, and evenly-matched opponents can make games stretch on for well over 30 minutes. It is also very heavily reliant on RNG, which can make games either really fun or really unfair. But this are still very interesting game mechanics that haven't really been seen before in card games, and Garfield's genius in game design shows here. He has no regrets in his part in making the game though; by the time Artifact was launched, he moved on to design another game.

Classic is the one to pick though if you're interested; Foundry has very different and confusing rules and made Artifact far more complicated than it already was. Finding players now though is another matter. We're talking double digits the last time I checked Steam Charts. So the way to go is either play with bots or find friends who are also interested in the game and make matches with them.

If Valve had spent more time doing researching on their competitors, then perhaps Artifact wouldn't have been in the place it is now. The game would have had patches, new cards would come to make the game fresh, and while that $1m tournament they announced never came, ranked play and small tournaments would have made the game more accessible and noticeable.

Now if Valve let a third-party come in and use the game mechanics to let them bring a revamped and revitalised Artifact (with new cards, patches, etc.), would that make the game better? Well there's no way Valve would let someone officially do that without getting copyright sued, so I guess we'll never know.

Dota was my first MOBA, and I thought the game design, aesthetic and world-building was great. To see it in a card game (as in a functioning card game that is frequently maintained and updated) could have been great too. Except not everyone asked for it, and since Dota is designed to be a complex game anyway (it's what draws players in), a similarly complex card game would falter behind the likes of Magic, Hearthstone, Pokemon, Runeterra, ES Legends, Gwent, Shadowverse, and so on.

I still recommend it though, if you like the Dota franchise and have no issues with what is now a dead game that will never be updated.",1688800407,1688800407,True,39,5,0.7666473388671875,0,True,False,False

Memes and drama are where it's at, people love mocking AAA titles and companies, and when they get a rare chance to do it, you can be sure they will milk it to the max.
Even having to wait a while for matchmaking, I still keep coming back to it, nothing can replace the sheer satisfaction of winning a complex game against a good opponent in this game.

Valve have taken over 4 months to address any problems with the game, and refuse to communicate with the community about the issues they have because they believe themselves to be so enigmatic and infallible that they don't believe that they need to actually consider what their rapidly shrinking community needs from them in order to fix their game that they dramatically over-promised and under-delivered with. Artifact is, in fact, hilariously emblematic of the core problem with what Valve has turned into since they enjoyed a modicum of success, in that Valve is so fixated on the idea that they AND ONLY THEY are the authority on what makes a good game and what does that they failed to even listen to their own HAND PICKED BETA TESTERS, most of whom had been playing other online CCGs professionally and/or had a significant amount of expertise in DESIGNING THEM. They completely ignored the numerous warnings and reports from their Beta testers, which was clearly a huge mistake because many of the problems plaguing Artifact right now are ones we have evidence of not only EXISTING, but, in fact, HAVING BEEN REPORTED TO VALVE MONTHS IN F*CKING ADVANCE during the beta period! Which means that the period of time before official launch that some players were allowed access to the game WASNT EVEN A BETA PERIOD! They weren't employed to TEST the game, they were employed to SELL the game! THAT is why they were large-audience streamers and personalities, not because of their expertise, but because Valve wanted to exploit their influence for next-to-free advertisement, which is an apropos display of the exploitative and lazy behavior that put Artifact in the ground in the first place.

The most awful thing, however, is that all of these things would be excusable if Valve gave any indication whatsoever that they actually gave a crap about the quality of their game. In truth, Artifact is the clearest example of bait-and-switch that I've ever seen. Valve sold the game on the premise of competitive support and tournaments and events and regular content patches, and then when people purchased their product, they wordlessly abandoned it and their audience along with it. At the time of writing, the most recent ""official"" Artifact update is from December 20th, 2019. That's over TWO MONTHS AGO, which is HALF THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE F*CKING GAME.

Artifact has revealed a level of systemic unprofessionalism within Valve that I sincerely hope will haunt them for the remainder of their tenure as a developer. Although, I suppose they aren't really a developer anymore, are they. Developers care about their product. Valve has gotten so used to merely selling the hard work of other people and taking a slice of the pie that they've forgotten what it means to make and maintain a product of their own.

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.
""MINECRAFT...""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior, Science.

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian.

Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.
Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

This was a complete cash grab on Valve's end and the sad part is this game could have been amazing. This game truly was a breath of fresh air compared to other online card games and honestly was the most unique and fun experience I've had with the genre. Unfortunately the game had a lot of issues mainly with how costly it was. Only way to get new cards was to pay or pray it's on sale on the market for a reasonable price. There was almost nothing to do outside of fighting other players with your wallet or spending a dollar to gamble through a gamemode. During its launch there were all kinds of suggestions to try and make the game a better, more successful experience among the community but instead of following any of those they just ripped it to shreds in a new beta that took every bit of creativity and fun out of the game. There was a lot of potential and instead of developing through it to try and redeem itself they just cut the cord.

Old: This game is a very mixed bag of emotions and it's really hard to say whether it deserves a recommendation or not. To start off the game is absolutely amazing, it's fun, interesting, and unique. Not to mention its on its first expansion and there are so many options for playstyle / builds, I can only imagine what future updates will bring. The game also showed a lot of promise with buying and selling cards from the market as well as the fact that nerfs / buffs would only be made if absolutely necessary in order to keep the market strong. The game sounded perfect, or atleast close to it. Unfortunately the game has no real drive to keep players playing and no real incentive to constantly throw money into the game. Since launch things have been the same constantly day in day out, you either play your deck you spent your hard earned cash on, or you draft up a deck and hope your matchups work well for your setup. This is the only real way to keep getting new cards and its by no means a guarantee. You do this in hopes that after some new cards you can spice up your pre-existing deck or build another deck entirely that might be fun to play. Sure you could play the prebuilt decks and, if you have the money, buy all the cards you need off of the market. But from what I have gathered, card games are about building a deck to call your own. They’re about playing with friends and trading your cards to make your frankenstein monster of a deck perfect against the guy who keeps beating you. This game is more similar to a TCG only your cards are not physical and its as soulless as playing against bots. The sad thing is that the progression systems that other card games have are put in place to keep people constantly playing / returning as they make it even harder to obtain the things you want until you inevitably spend money. I don't really want to see the game become a free to play fiesta that suffers from the same problems hearthstone and shadowverse has but I know that with its current state it won't hold up. I wouldn't be surprised if the game implemented daily quests, 3 types of currency, and a login bonuses in order to appeal to the digital card game players. Artifact is quite good and if you understand the problems with other digital card games then this should be a huge step up and a positive vibe all around.",1544862233,1627769418,False,0,0,0.500504553318023682,0,True,False,False

Well well well, the game's got the bullet.

While I still think people continue to be completely braindead in regards to calling the monetisation ""pay to win"", it is true that Valve didn't exactly explain themselves. Why do people like me need to explain the nuances? They could have saved themselves so much headache by being up front of people and explaining why this monetisation is better than the CCG one.

And speaking of a lack of communication, imagine being led along for ages with new updates, promising new updates even, to then just can it? What was the point valve? Were you expecting to get half your players back by publishing an unfinished alpha of a rework? What was the expectation there?

Lot of us were excited to see it being revived, to see this rework and to see these changes. I personally didn't really partake, I didn't feel like I would contribute much and wanted to wait until the rework was completed.

That didn't happen.

If there's one lesson anyone should draw from this it is to actually communicate with people. Communicate your goals, communicate why X controversial feature is part of your design, explain your expectations.

Hell this even extends to the time before the rework where we basically heard nothing for a year. What made them think that without putting in a shred of effort to keep talk alive people would suddenly flood back in? Baffling incompetence ruining what was a huge step for online card games in ways I've only ever seen mabinogi duel do, which didn't do it as well and was also shut down years ago. 

Do I still recommend it? I guess so. It was still fun while it lasted. It was my favourite for a while. But I admit despite being my favourite, I didn't spend as much time on it as when I was really into hearthstone or mabinogi duel. It's still a good thing to play just to experience the ideas at work here, but my god is this a tragic and enraging end.
-------Original review below--------

This shouldn't be compared to Hearthstone, this should be compared to Yugioh, or Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon.

This is not an online card game, this is a real-life card game, a tcg, on a computer. And it's amazing

Real life card games allow for a secondary market, they allow you to buy what cards you want without having to buy packs/lootboxes, the main things that are so annoying about games like Hearthstone. And valve dove head first into this new market and got it right the first time and it's wonderful. It's like playing a real-life card game online and I get to make my deck for 10 bucks rather than pay 50 for Hearthstone card packs and hope I get what I want.

I've been around forums a lot and I don't understand what people are on about. They're calling this pay to win. How? In what universe? And even funnier they say Hearthstone is an example of a good monetisation system. Have ea and blizzard won in the end? Have we succumbed to the lootbox era?

Artifact is pay to play. Hearthstone is pay to win, simple as that. you **need** to pay exorbitant amounts in Hearthstone to get anywhere because of the randomness. Hearthstone is a CCG. Artifact is a TCG. You pay to enter events and even that can be remedied by recycling worthless cards. You pay once for whatever you want and you never have to pay again. You pay less to play artifact than you do to play Hearthstone.

I've played Hearthstone for years. I've had free to play periods, I've had periods where I paid 100 euros on new sets. It was never enough, never enough to be the best. Here I pay 10 and have all the fun I want. It's such a relief. I'm never touching hearthstone, duelyst, elder scrolls online, eternity or any of the other clones every again. This is my card game now and I'm not regretting a single penny spent.

Not to mention that beyond the brilliant monetisation scheme, this is a genuinely good game. It's a fun and innovative system, it has great balance, it has decks for beginners and decks for pros. Anyone can play and still have fun with minimal investment. Don't forget people. This isn't microtransactions, this is you buying the cards off of other players and you trading cards with other players. Treat this as your schoolyard Yugioh from 10 years ago and not like a corporate shill game like Hearthstone. I don't want to grind 1000 hours for a few packs. I want to play now and not have to pay more money for it than it's truly worth. This game is every TCG player's wet dream.",1543594727,1626903446,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a mix of [i]Magic the Gathering[/i] with [i]Dota[/i], but without the most complicated mechanics of them. The basic concept is, you have 3 boards to play your cards on and the objective is to do 40 damage on two of those boards or 120 on one of them. You got creatures and spells to cast — just like [i]MtG[/i] — and also creeps that spawn automatically, gold to buy items and hero characters — just like [i]Dota[/i]. It looks complicated to play something like this on three boards at the same time but it's surprisingly easy to keep track of what's going on. The first tutorial is excellent and will give you the rules intuitively.

Gameplay apart, [i]Artifact[/i] is a really good game for its $20 price tag. You get 2 complete starter decks, 10 booster packs, 5 event tickets (more on that later) and also a month subscription of Dota Plus if you are a Dota 2 player. From the start, [b]you can play an unlimited amount of any of the casual modes without spending any extra money[/b] because you can play decks with cards you don't own. To play competitive modes, on the other side, you need to use event tickets that you acquire by buying directly from the store or by winning competitive matches. And the Constructed mode (where you play with your own cards) you need to get some good cards first, like any other TCG. But the ""problem"" starts here...

There's no way to obtain cards by grinding (you can obtain by winning competitive mode but, remember, this mode require event tickets...) so if you want to play competitively you need to buy/trade cards almost exclusively. That of course means the system privileges those who got bigger wallets, but that's not different from other card games. The thing is, by not being physical, you are obligated to use a mediator that takes a cut for every transaction (Steam Market), and you are locked to Steam Wallet funds, so you can only spend the money inside the Steam environment.

Because of this, [i]Artifact[/i] is being heavily criticized and that's reasonable. But that's it. The game is extremely fun and, again, you can play casual modes without spending a single extra dime. Also if you don't have any intent to play competitively, you can even sell your cards to get some money back and still continue playing (in casual mode you don't need to use any of your cards).

So, concluding, it's really hard to be Valve right now. Their great games of the past still haunts them and the recent cash-grabbing trends of the industry makes the gaming community harsher than it ever was. But the fact is: even though it's not for everyone, [i]Artifact[/i] is the most recent clear example that Valve still knows how to make good and interesting games (game-only narrowed perspective). It's a shame that it was focused around an virtually impossible economy and thus, eventually became unsustainable for the player base.

It's not a MONETIZATION, it's a card market, it's about cards that obtain value and sweet feeling of opening packs. Like they really expected cards to be free. What's the point then?

The gameplay itself is appealing and fun. At first glance it looks like it has simple mechanics, but the more you play in your first hours - the more you realise how much potential the game has. I've already had an epic 30 min match where it was not certain who's gonna win until the very end. I like this aspect of the game the most, the battle can become really dramatic.

Game has nice game modes - casual free drafts and matchmaking as well as competetive payed drafts with rewards. At the beginning you get 2 starter decks and 10 packs. You can build a cheap deck in ~10$, a 2-3 tier deck in 40-90$ and you can obtain all set for ~300$. It's not actually that much compared to how much you have do donate into HS or MTG Arena to be competetive. Market part of Artifact is greatly organized right ingame.

Also currently there is an intro event when you can play 5 free constructed decks to learn set mechanics.

Overall Artifact won't be a super popular game. Kids these days won't like that game isn't a grinding HS-like casual thing, it's not very interesting to watch it on stream, etc. Artifact will gain niche audience and will live a long TCG life.

I just finished playing a game of Artifact with a friend and I have to say it was pretty dang fun. We both started out making draft decks through the draft q, clipboarding the decks and saving them as standard decks so we could play a challenge against each other with them. It would be amazing if there could be some streamlined 2 player draft challenge but this will have to do for now. 

The game created a lot of fun moments and talking points and was generally really fun and relaxing as we both played very casually. The win came from an objective neither of us gave much thought to and the game was very close. It's a pity the game's initial monetization strategy kind of drowned any enthusiasm for the game overall. And personally I'm not a fan of playing against strangers with prizes on the line so being able to challenge friends in a fair and fun environment (ie free draft) is perfect. Still wish there was some good PVE content but will have to make do with what we have.

I guess in the end I will say this is a fun game. I hope now that it has gone free to play and released all cards for free that it will find an audience and that Valve will show it some love finally with new expansions and cards.",1543771851,1617852417,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying the base game is $20 but you can buy 95% of all the other cards with an additional $8 through the marketplace. Don't waste your time on packs, by making full use of the steam marketplace you will virtually buy every card you need to make many fun and interactive decks for around 1/10th of the price of staying competitve in Hearthstone after an expansion. Only the most powerful cards are over $2 and even then you have a chance to find them in the gamemode Keepers Draft where you draft a deck of random cards and keep all the ones you draft, however this costs around $8 but is still better than just opening packs.

Now let me say this game is very deep, and bit complex and therefore is NOT for everyone. If you are looking for a casual cardgame to play while watching a movie and doing laundry, this is not for you. If you are expecting to understand all the decks and how they behave in the first 3 hours of gameplay, this game is not for you. If you are looking for a fair game that challenges and rewards players for understanding their opponent and playing their decks efficiently and intelligently then this game is for you. Randomness does play a role in the game, but times when you feel that RNG compeletely decided the outcome of your game are few and far between and in my experience feel much less worse than many of my games in Hearthstone.

Lastly, the game is beautiful, the imps can get annoying but their animations, the board, many of the card effects are absolutely top notch and are a lot of fun. The cards also have voice acted lore tidbits, and the game itself will seem to advance DOTA's lore in expansions through new cards and some really good comics.

 I would strongly recommend this game to experienced ranked Hearthstone and Gwent players or people looking for a good challenging cardgame.

EDIT:

Game dead.

Turns out people don't want long card games. Artifact had an issue with not really knowing how you lost. Monetisation was still more consumer friendly than a lot of the card games out there, but people didn't really seem to understand that, not like it mattered because at the end of the day the games ran for thirty minutes  and you'd either lose in the first three rounds and not know it, or the last two rounds and not understand how you could have countered it.

[strike]Artifact is Valve's take in the card game industry; a card game inspired by Dota 2. It is an innovation of its genre - showcasing a vast variety of strategy and gameplay. Similar to its inspiration, Artifact is more complex compared to its competitors. The game features the classic MOBA/RTS three-lane board layout, Dota 2 items, heroes, and even its universe's diverse lore.

Artifact has a steep learning curve and yet the turorial barely explains the in-depth flow of the game. Conveniently, players do not need to have prior experience about Dota 2 to be able to enjoy Artifact.[/strike]

[b]Update[/b]
[strike]The game is currently being reworked internally by Valve. I cannot recommend Artifact as of now due to the fact that there are less than 300 active players.[/strike]

[u] [b] Edit: 13/03/2021 [/b] [/u]

This game was so hyped at the time, and for me, the [b] gameplay lived up to it [/b] for me when it launched, it was so different from everything that I’ve tried before and [b] I did not even know Dota 2 universe… [/b] But after years waiting for something, it’s finally Official, both versions of the game, Classic and Foundry, will not be in further development… Here is some of the main things that were impactful during all this time being a casual player.

[list]
[*] [u] [b] Art Style [/b] [/u] – Artifact is visually amazing, the design they took for this game made me fall in love to it at first sight, from the main screen to the board, it is just stunning and gives a unique touch to it, something mystic and interesting to get into, with an amazing soundtrack to help build it. The animations in-game are good too, I love the 2 fellows (Lux and Nox) that stick with us during the match.
[*] [u] [b] Innovation [/b] [/u] – The game features five heroes and three lanes to play, each one has its own tower and mana. I’ve never seen a game that was so close to a Moba game before, the core of it made me interested and trying to learn it, in a time I was really invested in this game.
 [*] [u] [b] Difficulty [/b] [/u] – This game has the same difficulty when you start learning any card game, but there are features that makes it harder, by having 3 different boards, you must be very careful about your decisions on where to move your resources and what time of the game that you become stronger than your opponent. Took me a while to get used to it, but I saw a very good potential in competitive scenario in this game.
 [*] [u] [b] Draft [/b] [/u] – There is a game mode called Draft, which consists of you randomly choosing cards until the 5 packs end, it helped me out to know all the cards and have creativity with combinations, learning the game faster while having a lot of fun.
 [*] [u] [b] Business Model [/b] [/u] – Here it is, the thing that made this game one of the biggest failures of the industry. Valve decided to release this game for US$20,00, but you wouldn’t receive any cards in the game, having to buy packs and even tickets to participate in non-casual matches, making it pay to win. Justified, people were calling out Valve that did nothing for the past couple of years.
[/list]

While the player base was slowing getting away by all the negative things surrounding this game, Valve didn’t help at all with their silence and by changing all the focus to a brand-new Artifact game, that was so exclusive that very few people got the invitation to try it out. In my view, Classic Artifact was amazing, all they had to do is change the monetization…

It’s definitely a [b] Sad Journey [/b], but not an unexpected one, Valve made it again, they developed something amazing and left it to the community, to keep playing until there is no one there anymore…

However, in the digital space players just didn't like the feeling of a system that kept asking the player for money. 

The pros:
- In a sense this game was cheaper than Hearth Stone for a 'buy-in' perspective.

The cons:
- Lack of progression.
- Players were asked to spend more money to access game modes which is intimidating. 
- Not FTP friendly.

In conclusion:
Valve's model was too aggressive for a game that not many believed in. The buy-in cost of $20 followed by small micro-transactions to get more cards, left players feeling gouged to pay more. Perhaps if there were more cards, expansions, sets, ect.. released this would mitigate the problem, however a small card pool and a meta being defined early in its life also had players feeling like they were specifically playing the same deck over and over.

The game-play:
I felt the game-play was both overly complex and simplistic. On paper cards interact in pretty subtle ways, but those changes have pretty long lasting effects. Card draw also feels very limited as you draw one card per round but you have three lanes. Then blue nukes the whole board and resets everything.

Edit: Real-talk review after playing more:

I'm going to be real with you.  This is a pay to win game.  I spent over 100 dollars buying packs and if I didn't I wouldn't be competitive at all. I'm still not competitive. If I spent that 100 dollars buying packs on Hearthstone, which I have done when a new expansion is out,  I could have dusted the repeat cards and gotten the legendaries I wanted. Here, you dust to get event tickets. Also only 20 or so cards are actually more worth .03 or more cents. This isn't a ""Trading"" Card Game, it's Magic Online (Not Arena) with Valve being the seller instead of 3rd party robots. You gotta pay to play here. I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

Edit 12/8/2018:

This game is dead. Valve has ignored it since release. Don't waste your money. Also Hearthstone is expensive too but at least it's not dead.

Edit 12/30/2018:

This game is on life-support. Only 2 updates and no roadmap. It's fun but there is no effort being put here by the developers or engaging with the community. I think Valve finally realized that they were tricked by ""pro"" players and the rich streamers into beta which only made those players money in tournaments, but yeah... Still don't buy. Wait and see until June. You're not missing much. Better games to spend your money on.

Edit: 3/30/2019:

This game is pretty much dead. Do not buy. Valve gave zero road map or plan or timing or anything in yesterday's response that was 3 months too late.

What your getting when you install this game is a genuinely fun and easy to get into card game. I won't go too into specifics when it comes to the gameplay, I personally think it's very good and of course it could be improved upon.

The reason this is Valves biggest failure is due to making an online card game that you had to PAY for. And it was priced at TWENTY dollars. Not only that but you had to buy the cards as well. I just do not understand what they were thinking when they put this game on the store.

Twenty dollars is way too much to pay for a card game, but if it has to have a price tag at least let the cards for the player be free. But no, you had to buy the game AND the cards. In what world does that make any sense for a consumer? Cards for the first three months on release could range anywhere from fifty cents to fifteen dollars. What they should've done is made the game free, but maybe you can buy card packs/earn them, or have the game itself be 5-10$ but have the cards be free.

It took them almost THREE years to make the game free to play, something they should've done within the first month of release. But no, they took the backlash from the community and disappeared, promising they would try and fix the game. This is when they started development of Artifact 2.0 and let only a select privileged few try the beta. From what has been discussed, Artifact classic and foundry are nothing alike in gameplay.

And that right there shows how DISCONNECTED Valve is from their fans. ALL they had to do to save this game was make it F2P, something they ended up doing anyways down the line. They thought the GAMEPLAY was the problem, and decided to try and remake it, when the only problem was how EXPENSIVE the damn game was. They announced today that they are completely stopping development of both games. 

Like I said, it's a fun game. But the reason I don't recommend this game is if your getting it right now, your playing only season 1 and that's all the content we are ever gonna get. 


It's really a heart wrenching letdown that they are giving up on it. All of the story elements we see in Classic and Foundry are so interesting and deserved to be explored. Juggernaut was a prisoner of the dire? Rubick is being held captive by Silencer? Abaddon, Omniknight and Lycan have some pact? 

This is a game that had real potential in the card game industry, a game that could've shared with us the untold stories of DOTA 2, now just a complete failure of a project from Valve. Best thing that comes out of this is that perhaps more developers shift from this to TF2 or DOTA.

What is more wrong with this game is Valve, they killed the game after two months, last update was at the end of January and right now there is no info about the future of the game, they also fired RG and other members of the team.

I got into the closed beta for Artifact 2.0 in wave 4 which was pretty early on. I absolutely hated it. I just could not get into the new way of playing the game. They changed way too much. 

Artifact Classic or nothing.

#StillHaulin


[b]I'm a 32 year old soon-to-be father and I just stayed up til 3 a.m. playing this game. Slept for less than 4 hours and hopped back on.[/b] I haven't had a game grip me this tight in a [i]looong[/i] time. 



[h1]Where I'm Coming From[/h1] 
I grew up playing card games. I was in deep with Magic the Gathering during middle school. I dabbled with the Pokemon card game. My friends and I went to Dragon Ball Z card tournaments almost on a weekly basis. I bought into the HEX TCG that was on Kickstarter. Slay the Spire has currently been my obsession. It might be the greatest deck builder ever made. I will fight you on that. Yes [i]you[/i]. However, I never touched Hearthstone. I've also never played DotA. I can't get into MOBA's, not my thing.

[h1]Monetization[/h1] 
The Steam Market and how you obtain cards is a controversial topic right now, and I'm here to say that I actually enjoy it. Maybe it's because I am an avid gamer and my Steam account is 13 years old, so I had a ton of items in my inventory to sell. I went thru and sold a bunch of CS:GO skins I didn't want, I sold damn near everything I had in TF2. I had duplicates of Steam Cards from other games, wallpapers..  all kinds of little things. It all added up. Coupled with the fact that most cards in Artifact are around .04 to .30 cents, it's super easy to get a good bedrock of decent cards that [i]you chose[/i] right at the beginning. [b]The beauty and accessibility of the Steam Market really shines in Artifact.[/b]

[h1]Missing Some Key Ingredients[/h1] 
That being said, I still think Valve should implement some sort of in-game currency that you can grind out. There needs to be an option for the average joe to obtain cards without paying cash or being really good and winning matches right off the bat. That's how you grow your playerbase and lower your whales.  

We also desperately need some sort of Progression System. The matches themselves are extremely fun, but then there's almost nothing to do afterwards. It kinda feels lonely without a Profile Identification and in-game Chat. Even though I will praise the Steam Market for doing a lot of good for the game, some cards are extremely expensive and have deterred players from the game. This doesn't particularly bother me though, it really doesn't. If you are familiar with card games, then you know this is how just about all TCG's work. 




[h1]Summary[/h1] 
Artifact is dauntingly complex upfront, with a friendly and addictive personality once you get to know it. There are just so many interesting decisions to make every turn. With Valve and Richard Garfield behind this project, I strongly believe Artifact will last for decades as one of the best Card Games online.",1543532723,1615007790,True,44,3,0.551931023597717285,0,True,False,False

I never had issue with how game was played. The 3 lane structure added great variety and depth to the combat phase as you could employ more than one win condition at a time and you had a way to rebound if a lane was lost, adapting as you go. This made each match highly varied and fun. Certain hero and color combinations lead to great chain reactions and counter plays. Truly the core game play and ideas here were solid and well realised.

I think everyone can agree that the monetization choice for the game was a huge mistake. Dota 2, the game Artifact takes inspiration from offers the entire roster for free, and yet still breaks it's own record for profits generated every year from it's own competitive scene and consistent flow of balance tweaks and cosmetic items to keep the game fresh and interesting. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to treat Artifact as if it was a physical card game and give up on releasing new content should honestly be fired. You can't just emulate the greedy business structure of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone without earning the playerbase to carry it first.

I was eagerly looking forward to the re-release of Artifact and hoped to join the beta, but before I even got an invitation to play it was already cancelled and considered a failure. Why? There are still plenty of ways to monetize this game and yet whoever is in charge insists it's a gameplay problem. The sheer amount of new content in Artifact Foundry would have been enough to carry Classic well past it's first year if it were incrementally released for free and would have rekindled good faith with the playerbase who were rapidly abandoning ship for games with actual support from developers.

I loved the idea of a Dota card game and the potential was certainly there to make this work but what the community wants clearly isn't what Valve wants for this project. You figured it out for underlords by making it free with payed cosmetics, why crash against the rocks clinging to a draconian business model here?

The ""issues"" the game has, however, don't make the game bad... They just make the game hard to approach, with a staggering skill wall. There are many situations where a game of artifact can start going wrong because of something you did a few turns earlier, and it can be hard to match the effect with the cause. Artifact is otherwise a wonderful hobby of a game, like all card games, that was fairly priced upon release.

Yes. Fairly priced. You cannot play most card games without buying in. You cannot play mtg without first purchasing cards, or otherwise acquiring cards from someone. Same goes for yugioh, for pokemon, for any other physical card game out there. And at release, Hearthstone wasn't much different. Hearthstone is free, and you can absolutely log on and immediately start playing...with impossibly garbage decks that don't hold a candle to the decks that require purchasing packs upon packs upon packs. Hearthstone is changing (for the better, I hope) with the core set, but it doesn't guarantee that the free player experience won't still require a lot of money (Or an EXTREME amount of time dedicated to grinding ingame currency) to be competitive.

Artifact was a digital card game with a physical card game price schema. You paid 20 dollars to buy what was the equivalent of a starter deck and a bunch of packs. The monetization was fair, and the open market for cards is leagues better than Hearthstone asking you to dust 4 legendary cards to get one legendary of your choice, when a legendary on average costs 35~ dollars to get, and to dust all cards from packs into whatever legendary you'd like, you're looking at 70~80 dollars. Or...you could just buy axe, the card that used to be the most expensive card in the game, for 20 bucks outright. ""bUt HeArThStOnE iS fReE""

Now, artifact is a free digital card game to all, for anyone to jump in and start learning one of the deepest card games out there (though somewhat scant on content, unfortunately). I really recommend everyone give this game a shot, as it's a hobby game worth investing time into.

It was quite enjoyable but it had a few issues that bothered me and seem to bother a lot of people. Personaly i found the games to take a bit too long, basicly as long as a short dota game, and that went against the philosophy of card games that tend to be fast. So you would spend 2 hours and play 3 gamesat best. But the main issue was that it wasnt free to play, you had to pay 16euros and you got pretty much nothing for it on top.Some packs and a few tickets for something similar to HS arena, so even tho you payed you still had to pay more to get the cards you want. You couldnt farm them because it didnt have many options to farm currency. So immidietly when you launch the game you were stuck in a frustrating situation. So people started quiting after 1-2 days. Then it became a trend and almost everybody stopped playing. From the looks of it even the developers stopped caring about the game. They fired the guy that design the game and went silent for months until the 2.0 artifact announcment that is now dead. To summirize valve was too slow to act and did too little. Almost 3 years later valve did what they should have done from the start make the game free, if only they had figured out the second part and actually tried to update the game instead of announcing 1million dollars tournaments for an esports scene that didnt exist (the tournament never happened btw).",1614965664,1614965905,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every match you play feels as intense as RTS ranked matches.
Now with the added progression and card balance in the table, the game will address every flaw it had and really stand out from competition.

Massive potential. And the price is actually way more cheap than other CCG's if you want to build tier 1 decks and be competitive.

Highly recommended, even if you don't have money to spend more than on the initial purchase, because you get a lot of free modes with progression (free Draft, my personal favorite).

Are you an Arena mode/Draft mode player? Then this is the best in the market.
Are you a constructed player? Then this game is not that expensive. You get competitive tier 1 decks ranging from $10 to $50.

It is a unique game, the idea is very well-done and I think that the game is very enjoyable (I enjoy it much more than any other card games out there). The main thing is, however, the lack of support from Valve, which is very unfortnate and sad.

==============================

heartstone introduced me to the wonders of ccg/tcg. been an infinite arena player since the closed beta but stopped since 2 years ago due to getting bored of stalled/uninteresting/recycled game mechanics.  Artifact in comparison is a very refreshing game due to slightly more complex and deeper gameplay and deck building, which is what a lot of hardcore hearthstone players were asking for.

my core game mode is phantom draft (pretty much like hs arena but with more choices and freedom) so the points I'll make will be making will reflect only on that mode unless otherwise mentioned. I've spent 50ish hours on phantom draft as of this review is written. 

- gameplay wise, i am not too sure about how i feel about it. i dont hate it but i dont like it either. I have mixed feelings about it. I've hated the fact that you cant position the heroes and choose the targets during deployment which takes away the sense of control from you. yes i am aware of you can pick the lanes you want to drop your heroes onto, i am talking about the positions not lanes. in which i think this is the most annoying game mechanics of the game. There are simply too much RNG is dictating the core part of the game, more so on phantom draft mode since you cant exactly draft all your dream cards, you have to make do with what you have. often, you just lost the run without even playing due to crappy/fragile heroes and crappy rng during the first few deployments which put you into massive disadvantages due to your opponent having a lot more gold than you. 

- balancing wise, i cant say i am well versed about all the cards and meta but it feels like red and green are simply too good in phantom draft mode while black is the average. blue is the worst in term of raw stats. blue is simply too conditional and hard to extremely hard to survive early game. 

- incentive/progression/rewards - as of right now, it feels lacking the thrills/incentive to keep playing due to the lack of progression and actual reward. while one might argue that casual modes are free, but for me, it also lack of the thrills due to the fact that you get nothing in return. in short, a player can just abandon as many draft as you like until you get the perfect draft where everyone have the insane draft, which is kind of defeating the purpose of a draft mode.

- the fear of spending money without getting anything back. i think this is very similar with starcraft 2 ladder fear, players are afraid of losing rank and discouraging weaker/newer players from trying hence making the paid modes even harder since those who dare and will spend money on the tickets are usually already kinda good at these modes further alienating new/weaker players to try these modes. the cycles will only get worse and worse, eventually there will be very little players on these modes. i think the current model is simply not sustainable in the long run, business and players number wise. 

-User interface wise, the UI overall is usable but not exactly polished, the hand is quite difficult to navigate especially when you have a lot of cards, they simply clumped together, browsing and picking cards from your hand become really difficult especially on tournament mode where the time constraints are much shorter. the auto camera zoom is very annoying as well. 

- Monetization wise, It has the worst forms of monetization packed into a single game. 
Pay to play ✅ 
Pay per play (tickets) ✅ 
Pay for lootboxes (packs) ✅ 

- will update when i've more to rant/add. hopefully it will be a positive review then. i kind of enjoyed the game, but i am not too sure i am willing to continue playing it in the long run.",1543972021,1614920114,False,58,1,0.587884902954101563,0,True,False,False

As for card packs, I literally never bought any because the dev team added account leveling which gave them for free a month after release. It wasn't the most generous but it was decent.

Also, full-deck draft gauntlet made it so the cards you own didn't really matter because you could just make a temporary deck from cards from the full set. It was entertaining as hell to run like 6 copies of the same card or 3 of a hero.

Pathetic.
That's all i can say. They promise so much stuff and then they just give up. 
I understand that the launch was a mess and that players gave up on the game because of the buying of the cards but the game was still playable and pretty fun in my opinion. 
Then they said that they really wanna focus on Artifact 2.0 and that they are gonna listen to our feedback and re-do everything and it's gonna be better. I've got invited to the Artifact 2.0 Beta, it was pretty ok wtih some neat changes but they still didn't have a playerbase.
So guess what the fuck they did after all this shit?!?!?!?!?!
THEY FUCKING GAVE UP! LITERALLY GAVE UP! Made both the Original and the 2.0 versions free with all the cards and every shit free. But they fucking said that they don't plan on making any future updates for the game.

You can still play this game because now it's free and you can still find players (random as fuck.. either very fast or you have to wait 4 hours) but it's not worth playing it for more than.. 2 or 3 days.
It's gonna get boring fast because you have all the cards, you're gonna make some decks, battle some people (if u fucking find any) and then want more. OH YEAH? YOU WANT MORE?! NO! YOU DON'T FUCKING GET ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY ABANDONED THE GAME!

The game is mechanically interesting, though not without its flaws, but I would still recommend giving it a try, especially since the game is now 100% free.

The other big issue with this game was lack of post-launch support, Valve put out almost nothing by way of meaningful updates aside from a single balance update several months after launch. There's a common denominator with digital card games that are currently successful: they have frequent updates, and these updates are communicated to the community to build hype, and to build faith with the community that content is still coming. Valve, in no uncertain terms, did not do that. This is a problem the game will take with it to its grave, unless Valve decides to pull their heads out of their collective asses and realize that a closed beta having a small playercount is not only unsurprising, but completely fixable, and that is a horrible excuse to stop development.

Try out Artifact Classic, you don't have much to lose, and it'll be pretty apparent real fast whether or not the game appeals to you, so you aren't even sacrificing much by way of time.

In the personal opinion of this reviewer, the writing was on the wall for Artifact, and Underlords has a better chance of survival (so I'm busy praying for that game now). 

An unexpected side-effect of the cancellation of Artifact 2.0 was Valve's release of a final update for Artifact, in which both Artifact ""Classic"" (1.0) and Artifact ""Foundry"" (2.0) were released as free apps with all cards free (in Classic, unlocked from the start; in Foundry, unlocked over time). Valve said they will release no more gameplay updates, but that both games will remain fully playable and online and have been made free to maintain the existing (if small) community and playerbase.

Well, the question is - are they worth your time? I've played Artifact Classic for 185 hours and Foundry for 38. Both games are incredibly fun, highly complex strategic puzzle games. The differences between them are best understood by reading Valve's post below titled ""Artifact Classic and Artifact Foundry"". In short, these are two fundamentally distinct game systems which share mechanics, card concepts and rules. Both are worth trying out. 

Since there is no longer an obscenely high starting price, nor are you obligated to pay for cards - everything is now free... I have to say, if you're bored and want to try out an interesting card game with the honor of being Valve's latest ""Ricochet"", this is a fun diversion.

I come from a background where I play a lot of Magic the Gathering and DOTA2 so this should be right up my alley, also Richard Garfield.
When Artifact got released I was put off by the market mechanics in the game, having to pay for tournament entry tickets, packs and cards. It's now 2021 and I decided to buy the game to see what it was really about.
I am impressed by the game design and the ""pay to win"" factor (Axe being 20+ dollars on release and a must include for competitive, now around 2 dollar) isn't nearly as bad as I thought.
I have only played this game a couple of hours and have no real grasp of the meta yet.
Both the Three lane and the Four colour systems are brilliant (Steam fix your spellcheck, it's not color :P). And leads to fun deck-building puzzles. In game gold economy seems solid although I have yet to explore it fully, Black bounty decks seem to be a thing I have yet to try.

Awesome production value, great mechanics, beautiful lore, but the game is built around a single purpose, dumping money on it. Everything requires payment, including the competitive mode, and as of now, there's no ladders, rankings or a progression system, not even achievements, imagine that.

However, I think more effort should be spent on the monetization of the game. Constructed mode is no doubt pay to win. You already paid 20 dollars and yet you also have to pay another 1 dollar for prize plays. This method of monetization is dated and it is the main reason why players are discouraged to play the game. Ya sure, community wants some skill progression and thank goodness it was introduced recently. But that is not enough. I restricted myself only to casual phantom draft since imo is the most fair and I don't have to burn my wallet. 

Based on the player activity, this game is dying and I'm disappointed. I remember from the beginning, the day the game was released, I couldn't even cancel searching a gauntlet match. In other words, upon hitting the 'Find Match' button I'm taken into a game. Now it takes at least 15-30 seconds to find a match. As for Call to Arms event, I can't even search an opponent within 1 minute. 

I wouldn't recommend this game for those who hasn't earn money yet. The game itself is complex and buying this game without knowing how it works really sucks. Therefore, I strongly discourage students to play this game.

Despite giving paragraphs of negative comments, I love this game very much as it encourages me to think ahead every time I make a move. I highly recommend this game to scholars and geniuses as well as those who like logical/math games. My advice is research and understand this game before buying it.

[h1]Starting the game[/h1]
When you start the game for the first time, you get a few card packs and 5 tickets. If you don't get extremely lucky and pull some insane cards (yeah good luck with that) you can forget about playing with your own decks as you will have your ass handed to you by people who paid for more cards and have optimized decks. So you can basically forget about playing Constructed until you get more cards. The other gamemode is Draft. Which is like the Arena mode. Open a few packs, pick you cards and play with those. Simple. Though, I recommend practicing in casual mode, before going into ranked, because playing ranked isn't free in this game. Yes, the ranked gamemode, the only gamemode with some sort of rewards, is not free. So what you have here is a 20$ game, where you are expected to pay even more for some of the most basic features that are present in every other free-to-play card game. Just brilliant.

[h1]Earning cards & exploitative monetization[/h1]
How do you get more cards, you ask? Is there a shop which lets you exchange your in-game currency? Nope. What in-game currency? The only way to get more packs is either by paying with real money or winning against other players, while not losing yourself. You can either pay 2$ for a single pack of 10 cards or go through the Steam market and buy cards off of other players (which is more profitable, if you actually plan to pay). I mentioned that you can earn packs by winning games, but in order to receive a single pack you first must spend a ticket, which are also bought by real money or created through destroying 20 of your cards to get a single ticket... And now you have to play and win. Lose 2 times and your current run is over. In order to ""recover"" your ticket you have to win at least 3 out of 5 games. 4 wins gives you a ticket and pack, while 5 an additional pack. To receive the most basic thing in Artifact - the cards, you have to play damn fucking well or you get nothing. Unless you pay of course and Valve would be very happy if you did that :^) 

[h1]The RNG[/h1]
There are so many elements of this game that are outside of the player's control. These aren't even the fun or wacky RNG effects similiar to the ones Heartstone has. This RNG isn't the type of RNG you can make a funny montage of. This is just problematic and frustrating RNG. So many coinflips that can absolutely win or lose you games. And with so much on the line, losing in Artifact feels absolutely bad. Creeps spawn each turn in random lanes, the shop randomly generates different items each turn, heroes are placed on random position's when there are multiple available on a single lane, the arrows which control the character's attacks are random, many effects and cards have a 25% or 50% chance to work, or just do nothing. A single game of Artifact can last up to 40+ minutes. If you lose a game due to RNG, it will fucking sting. 

[h1]Other problems & lack of fundamentals[/h1]
Even if you overlook how Artifact handles its cards & microtransactions, this 20$ game, really doesn't offer a lot. Gamemode wise, it has what every other card game with microtransactions has (major difference being that a lot of those card games are free and have some system to allow free-to-play players a way to play & compete against paying players). Outside of having little to no reward system, this game doesn't even have even the most fundamental things other digital card games come equipped with: 
[list]
[*]No progression system (outside of the account leveling system, which was implemented months later after the launch), 
[*]No way to keep track of winrates 
[*]No way to keep track of card playrates 
[*]No statistics for either gamemode
[*]No way to look up what kind of other decks other players might be playing
[/list]

[h1]Final words[/h1]
The only good thing about the game I can say are the visuals, music & sound effects, but those aren't elements that can save a game's shitty gameplay. Until Valve fixes some of the core issues with this game or implements more interesting things, instead of just trying to ride off the popularity of other digital card games, I really don't recommend this game. Will Valve continue updating this game and implementing new features or will they abandon this game just like the majority of the playerbase, if it becomes unprofitable? Who fuckin' knows  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? Go play Hearthstone or Shadowverse instead. There are probably more options. And no doubt are they better than this lol. Ya dun goofed up Valve. Could have invested the money that went into this into Half Life 3 instead lel.",1548460589,1594186341,False,9,0,0.500554919242858887,0,True,False,False

It just strikes a time vs. money differential that I find very palatable and actually better than other digital card games.

The problem was that the game is very complex, unintuitive, and lacking ""high impact"" moments. You can't watch a game of Artifact and tell who is winning, for example - in the age of streaming, etc. that is an absolute death sentence. Winning a match of Artifact is a game of very incremental advantage (not unlike old MtG). There's no ""let's upload this to Youtube"" wombo combos, or at least, it is not nearly as common as more popular digital CCGs. Even for the things that resemble such a combo - it's not readily obvious to somebody who doesn't play the game that that combo is happening - it's the opposite of ""hype"", basically. If you enjoy Artifact (and I do) - you enjoy the incremental advantages you accrue over time - card advantage, board advantage, etc. and slowly sucking your opponent dry of resources until you take over. It is actually very gratifying as the player - but it's the opposite of a game that can and will succeed in the age of digital media/streaming/etc. It just lacks that ""pop"", that ""anybody can get why this is fun"", that ""my little sister who doesn't play card games at all can have a favorite card"" factor that Hearthstone has. Add to that the fact it's not ""free"" (though ofc for any competent competitive player HS is actually more expensive than Artifact) - dead on arrival. And that's exactly what happened.",1593991594,1593991594,True,0,2,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Played M:tG, digital MtgO and Shadowverse. 

Barring its rough launch, Artifact is a thoroughly fun game. A self-confessed Timmy, my passion comes from building new funky decks or bashing heads in with the biggest Revtel Convoy I can come up with. 

UPDATE: Devs went back on the pillars of the game that I originally bought the game for, now giving out free packs, and adjusting values on cards originally bought for high prices on their marketplace. The blatant bait and switch was one of the most disgusting customer experiences I ever had.

PROS:

Unique blend of traditional CCG (cards/mana/deck synergy) and DOTA (creeps/lanes/gold)
Very tactical/mathematical play, with overarching strategy/logic.
Cheapest digital CCG on the market over time.

CONS:

Devs went back on the pillars of the game that I originally bought the game for.
Pay upfront to improve your card pool, or get lucky with the free/earned packs.
Volatile metagame. With Patch 1.2, cards can be nerfed/buffed without warning even though bought with real money, depending on pressure from the vocal internet.",1543639388,1592579594,False,0,0,0.496585249900817871,0,True,False,False

When people remember staying inside during the events of 2020, the memories of the virus or the riots will be secondary to the real reason they stayed inside: playing Artifact 2. It is the event that renders all others redundant.

Valve has come under criticism for not acknowledging the Black Lives Matter movement, as is fashionable for every corporation to do. Perhaps the most prominent example of such in videogames is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which displays a Black Lives Matter message before the title screen and in place of every loading screen. It is simple to explain the difference here: the people playing CoD actually have lives, which cannot be said of the ""people"" playing on Dota or Dust II unironically in 2020. Valve has long been a proponent and exemplar of the post-lives-mattering world vision, especially when it comes to their fans.

Artifact 2 is designed with the foremost intention of invalidating every specific complaint everyone ever had about Artifact 1. When they are eventually allowed to play it, those who hated Artifact 1 will either love Artifact 2 or they will eke out some vague gibberish reiterating their resentment of the whole title, behind which you will again readily see that they are dumb, and poor, and do not care particularly much about card games or things that are not immediately popular, which is the background (if not the entire essence) of their complaints about Artifact 1. But the game will now enable them to remain poor, at least, which is very important to them.

The key risk of Artifact 2 failing is that it throws down such a gauntlet in terms of design and monetization (no buying cards), such a massive flex, that it may be unanswerable, and maybe most will not even try to answer it since there is no marketing to confront them. But ultimately I believe in the goodness of the human spirit and that progress is possible, so I expect every life that matters to be playing Artifact 2 by the end of 2020. If this doesn't happen, and Valve abandons the game again, you know what to do.

I like the complexity from playing on 3 separate boards (lanes) at once. I found having to decide between how much resource you want to commit into each lane very interesting. I like the initiative system which led to situations where you have to make sacrifices now to gain an advantage later. I enjoy that games can swing hard and often end up very close.

I'm impartial to the ""micro RNG"" mechanics around arrows and deployment at my level of casual play. To most players in general, these mechanics ultimately have a minimal effect on a win or loss. I agree that they are regarded as unfun mechanics when they work against you. At the top level of play, these mechanics can determine the match outcome and I dislike that it is not good for the integrity of competitive play.

I don't think the pay model was as bad as it was made out to be, at least for draft mode. Since buying the game, I have played tens of hours without needing to spend any additional money. The free tickets you earn from level progression should be enough to give you plenty of hours in prized draft mode. If you run out of tickets because you're bad, you can continue playing the free draft mode forever. It is very shocking though, that free draft mode was only added after heavy community backlash.

This game is for players that are looking for hardcore, deep strategy game.
It takes a tons of hours to get used to UI, understand different mechanics and to get used to the game system.
It is more like a board game then a card game.

Pros and cons from my perspective.


Minusses - :
* UX / UI is terribly done, very chaotic. Alot is going on the screen, sometimes with many informations.
* Games and turns are very long. Ton of time needs to be put into a single match.
* Super complicated for newcommers which will discourage any casual players. High-bar of entry.
* Lack of good indicators when your turn starts. I usually have few times per game where me or my opponent realised it is his turn by indicator saying it is 15 seconds left. It makes games even longer.
* For me cards look blunt. Heroes are somewhat fine, but other cards are still hard to read for me.

+:
* Fighting in a lane has a really good feeling to it. Playing cards and countering one another plays before resulting an action is a super good concept (it is super fun) and should be implemented in a better card game. This mechanic is the best part of the game which makes me still play it.
How it works: Players play cards one at a time on each side similarly to Gwent. It is quite cool because it leds to countering one anothers actions. It reminds me of yu-gi-oh game when players activates their 5 trap cards chaining them together resolving in a big action. It is pretty cool.
* Free drafts where you can practice.
* Market where you can sell or buy cards is pretty cool.",1543763820,1587978470,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, the Constructed game mode (50% of the game) is easily more p2w than any other card game I've played. There are three ways to get cards in Artifact, and all three cost money. And if you decide to sell some cards to buy the ones you want, you'll have a 100-200% tax unless they're rare cards that sell for more than 1-2p. I'm not a fan of the Hearthstone model, but this model is far worse.

On top of the fact that there's no reward for playing the game (unless you pay for 'expert' mode), there's also absolutely no progression system, ladder, quests, or other content to promote replayability. So unless you're like me and you really love the gameplay, you'll probably get bored very quickly.

That's not a criticism of him--the guy invented Magic: The Gathering, for Pete's sake. Yet, the game did suffer, I venture to say, from Garfield's unique vision of what would be fun or exciting in an online card game. In particular, the focus on random in-game elements was a misstep.

A card's ability would either trigger or not; a spawned minion would either battle straight forward or to one of its sides. Why were these mechanisms, which left, it turned out, too much of the battle's outcome to a flip of a coin in the game's engine, so prominent? One clue may be in how MTG: Arena has developed over the years. There, the ability to add any random effect has been available from day one, yet the new expansions have mostly stuck to the traditional categories of interaction--it's that these interactions are now handled quickly and efficiently by the software. Even new keywords are ones that could be printed on physical paper and used in play with little challenge.

So if the game Garfield is best known for hasn't gone the route of Hearthstone--pulling cards out of thin air, randomly assigning damage, etc.-- then why this emphasis on random chance in Artifact? My guess is that Artifact was his best attempt to integrate random chance into a game with the strategic depths of Chess or Go. Freed from the reliance on rolling dice or drawing cards to achieve randomness, the development team at Valve offered him the opportunity to see if he could fairly and seamlessly integrate those effects into a card game while keeping alive the tactics and dynamic analysis present in the games he has been known for creating. Suffice to say, that venture ended in failure. Garfield, to be clear, shouldn't be derided for attempting this. If anyone could do it, he could. It just turned out that no one could do it--at least, do it without the game leaving you feeling that victory is arbitrary and capricious.

So, kudos to Valve for trying to learn from failure and re-imagine the game into something both sustainable and interesting. Garfield has given the new team a rich and complex gold mine to work with, and I can't wait to see what's in store for us all.",1585678373,1585678373,True,17,5,0.6490439772605896,0,True,False,False

The only heroes worth making decks from are red.
Or red and black. 
YOU MAY get lucky with an all blue deck once in a while. Green is worthless outside maybe one hero or two.

The game is so hyper unbalanced that it is insane to watch. Red heroes specifically were given so much love by testers that their health is among the highest in the game across the board, and their DPS AS WELL!! A red hero of any type can usually one shot kill any other hero for DPS or support from another color ROUND ONE. Which is free gold.

Theres no strategy to the game. Its 100 percent RNG.
You dont get to pick what lanes creeps show up in.
You dont get to pick where in lane your heroes end up.
So there is literally NO STRATEGY to the game at all besides taking whatever card you have and trying to figure out if you should throw that one now, or next round... and that choice is a complete guess... there is no amount of thinking you can do to know  or see the over all startegy unfolding by your opponent.
Mostly because hes probably just using a red deck and smashing everything in front of him 3 at a time with axe, and timber.

They say they are working on number 2, and for what its worth I liked the CONCEPT of this game VERY much.
But it was so badly done, so badly balanced, so without any strategy that I have little to no faith in them being able to do their job.

i would avoid

UPDATE 1: I geniunely do not recommend this game for ANYONE who wants to play constructed unless you want to sink in a butt ton of money in this game. There is literally only one deck that works atm and it's just terrible to play against with the lack of counters now that Green/Red got nerfed. I would caution yourself.

That being said, Artifact is a great game if you like card drafting! However, Artifact is not something you want to try unless you want to subject yourself to one mode, meaning to me Artifact is still incomplete.
Here's the pros and cons.

Pros
- Unique gameplay and great if you love long games.
- Familar card design and very beautful to look at.
- FREE DRAFT MODE ARE YOU SERIOUS???? THIS IS AMAZING
- Free decks to test out if you wanna feel spicy!

Cons
- Terrible meta atm with very little counterplay. Variety is lacking.
- This is probably one of the biggest money sinks atm.
- Half-baked progression system and lack of good social features.
- Terrible optimazation, it just uses so much to run.
- This will bore you out unless you have friends.

the game is actualy very good, in depth yet simple enough that even a sperg like me can enjoy it in less than an hour, my only real gripe gameplay wise is that when you drop a new unit on the board you cannot select your target, so if your opponent have 3 heroes and you drop yours, you don't know which one your unit will attack, which is annoying to say the least.

On a very ironic note, i've spend 18€+50€ the week end this game got released, by selling my surplus and the cards i wasn't planing to use i made 110€ in the same window, so my Artifact experience was not only free but it earned me some cash which is a far cry from the reddit doomsayer & Hearthstone fanbase that must keep going in their sunk cost fallacy to trash every other card game

** Initiative is the game mechanic. Who have it will play first next battle phase (Next board). Some card you can use to steal initiative from your opponent. Use wisely. **

It is not bad game at all but need to change something.

If this game is less RNG must be better and more complex and comfort. Need to redesign arrow must not random anymore and Creeps will spawn one per lane each turn. 

Redesign some heroes like Bounty Hunter, Ogre Magi, OD passive skill that have many RNG in it. I don't like incarnation of selemane in blue deck it infinite value. Redesign Meepo when Meepos died count as one character or bounty cost change to half each time that summon new Meepo and not lower than one maybe it is better for him. Other is good I like initiative mechanic in this game. 200+ hour in game right now.

Original Review (1/24/2019):
I really wanted to like this game, but the absolute clumsy rollout, followed by utterly inadequate adjustments once things started going wrong, makes it pointless. I'm not usually Mr ""This game is dead/dying"", but unless Valve does something significant soon, there will be too few players for this game to matter at all, and no new players will be interested. As it is, the steamcharts for this game have got to be extremely embarrassing.

The only move I can see them making that has any chance at all would be to go F2P, which, as someone who paid for the game, will probably screw me over to some degree, and given their actions so far, will be an absolute greedy P2W shit show. Hard to believe Valve screwed this up so badly.

The way Valve is monetizing this game is mostly only perceptively terrible if the company would just start calling this a card game rather than a collectible card game. The only time pay-to-win becomes a factor is in the Constructed Deck game mode where you create a deck from the cards you actually own, but seriously, why play this old-fashioned boring-af Constructed mode when Valve offers the Casual Draft Deck modes which offers *the entire collection of cards*, which doesn't play singly towards the current meta of a patch, forces true tactical understanding of *all* cards, and is actually much more random and interesting. And if you've got it locked down, then you pay to play the Expert modes which buys a free Expert mode entry ticket on every 3rd win provided you don't lose 2 games prior, plus new packs of cards for each subsequent win. A player learns way less of the game from playing (and complaining about) the pay-to-win Constructed mode that they're a sucker who deserves to be losing their money in CCG's to begin with.",1543587715,1577267398,True,2,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

Artifact has innovative mechanic of strategic based randomness included in the card game in digital card game, which has tied with powerful lore. You are passing the turn to each other so the player has the control of the turn and rounds, and the power spike of 1 resources each turn has bigger impact than other games. Deck building has so many impact on the game since the card tied to one of five character you bring into game. But it stops there. 

- You are forced to take 3 cards for each character on your deck; 
- There are shop phase with too many randomness packed into two of three choices at the end of each round;
- The attacks are mostly random and you use your card to change the randomness;
- The randomness of unit deployment on each lane.

-Has a free, no-rewards, draft mode you can play infinitely. This gives you a draft mode where money can't help you win and you don't have to spend money to play.

-Has a free gaunlet mode where you pick one of several preconstructed decks and play against others running the same pool of decks. You can play this infinitely and the decks ocassionally rotate. Like draft, this gives you a constructed mode where money can't win and you don't have to spend money to play.

-Despite having no F2P model, costs less currently to be competitive than other card games, aided tremendously by the fact that you can buy individual cards, the vast majority of which cost literal pennies. No gambling on packs or lootboxes. Oftentimes, you can build the deck you want for a few dollars.

-The presence of the market sadly removed the capability to even reasonably add an F2P, but playing the market is a game in and of itself to some.

___

So yes, there are positives about this game's price model. There's game modes for virtually every format that are infinitely repeatable, free, and not aided by money... and even if you DO want to spend money, it's fairly priced. No, there is not a F2P and in order to keep the market in-tact, I don't think there ever will be.

The game itself is one of the most in-depth and fun card games I've ever played and matches the DotA flavor. I have a few gripes with how random the early turns can feel (losing a hero uncontrollably on turn 1 is not an uncommon occurence, especially in draft modes, I find), but the balance is still there overall.

EDIT: In good conscience, I can't recommend this anymore despite the aforementioned. Valve reacted poorly to their own initial release and despite their claims that they are ""in it for the long haul,"" the game hasn't received any updates in nearly a full year. Their communication to the fans is just as dead. Thanks for nothing, Valve.",1543867660,1575248003,False,0,0,0.522258400917053223,0,True,False,False

---

At first I laughed at Valve when they announced it. And I pre-ordered it a few days ago because I got so hyped.

I am so happy with this game. It is what I always wanted of a CCG/TCG. It has the feeling if a real-life card game, but it's digital and still brings such excitement and joy of playing it. The gameplay is fluid, interesting, complex and full of interesting encounters and turnarounds.

A lot of people say it's p2w. IT IS NOT. It is what a card game should be - you purchase a base deck with some boosters (you get 2 decks and 10 boosters, which are valued more than the $20 you pay for the game) and you can buy booster packs containing 12 cards for $2 each, OR buy individual cards from the Steam Marketplace, which creates a market for the game which is controlled by the players.

The game's complex 3-lane board and 2 towers on each lane is a classic card game representation of a MOBA, just like they meant it to be. It might seem intimidating, but it's lots of fun and quite interesting and a welcome change from all the other card games out there.

There are lots of ways to build a deck - there are 4 categories of cards, distinguished by a card's color. You have control, aggro, support or lategame and gold. You can mix-match all colors, or you can play only 1 color - it's all up to you. The recommended way is you build 2 colors.

And just like in a MOBA you have 5 heroes which go in separate lanes (there is a possibility to have all 5 heroes on 1 lane, but it's uncommon and requires playing cards with specific effects). There are creeps you can spawn and which spawn randomly each turn. There are items, which are representative of the Dota 2 game's shop (there's also a hidden shop item shown each turn).

For game modes, there are plenty:
[b]Social Play[/b] which includes:
[list]
[*] user-organized tournaments which have a set of rules specified by the creator
[*] private lobbies you can invite your friends into
[*] open play which gives you the opportunity to open a room to all your friends or a Steam community to play with you
[/list]

[b]Casual Play[/b]:
[list]
[*] playing versus bots to test decks or just train yourself to become btter if you don't want to face real opponents
[*] global matchmaking which matches you with another player
[*] Gauntlet, which has a set of specific rules and gives you a deck or a choice of a few decks to play with
[/list]

Now, the last one is called [b]expert play[/b] - this is where the real game is. This is what most will call the ranked play. However, it requires an entry ticket (one of them requires booster packs as well, but I'll get into that in a bit) which is purchased with real money - $5 per 5 tickets (you are given 5 tickets with your initial purchase). The goal is to win 3 to 5 games before losing 2 games. Here are the available game modes:
[list]
[*] constructed - you build a deck and compete against other players
[*] phantom draft - build a deck by picking cards from a series of cards which are given to you from a random pool to choose from
[*] keeper draft (2 tickets, 5 packs) - you again pick from a series of cards, but this time it's the cards from the packs you opened, you also keep all the cards you pick!
[/list]

Entry tickets are what a lot of people are angry about. But it's not bad, it's very well thought out:
When you play expert games, you pay an entry fee which is usually just 1 ticket. For winning 3 games before losing 2, you get your ticket back. For 4 games you win a booster pack. And for 5 games - 2 booster packs.
For keeper draft, it's different since it requires 2 tickets, so:
3 wins - 2 tickets + 1 pack; 4 wins - 2 tickets + 2 packs; 5 wins - 2 tickets + 3 packs.

Every win and loss feels like it wasn't contributed by skill, rather a roll of the die. If I wanted dice to make or break my game, I would rather play Yahtzee.

It's very unique with its gameplay, but for me personally, I never had any intention of playing anything aside of vs bots.  I don't really have any competitive urge anymore.  The issue I have is that vs AI has --NO-- experience gain.  That means no free card packs for playing.  It really takes away from the sense of accomplishment and building up when you have to go to the marketplace and choose what cards you want.

I can't wait for the revamp to the game.  Gameplay is really solid and doesn't need any change, it's the microtransactions and lack of experience in single player.



EDIT AFTER PLAYING MUCH MORE:
As much as I really kind of hate it, once you put some money into the microtransactions to get access to extra cards, the game gets WAY better than it already was.  I'm still playing strictly against bots, but with access to more cards, I've fallen in love with the game.  

tldr:  If you're planning on playing vs bots only, expect to put an additional $10-15 into the game to buy cards to make the game playable.  Overall, awesome once you do that though.",1555311180,1574968916,True,16,2,0.596495270729064941,0,True,False,False

A very complex card game with limited RNG. The three lane system really forces you to think ahead and how to distribute your resources among the lanes. The art is good, the voice acting is amazing and the lore is strong.

Something questionable is the marketing strategy where the amount of cards isn't inflated. Because of the market integration it makes the cards remain value as long as the game has players.

A major flaw with the game is lack of a proper ranked mode. The existing rank seems to be mostly quantitative rather than qualitative. You can not lose rank.",1574900885,1574900885,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is well beyond a ""card game""; this is much more a tactical board game played with cards.  While the cards define what you can do and where things are on the board there is a lot more going on than just the cards which is where the depth of play comes from.  It was refreshing in the first several games I played with my own crafted deck (from just the cards I got from the 10 starter packs) that I immediately could see where I could have played differently or made better decisions.  I never once felt like I was at the mercy of the next card I was drawing or that the random placement of creeps/random effect of a card were what caused me to lose.  

A few cons.  

The iconography and display of key information in the game is a mismatch of ideas.  The status of heroes and when they are re-entering the game is on the top left and is very vanilla UI.  Improvements in the lane (resulting from a card played) are floating 3D water drops and can be easy to miss as many blend in with the 3D board in the background.  Rarity symbols on cards have a hover over text so you can see RARE vs COMMON but I swear some common cards look like they have a RARE colored symbol.  Also the card-type icons can easily blend into the backgrounds of cards.  

Matchmaking in the casual play modes doesn't seem to exist so its one game against a random junk deck and the next against a top tier synergistic deck.  Feels like the system, at a minimum, could try to match the power level of decks so that players can try out less ideal deck builds without getting completely random results.  The free casual modes are key to building confidence for players to take the jump into the pay-to-play modes.

In regards to the market.

Personally I like the fact I can buy the cards I want to play with.  I didn't think I would buy any cards outright on day one, but when I saw that many cards I was interested in were a reasonable price I pulled the trigger.  I spent $10 on day one to build out an entire Red/Black deck I wanted to try (note; I did get an Axe in my initial 10 packs which was one of the stronger Red heroes I wanted to play in the deck).  It was a great experience with the market and exactly what I wanted out of having a market.  I am not opposed to paying to have some fun.

As far as selling; I am staying away for the time being outside a few Uncommons I sold off to see how it works.  My cards were bought almost instantly above the rate at which it would have been better to just convert to Event Tickets.  Checking back a day later and price was about the same.",1543511536,1574856704,True,0,0,0.498948216438293457,0,True,False,False

In no capacity can you grind or work towards gaining cards, Immediately the game warns you that you can't get a refund and it is apparent to get into this game you must first open your wallet up for a random chance at getting a set of cards.

DO NOT BUY ; NO REFUNDS ; Better options exist that won't leave you wondering where $400 went when you're just trying to play a game

Gameplay wise, its a pretty unique experience of how you can make item purchases for your heroes and have 3 lanes of combat. What you see in gameplays are literally what you should expect. It's much different from the usual online card games out there currently, so if you're looking for a different game other than like heartstone and shadowverse, this is a good switch up. So far though, its looking like you have to invest more money than the original 20 bucks for the game to create a decent deck, but coming from someone who used to play yugioh, I think it's ultimately up to the person playing if they choose to invest in the game or not. IMO I don't think its worth it at the moment, even though it is different and the fact that I literally got an RNG opening that paid the game for me. For some people, 20 bucks isn't much to experience the game, but I highly recommend you keep watching gameplay videos and learn about the game before deciding to make your purchase. Take my thumbs up as a middle ground, as I really like to see this game develop and see its potential, but in its current state it just seems too money hungry.

As someone who played Magic: The Gathering (MTG) within a year of its release and someone who plays Hearthstone several times a week (and someone who has also played Dota 2 from time to time), I was really looking forward to what Valve and Richard Garfield would deliver with Artifact. Although the game may not have lived up to all the hype, it has met my expectations. All thing equal, Artifact is great card strategy game. It is not without criticism, including its initial pricing model, and although it is not terribly difficult to learn how to play Artifact, it is complex enough that it sometimes does not seem as “fun” (in a casual sense) as Hearthstone. Perhaps Artifact is to Hearthstone what Dota 2 is to League of Legends.  

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Artifact is a turn-based card game, which is great for those of us no longer sporting the reflexes of our teenage years. Player turns are still timed, so you cannot drag games out indefinitely. Artifact matches are a hybrid of MTG, Hearthstone, and Dota 2.  As with the other trading card games, you start with a deck that is built around one or more colors or classes. Unlike the other card games but similar to Dota 2, instead of a single board where the action takes place, you and your opponent face off across three separate lanes guarded by towers. Your goal is to destroy two of your opponent’s towers or destroy one tower twice (although the second time, the tower has considerably more health). Over the course of the game, you get to deploy up to five heroes across your lanes and use them to cast spells or summon minions to battle your opponent’s forces. Artifact is also an interesting combination of calculated decisions on your part with some random elements, such as what lanes your initial three heroes are deployed at the start, what lanes additional minions spawn each turn, and so forth.  Between rounds you also get to buy equipment, a la Dota 2, to strengthen your heroes.  Since Artifact battles are brutal, your heroes will die. Often. But death is not necessarily a bad thing, as two rounds later, you get to deploy them again, at full strength once more.

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
The initial iteration of Artifact comes with four colors: black, blue, green, and red (and I say initial because MTG also had white in addition to those four). Your deck of cards will consist of spells and heroes of one or more colors. Each color has several heroes that, generally speaking, follow the themes of said color – as do the spells. Deck customization is very similar to what you would encounter in MTG. Unlike Hearthstone, you do not have neutral cards that all classes can use, aside from the equipment that you buy in between rounds. Most of the heroes that appear in Artifact also appear in Dota 2. 

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
Artifact does not have a story per se, but like other trading card games, it does reside in a fantasy setting, that just happens to overlap with the world of Dota 2. 

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
The card art, layout, interfaces, etc. all look quite nice. The animations, including those silly looking imps, are well done. Sound effects are fine. The music is also good, except there could be a bit more variety, and after a while, the music starts to sound quite repetitive. I have not encountered any bugs in the gameplay, but for some unknown reason, I continue to see a busted splash screen in the Call to Arms section that apparently has something to do with playing the game on an ultrawide display.  But again, no issues with the gameplay.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] Yes. This is the type of game that you have to play multiple times to become better at it.  

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 9/10.

[i]Played in 2018 - 2019.[/i]

[b]Addendum[/b]
As far as I know, Artifact is a dead or dying game. It would require investment from the developer to keep it fresh, but that in turn requires a playerbase that does not appear to be there any more. While I stand by my original review - the game is sound - I acknowledge that game failed to attract and/or retain a critical mass of players. Some of this is probably due to some of the obtuse mechanics but more likely just the pace of the game. Having personally switched over to [i]Dota Underlords[/i], pacing cannot be underestimated. The upfront monetization schemes were probably equally, if not more so, responsible for putting off prospective players. I think Artifact could be rebooted by Valve or perhaps contracted out to a third-party. Many of the pieces are already in place, but both the gameplay and the value proposition need to be overhauled; personally, I think that the game ought to be either free-to-play or contain a massive single-player campaign a la [i]System Crash[/i].",1550887969,1574803926,True,11,5,0.474290817975997925,0,True,False,False

This game is, at this point, abandonware with a poorly conceived economy, very little effort made to balance and exceedingly unfair to players on a financial level. 

If ever a future developer ever wants to figure out why ""free to play"" is the preferred economic model for online TCGs, Artifact demonstrates it in every possible way. 

Let's take a moment to discuss the good... 

As mentioned the presentation of the game is world class. It's beautifully designed, it captures the smooth and slick design of DOTA 2's UI and it's an overall positive experience visually.

The game design is rather interesting -- the three-lane structure was an obvious implementation but how they captured the feel of DOTA is rather impressive. Globals are indeed global. Some units excel at ""laning"" while others are role serving (executing assassins, champion killers, etc) 

However, that ends the good... 

Economy...

It's unfair to consumers, strongly encourages pay-to-win (which would be potentially a criticism to level at any card game, but generally it's more a pay-to-play situation) in that your best way to acquire cards is through the secondary market and obviously, the must have OP cards carry hefty price tags -- though obviously this did ""improve"" as the game died it's slow death. 

Unbalanced...

As mentioned, this is essentially abandonware at this point. Valve has entirely given up on the game and there is little reason to think that with DOTA Underworlds aorother projects that they will see any good reason to return to it. This means that the now entirely solved state of the game is sure to continue for the foreseeable future. 

To talk about how Valve put out a flashy looking, but incomplete game would be considered just purely piling on. 

If a MOBA card game is your thing, wait for Riot to release Runeterra, it's already a better game with a clear and concise way for how players can earn the cards and while the underlying game design is simplistic in comparison, at least Riot will put out a product that people can, and will play.",1574538589,1574538708,False,2,0,0.500316441059112549,0,True,False,False

I played this game again today, because I love the art and the idea.. BUT I load in, and on TURN TWO my opponent had drawn more than half their deck, their mana on all towers was triple mine, their cards were free and they could deal 80 damage to my tower, with the ability to board wipe the other two lanes repeatedly. I could do nothing, and I purposely built a deck that I thought might have a chance against this deck because it is the only one I saw the last three times I tried this game.. But alas, I didn't run the god combo of blue green with five very specific leaders, so the game is over before it started. Because they don't balance or ban cards, so you're stuck in a perpetual loop of god awful mirror matches.

Ultimately, Artifact solves the problems of Hearthstone's and Magic the Gathering's economies. I know a lot of people compare online CCG monetization to Hearthstone as some kind of gold standard, where you technically don't need to pay a dime for the game, but this mindset is absolutely naive, as being a free-to-play in Hearthstone requires a MASSIVE time investment to be competitive. Additionally, you can spend $100 on every set (I've spent $60 on a few), and STILL not have all the cards, or enough dust to craft them. Even in this game's peak price for cards, it was like $100~ to just buy EVERY card. While that does sound ridiculous, any MTG player would scoff at that, as a lot of staple meta cards are like $20 dollars in secondary markets (the most expensive Artifact card was Axe at a peak of around $20). Because the company behind MTG sees none of the money from secondary markets, they began a system of ""vaulting"" certain cards, and only reprinting them in big hundreds-of-dollars boxes for people to buy and resell. This just inflates the price of cards for the sake of the company earning extra money. Because Artifact's market is controlled by Valve, Valve already gets revenue from the secondary markets, leading to zero reason to artificially inflate card prices or gouge the customer on pack prices. While it does seem pretty egregious greed during the height of the lootbox era, this would actually be the LEAST expensive card game for actual card game players (it ""would be"" because its dead). I really hope they just say ""fuck the dota theme"" and make it a generalized ""Valve"" card game.

""First of all,"" he wrote, ""I'm grateful for Blizzard reconsidering their position about my ban. Earlier this week, I told media that I knew I might have penalty or consequence for my act, because I understand that my act could take the conversation away from the purpose of the event. In the future, I will be more careful on that and express my opinions or show my support to Hong Kong on my personal platforms""

Blitzchung went on to express gratitude that his winnings were being restored, explaining that, ""People from Blizzard had explained this to me through a phone call and I really appreciate that and I accept their decision on this part.""

Regarding the reduction of his suspension, he's grateful for that too though he noted, ""six months is still quite a lot to me"" and added ""I wish Blizzard can reconsider about their penalty on the two casters involved.""

He finished by answering the question a lot of his fans have been asking: Whether he'll be returning to competitive Hearthstone. ""Honestly, I have no idea on that yet. Since my next tournament is very likely to be the grandmaster tournament of next season, it's probably at least a few months from now on. I will take this time to relax myself to decide if I am staying in competitive hearthstone scene or not.""

He finished by writing, ""Hearthstone changed my the way I live, I really love this community. Blessing to all the players out there, and blessing to Blizzard.""

Blitzchung has also been answering questions on his Twitch channel. On the Hearthstone subreddit, a commenter translated some of his replies, including this response to the question of how he felt about suggestions of boycotts or protests at Blizzcon: ""We can enjoy the game all we want. I mean even if you don't do it it's totally fine, for some people it's their livelihood. Also I was definitely not trying to damage Blizzard by my actions. Also I really want to say one thing. I'm seeing a lot of people pushing streamers, players, casters, Blizzard employees etc to make a statement (regarding me). I want to make it clear that whether you play Blizzard games or not and whether you make a statement or not are completely your personal freedom. I don't think we should push people into anything. I also hope those who stayed neutral or silent won't be targeted by the crowd. Not that I don't appreciate your support but it's their freedom. I am against this ""pushing others to speak up"" thing.

Don't get me wrong - Artifact is fun. Infuriatingly so, in fact.
If all you're interested in is a draft mode: Go for it, the gameplay is deep, and refreshingly different from other card games in the sense that it's not about micromanaging your units but instead about using spells and your heroes to manipulate the board situation you're presented with to lead to your victory by balancing between defence and offence.

This is wonderfully supplemented by the three-lane-system which encourages you to split up the resources you're given and to figure out the best win condition to go for in your current situation.

These decisions the game gives you are then taken even further with the gold and items, which you can use to interact with your heroes, and serve as a secondary card resource other than the spells you play with mana - interchangable in some ways, giving you even more opportunity to take calculated risks and set your priorities.
The unpredictable nature of non-hero creeps and placement does introduce RNG into the core gameplay, but also ensures you're almost certain to continually face different board states, and to not get tired of the same situations repeating again and again too quickly.

These decisions also cause Artifact to be the closest you'll get to having a personal playstyle in a card game as opposed to having it dictated by your deck. 
In theory, it also lessens the impact of netdecking, because individual player skill in the match itself takes on a greater role compared to the deck alone than some of the competition.
It doesn't undermine the importance of a well balanced and thought out deck, however.

The importance of playing around situations you're presented with leads into deckbuilding and thinking about ways to improve your deck to adapt to certain enemy strategies et cetera naturally leads to deckbuilding being a marvellously fun thought process of theory crafting and playing around - which leads directly into the main downfall of Artifact - the ""Economy"".

It feels like Richard Garfield and Valve designed an economy consisting of loot boxes (card packs) and a card stock market with a game attatched to it, influencing some design decisions negatively. 
They want to stay as close to physical card games as possible by only balancing cards in extreme cases, which is an interesting idea, because especially in deep games, the meta tends to evolve without any change to the core game itself - see Starcraft 2, where one player managed to completely tip the scales in a matchup considered one-sided for years.
[strike]This design decision, however, appears to have mostly been made to reassure [strike] stock traders [/strike] players that their ""investment"" would retain its value, putting the economy over gameplay.[/strike]
Edit: This decision has recently been changed, marking a step in the right direction.
Furthermore, a way to earn a limited number of cards by gameplay has also been added.
Nevertheless, the game remains pay to win after purchase, and thus it still has a long way to be able to be called a game with a ""fair"" monetization system.

This leaves Artifact as a game full of potential castrated by its outdated monetization scheme.
Valve have shown that they can do better with DOTA 2 and it's horribly disappointing to see them turn to pay to win with a really promising title.

NOTE: At the time of writing, a full base set of Artifact cards can be bought for approximately [strike]$180[/strike] $60. This is cheaper than most other digital card games on the market, save for maybe Gwent. So if you're ready to shell out that sum for a mostly complete experience in a card game (save for the ""expert"" modes which require a $1 buy-in every time) this is probably what you're looking for.
However, this being ""cheaper"" than most others is not an excuse - it's a video game, and others in the medium do not get this free pass. 
I highly doubt that the development cost for card games is higher than something like a competitive shooter or a MOBA in terms of game design or balancing, and see no reason why card games should be treated differently in that regard. 
The previously mentioned DOTA 2 is a prime example of a competitive game done right, and Valve have definitely proven they can be successful with such a model, making Artifact even more disappointing.
NOTE 2: After a blog post detailing the development team taking two steps back to reevaluate this entire mess, the community is hopeful for a relaunch some time next year.

Valves other new game, Underlords, just didn't make the cut for me. The games take too long, and at the same time the game doesn't require you to focus on it completely, so it just becomes quite boring quite fast. Also I don't like the constant changes to Underlord, seems like there is 3 new patches every week, and you therefore don't get time to learn the meta, before a new one comes along, which makes the game far less fun for me.

Sure Artifact has a small player base atm. But let's be real, the game in itself is really well designed, both graphically and game wise. It's far less RNG then a lot of other card games, and the game resemlbes dota 2, which the card games evolved from, in a lot of ways.

1. even though the ""board"" never changes, you rarely get the same kind of game twice, this is an remarkable feed, when considering the amount of RNG in the game.

2. The learning curve is quite high. The game, just like dota 2, takes a lot of time to master and play ""well"". Still, once you have mastered the basics, if not more, the games starts to become really rewarding to play, in regard to the feeling you get when pulling off a clutch victory or just outplaying your opponent, cuz' yes, you have mastered a very difficult game, and it shows in your victories.

It's not like hearthstone, where I would dare say; that if 2 players, one pro, and one regular player, where given the same features regarding deck strength, the regular player could easily pull off a victory vs the pro player, if RNG was with him, and he just played his cards on curve.
Let's be honest, it's not rewarding to win a game in hearthstone like it is in Artifact, the games quickly become the same, in regarding to cards you seen played, and not long after that, the grind just becomes very tiresome, because every game basicly is the same, and you keep meeting the same 3-5 decks in every game. It's not fun. Artifact on the other hand, offers you a new game, every single time. No game is ever played out the same. Sure you can also find the same decks on Artifact, thats not what I'm saying, but the fact that the games, where you maybe find those same decks, are played out differently every time, makes the games so much more enjoyable. After having said all this, it saddens me to see the player count in Artifact. It's SUCH a great game, with huge potential, and even though Valve might have made some misssteps regarding the way the realised the game to only a select few and making the game 20$ (which in my personal opinion, wasn't a mistake, but a lot of people seems to think so), the failure of the game is mainly that people didn't sit down and had the patience to learn the game.

You get what you pay for, so yeah, hearthstone is a free-to-play game, and that is clearly seen in the quality of the games. So yea if you like giving money to a bottomless black pit, which is Blizzard, by buying pack after pack, (cuz lets be honest, I've played hearthstone in legend top 200 EU, you need a buy AT LEAST 200 packs, everytime a new expansion comes out, if you want all the good cards, and then after that, dust the duplicates to craft the rest of the legendaries you didn't get), then hearthstone is your game.
But if you are tired of the same grind every day, the same decks, the same cards, and the same outcome, then Artifact is your game. Sure it requires an upfront payment, but the game is definitly worth it! In regard to the bottomless black pit which is Blizzard, Valve on the other hand, has the Steam Market, so your cards actually have value, like a card collection in MTG, and if you should get tired of the game, you can just buy some other game, with the money you get from selling your card collection. I for once have spend thousands of dollars on hearthstone, because that was required if you wanted to play at a higher level. All that money is gone now, I'm not getting it back, because of the black pit, which I at the time, was stupid enough to invest in, because no game like Artifact exsisted at the time i began playing online TCG's.

I can only urge people to really try, actually try out Artifact, instead of having played like 10-20 hours and then write a rewiev on how bad the game actually is. I can guarantee, that if you played 20 hours of dota 2, and then had to write a reweiv, you would fucking trash the game so bad. Because it's a super difficult game! Much more difficult then LoL and HoN, but at the same time, like Artifact vs Hearthstone, much more rewarding to spend your time on, once you learn to play the game, mainly because of it's high skill cap, and also it's beautiful interface!

So people, let's stop trashing a great game like Artifact, and sit down, learn to play it, and all have fun together, with this amazing, and best online TCG game ever created: Artifact!",1572250685,1572250685,True,2,0,0.478286892175674438,0,True,False,False

By far the cheapest card game to play considering how much it costs to play, I only play in the modes that require tickets, and even after almost 300 hours I spent less money on Artifact than on a 3xA game. Comparatively I spent waaay more money on MTGO, MTGA and Hearthstone.
That being said, I've played card-games professionally in the past and while I can go infinite in any MTG platform, I cannot do so in Artifact (although it is very close to possible and considering my playtime in the game I can't believe how little I've spent). May be more expensive for ""bad"" players, but even then there is the option of playing completely free.

Queue times are completely fine at the moment even tho the game is currently considered ""dead"". I left the game when it ""died"" and recently came back, and there are always people for me to play against in competitive phantom draft, which is the mode I play the most.

In my opinion it's by far the most skill-intensive card game ever made. Even with RNG I feel like it's extremely rewarding for good play, and you can get back from crazy situations, a game of Artifact is interesting from start to finish and is never over until it's over. The amount of premature gg's I did before learning this is staggering. More RNG than Magic, but 100x more complex.

Even if you don't like the complexity of the game, it's extremely fun and the Heroes feel strong and impactful. If you just want to smash things you can always play bigger heroes. The balance of hero quality vs card quality is brilliant.

RNG plays a big role in this game, but there are many cards that help mitigate this, like for instance cunning plan, compel and ventriloquy in blue to make up for ""unlucky"" hero placements early game.

This game is amazing and I'm so happy it exists! I hope expansions will come in the future. Only thing I would really like is more time in competitive, because the game is so complex and I love to dive deep into intricate decisions and right now with the quick timer that's just not possible, going back to the original time would be great (was it 10 minutes and now it's down to 5?.. 5 minutes is stupid honestly, way too low for a card game this difficult).
Maybe a daily quest system would be good to retain players?

What I like about Artifact:

- Beautiful game: Love how the board looks and enjoy all of the card art.

- Sound: Fantastic music! I've also enjoyed listening to voiced lines from some of my favorite heroes.

- Engaging to play: I like the general flow of the gameplay. Enjoy how there are Dota mechanics weaved into a traditional card game system. It makes sense and I'm usually surprised at how well thought it abilities are on heroes.

I get that it's a game that has a low population base. It's easy to see that and then move on to look at any digital CCGs that might have a healthier population. There's now a connotation that Artifact is a dead game... and in the age of video gaming, with such a plethora of options, when a game's population moves away, it's typically for good. I haven't had issues finding multiplayer matches, primarily in the standard phantom draft game type (a free one, in case you're wondering).

I think if you approach this as an extension of Dota lore that has high production values and you can get enjoyment out of primarily single player CCG play, there's a worthwhile purchase here.

I wanted to recommend Artifact. I really did. I would be wrong to do so.

Artifact is fun to play. It reminds me of Magic (no wonder, since Richard Garfield spearheaded this), it is exciting to bluff the opponents, it has a TRADING system, which no other digital card game has from what I've played so far. Matches are interesting and the mechanics are really cool. 

Problem is, there's no incentive to play. I find myself WANTING to play Artifact and then being immediately dissuaded by the fact apart from one or two matches, the game gets stale. There's no sense of progression. There's no feeling of actually accomplishing something. 

The game feels like an Early Access in terms of what it offers. No profiles? No stats? No deck comparison? Coming from the company that literally made stats an in-game purchase (looking at you Dota Plus), this feels like a feature yet to be implemented, and a feature that should be out already.

You can play draft and constructed formats, but only in a casual way. Ranked costs tickets and while I get this urge to buy tickets, I also stop myself because fuck this. Fuck all of this. I don't want to pay to be matched with equal match opponents.

[/h1] It is full of strategies with 3 lanes taken into consideration. Besides, the card selection and variety are abundant. There are so many decks and strategies to explore.

[h1] However, as for the business model it uses, pay to play ( expert mode which is the only way to grind for extra card packs ) is definitely not promising for this game's future. [/h1] Many new players would want to get new packs ASAP without spending extra money in the game since it already costs 20$ to buy 10 packs and 5 tickets. 

With 5 tickets, if new players begin to play self-construct mode, they are likely to meet with those rivalries who have the strongest cards in the game which also cost a lot of money. If they begin to play phantom draft mode, seldom will they get the card combination they want because of the rule of 4 different card attributes ----- black, red, green, blue. For those who do not want to spend extra money in game, surely will they not consider the third mode in expert match which costs 2 tickets and 5 packs to enter. 

[h1] Last but not least, RNG factor in game is quite annoying. [/h1] The fact that you cannot control friendly units to attack whichever enemy units or tower sometimes just drives me crazy, because at some critical moments, the attack direction for my units is actually helping the enemy. I do not know why they did not apply the game mechanism used in MTGA to every lane in the Artifact. 

Overall, I have used all my 5 tickets to play expert matches, among which I got only 1 perfect run in the phantom draft mode while the rest lost with no tickets back. Right now, I do not see any reason for me to stay playing the game. [h1] Fun though it is, there is also no progression system that awards players. The dev will add progression in the future update. [/h1] Maybe I will change the review then.

Edit: 
[h1]Dev added the progression system and promised to balance cards in the long term. [/h1]Although they did not change RNG mechanism, balancing cards is a good alternate choice essencially.

It does have real issues :
- having to pay for cards in constructed mode
- the absence of an actual ladder with MMR and leagues

It also lacks some small (but important) things like a draft mode with friends, and a ""watch replay"" feature.

But at the same time it is so strategic, deep, intense, original, beautiful, and (most importantly) fun.

-No in game tasks or quests in a time when players are used to play incentives
-RNG in a time when people are hyping up competitive MTG.

Deep. Complex. Fun. A little bit of RNG that makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes, but also leaves an uncertainty that makes every match exciting. Here's why this is the best card game I have played in the 6 years of card game experience I have.

-You may think that $20 plus buying cards to be super meta(super meta decks are between 20-60 bucks)makes this not worth your while. But I assure you that isnt the case.

-In other card games, the meta cost varies usually between 100-3000 dollars. Usually the higher end is what wins and it's nuts. In this game, relatively cheap and easy.

-Phantom draft is for those who dont want to spend much money. You get to open 5 packs on the spot to make a deck and use. It only costs a ticket to enter(you start with 5) and you reearn the ticket as well if you get 3 wins with only 1 loss. you get 1 to 2 packs as well if you get 4/5 wins. This is crazy, allow me to explain why.

-When you go to your local game/cards store it costs 15 dollars usually to participate in a tournament of maybe 30 people and have a chance to win some packs(or in store credit) usually the packs vary between 16 for the winner and 4 for the bottom of the top 8. In Artifact you only need to beat 5 people and are allowed 1 loss to get all your money back and 2 pack.

In short, this game is a godsend to the card game genre with excellent gameplay and a good pricetag. Most people in the reviews screaming about microtransactions have no idea what they are talking about.

* Owning the full collection made me take an interest as i can develop new strategies/experiment and homebrew for fun/cheap without spending $100s like on other card games.

*Upfront cost instead of grinding my life away until i hit the gold cap each day.

*Possible CS:GO effect will come into play and value of collection will skyrocket.

12/22 UPDATE: So it looks like the backlash resonated with Valve. There's now a leveling system with rewards, and some of the worst RNG cards have been rebalanced to avoid ridiculous coinflip strategies. While there's still some work to be done, this is a good start, Recommendation changed.

The three things that hurt Artifact.

#1 It is a card game made by Valve and many Valve fans are not dota fans or into strategy games, let alone card games.

#2 The monetization model. In reality, Artifact was the cheapest card game even at it's peak. You could buy a whole collection for $300. Hearthstone would require at least a few grand. It was a bold move doing the traditional old school way of physical card game monetization models but because of people trashing the game with 0.1 hours and also 

#3 The game wasn't entirely finished. Valve released Artifact with no progession model. No stats. No replays. No expansions.No mobile. It took long enough to get balance changes. Artifact needed so much more to keep people staying. 

Artifact is actually a really fun game that was hurt by people who never even gave it a proper chance. Many people just aren't the target market for strategy games, let alone card games. Yet, because its Valve that means that people have to be little kids and trash the game anyway because it just wasn't meant for them. 

When Valve decides to re-release Artifact with a monetization model similar to Dota 2, it will be the best card game ever made. A card game where everyone has all the cards, and that the only thing that people pay for is cosmetics / music packs / boards / ect. You know, the monetization model that all of your Dota 2 fans know and love. Valve messed up by listening to Richard Garfield when it came to monetization. 

Again, the perception people had that it was so expensive but if you wanted to be competitive, it was absolutely hugely more affordable. It wasn't affordable however to people who didn't want to spend a dime more than they needed to. No option to grind. The reason for the no grind of course was because it would devalue the cards on the steam market.

Valve tried protecting the value of cards. Richard Garfield said they would never nerf a card because it would hurt the value of the card on the market. It wasn't until the game took a huge player loss that Valve looked at the outrage and realized that they had to make a huge decision. Balance the cards and roll out updates similar to Dota 2 and create a volatile market or continue to let some cards be OP.

Valve did start laying the foundation of the future of Artifact. It looked positive. Balance changes. A focus on the gameplay being better than the value of cards remaining intact. But Valve didn't have enough time to realize their visions before it was so negatively received that the only way for them to have people give it one more serious look would be to re-release it when everything was finally done. 

If Artifact ever is relaunched, and something tells me it will, then I will bet that Artifact will not be missing any features. It will be a complete game. It will have a good monetization model. It will have a huge road map and the game will be supported just like everything you expect from Dota 2 and Underlords. 

You can comeback and look at the Steam reviews of Artifact to laugh or cry but at the end of the day you're only denying the inevitable return of the greatest card game ever made, Artifact.",1543447342,1566709461,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

I'd just like to say beforehand that im a magic: the gathering veteran (played since 1995).

Its ok

Not great - just so so

I didn't know anything about the game until only a few days ago - bought it (richard garfield) -  and played a little. My initial impressions were that it was fun (sort of) but they did little to show you how to actually play the game: this was frustrating.  The games were also long. Loooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg. Long in a way that made draft very difficult to play given the amount of concentration is required over such a long period of time. I also noticed that they have adopted the 'lane' approach, one that they have obviously borrowed from other online card games. I also noticed that there are very few ways to acquire cards outside of buying them. While im no expert at draft, im no slouch either, but im certainly not going to put in all those hours just for a chance at winning cards. At the end of my 10 or so hours of gameplay and after looking at some of the Valve promo  videos ive become a little suspicious of it all. Let me explain that: I really don't think Richard Garfield has designed this game, or has even had a major input. Valve has explicitely stated that they were influenced by Dota mechanics. What i think has happended here is that Valve has decided to enter the online collectible cardgame market, designed a card game derived from both Dota and Magic: The gathering and  employed Garfield as primarliy a marketing strategy. I honestly think that Garfield has had some input in Artifacts' design process, but as to how much is anyone's guess. 

I would have liked to have seen some original ideas here, but they are few and far between - the same fantasy tropes, the same use of mana and colours and the same combat mechanics. If you've played Magic then Artifact is like three games of Magic played side-by-side with some interactions between those games - it is a true test of concentration indeed but i'm not sure that it has taken the genre to an altogether good place. One of the main  reasons behind Magic's success was that the games were playable within a certain window of time. 

I would stay away from this game unless you are an avid fan of collectible card games and have a lot of money to spare. I myself will probably play a little here and there but will not spend any more money on it apart from my initial investment of around 40$. You have been warned.

 The gameplay is solid, while its obvious that some cards are more powerfull than others, thats by design. And that would be ok if valve didn't fuck up one simple thing.  And that is that card games NEED UPDATES. Especially when your game is designed by Richard Garfield.  Every complaint about X card being too powerfull would change eventually cause the new influx of cards would make cards that were bad before more viable. Or cards that counter these old more powerful cards. 
     Valve fucked up real bad by not updating this wonderful game with a new expansions 2 months after release.  And i still think this game CAN be saved if they commit to launching more expansions ( and making the base game free to play) .  Honestly, i want to know more lore about the dota 2 universe, i want to play more of this game with new cards.  So please valve, UPDATE THIS.  They were doing such a great job before the launch by talking to the community every day and now we go silent.

It made you think every play that one certain card could do in each lane and is one of the few card games you had to sit down and focus on like the others. I felt what really killed this game was the fact it wasn't in early access. The beta was given to a handful of players. Instead of just eveyone. I also think the fact people in the beta got every single card didnt show how the marketplace idea could tank the game. It makes the game enjoyable when someone has access to all the cards and you just have the starter decks. I also think that how the game setup with having to spend 20$ on the game than having to spend money on tickets, having to spend money on cards or packs made it hard for people who dont want to spend more than x amount on a game. I think artifact could have been free to play, in beta, and setup how underlords is handling everything.

i HATE the visuals, but the depth in strategy is great. RNG is a factor, beware. As in ALL card games, either poker, MTG or even war ;)

Hope Valve do keep their promise to support and update the game. 
My main criticisms would be that it's a little dry, I'm not into the lore and sometimes opening a pack means you have to listen to a 3 minute monologue from your 'rare' character you unpack. I tried to listen and get 'into' it but I just couldn't, I think the game expects you to know who/where certain places are in the lore but I have no reason to care since I didn't get into DOTA previously.
There is also no way to earn more packs/cards from playing which is sad. I may not be Valve's target audience but I am not going to pay for digital cards beyond the initial purchase of the game. I have enjoyed Hearthstone since launch without having to put down another penny (I did buy a few packs when Hearthstone launched just to support the devs). This may be the biggest reason I stopped playing.
Finally I think the base set was not well balanced enough. Without having all the cards I can't see any way to counter the best decks. Even if I did have them all I think the possibility playspace of this initial set was too small and needed more counters to the dominant playstyles.
I don't think there's any community really playing now, matchmaking takes a long time, so I just play bots, but I'll be back and ready whenever Valve update this.
Overall, I couldn't recommend this for card playing beginners, but a very good game for people already into this style of gaming.",1562226841,1562226841,True,2,1,0.512609243392944336,0,True,False,False

Overpowered heroes strong arm players into using certain builds. Additionally, frustrating mechanics like attack arrows, lack of control over hero movement and positioning, cheat death, multicast, locked cards and infinite mana often decided games on turn 1 or made endgame a spacebar simulator.

Pricing model is also lacking. Initial buy-in price and tickets made playing the game more expensive (recuperable if good in competitive game modes). The lack of rewards and achievements also did not help post release interest.

At this point, the game is a bad haul. Valve has their hands full on more profitable titles. Their lack of communication does not inspire player confidence. You'd probably have some fun with janky builds against AI though.

Because Storm Spirit as a ""traditional Black"", just doesn't make any sense what so ever as a Dota player... And Omniknight as a ""Green"", that 'magically' makes him into a scuff healing Elf? I mean, come on... Lol.
In my opinion, they should have kept the original idea of sticking with the 3 main primary colors. Red being Strength, Green Agility, and Blue as Intelligence respectfully. And turn Black into another game mechanic itself. Like a duel (or tri-) colored card between at least 2 of the core colors as combined actions from the given Heroes and Creeps for a example. Would be a great way to get new people to be interested into Dota 2, by teaching players what would be possible to do in actual Dota. And the flexibility to create more actions between Heroes and Creeps, besides just Abilities & Spells that wouldn't be possible in actual Dota without drastically changing and diluting the Heroes in the arena.
And refocus Gold as it's own main color behind it all for all the items and MORE effective consumables from Dota 2 and lore. All caps, to emphasis the choice in Strategy between a Weapon/Armor or that one time use item that would help save a lane.
Improvements? All White cards, there you go. Would think cards that are powerful enough to completely change the environment into anything, guess the power of photons would do.. hahah!
There, at least six core colors to differentiate with to build on. Simple and to the point. Also agree with balancing the cards numerically over time. No one wants a ""retired card"", due to being ""outdated or overpowered"" in digital format. Especially since the ideas behind each card are style in play, and not just numbers. So why limit and phase out any gameplay from personal style of choice and creativity? No thank you.
About the whole ""it's not free-to-play"" baby rage that the vocal mob wanted; just give people pre-constructed decks to play around with for fun and add/balance things out from there. Without 'owning' any of the cards to make their own decks that is. Call me old school, but even people who I wouldn't know would be kind enough to lend me their deck for fun at the cafeteria table.
Speaking of, Team Fortress 2 also had a pre-order Beta over 10 years ago with discount before it was officially released. So why the backwards thinking now? A easy fix that was already learned before hand, could have avoided a lot of drama and the bad acting. Guessing some at Valve who worked on Artifact are new(ish) perhaps (?) and didn't listen, while old guard working on other things waited to see them flop to learn a lesson is how I pictured it. Hah!
Besides the above that I find to be hindering it all, game play interaction and pacing is greatly polished. And I'm willing to wait in seeing it's rebirth with this being their foundation. Now that Valve have it's main mobile game with Dota Underlords, hopefully the team working on Artifact can look past attempting to push the game into a mobile title like before going forward... and build truly a great tabletop card experience for people to find value in.",1561834197,1561834197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is very much so pay to play. I had played early on before people (including me) figured this out and it was pretty fun overall while people were learning the game. I had a bug where the multiplayer would not connect and it wasted my tickets (despite verifying that I had no issues with connectivity on my end and not experiencing anything like it previously or since). The customer support did not give a full refund and made it seem like they were doing me a favor accusing me of losing connection on my end. Poor game, poor customer service to a long time valve/steam customer. 

--------------------------------------------------

Its a good game, just a bit long with regard to individual match lengths (although they do have a timer so the high end is capped, which is nice). I'd say the learning curve is a steeper than other card games as well.

There will never really be fast duels as you are basically playing 3 games at once with quite a bit of overlap to usually lengthen each. There is a ton of room for growth here and I see a lot of unique potential in this game.

Now don't I feel like a fool?  I was tricked into this as the first few matches I played made the game seem incredibly promising.   I used to play a lot of Hearthstone until a few years ago when I grew tired of the game so something different like this was very intriguing and offered in my eyes a chance to get into a fun new card game right at the start.  But it didn't take long before I realized there was zero skill involved in this game.  Due to how attacking in this game is completely randomized, you can be a top tier player with a top tier deck and get absolutely destroyed by a garbage player with a garbage deck.  And there is no point in playing a competitive game where the main factor in who wins and who loses is luck rather than skill.  Most card games luck is a big factor, but even in something as luck heavy as Hearthstone you can still walk away with like at least a 60% win rate if you're truly always the better player.  That's why this is such a frustrating an unfun game.  And the fact I poured over a $100 into Valve's game only to have the it die a few days later and end up being totally unplayable with no chance for a refund is an absolute crime I cannot believe they got away with that when they forced other developers to offer refunds when that happened to their games.  I will make sure Valve loses out on FAR more than a $100 from me by never buying another game from them again whenever it's offered on any other game store.  Always buy directly from the developer or buy from Epic so that their store can keep on taking a larger and larger bite out of Steam's profits.  Regardless, I'm sure you already knew this was a dead game and no intention of buying it, you probably just wanted to have fun looking at the reviews so...go ahead...have fun watching thousands of people echo the exact same opinion.",1561251775,1561251775,False,12,6,0.470364749431610107,0,True,False,False

Believe me when i say this game IS PAY 2 WIN and VERY luck based. This is all a pity, as the gameplay idea is very nice and definetely works. 

The best thing about this game is the story of the war between legions from Dota 2, absolutely amazing lore. I didn't think i should go thus far to write a negative review, but COME ON! I bought this game for 17.95 eur like everyone else, and then i have to buy a deck which is suitable enough to go up against others? or if i want to play expert play, 4.50 for a fucking ticket? Is this actually serious?

For people who can afford this kind of shit, their experience whilst playing this game will be great. Otherwise if you arent ready to pay around 60 eur extra to get a really good deck... just dont.

Personally i'll only be playing this game against bots, since i don't want my 17.95 eur to go to waste. Oh and yes, one last thing. if you plan on refunding the game. dont use your first 5 tickets for expert play, or you won't get it.

To those who will continue playing the game, i hope you have fun!

PS: If certain things will change, for example, being able to earn card drops and not needing to buy them. I will happily give this game a thumbs up :)

UPDATE: In the 6 month period this game had since it's release, literally no and when i say no, i mean NO fucks have been given. Apparently a few months ago we got the news (finally) that the game is being reworked. My comment to that is this: PATHETIC. Rework a game which is made to be pay to win?? Ahahaha, nah don't think so. In my opinion, there is literally no hope for this game at all.

As of 15/06/2019, Artifact seems to have been abandoned over Dota Underlords which saddens me immensely mainly because how Underlords is much more casual and rng based in comparison towards Artifact. Underlords's very early open beta release also worries me as we're seeing Valve being something it was never was before: putting new games to the public before they consider them polished enough to be out. It could be a good change or a bad one, it's too early to assume either of the options. Underlords succeeding would be rewarding Valve for solely focusing on casual gamers (Underlords) which was  something Valve never  did. I'm afraid they'll turn to the lowest common denominator (mobile rng crap) instead of making wholesome big experiences with complete. Artifact was somewhat incomplete but it was polished nonetheless, I feel like the game should've been given more chances than what people originally gave it. Even never using any card packs I had endless fun with the free stuff in the game and it was the best TCG I've played to date. The graphics/art/animation are great as well as the soundtrack that never failed to deliver. I hope this game is truly reconsidered by valve and people. I hope people will reevaluate this TCG video game economy thing because I think it was a good step away from pay2win card games. Artifact will probably be a highly debated topic for the upcoming years, however I think it'll be revisited and re-experienced, future people will enjoy it and miss what it could've become.

Artifact does that constantly, just that now you are in control of all five heroes. No more REPORT MID fOR FEED nonsense.

The game is extremely fun and well balanced. Due to the three lanes, you get cards that look stupidly broken in any other card game;

[u]Cheating Death:[/u] 
Permenant, allies have a 50% chance to not die on death when a green hero is in lane
[u]Time of Triumph: [/u] 
Allied heroes get 4 Attack, Armour, Health, Cleave, Retaliate and Seige Attack
[u]Incarnation of Selemene: [/u] 
Permenant, after you play a card, fully restore this tower's mana. (my fave, you may be able to play your entire hand in a turn, it even restores it's own mana cost!)

All these cards are fine. If you see that your opponent is going in on one lane, thats ok, now you can pressure their other lanes without resistance. If you want a card game with big balls here it is. No tiny +1 buffs only if you're a robot and wear a hat cards.

I have been playing the draft mode mainly and all games have been extremely close. I have won 'lost' games by sneaking creeps onto their ancient, healing salves at the last moment, juking damage to squeeze that tiny bit of damage needed. There is a lot of depth and potential for outplaying your opponent here. 

Like any card game, the RNG gives and takes, what makes a better player is playing around this uncertainty.

About the pricing, It's difficult to compare to other card games, the monetisation here and the method of obtaining cards are just so different. 
[b] In other games[/b], if I want a specific card there is no way for me to get it besides opening packs until I do, or dusting enough cards until I can afford it.[b] In Artifact[/b], if I want a card, I can buy it off another player directly.

The seller gets money into their steam wallet.

(I'll edit this to be longer sometime when I've played it more, I just want to nudge a positive review out there cuz I'm pretty sure this game doesn't deserve its current 58% steam rating.)

edit, followup: OK, now it's 53%.

Anyway: Artifact is a fun card game. Lots of people are mad about the pricing structure. That's sort of understandable, for people who specifically want to play Constructed at the highest level. That'll cost you some money. Like... $40, if you want an absolute Meta Deck. But there are some much cheaper decks that are still competitive.

But I've played barely any constructed (note my hours), since Free Phantom Draft is completely free, and fun in a Roguelike reacting-to-randomness kind of way.

It's not a game I recommend taking competitively (but I wouldn't like playing any kind of card game ""competitively""), but it's a distinct and fun game nonetheless.

The form of the ""fun"" is the constant, intense thought required, to factor in all the variables of the situations and make your best guess of a decent play. There's so much thinking possible that it's potentially a pretty stressful game. It's a lot more stressful if you get mad about losing to RNG, but if you treat it like a fun board game (as in, a randomness-heavy game that you play for the fun of the ever-changing puzzle, rather than for deterministic competition), then it will turn out to be a fun board game.

If you want to play Constructed, I recommend playing with friends (so you're not forced into meta decks), and playing Pauper/Peasant (commons or commons+uncommons only, since it's much cheaper without Rares).

edit 2, June 10 2019:
I've played like 300 hours of this and the vast majority of that has been free phantom drafts. It's still fun, and I still play it regularly when I'm burnt-out on whatever actiony game I'm mainly playing. I do hope Valve follows through on revamping the game to be less... offensive to people. (So many people were offended by the RNG and the monetization system, even though both the RNG and the monetization have some really positive sides to them.)

I just hope that their revamp doesn't sacrifice what I enjoy about the game.

Oh you liked control in magic and going for a late game win? Yeah well better hope RNG governs what attacks what in your favor. I literally watched the random creeps place the entire enemy wave to block my mid attack and then all of my creeps went into the row I had already pushed down. Great.

Unless you're willing to pay $20.00 to play the game and then spend another $30-50 for the cards needed to make a top tier deck (Because not all cards are equal at all, there are so many cards that are similar but one is better by miles), don't buy this game. Also you can't even try it out, because it has ""Packs"" that you get right away which count as DLC or something, thus making it non-refundable.

There, I get bitter feelings. First the amount of time to create a deck is significant, then... it is tough to get interested in mastering such complex mechanics because there is way too much randomness. It feels too unfair.

If you take a step back and look at the pricing model it is actually cheaper than other card games out there. Valve also did a good job providing some nice game modes to play their premade decks which had decent cards and no meta-deck opponents. 

However, now Valve seems to have two big problems they need to solve for. 

1) First is an external PR issue. Valve seems to have a hard time marketing the game towards new audiences. Especially those who looked towards Artifact to be a savior to the other myriad of F2P card games out there, but wasn't. People who don't look at the facts of pricing and instead spew all that negative press all over the internet about how you can only win if you spend hundreds. This was exacerbated by the $20 buy in point, even though it gave you much more than $20 worth of value. Progression rewards slightly helped with this but it definitely will require an overhaul in the next version. The economists at Valve will need to fix the markets to ensure that card values will be lower than they were, because the $12.00 Axe card at launch, while fun for the people opening the packs, does not reflect kindly to outside players. It creates the illusion that the barrier to entry is extremely high. Ironically, Valve will have to make the game F2P in order to attract a new player base again after the rework. 

2) Second is an internal issue. Valve had a lot of trouble keeping existing players. There are a ton of reasons for this but the main two I can think of is the pace of gameplay and deck building. The pace of gameplay is slow, while this can appeal to some people, myself included, it does make the game hard to start in every situation. It makes every hit of the ""Play"" button seem like a daunting task. Deckbuilding is even more-so daunting. Due to the colors and the complexity of cards it leads players to look-up decks online instead of experimenting on theirown. No card game WON'T develop a meta but the complexity of creating decks made the homogeneous mixture in build-your-own modes inevitable. Eventually the players who shy away from this mode and only play premade modes will become bored and stop playing unless Valve is actively and continuously rotating new decks in -- which is not feasible.

Overall I do recommend this game because it is still fun and you can play the premades safely without dropping any extra money. Buying and playing the game now is an investment in its future state rather than the current one. Valve will take the lessons learned a use it to create a better game. Looking forward to that day (however far in the future).",1557888312,1557888433,True,44,19,0.537531256675720215,1,True,False,False

Pros:
- Great gameplay, addicting
- Barely feel 'helpless' and that there's always outplay because of the unique gameplay
- Represents Dota as a card game well (I have 4k hours in D2)
- Great unit interactions (like in Dota 2)
- No rigid 'objectively best' deck, lot of variation and RNG involved in determining what decks will control momentum. 
- Seems relatively* balanced in my experience? I've played many multi-colour decks that I thought were powerful. 

Cons: 
- Terrible social features, non-descriptive and basically not there. (e.g. You can't add your opponents in-game.)
- No in-game viewer for Pro-games (like in Dota 2)
- No progression system whatsoever
- No ranked/ladder, it's basically the wild west in non-expert constructed. One game is against whales (Modify Player with Big Credit Card), and another is against someone who is running 4 colour. 
- Terrible monetisation, you're basically stuck in a 'Expert Loop' where you're basically going to go 3-2 (T H R E E  H O U R S  W A S T E D) most of the time and get perfect runs only if you get insanely lucky on Draft, or lucked out on your free packs so you have good items and heroes to beat the crap out of people in Constructed. And guess what, if you run out of tickets you better hit the market place to buy 20 cheap cards that cost slightly less than a dollar, it's better than how they force you to buy tickets in sets of 5 for 5 dollars. 

Rant Section - Suggestions & Frustrations (feel free to skip): 
If I had to sum it up, the only people who plugging the hell out of this game are streamers and people willing to play by the 'real card game economy' type structure because they believe that it works, because they have enough extraneous money to just not give a damn about it. Yes, if card packs were easier to get, card value inevitably goes down, and that would destroy the ticket system. But you know what? If this game had /DAILY QUESTS/ that gave you ONE ticket per day it would not destroy the economy, you know why? Because you still have to buy in to this game. You still have to win the 4/5 games in Expert to get card packs, and honestly based on the way most people who aren't 500 IQ players goes, it's not going to affect the market severely. Sure, some rarer cards might go down, but cards will always be worth something *because* of the ticket system. And the fact that people can't grind alts or throw games by multi-boxing means that a lot of the problems of f2p card games goes away. 

""You're just mad because you're bad"" - Calling out Reddit/Steam Forums: 
There's honest criticism to be given to this game, because it's a great game, but plagued by terrible decisions. Honest conversation can only be had when people who are paying out the arse for this game shut the hell up and actually understand that not all experiences will be the same. They make tonnes of money from this shit, you don't need to defend them. Especially when they're driving away people who you KNOW would love this game if not for the horrible model and [lack of] systems. 

Also the tutorial explains things, but they should have like a card ruleset or something

Ending Statement: 
I don't give a shit what 'real life card game economies' are like, Credit Cardifact is going to drive away players, Influencers and streamers are doing them a favour by being able to avoid criticising monetisation, seeing as they already have a shit tonne of money since they're not advertising it for money but because they know the game is fun. Valve won't back down from drawing people into a game because they think they can 'profit by playing', but people should at least know it's pretty unrealistic to just farm packs out the ass unless they shell out for a solid Expert Constructed deck. 

TL;DR - Best card game, terrible monetisation, non-existent Quality of Life, no quests or sense of progression.

Original: 
So far I have really enjoyed this game, it is a card game like none other. With just the start 10 packs, plus selling the unwanted rares I have been able to build the deck I wanted.

But building additional decks that are of any quality would definetly require buying more packs, what brings us to the downside of the game, the economy... The economy is structured more like real life Magic the Gathering instead of the f2p digital card games like hearthstone. I am mostly okay with this, if you want packs you have to buy packs or enter tournaments, I play Magic for many years so I am used to this. But many people will be unhappy with this approach

I do wish they would add some sort of progressive to the casual play, like just XP from each game that goes to an arbitrary ranks so there is something to strive for when not playing Expert. Also I feel like simply adding the ability to grind out packs from winning many games in causal and getting your rank up would negate a lot of the bad reviews. In hearthstone it takes quite a few wins to save up the gold for 1 pack, but I feel like just having that option would make people much happier.",1543646598,1555732014,False,0,0,0.491730004549026489,0,True,False,False

No one can tell right now what will happen to this game in the future, but the latest development could be labeled as shady or moralic questionable -  at the very best. The game was released with many parts that seemed unfinished and a monetarization that aimed at generating much money in short time. After only a few months of runtime instead of releasing further updates, the game is apparently now being overhauled with no expected re-release date.

After spending 20 EUR to buy the game and another maybe 30 EUR invested in cards I am plain speechless upon this behavior.

Original review:
After seeing the game on streams and reading about it upfront, I really wanted to like it, but some parts of the game make it very hard to enjoy it longterm as it stands. Overall, my current review summary could be called ""very mixed"".

To start with the positive, the gameplay itself is fun and I could probably recommend that portion of the whole experience. It is more RNG driven than you might expect at first and you can and will lose (and win) games in the deciding moments to unfair RNG results, but that is not even the dealbreaker here. Nonetheless it should be mentioned, that I am lost from a design standpoint, why a fair share of cards exist that can make or break a game on a 50% chance. I would hope that in an upcoming expansion this is not further utilized as losing a 30min game to a random effect is a very upsetting experience.

Having said that, what really makes the game difficult to enjoy is simply the setup of game-modes. As described by many others, you can chose to play constructed and draft completely for free after buying the game. You will not have to pay tickets but also not receive any rewards. At first that sounded promising and I hoped to play the game that way and enjoy it. However, it simply does not work that way.

Playing the casual-draft, you will play against many people who are completely new to the game, new to the mode or simply are not invested into it and play along. If you played card-games before and are familiar with the draft concept, it will be very easy to achieve a high winrate here but it is a very awkward game experience. It becomes worse when looking at the casual-constructed mode, because people with starter decks will be playing against people who invested money and run fully-fledged decks. I am sure you can imagine how much fun that is. To top it all off, as there is no ladder and no ranking of any kind, people will concede games very easily in the casual mode, if the state of the board does not suit them.

To enjoy the full game experience you will have to turn to the expert mode. If you want to play the constructed mode here, you will have to buy packs or cards from the market and thus, invest money. Running a starter deck here is surely possible, but do not expect to win any games at all in that case. 
Further. any mode in the expert section costs a ticket to enter, which can only be acquired for hard cash or by trading in cards, which you had to pay for as well. 
To sum up my experience and to illustrate the issue: My last played draft was done in the expert mode, costing me a EUR 1 ticket, whereof you get 5 with the game purchase. I won two games in a row and then lost two in a row bringing me to a 50% winrate. The last game I lost to an RNG effect in the last round. My ticket was gone and with two wins I was one short to get a ticket back as price. I paid 1 EUR to play four games without any reward.

From my perspective, I had and would have fun playing the game on the level you can find in the expert section. However, I cannot see myself paying 1 EUR every time I want to play a round of 2-6 games. Sure, winning 4 games grants you one ticket and a pack as reward and 5 wins adds another pack, but the average player will not win that many games in significant amounts.

I think the game has great potential, but I would recommend to wait with a purchase until changes are made that allow playing the game in a competitive environment, ideally with a ranking system, but without having to constantly pay money only to -in simple words- keep playing the game.

Update after 27 hours:
After 27 hours I have to say that I will stick with the negative review. After playing it some more the whole game appears to be in a state far away from a finished product as the balancing of cards is completely off in several cases and the game design has flaws that are hard to understand (RNG on where a hero gets deployed round 1 can snowball into deciding the game and often the game is then decided in favor of whoever plays the first broken or at least game-deciding card).
 
On top of that the monetarization has not been thought through or the developer actually expected people to happily and continuously pay money to play the game. Without putting further money into it and only playing the free-mode, it does not feel like having access to the whole game but moreso to a limited trial-version. 

To be honest, I feel quite tricked by the developer and find the approach more than questionable.",1543627948,1555161448,False,14,0,0.546140730381011963,0,True,False,False

Coming from Hearthstone as my only 'real' card game experience so I will frequently compare the two games in my review. I was originally planning to completely avoid this game because it seemed to have a ton of rng and required constant payment after the $20 to buy the game. But after deciding to get it with a friend and playing for a little while, I'm really starting to like it and I'm probably quitting Hearthstone now. One of the best things about Artifact is that you can buy whatever cards you want. Yes, of course, you are spending real money. But most of the cards cost 5 cents and are still good playable cards in constructed. Even the most expensive cards have been falling in price and most of them are heroes anyways which means you'll only need one copy. Spending $40 on Hearthstone just to get a couple crap legendaries has nothing on this.

Now for the dreaded RNG, it's actually implemented pretty well. To my surpise, (most of) the RNG in Artifact is less of just dumb luck that decides games and more of something you can adapt to and change your strategy based upon. For example, before each turn two melee creeps will spawn randomly, however, the game will tell you ahead of time where they have been chosen to spawn. This allows you to play around what is going to happen to at least some degree and actually makes for an interesting mechanic. On top of that, RNG events like this usually don't have strictly better outcomes. Maybe the melee creeps didn't spawn in the lane you were pushing, they will still get in the way of your opponent's units in other lanes to potentially stall out. Maybe your hero died on turn 1 before you could do anything, well now they'll come back on turn 3 and allow you to swing the game back. Though there are a few examples of badly implemented RNG, most of the cards have a lower power level on average which disincentivizes players from using them in competitive decks. (One of the only powerful RNG cards got changed to no longer be random!)

Not only does the game have a lot more depth and meaningful decisions, but the gamemodes do too. Coming from someone who avoids arena completely, the Hearthstone alternative to deck drafting, Artifact draft actually interests me and takes A LOT more skill. Not just from the actual gameplay, but how the drafting/deck-building system itself works is endlessly more skillful. Essentially you pick two cards at a time from 5 twenty card ""packs"" that other players will then pick from the remaining cards. There is no wait or anything, there is just a pool of x card packs and you get one at random. This system means you have way more cards to pick from and you will draft excess cards that you then use to make your deck of at least 40 cards. (15 hero 'signature' cards and 25+ main deck) Obviously this lets you to avoid using unwanted cards and allows you to actually use deckbuilding skills instead of just hoping to not draw the trash cards you inevitably get stuck with in Hearthstone. The fact that drafting is cards of any color as opposed to just getting cards from the hero you pick beforehand as in Hearthstone also alliviated some balance issues where certain classes are just going to be better than others. In Artifact, packs you pick from come from other players so no matter what end up being strong, it will sort of balance itself because 'weaker' colors will be more plentiful in packs while more popular will be more scarce as other players will snatch all their stronger cards. 

Overall I think the strengths of Artifact greatly exceed the price of the game. Unless you are dedicated to not spending a single cent on a card game, Artifact is a much better option than Hearthstone for any kind of player. It's so nice to be able to just build any obscure deck you want. Because cards are sold on the market, their price is almost solely determined by how competitively viable they are, so meme tier fun decks are going to cost almost nothing. No more worrying about screwing myself over because I want to craft an off meta deck in Heathstone. This game is way more enjoyable for that aspect alone.",1546504445,1555006282,True,10,1,0.564332067966461182,0,True,False,False

If you want to wait for the retooling, that's ok, and if you didn't find it to your taste, that's ok too, but I feel a lot of what is great about CCG's can be found in Artifact, and if you like CCG's and Dota, you might really want to cancel the auto-attack and not last hit just yet :)

Artifact is great in many, many ways!  I was greatly saddened by the decline, and (perhaps partially unfounded) negativity of many people (just like the real Dota community!). It has great game-play, lots of strategy, and most of my matches have been very very close, and always engaging. I also play Dota, so I LOVED all of the parallels between the two games.... 5 heroes. 3 lanes, items equipment, buffs, it all felt like a fantastic little version of a Dota match in card form (without the required crazy good reaction time)! I felt a little like the game was made for me specifically. I was even pretty excited about the market.... I checked prices for 2 months daily and tracked values and bought and sold cards like it was a secondary mini-game. I was quite prepared for the next expansion (ready to profit!), and I still can't wait for all of the Dota heroes to get added in multiple and various re-iterations. Valve put MANY free modes in the game, and although I eventually got a complete collection over time, I actually play the free Phantom Draft %90 of the time. It is fun and free, what's not to like? There are nice friend features, tournaments, and many other little things that were well done. I look forward to whatever they do with it from here.

As to the financial cost, I played Magic the Gathering for years, and I've played Hearthstone for years as well, sinking more than reasonable amounts of money into both of those games than I ever intended. Rng card packs, Three $70 expansions a year, or grind, grind, grind, dailies, grind, grind, grind, dailies etc etc. At the time of writing this, it cost less than $10 to get all of the Black cards in existence, and less or around $20 for any other colour. The market took a bit to settle, but friends and free modes were there till they did. I know several friends who made money on this system. I would hope that some kind of regional version of the game could get put out though....

I was a hater... Then I played for two days straight, spent an extra 10 dollars, got an Axe and a few other rares, sold them for about $25, got a decent deck together and am now winning a little more than half of my games. 

What makes it really special are all the game modes - tons of them. Lot's of casual and offline options. 

Playing against the AI in offline mode was incredible for helping me get a good deck together that won me a few tickets and a card pack in the expert mode. 

Just keep playing the AI with different deck configurations; after winning a few matches in a row, take it into casual play; after winning there a few times, try a guantlet.

As of writing only 19 cards cost more then a dollar, the median cost of a card is .10$ and every common is going to be perma .05$

considering that decks are in actaully made out of 39 cards(5 heros, 25 non-hero main deck, 9 items) , of which you realisticly grab 1 chase rare hero card and then maybe 9 chase cards, you looking at meta decks being under 100$ while buget decks are going to be 10$, and the price is going to keep droping, ax will not be over 10 dollars forever.

Given that infite draft players must sell cards, give them some time and all the uncommons will reach the same .05 cost as commons currently have and the few chase rares will likely end up costing dollars.

I rember dropping 100$ on hearth stone to try to get the cards for a mill deck and coming up short or watching scrolls grind economy die its slow death, the open economy rewards non-netdeck players with the highest rarity tier costs 2$ for each one compared to heathsones 50$, give the market some time, the inflated prices will drop as netdecks swap around, the to-be infite players finish thier collection and start selling rares blindly.

edit//

I still love this game, ax is now at 3 dollars; it costs 5 dollars to biuld the deck I play; heros should have been free, full stop, its the most important card in any deck, and generally you need 3 or so very specific hero combos to make a gimik deck work, it wasn't ax, the economy would have been just as dead if not more so if it was zues, or solra who was the chase rare.

Our plan was to immediately dive into our normal strategy of shipping a series of updates driven by the dialogue community members were having with each other and with us.

Obviously, things didn't turn out how we hoped. Artifact represents the largest discrepancy between our expectations for how one of our games would be received and the actual outcome. But we don't think that players misunderstand our game, or that they're playing it wrong. Artifact now represents an opportunity for us to improve our craft and use that knowledge to build better games.

Since launch, we've been looking carefully at how players interact with the game as well as gathering feedback. It has become clear that there are deep-rooted issues with the game and that our original update strategy of releasing new features and cards would be insufficient to address them. Instead, we believe the correct course of action is to take larger steps, to re-examine the decisions we've made along the way regarding game design, the economy, the social experience of playing, and more.

So what does this mean?

[strike] Mostly players gave this game a ""Not reccomended"" rating did not understand a card game's business model. I played card games from Pokemon to Hearthstone and other card games, and yes it does cost TONS of dollars to play with full satisfaction (full collections of cards). TBH, Artifact is expensive to be played with full experiences, it dug a hole in my wallet, and i'm happy with it. And so does other card games i played like Hearthstone, dugged holes in my wallet since beta, now still playing with almost full collection (I'm broke now :( ). 

Oh yeah, phantom draft, for free, is the best place for me to play on. Learn to draft a deck and play for free. To those who love this game, but doesnt wanna spend money on constructed, this is the place for you. No one in that mode has the best drafted deck and its all based on luck again lul. Its fun! 

Gameplay: I love the mechanics and tactics of this game, it causes brainstorming just like other card games too. playing 3 boards is what makes this card game different from others. But the RNG in this game is strong especially deployment section where you pray hard that your creeps blocking the enemies from hitting your tower and your hero blocking your opponent's hero and minions from attacking. Additionally, 40 cards per deck, causes you to pray even more harder for your next draw cuz most games i played ends early (Thanks aggro). Again, I hope this game in the future does not promote mostly on Aggro decks, but more on controls. Aggro is antifun:(

Summary: It is expensive to those who have never experienced card games. Most negative reviews are those Dota players who never spent money on it (cosmetics for example) or single player fanbois. But once you understand how card game business model works, you'll feel appreciated about how Valve handle their tactics of selling and letting community to sell their cards. Artifact is fun and RNG based game, just like Hearthstone and other card games, RNG is king.
Will i spend more money on it, absolutely. Do i support this game to be free to play, not yet, but paying 20USD for this game is too much for launch of it, but do note u get packs and tickets for you to start on. If they didnt include those freebies in it, It would be a let down for all of us. 7.5/10

There has been no updates for a while to confirm the game would truly be ""for the long haul""

Player base is gone and recently been seeing possible bots in the game.

Rating system is just a complete piece of crap there is no indicator on how the rating is calculated, nor does it really affect who you are paired against.

In current form I would say Artifact seems dead and abandoned.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently Artifact offers a very deep and competitive tcg experience.
The tournament scene is well up and running and the game is highly enjoyable.

A lot of players are crying about p2w aspects. Sure, you are the underdog if you play constructed format with a very limited card pool. But at least for me, the real challenge and fun is in the draft mode. In draft there is no advantage for people spending money on the game.

Some people have been also crying about balance and rng in the game. Cards such as Axe has been the target of constant ""op!"" cries from the community. However, recent pro tournament 1st place deck didn't even use Axe, nor red for that matter. We even saw a mono black deck in the tournament. The rng in Artifact is a bit higher than in other tcg. That said, you have dozens of cards to manipulate that rng in your favour. It's more of a deck building aspect whether you like more rng or not.

Many have also brought up the aspect of not earning cards trough playing. In current form it would destroy the entire economy as all cards are viable for steam market, which would result in no boosters sold anymore. So any type of market / trading would be immedietly off the table if earning cards via grinding (like bot grinding) would be possible. However, more skilled players are able to earn cards without spending money. As an example I started on official release day and have not bought a single ticket for phantom drafts. Yet I have gotten dozens of boosters for free via rewards. The recycling system implemented (20 cards = 1 ticket) makes sure that you can sustain tickets as long as you play better than your average joes.

The game also includes free game modes for those who still need / should train before entering the expert leagues. This can rightfully feel wrong as there is no experience system or anything to be achieved other than better understanding of the game. This part here is imho the biggest issue Artifact currently faces. We need to be able to progress in some way outside of free cards to keep interest.

Currently Artifact is only for those die hard tcg fans that love a highly competitive scene. Artifact is truly missing the feel of progress and achievement for casual players.",1544186062,1553002371,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

As a ""mid tier"" player, it's just boring either way, and i can relate to the frustration that new players must have - that's the reason why this game is literally dead and has no real hope to start a comeback.

I've played a couple rounds with friends smashing the starter decks together, a few casual drafts and a keeper draft. That put me at the ~9 hour mark and so far, so good. I've really been enjoying myself. Been quite some time since a new CCGs mechanical systems have given me stiff nips. I think the last two that have made me sit up and take notice would be Shadowfist and Middle Earth: The Wizards back in 1995. Now, I am definetly still in the honeymoon phase; whether this one will be as deep and maintain the same long lasting interest as the former two I mentioned (I still play 'em) remains to be seen and too early for me to objectively tell. I have no issues with the monitization model because it comes the closest to the real world model while allowing me to break the rules in one signifigant regard. I see a card I want for a deck I buy it. That's it. I don't want to churn daily quests or grind games for hours to get my cards ""for free."" I already have a job. I sold a rare from my keeper draft for ~$5 and bought a couple dozen cards to modify my starter decks with for a about nickle to a dime, each. Other games where you bust up your cards into cookie dust or fairy sprinkles or whatever the return rate is booty sweat. Finally, I can play phantom drafts (no retention of drafted cards) for _free_. I'm about to make my $20 bucks sit up and dance for me in a way that cannot be equalled by nearly all competitors, to date. Magic: The Gathering Online has a singles market but no free draft so nuts to that.

That being said, I can recommend a purchase for aficionados of the genre and an encouragement for the curious with spare holiday dukats to step on board.

[b][i]Isn't this game like super P2W and stuff?[/i][/b]

No! There are free drafts and a premade deck format.  
It's rather pay 2 play [b]constructed mode[/b]: Tier 1 decks'
prices are ~ 50 €, which is at least very low for a CCG.



[b][i]What's a free draft and what's so special about it?[/i][/b]

In a draft you have to open a bunch of booster packs  
and build a deck from those cards to play with. This 
game mode usually costs an entry fee in other CCG, 
so it's a positive suprise to be able to open an infinite 
amount of booster packs and not having to pay for it.

I wanted to like this game, and I really wanted a good card game. This game comes up short in so many places, even after some of the ""progression"" tweaks.

The game feels a bit like it's on auto pilot and you're just along for the ride, problem is the ride is boring. I'm ok with the RNG elements but they don't come together in  a cohesive manner. 

 The art looks good to me and the UI is fine and I never had a problem running the game. 


I'm not going to talk about the business model of the game that's up to you to except or reject. I spent $20 for the game and never used any tickets because I never really saw a need to, I thought it would get to a point where I might want to use tickets but it never happened.

I recommend you go buy slay the spire over this its much better for the price if you want a card game.
I recommend Dota Auto Chess mod for Dota 2 if you want something dota-esque but not quite dota. Ultimately I wish this game was Auto Chess.

Never have i played a card game with this much depth. Artifact, when it comes to the actual game is amazing, fresh and deep as far as a skill ceiling goes.

With that said, the monetization system currently in place is not ideal in an age where F2P card games with grindable currencies reign supreme, making it a more demanding system than others. The game still warrants free modes of every mode available in it, as well as access to community driven tournaments in said modes.

Apart for this issue, an ingame chat and a ranked system to display any sort of progression would be welcome as well.

All in all, it's a far less expensive game when it comes to completing a card collection, but the fact remains that you HAVE to spend money in order to achieve this, whereas F2P card games allow you to bypass this with an ingame currency.

Gameplay is good but everything else is completely dogshit. Bad card balance. Bad monetization. Pay to pay to play. 0 progession system.

For a digital CCG, it's a very good game.

I don't really think the complaints about the economy are fair, it's not a f2p game and it mimics the real economy of CCGs. You have gamemodes you can play for free, including draft, which is in my opinion the most fun gamemode in the game. I don't really care about creating a collection, so I bought the game and sold like 8 cards for more than the game was worth, so even made money on it, but the money could be used to buy other cards. The prices of the cards will probably go down once the market saturates a bit.

As far as the game itself goes, it's amazing. The writing for the lore is pretty interesting, the audiovisuals of the game set a very deep atmosphere of the Dota world. The gameplay is very interesting for a card game, as there are different mechanics to spike up the experience - namely playing on three lanes like in Dota, making decks based on heroes, items and then one of the four colors' cards.

Don't get me wrong its a good game. Not as good as Hearthstone but has qualities that are better then Elder Scrolls Legends in some aspect.

Basic idea:
You build an army (color pie, but lore wise, seem to be from the same faction), around leaders (heroes from Dota). You attack the enemy base, and destroy the ancient, or create a break through in the enemy lines, via blowing up the towers. The resource system of cards, and a built in sideboard of sorts, dictate how each game plays out.

The bad:
WAY TOO MUCH RANDOMNESS!
No control, or consistent pattern on the random creeps placement.
No consistent attack pattern with each individual piece.
Leader pieces placement at start of the game are random, and do not reflect how they are arranged in your strategy.
On top of the inherently random nature of the decks, and the shop, results in games that feel like you have little to no control on the flow of the game.
(Suggested fix; Allow a player to pick between options on creep placement, when building his or her deck: whether that be more reinforcements to the weakest lane, or more to the strongest lane (Measured by number of leaders in a lane) or allowing for a random placement. In any of the cases, the player effectively controls for a randomness, that is fairly vexing in game.
Please make the random attacks be consistent; Allow a player to pick between options on attacks, when building his or her deck, or simply make each unit attack straight ahead. This could even be made into a mechanic where a particular unit will always attempt to attack a specific target: leaders first, non-leaders first, towers-first, ext.
Please match the placement of the leaders to the order they appear in the deck.)

The good:
Each leader has strengths and weaknesses that can be synergize into multiple strategies. For example, Axe can serve as an assassin or a bulwark for an early game push. Zeus can be used in a control strategy, or as a combo enabler.
(Nit pick, yeah some of the leaders, and their cards, seem fairly weak, and some seem to have hard to counter cards. I assume this to be assessed and worked on as time passes.)
Multiple different ways of building a workable strategy: upkeep killers, and combo killing are some of my favorites.
The price point for the cards isn't to expensive (compared to the big three card games).
The practice mode allows you to try out many of the most popular decks and play against them.

Expectations for the future:
Leaders capable of pulling from multiple armies, in order to help multi-color strategies.
Changes to the shop or the economy system; keeps the game interesting if something like early game leader kills net more gold over late game leader kills or vica versa.
New unit types
Power creep

In summery, Artifact reminds me more of a Warhammer tabletop game over an actual card game; it simply needs to remove some of the excessive randomness.

Please give it a try, I have never played DOTA, I'm just a card game enthusiast, and I thoroughly enjoy the depth of the game and the lane system.  When you buy the game, they give you $20+ worth of drafting supplies, which really killed the initial influx of players this game could have had.  This game could have been offered free, with the option to buy a Deluxe version with drafting supplies for $20.  Also, the game is kinda difficult to  watch on Twitch or YouTube, especially if you don't know how to play the game.  Too much information is 'hidden' on the cards (you have to clock or hover over them to see stat changes) for this to be a viewer friendly game.

That being said:

VALVE: Please make the game free to keep it alive.

POTENTIAL BUYERS: Please give the game a try.  It's really good.

PROS:
+ You can play casual draft for free. This allows you to build a deck with any cards available in the game. So no, you don't need to whip out the credit card unless you want to play constructed competitively. 
+ No grinding required. There's no need to use luck, or lack thereof. If you really want the best hero cards for competitive play you can buy them outright on the market. 
+ Amazing music, visuals, and voice lines. Great lore!
+ Allows for your own social tournaments and challenging your friends. 
+ In-game spectator mode and replays. Puts other TCGs to shame.
+ Varying bot difficulty, and can play with any card/deck you want them to have.
+ You can try out pre-made decks from the Call to Arms cards.
+ Great minds working on the game. Good updates so far and they listen to feedback where necessary. After watching the tournament, a lot of twitch streams and playing for a few hours I can say that this is the best TCG I've played in a long while, the gameplay is very refreshing.
 
CONS:
- Highly addicting. The game is complex and a lot of fun, make sure to stay hydrated and take breaks.
- Very little marketing, and lack of PR. This goes for any Valve game.
- The only way to obtain free packs is behind a ticket paywall or buying card packs. I suggest a weekly free ticket or pack for playing a draft, or competing in casual tournaments so it can't be grinded. This rewards players for coming back to the game at least once a week.
- Game gets stale after a certain point. Even with the ladder, there's no ""real"" reason to play other than to play a trading card game. I feel like something is missing.",1543540359,1551997557,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, this is my second attempt at writing a review for this title. Let me start by praising the work they've accomplished so far with it. It has SO MUCH potential it's not even funny.. It's a shame to sit here and write that, although fun when rng is on your side, the game is horrifyingly frustrating. Some call it complex and it is to some degree, but it's not exactly that complicated to play Phantom Assassin or Brisetleback on the flop and win the entire lane cause she/he 1 shots 90% of the cast. And there's a few instances of things happening like this.. Ogre Magi and multi cast, bounty hunter and jinada. I just find mechanics like this utterly game breaking and defeating although I'm sure one of you will say ""Git gud!""

I bought into Artifact at launch before the Cheating Death fixes and first big CtA update. Looking back in retorspect It was nothing on the scale of what was to come to the forefront from those nerfs. We have Mono Blue and Red/Green ramp now over running the game and sapping any kind of enjoyment ""I"" (Me; personally) was having with the game. I find it so fricking hard to come back or win a game against either of these decks/heroes. So whether  I'm using Green/Black (Death and Taxes, I'm looking at you.. Essentially the worst combo of colors in the game so far. They really need to redo this deck. It's utter garbage compared to the other pre mades) or any other setup I've used unless I take a PA, gank and all the other seemingly imbalanced, underhanded and overpowered cards at our disposal. I just feel like the only way to get a win is to cheese your opponent (RN'CHEEZUS'). Probably why people say when they get a win it feels like an empty one. It's easily done too with blues constant wave clear which is hard af to outplay (Eclipse, Mystic Flare, Thundergods Wrath, 3 Ignites, Conflag, Thunderstorm... Am I missing something? Oh yeah, ANNIHILATE) This is just my opinion though and you might find it easier or more enjoyable.Another thing I didn't like was the adjustments to items. I suppose it was to try and level the playing field and help those what have bad flops back into the game.. This is counter intuitive. If you lose the flop (guarantee if your luck is as bad as mine thats at least %60 of the time) then your opponent is gonna snow ball and item spam you to death. Why would you adjust the item prices like that? If anything they should be more expensive and not cheaper as to make them more of a luxury rather than getting big items for a fraction of your gold reserves. They actually nailed the coffin with that last update. 

Another thing what gets me after so many weeks of playing is..... This game has literally ZERO content. No leaderborads, no achievements and no rewards (kind of sorted that one with the second update) Yes we found out through data mining and other sources that there's some development going on for a single player campaign and puzzle mode but really and truly, this should have been included already with the 20 initial fee. Not just access to draft (And remember people had to complain for them to make phantom draft free). I think this is just one of the main reasons they took a big hit in the player base. The game feels like its still in alpha/beta. 

Still a hell of a long way to go in the sense of balancing the cards and colours  and now items!!!!  Like I said, green/black is technically the worst combo at the moment, I feel. In a few months (Or years at this rate) I'd love to delete my review again and tell you how they've implemented a lot of mechanics which don't feel like day light robbery to play against and how amazing the game is to play after so many modes get added. For now though you're probably better keeping your eyes open for the updates and take it from there. 

PS: Just like to say... Shame on the people involved in the beta for this game.

- Reggie Fils-Aime  
These words from Reggie ring true here. From legendary game designer Richard Garfield, Ph.D, comes Artifact. Another card game. I'm a *huuuuuuge* Magic: The Gathering fan, so I had some high hopes for this game. The monetization scheme really scared me, but unlimited ""phantom drafts"" seemed fun. Boy was I wrong. This game seems fun, but it's bogged down by a complicated ruleset and just waaaay too much randomness. Minion / hero placement really matters in this game. That alone isn't bad. But what frustrates me is that basic creeps are distributed to lanes randomly. Ok, whatever. Not too bad. But the randomness gets measurably worse when each minion determines its target randomly. I can count the times I've lost because of this. There are minions that can subvert this, but they're few and far between. The design in this game is stellar, and I don't think I'm mincing words when I say that. The game is certainly well-designed, but it's too complex for it's own good. There's just too much happening all the time. The game has charm, but when every game feels like a slow crawl, the charm wears off. Overall, the game has its merits, but with a dwindling playerbase, complicated rules, and slow gameplay, I'm going to say this isn't a fun game on the whole. It has it's moments, but those moments don't come often. The game isn't fun; so I have to ask: why bother?",1551051537,1551051537,False,7,0,0.526438415050506592,0,True,False,False

Draft rng - You don't need skill to draft 2+ Luna or 2+ Ogre Magi or to get a bunch of good cards.

Creep rng - 3 lanes and you get 2 creep randomly every turn

Hero rng - You have a chance that your hero gets killed by one of the enemy hero, it's 50-50 
with Bounty Hunter tho, because sometimes he has 11 attack, sometimes 7.

Hero/Creep rng - First round is absolutely random, but later at least you can choose the lane for your heroes, but the placement in lane is also random

Arrow rng - Left/Forward/Right - 25%/50%/25%. Your heroes and creeps are randomly attacking an enemy in one of these directions. If you never lost a game because of this, then you just haven't played enough.

Item shop rng - You get 3 item offers. The left one is totally random from all the items the game has, except basic consumables. The mid one is random from your items. The right one is random consumable.

Then there is a bunch more rng - rng spells, rng summonings, cards like intimidation that has 50% chance to win or lose the game for you in a lot of end game situation and i guess i am forgetting and i didn't mention the basic card game rngs.

This game though... It eats your attention. It demands you respond to the move of your opponent by making you each play one card after the other. It requires you to look turns ahead, not only on the board but at who has initiative.

There's some small balance issues but, for the most part, you can dodge those crazy strong units by moving into other lanes. There's some obnoxious spells, but other than cheating death, none of them have made me want to rip my hair out. Whenever I lose, it's close. Whenever I win, it feels earned.

I haven't been this sucked into a strategy game since I started Blood Bowl four years ago. Now, I'm playing Artifact with my buddy who got me into Blood Bowl and we're once again talking strats and trash talking over discord.

I hope this game takes off. The monetization model sucks if you're not willing to spend. I've dropped $20 after the purchase into the game and have not only a few decent decks but 17 hours under my belt. That's not a terrible deal and I have a feeling it'll be another 40 hours until I want to drop another few dollars on that next dope card or deck.

I hope they add some kind of reward system, only because I want the population to stay high and I want the game to thrive. The gameplay is so damn good, it certainly deserves that.

Valve is smart. I believe they'll come around. Even if you can just earn event tickets or something.

Edit: I have gotten my money's worth. I love this game. I will be turning this review to a negative until it is revived. It's dead. Don't purchase it unless you are just DYING to try the gameplay.

Original, positive review can be accessed below. I am going keep the new review brief.
I stand by what I said in the original review. I still believe that the monetisation is completely fair and this is not why I change my review. No, the reason behind it is RNG.

I enjoy the game when it flows well and they game is decided based on who played better, but too often the game is decided by RNG. And it's not that the game has a too much RNG, but the RNG that is there, has too much impact. You can play an entire game well and then lose because in the crucial moment 2 of your heroes decided to attack a creep and the creep ends up tanking 30+damage. 

Sure you can work around RNG and try to prevent RNG, but there is a key difference between this other card games, in a lot of other card games, you choose to add RNG to your games by playing RNG cards and then you have to deal with the RNG, but it was your choice. In this game, every single turn on every single lanes the targets are chosen randomly and you just have to deal with it. It feels like you have to fight against RNG every single match, which in my opinion is very bad, hence the change of the negative review.


Original review:
The game is amazing and negative reviews are undeserved, please do your research before you listen to all the negative reviews.

I am just posting a positive review to do my part in countering all the negative reviews from people who don't understand the difference between a CCG and a TCG.

For those who don't here it is:
CCG - Collectible card game.
TCG - Trading card game.

The difference is that in CCG you collect card, but in TCG you collect and trade cards.

The reason all other card game has a way for you to get cards for free like daily quests and other stuff is because they are all CCGs. That's why F2P CCGs can give you a legendary for free when you start the game for the first time or during an event, because cards are only in your collection and there is no way to just give it to a friend who wanted that legendary card. 

TCG on the other hand has a way for players to exchange cards between themselves. Which means that if you are missing a rare card that you want to put in you deck you can just go to the market place and buy it instead of having to spend money opening packs and hoping to get it. If you were given cards for free there would be no reason buy any cards because they wouldn't have the same value. The reason rare cards cost as much as they do is because you only have chance to get them from a pack. Now imagine if everyone who logged in got a random rare card. Their value would be 0 because people get them for free. Why would you pay for the card that you can get for free from a login, event or a daily quest? If there was a way to get cards for free the economy wouldn’t work because after some time market would be overflowing with rare cards that people didn't pay for.

I do have to say that there is 1 reason that I might change my recommendation in the future. And that's player to player trading. While I do believe that Artifact's monetization model is completely fair, their trading model is greedy. Cards can only be sold on the market and can't be traded between players. This means that you can't give cards to your friends for free, you must go through market. When you do go through market, Valve gets a % of every transaction. This is the greedy part of the game, not the fact that you must buy pack to get cards, that's just standard TCG stuff, no not being able to trade with people directly and having to go through a market is the ""greedy"" part. The reason for it of course is that it's how Valve are going to make the most money on the game and allowing for directly player to player trading would let people bypass the market and just create forums where they can just trade cards for other cards and not give Valve any more money. Because of this I don't think they will ever change how trading works.

To end on a positive note though Phantom draft that lets you draft for free (even if you don't get any cards) is an amazing addition to the game that I believe they didn't have to do and for me personally, I could sell all the cards I got from the 10 pack that you get when you buy the game and just play phantom draft and be happy with that. In case you don't know how the phantom drafting works, you essentially get to open packs, but you don't add cards to your collection. Instead you use cards from those packs to build a deck and play with it. After 2 losses or 5 wins (whichever comes first) you can start a new draft. So, you get to play with all the cards in that you get in those packs, you just don't get to keep them.

If you got this far into this recommendation, thank you for reading.",1543569465,1550955691,False,0,0,0.482195824384689331,0,True,False,False

This is an excellent game if you're willing to take the time to learn it. There is a lot of complexity involved, and the randomness on top of that has obviously made this game impenetrable to 70+% of people. That's pretty clear. For the same reason, not everyone enjoys chess - at least not enough for most people to make a hobby out of it. But that doesn't mean there's anything bad about the game of chess. I've enjoyed playing a lot of chess, and it's quite rewarding to learn its underlying elements and principles. For me, the principles of chess could be applied to real life.
 
In the same vein, Artifact is a fun game to try master. With all the complexity, there are many potential strategies to follow. And the game's artwork, music, and spammable voice-lines for each hero are definitely a treat.

But the randomness can feel unforgiving. Some losses can feel utterly impossible to have defeated no matter what -- but at the end of the game, there is almost always a decision or strategy that could have been improved, playing a hero to a different lane, or playing a card early instead of saving it (or vice versa). It takes a certain personality type to think about games this way, to reflect, evaluate, and persist to improve. For me, Artifact has been very fun in this regard.

I've mostly enjoyed playing the featured event (Call to Arms), because each deck is known and set, so it's easier to learn each of their strategies. Random mode has been my go-to, and it's honestly fun to identify the elements that make up a ""solution"" for each battle.

It cost $20 but I never spent anything more during my 125h of play.
There is a free draft mode allowing you to have really fun games with a gauntlet system.

Draft ===
=======
Even with these advantages, Artifact is still fundamentally broken as a strategy game in draft mode.
The impact of some end game cards is such that no victory is guaranteed until the very end.
It could be possible to take these cards into account in constructed mode while planning your next moves, but the draft really is just a huge lottery since those card are often rare and seldom picked.
Strategy is still important, but all your efforts to carefully plan a 3 turns move can be put instantly to the trash in draft mode.
This draft mode is full of good intentions and it did gave me 125h of play before realizing this rabbit hole is full of anger and regret further down.

Constructed ===
=============
Let' talk about constructed now. This game has a broken constructed mode with a cancerous meta that crystalized very fast around too few decks, and I found myself even hating to watch constructed game streams because of how forced all of this seemed. 
However, the strategy aspect of constructed is really deep and even magic pales in comparison of the complexity.
To me that is not enough to make me go into constructed and spend money on packs.

Other aspects ===
==============
It is to be noted that Valve has its own way of communicating with us gamers.
No promises are ever made and their overall strategy has always been cryptic, either turning out to be pure genius or seemingly retarded.
It has not been any different with Artifact regarding their view of Player Progression. No XP system or level was present at first, and they quickly implemented one that was basically a hollow incentive to make us give the game a second chance.
Some booster and avatars can be won at the first levels, then nothing.
The ranked matchmaking system is just based on the number of wins of the season and is so broken it became impossible for me to win a single gauntlet after a few runs.

In conclusion, this game has very solid foundations but fails on so many aspects that its faults can't be overlooked.

I still play from time to time but it is just to get frustrated after having done my best.

**In it's current state I couldn't recommend it, maybe after some time passes and they start balancing the game, fix the market, and the exclusive beta experience matters less things will change enough to make it worth the buy-in cost.**

After so much time w/o the changes necessary to make the game approchable and enjoyable for most of the people interested in it (50k 2 moths ago), the game has now become an exclusive game for: the people that dropped thousands of hours in it during the closed and embargoed beta and now probably feel like it would be a waste to quit considering the time spent, and the very few people that actually enjoyed it in it's state and will probably stick with it until it's dead for good (3k peak-1.5k lowest now and still going down daily).

Damn shame to see Valve lose so much goodwill for less than 20$ with this.

Good luck on that, because you will face opponents 20, 30 levels higher than you with way better cards. You get nearly no XP after each match (20 to 50) when you need 1000 or more to level up in the beggining.

Matches can last for more than half an hour, depending on the situation, and the way that cards are deployed on the battlefield and attack adjacent cards are completely random! Even if you play right against opponents with cards way better than you, make no mistakes and understand the mechanics of the game, you still need to be lucky!!

This game should be free to play, and then ppl could decide if they spend money or not with cards. Totally deserved my review so that no one else wastes more money on this piece of unbalanced garbage!",1550263508,1550263508,False,29,0,0.574309170246124268,0,True,False,False

The weaknesses of Hearthstone (strategically simple, very few decisions that aren't obviously the best decision) are not here: the game is strategically complex and I have seen much 'stronger' decks get decimated but superior playing tactics. MTGs weaknesses are also not here: turns never feel laborious or labyrinthine: you simply pass control back and forth.

There are lots of other pros:

-The card set design is simple, but even with a release lacking cool mechanics, this game is still incredibly interesting (this also means that there is a huge amount of room to grow)
-The UI is slick and polished
-Games don't feel too short or too long
-Games tend to be very close, and even when you have a superior draft deck (for instance) you still have a couple critical moments where if you make the wrong decision you can lose - this keeps you on your toes
-You dont need the best cards to win! You need to be a better player...

And a few cons:

-Some of the RNG can be incredibly punishing. It definitely evens out, and usually even over the course of a single match but occasionally you feel like you are WAY behind the 8 ball just by the way the heros are deployed.
-A bit pricey. For a guy who came from MTG with a collection of thousands of cards, I feel like a very modest investment can go a long way in the game

Biggest negative is monetization. I have magic cards from 20 years ago that still hold value or I have gone up significantly. I can't do that in this game, let alone it being a digital game and if the servers die then what? So many mistakes were made in this game. 

It was clear than releasing this game with alpha level features but with a full featured monetization system what their intentions were. Really unfortunate, may this be a lesson to all.

- Buying items for your heroes during the match.
- The action takes place on 3 boards instead of one, luckily this proved to be less confusing than it first sounded.
-  There are “creeps”, which unfortunately spawn randomly on “lanes” in random positions, throwing more randomness in a game that is already very RNG heavy.
   The game length for a newbie like me was about 30min, longer than other CCGs. The game has no premium cards which would be usually animated versions of the standard ones.
   The game has lots of QoL improvements like you can see your opponents’ deck after the game, each deck has an identifier so you can quickly load/export decks, and the game lets you easily buy the cards that you are missing. You can freely sell and buy cards on the Steam marketplace but the fees for transactions are a bit too high.
   I don’t feel like the game has a purpose even though it has support for tournaments. The progression system was recently implemented and it’s very unimpressive. At the moment the player base is pretty thin.
   Artifact is not a bad game, it’s just pointless.

There are combo, control and aggro decks and because of the systems in place it allows for more unique card designs to come. This, in my opinion, is the biggest plus; It tries to alleviate the biggest weaknesses in MTG and sets a ground for a freedom of choice which only a select few of (strategy) card game have.",1548606879,1549512896,True,4,0,0.480171233415603638,0,True,False,False

It's missing a few things I expected like chat or communication of some kind, but I believe it will get there.  Game is extremely fun and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it and believe I will continue to do so after future expansions.  There is no progression system which seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way.  Personally I would rather spend money to purchase the cards/decks I want to play; when the alternative is spending loads of time grinding for a slight chance of getting the card I want, but apparently that's abnormal.  I would highly recommend this to any real world TCG players.  Hearthstone loyalists...not so much.  (Also there was plenty of news that there would be no earning cards in game I don't know why it's such a surprise).

**UPDATE**
Valve has since decided to cater to those that didn't enjoy anything about the game in the first place.  Adding grinding for cards and greatly reducing the amount of time you have to make decisions are the 2 that bother me the most.  I know I'm alone on the time thing but this is a complex game and I was not taking that long but now a forced surrender because no kind of timer resets after my turn....really?  I was really excited to have an online card game that I can buy the cards, not buy a chance to get the card that I want.  They will likely be moving it to a f2p model and I (as a person with more money than time) am very sad about that.

Damn that's harsh... But then noticed I could sell all my duplicates. I listed them on the market and they sold instantly buffing my account over £4, I then could buy a couple of decks I fancied and still have some cash left.

Despite those elements, the core gameplay and the extras gradually added after the chaotic release show that Valve is going in the right direction (even if it is kinda slowly - Valve Time).

Right now, if you are bad at card games like me but enjoy them, you can play free tourneys with more options with last patches (Chaos Blitz), free drafts and so on. Without paying, you have access to large sections of the game.

I really enjoy the 3 lanes 5v5 hero based gameplay, at first i thought a lot of heroes were rather weak or useless but iv come to see that almost all have there place in decks, and that while there may be meta defining decks as in all such games, the difference between the top tier and the 'jank' beneath is very close, iv beaten decks with all those Axe or Drow or Kanna decks with fun decks using 4 blacks and Rix, iv had success with mono red stall decks trying to bulk up towers till they have 5 armour each. there's so much creativity and fun to be found in the deck builder and while some may find the upfront cost a barrier, if you've ever played any online CCG or paper card game, i don't understand how 20 is such a barrier, it comes with a free drafting mode, which itself is unlimited free play. you can play with bots using all cards, and in all honesty as someone who has spent money 3 times a year on pre-purchasing hearthstone expansions, i have almost a full collection of cards i want on artifact without having to spend nearly as much, and after my purchase they introduced a leveling system that includes free packs. so i say ignore the bad reviews on cost or lack of players, and just play the game for yourself, its a great and creative expression of the card game genre.",1549109862,1549109862,True,6,0,0.477503567934036255,0,True,False,False

It really feels like the Dota 2 of card games. Games are too long for no reason and you often feel like you are not in control and losing because things you couldn't change yourself. I stand by the fact that this is a well tought game. It works, it's playable but it's just not enjoyable to me.

[strike]In the latest patch, they added progression and rewards, seasonal skill ranks and balance changes. Game is officially good now. Thanks Valve![/strike]
--------------------------
[strike]So Artifact is a good game. I don't think it's a surprise for anybody, and I think we all know that's not the controversial part.

The monetisation is the controversial part.
0 free to play content, everything has to be bought, a lot like any physical card game. Now, it's not all bad. Being able to straight up buy the deck you want without grinding is a good thing. Reclying is a good well integrated feature. But it comes with a couple of bad consequences.

[list]
    [*]It's very unlikely that they will balance or ban cards if they become a problem because it would screw the peoples who bought those on the market. I've always said the biggest strenght of digital card games is that they can rebalance the cards at will. It has little consequence on players since they can recycle their cards (some games like Eternal even refund full value when they nerf a card) and they don't have to ban a card or wait months or years for the set to rotate out. Artifact is probably locked out of this option so problematic cards are here to stay. They might do it, but it's very unlikely and I wouldn't assume they will.
    [*]Expert mode feels very bad to play if you are not a very good player. Expert mode has constructed or draft, you need to pay to start a run, play untill you get 5 wins or 2 loses and get rewards if you scored at least 3 wins. After the very first day of release, I only played against very good players with amazing drafts or T1 constructed deck. I don't mind playing for money from time to time but if it's always open like this, only top players are gonna be there and it's just not worth to do. I'd be curious to see temporary events with tickets with incentives for a lot of players to join in.
    [*]The alternative is Casual play. Basically, play for free but without any rewards. You can either play single games or gauntlets. So... it's gool just to play the game but it feels kind of pointless to play. Your options are pretty much play for money or play for fun. MMR is invisible, no ranked ladder or anything.
[/list]

I'm looking forward to see how they handle this game because it's very good and a lot of it is done right like free Phantom Drafts and Social Tournaments. But (likely)no balance in fear of screwing the market, betting against top tier players and no ladder is just too much. I hope this game improves and I'll be sure to check back this review if it does.[/strike]",1543894199,1549058973,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Let's start with good things first:

+Graphics are good for a card game. (Card animation effects, spell cards, trap cards, and attack moves).

+Gameplay idea that you have to fight on three lanes just like in the real Dota2.  Take down towers and go for ancient. (but there is something I don't like about it.)

+Unlimited card decks. 

Now Bad things:

- Unfairness You can't manage your starting hand or hero placements on fields. You start the game. Enemy Kills every single hero in every single lane. In the next round, he takes 2x siege and game is lost... (Valve, please add an option where players can choose which hero going to which lane.)

- Many cards are unbalanced. (1mana cost +2 modify hero red card/-2 armor 2mana cost red card/ +2 armor mana cost 2 green card/+3 siege mana cost 3 black card.) And IF happens that enemy gets 3 copies in hand of that card at the game beginning... You're done for. Or this deck - Two Ogre Magi/ One Crystal Maiden/One Zeus and One Veno. Not fair at all. You get electrified after every single card. Plus two ogres get TWO copies of cards back to owners hand, and cm keeps refreshing tower's mana.)

-Confusing. Once we're talking about cards. There are so many cards whose effects are so similar, sometimes you forgot which was which and then you play out the wrong card just because it looked like that one card.

-Now the thing I said earlier that I liked the idea about lanes BUT why you have to take out just two towers to win? If it's Dota 2 card game, You have to kill ancient. (Wouldn't it better when you destroy enemy's tower You have to kill their ancient AND ANCIENT COULD SHARE HP ONE EVERY GAME after tower been destroyed. Example. Lane 1. Kills tower, ancient shows up creeps hit it. 80hp-12hp=68hp/Lane 2 still has tower 22hp/ Lane 3 Sven kills the tower and ancient shows up, but since creeps on lane 1 hit it now it'd have 68hp on the third lane.

-Matches are a way too long. It takes ~30-40min to finish one game. (And if another person is trolling it can get even longer. I mean if Player waits till last second of his allowed time and then plays out card or ends turn. Just to waste other people time.)

- Getting Card parks and Tickets. You can get Card packs and tickets till level 16 after that you can't get anything. To get into prise play, you need one ticket. If you don't have it, you have to pay 4.50 EUR for five tickets OR recycle 20 cards to get one ticket to get into prize play mode. Then all you have to do is win 3x to get one ticket 4x to get 1x ticket and 1x card pack and 5x to get 1x ticket and 2x card packs, which is pure luck. Don't even bother with Constructed deck prize play because there are people, who play with OP decks. If you want to win best is Phantom Draft.

-Microtransaction also ruins the game. People who love to spend money get Strongest cards of the game, build decks and destroys everyone else who is playing in a fair way. (In my opinion, this is the reason why Artifact's player count is dropping so fast. Imagine you're a new player and you get destroyed by op decks, without a chance to win, also cards which can confuse new players. VALVE What you could do about it? Look at Hearthstone for example. You can't buy cards just card packs, skins, Campaigns. Also, They have brawl game mode( just like a prize play) where you collect in-game gold by doing quests, and you can enter this mode. In there People can earn Card card dust or basic card pack.) Microtransactions are not needed. They a game PAY TO PLAY TO PAY more.

-Too much game modes. Featured mode|| Solo play=>Bot match/Bot Challenge|| Standart play=>Global Matchmaking/Constructed/Phantom Draft|| Social Play=>Open Play/Challenge a Friend/ Tournaments|| Prize Play=>Constructed/Phantom Draft/Keeper Draft
Why would you need that much? I don't get it...

-This is my individual opinion. But Can you add more animations for Imps?  It's sometimes annoying when they act all the time in the same cartoon-ish way. (I mean more animations when your tower gets destroyed. Every time one's Imp farts at the tower, and another imp is dropping his jaw.

Like I said Idea of the game is great, but they really need to fix many things. GUYS IF YOU WANT TO BUY ARTIFACT Wait for summer or winter sale otherwise it's not that worth it.",1549038875,1549038875,False,14,0,0.599650740623474121,0,True,False,False

-Initial Entry Fee. Its a card game, people should be able to try it out for free 
-No real ranking system. So far there is not real ranked mode. No reason to try and improve yourself at the game
-Limited Card Base. This is just a problem with every TCG when they start, the meta is extemely limited for constructed. 
-No fun events, MTGA always has unique game modes, different kinds of drafts, etc going on. Events get people do build unique decks and more incentive to keep enjoying the game
-No rewards for playing. This is just standard with digital card games. Have some goals for people to achieve each week. 
-Marketplace is a roller coaster. In all honestly the marketplace is great, but with the state of the game its just a mess. You can keep the marketplace in the game and still have rewards for plays with free packs and quests.

-The gameplay. This is the hot debate. Learning curve too high? Not accessible? IMO the game is amazing.

I love puzzles, brain teasers, and competitive strategy. So maybe I am biased here cause of my but the gameplay really is great to me. Every move requiring me to think and plan my strategy.

Note about monetization: I think the balance is fine in Artifact. Some game mode even use free pre-made decks.

Don't even try to do the competitive unless you're well seasoned or are masochistic. You'll get get dumped on by high level people.

""
Random initial placement of heroes and creeps
Random card draws
Random creep deployment every round
Random attack directions
Random draw of which item from your list you get to purchase during the shopping phase
Random secret shop item and consumable item during the shopping phase, different for each player.
Random card procs (Bounty Hunter, Ogre, etc)
Randomness of card actives (Chainfrost, Eclipse)

So many RNG elements really dilute the tactics of the game, and make it very frustrating.

1,787

It does highly reward strategy (as opposed to luck) and games are often very close until the end. If you don't want to buy cards the current gauntlet event is pretty fun with 6 sinergetic decks, each with its own different playstyle and combos. You can also play Casual Phantom Draft if you enjoy building a new deck every few matches without owning the cards.

While the gameplay is very good I wouldn't call this a finished game, a ton of features that Valve promised are still missing like: some sort of progression, spectating, the ability to trade cards, draft with friends, chat, replays, a profile with stats.

Monetization isn't that bad if you look at the price of most cards (which will decrease over time), but it isn't good either. I'm still not sure how Constructed would feel with suboptimal decks.

Overall it's a very good game that still requires many patches before being complete.

Edit: Volvo did an update changing their whole stance. They decided to balance cards from now on, they added some levelling progression where you can earn up to 15 free packs and tickets per season, they also added a seasonal skill rating (0-75), and pay2play is no longer called ""Expert Mode"" but ""Prize Play"", making ""Standard"" the official gamemode to play.

There is depth to most decisions in the game, with strategic decisions in deck building, and tactical choices when using the cards. I was often thinking about the wrong choice I made, or my opponent did which cost the match.
Matches can be pretty long and typically end in nail-biting moments. While being a card game, it often feels akin to a board game when playing. 

The hot topic for this game is the cost. Honestly at $20 bucks, what I got was fine for me. However, I can understand some people's perspective. I have not invested additional money in this game, and have already had a more than reasonable return-of-investment in gameplay hours. It does seem like even Casual Constructed is difficult without re-investment. But Draft Play is where it is at for me, and there are no limits to deck experimentation in that mode. I have been nothing but impressed with this game for the most part.

This game would benefit massively from just a few tweaks; IMO.
1) Offer Free-To-Play Featured play against Bots and Friends.
	a) FTP version receive 5 Pre-Event Tickets. 
	b) Pre-Event - Grants Access to Casual Draft play
	c) Upgrade is same as $20 copy.

Larger Tweaks would be:
2) Story Campaign [Emotiooneer Level - **Ref: Tynan Sylvester]
	a) Comics are great. Barely anyone but die-hards will see them.
	b) Integrate them DIRECTLY into the game. 
	c) Use SFM to create Cut-Scene Story points for Campaign.

2) Engine Scaling for Cross-Play
	a) App/Mobiles: 
		- Minimal graphics
		- Basic card design using color blind  options
		- 52 Card style symbols, minimalize siloutte design

	b) PC Build:
		- Optimized, or more scalable
		- There are too many effects, niceities. 
 		- Dated PCs cannot run a card game? This should run on a Potato...
		- Implement minimalize siloutte design option for Potato CPUs...

	c) Virtual Reality:
		- Basic Design as is in current Engine
		- Player sits at the fire/stump depicted in comics

* The game currently is  something like 4.1 GB which is smaller then Fortnite on iOS

In a typical game of artifact, it never feels like you are in control. The RNG constantly gnaws at you, a couple of wrong arrows, a coin flip for your hero to stay in lane or not get stunned. People say they it can be played around, but those are only possible through cards, and guess what, drawing them is also RNG, so you have a couple of dice rolls before you can try do anything, which feels really bad.

Its just too boring to play after the first couple of matches. Heroes feel very uninspired. Most of them are stat blocks and feel samey after a while. Spells are the same, just +1/+2 to some stats. Not many cool effects. All these make the game a calculator simulator.

On top of this, the monetization has been god-awful. With a background of Dota, they would have been the primary audience of the game. Too bad that Dota players are used to the excellent free to play model and not the pay to pay model of Artifact.

Would not recommend in its current state at all. Instead, I would suggest you to play Slay the Spire instead. For about the same price, you get a fully fleshed out single player experience that is actually fun to play.",1548551363,1548551825,False,9,0,0.524656474590301514,0,True,False,False

----old review----


The negative reaction to Artifact's monetization is overblown. For the up-front cost you get access to events and casual phantom draft, neither of which draw from your own collection. Arguably these modes are more fun than constructed which is currently plagued with samey hero-kill meta decks. 

If constructed is your style buying the exact cards you need for a deck is a lot easier and cheaper than usual — there is absolutely no need to gamble on packs, just buy exactly what you need off the market (usually for a few cents each).

The game itself is very complex and gratifying and the ability to play draft tournaments against friends for free is a big perk you don't see from contemporary online CCGs. If you're a strategy or ccg enthusiast your money will be well spent, and if DOTA 2's massive hero roster is any indication then Artifact still has a lot of content to come.",1543636926,1548544805,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay is unique and differentiates itself from Magic: The Gathering and all it's clones. The core fundamentals are very strong, though the base set is a bit bland (all base sets are).

No opening packs, recycling cards, grindy skinner box nonsense. Just buy only the cards you need directly if you want to construct a deck - most cards cost nothing. If you don't want to spend a single cent aside from the price of the game, draft is also incredibly fun and costs nothing.

The game is still fun and i'm sad to see it still dying. I've been thinking about what Valve has done wrong and one thing that really comes to mind now is their bad distribution of the Beta keys. Think about other games coming out Developers, Indie or AAA, send their beta keys or test keys out to influencers and big gaming youtubers to kick start their games success. What did Valve do? They sent their Beta keys mainly to Dota 2 personalities, which did nothing because Dota 2 is a free to play game with a large player base which might not be able to spend a lot of money on a game plus P2W items.

Valve still has time to advertise, but they probably won't.


(OLD REVIEW)
Artifact is extreamly broken, i'll start with the pros first because there are too many cons. Im still very hopfull for a super good update but Valve has been very silent so far.

Pros:
-Looks really nice
-If your opponent also does not have a lot of money to spend on cards and shit, the game can be pretty fun
-If you've played dota 2 before, you'll find the way Artifact uses abilities and ultimates pretty fun (Zeus ult and Lich ult 15/10)
-New heros (?)
-New lore

Now the cons:

-Unless you have a shit ton of cash to spend on cards (which you need to have right now), the game is not fun
-WAY too many unbalanced cards, if you don't have Axe/Legion commander, Emissary of the Quorum and Kanna, you will not win. If your opponent has them, you will lose 100%
-No way to get cards for free, there is not progression system or daily quests like Hearthstone has for you to get cards. The only way you can get cards is through Expert play (which you need a £3 ticket for) or you actually buy cards through the market
-REMOVE THE FUCKING IMPHS
-Horrible voice acting for CM
-No way to check your play history
-No way to progress, you do the same thing all the time. Theres no ranked option, expert play is just you pay for a ticket, enter a game, if you win 3 times you get something small, win 5 get some packs, or lose 2 matches and lose a £3 ticket.
-Its very obvious that Valve wants this game to be a money makign esport instead of a fun game.

Artifact is a good game that is lacking some key features. The visuals are beautiful and the soundtrack is AMAZING. It is a very well put together game with unique, strategic gameplay. However, right now there is no progression system at all. Not even page where you can view your stats. It also lacks a realistic free to play model. You can not earn cards for free unless you can consistently win at least 67% of matches in draft mode. I do like that you can buy individual cards from the steam market instead of burning through packs looking for one card.

If you're on the fence about buying this game you can pay the $20 and only play ""casual draft mode"" which is free and offers no rewards. You will get a good feel for the game and learn how all the cards work. (This is all I have done for 36 hours playtime)

Good:

I just simply can't comprehend why Valve of all people will choose to smear probably the best card game in the market with this abomination of a monetization system. Yeah sure, if you have 200 bucks just lying around it is fine. But why the fuck does valve ignore their customers in poorer countries? A lot of people in CIS are living on about 500 bucks a month.

You do get some tickets through playing but it's a finite amount, so basically you will get cards if you are able to win at least 4 games for every 2 losses, which is a pretty demanding margin. That's the only way to get new cards behind the limited amount you get for leveling up to level 15. 

On top of all this, the game is pretty RNG based, which I'm personally not against, but it's RNG that is outside of player control and that can easily screw you if you are in an evenly matched game. So in a game where you absolutely need to win to get new cards, the RNG has a little too much influence.

Artifact doesn't have too much strategy, but it has huge tactical depth. When you are building your first decks (if you enjoy that kind of thing), you have these plans that you envision in your mind of how each turn might unfold. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Stuff gets killed, split or stranded all the time. The game really tries to play around with the idea of randomness as input or output, so you have to learn how to not invest too much on one decision and how to force your opponent to commit in a way that you can take advantage of. 

You probably want to consider getting into this game if:
- you're a M:tG veteran that realized, as Garfield did decades ago, that mana screw/flood is just dumb
- you love DotA 2 and want to get more into its theme and lore 
- you're a hardcore gamer that likes to experiment with new awesome ideas

However, the game's not ready for prime time right now. The UI looks too much like somebody described it in words and a coder implemented it, too many buttons that transform into buttons, too many options that look the same although they don't share the same importance (""view opponent's deck"" is not the same as ""find next match"", which is what you want to click 99% of the time). The flow of gameplay also needs to be reconsidered, as there are too many details that break you out of a smooth experience, namely the forced zoom or status on cards not updating instantly.    

Finally, and this is probably the hardest part, gameplay itself may be banging too much against a glass ceiling that doesn't allow it to go from good to great. The problem with prioritizing tactics over strategy all the time is that wins don't feel really satisfactory and losses can be frustrating. Burning your brain to find a correct decision doesn't feel so good when that decision still gets filtered through a die roll. It may be just how the game works and you know what you're getting yourself into, but it's also why people eventually stop playing. 

Recommending Artificat essentially boils too how much you trust Valve to keep on improving what is still an early-access game. Can I garantee to you that Valve has a solid road map for Artifact 2019?

The playerbase is incredibly toxic too, probably the worst I have ever seen. On then rare ocassion I can get a win against one of these red deck using people, you are hurled abuse.

1. Silly economy. 
The description ""pay to pay to play"" pretty much sums it up. The game is not free to play, yet expects people who are interested in prize play to constantly pay for tickets... AND pay for cards on the market on top of all that? Very much feels like they're trying to have the cake and eat it, too.

2. Lack of a progression system. 
They more or less tried to fix this with a rushed leveling system... but it's far too slow and far too unrewarding to incentivize staying in this mess of a game. 

3. The game itself. 
All of the above might not be that bad, if the game was awesome. After all, abusive business models in digital CCGs are pretty much a given nowadays (unfortunately)... But it's just not that good. The gameplay is unintuitive for newcomers, full of infuriating randomness (I'll say it: much more so than even Hearthstone.) and just feels clunky overall. The three lane thing might have been a neat idea in terms of translating the DOTA feel to a card game, but it doesn't seem to bring all that much depth to the table, in my opinion. It's just a BO3 in which all matches are played simultaneously. What you're left with is a game of trying to stack more numbers on your side of the board. Boring.

4. Valve's silence. 
I know that's just the Valve way and all that, but maybe that approach just doesn't cut it anymore in 2019. Considering the magnitude of the trainwreck, some more info on what they're actually attempting here might have gone a long way in helping people trust that betterment is on the way.

There's glimmers of potential buried deep, deep in there, but it's not worth digging for.

1. Monetization - on the one hand, it's not expensive... but it's understandable that a lot of people don't like the idea of spending $20 on the game and then additionally having to spend more money on the cards.  At this point, they should drop the $20 cost and also award a ticket for getting 5 wins in the public queues.

2. Queue system - Don't get me wrong, most people will disagree with this but if I were the Dev I 100% would have done this without telling the players:  Combine all of the Draft queues together.  Since you aren't drafting against the opponents anyways, it doesn't matter whether you queued up in an Expert or public game.  Heck, those who queue up in Expert would probably end up with an advantage because they are more likely to take the battle more seriously than someone who just queued up to play a quick battle.   This change would protect against a skewed playerbase that primarily plays one game type or another.

3. Hero Cards - the biggest game design flaw that I can name is actually that Heroes only have one associated card each.  I would have made it 3 cards each.  5 heroes would then cover 45/60 cards meaning that the Heroes that you play would end up having a huge impact upon how the deck plays out.  This would increase the variance between games in Draft, as the heroes used would have more variation, and the variance in Constructed would be easier to shift simply by buffing/nerfing individual Heroes. 

I still think it's the best game design on the market, but if the Devs don't quickly make big changes the game will die.  Even saying this, I still think it is worth giving a try to, because it is different enough of an experience from traditional card games.",1548446598,1548446598,True,2,0,0.473058849573135376,0,True,False,False

That is IF you like strategy.
In heartstone you have 1 lane , taunt and what not , beat life points win game.

Artifact has 3 lanes to play cards , 2 towers to kill or 1 tower and ancient ( 120 life points) vs 2 towers of 40 hit points.

The mechanic of creating a deck with 5 heroes with their own abilties makes it different then heartstone as wel.
The strategy behind artifact is all about outplaying your opponent on the right turns, (this is simmilar to all card games ,) future turns give more mana etc etc.

And to counter the p2w part i personally find heartstone ATM more pay to win then artifact. This is because heartstone cycles cards out and when you finally have some deck for classes all of a sudden you find yourself not playing standard mode and have to buy packs or dump cards to create 1 deck or buy tons of packs.

At this point sure, the players that stayed evenually have better cards then you do because of the lvl system you get more packs untill lvl 16 , total of 15 packs plus the 10 you get when buying it .

Now knowing that your heroes all have 3 cards , your deck which usely has 40 cards , you allread set for 15 cards for free basicly. only thing  you need to do is find the missing pieces.

Because the game has a low playerbase the market you can buy cards for 1 cent. 1 fucking cent. 1 pack in heartstone is 1,50 , so do the math, you can complete alot of cards for a little bit of cash(sure) or just lvl up to lvl 16 and you most likely will have your deck finished.

I would recommend this game because the mechaniics , strategy per turn , and the grafics. Forget about heartstone.

Well sometimes you are not even outplayed, your oponent just had that much RNG going for him and played a finisher card in round two.

  Apparently Valve forgot everything they learned from TF2, CS:GO and Dota2. Making fun games fully accessible to everyone. Online games without players and communities are destined to fail.
[b]But... Nope.[/b] Valve decides to exclude 90% of the World.
[list]
[*] Pay for the game.
[*] Pay for cards to play the game, making the best cards the rarest and therefore most expensive. (when they said power level wouldn't be related to rarity)
[*] Pay to enter prize modes.
[*] Take a % cut of prize mode entry fees.
[*] Make a Trading Card Game where you can't trade. You can only buy and sell on their market, while taking a 15%+ cut. Sell a card for $0.03, get $0.01.
[*] Slowly inject cards behind a weekly time-gate to ensure the market decays, making it impossible to break even in prize modes.
[/list]

There's so many things they could charge for that don't affect gameplay. People love hats.
Why not charge for: different imps, hats for imps, different card fronts/backs, different boards, animations, dyes for cosmetics and features (river color), props like trees/flowers/dota2 heroes to decorate/place and make unique boards, chatwheels, emotes, and everything else you did in your other successful games.

[h1]The game isn't fun.[/h1]
This is supposed to be the best card game possible? They had complete design freedom to do anything they wanted on a digital only platform with a 3D game engine. And they made 3D versions of 2D cards with static art... They literally have 3D models, animations, and cosmetic systems to work with for every hero from Dota 2.

The gameplay is essentially completely reactive and plagued due to RNG at every step. It's not complex with the current card set and it's nothing like Chess where the initial state and immediate possible moves can be determined by a human skill level.

[list]
[*] Random initial placement of heroes and creeps
[*] Random card draws
[*] Random creep deployment every round
[*] Random attack directions
[*] Random draw of which item from your list you get to purchase during the shopping phase
[*] Random secret shop item and consumable item during the shopping phase, different for each player.
[*] Random card procs (Bounty Hunter, Ogre, etc)
[*] Randomness of card actives (Chainfrost, Eclipse)
[/list]

Is it possible for a better/perfect player to win 100% of the time? [b]No.[/b]

[b]The game just isn't complete.[/b] There have been a few features added since the game released, but they just aren't good enough.
[list]
[*] The chat interface is terrible. You can only chat by bringing up chat wheels. No chat log/box. Really, how hard would it be to have a chat box like your other 3 main games? Add an option to disable the chat box if you get butt-hurt by social interactions and can't handle it.
[*] No voice comms (with a disable option)
[*] Once a game is over, that's it. No replay, no stats, no game history, can't even tell who you just played against. Literally the only thing you can do once a game ends is immediately add them as a Steam Friend to chat... Any other game you've ever played is basically like it never existed.
[*] Progession system: Earn levels mainly dictated by a weekly time-gate to unlock a bunch of Icons.
[*] Ranking system: How can you tell if someone is good? You can't. There's a 1-75 rank bin it puts you in based on your hidden MMR, but it's essentially meaningless. You can't even see your opponents rank level! You can only see their Icon level which is basically just a measure of how much they play.
[*] No matchmaking leaderboards. (Featured mode win streaks leaderboard is useless)
[*] No unranked global matchmaking mode. Want to test some really bad ideas out? Play against a bot or else it's counting towards your hidden MMR.
[*] No demo mode. Want to try out cards you don't own? You can play against a bot that uses them, but you can't use them yourself.
[*] No anything profile related that you expect as standard after playing other Valve games.
[*] Basically, the only thing you can see about other people playing the game is their name and icon level in your current match only. (Or the dwindling concurrent user count online)

Because the game isn't inherently fun for the average person, there is no incentive to play. Valve's only option is to finish the game, make it more fun, more complete, and then relaunch as Free2Play without any paywalls so the other 90% of the world can try it out and create a better community. No players = no game.

Also, what about the $1,000,000 first place Artifact tournament scheduled for Q1 2019? When you consider the time it takes to announce and run qualifiers, and for players to secure their Visa's and schedule travel. There's only 2 possible options.
[olist]
[*] The 1st tournament is invite only and the invite only players are already decided, and Valve isn't telling us.
[*] The tournament is cancelled/postponed, and Valve isn't telling us.

[b]ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY.[/b]

 While the new update does address some original issues I had like ""lack of progress"" by adding Weekly bonuses and Ratings which you can earn ""free"" tickets and cards, Valve also changed the number of packs and card new players get upon purchase!

If a new player was to purchase the game now, they receive [b]5 Card Packs, 2 Event Tickets, and 2 preconstruct starter decks. [/b] Players like me who had purchase prior the the update got 10 cards packs and 5 Event tickets. New players are getting screwed in a card game that needs more new players.

The game still needs a lot of work. Games can still take long periods of time, and while RNG is inherent to every card game, the RNG in Artifact feels less fun.


[b]Artifact is a Pay-to-Play digital card game in a space where established Free-to-Play card games like Hearthstone and MTG Arena exists.[/b]

To the people who want to argue that Valve made a card game where your cards are ""worth"" something. They are not worth anything. From a economic standpoint, it's a digital card game so there is no cost in production when creating card opened in pack (unlike in physical tabletop MTG cards). As people open more packs (either given for free or purchased), more cards will exist in the Marketplace and card value will inevitably trend downward.

As anyone who has played Hearthstone, MTG, or any card game, Valve will release new expansions and create new cards that will be more powerful or offer new mechanics that trump the old base cards. Initially Valve has maintained that to get cards you need to spend money to buy packs or buy the cards from the Marketplace. With the new update that allows players to get ""free"" packs as you rank up, it hard to figure out how Valve is going to proceed. Will players be able to get free packs from the inevitable new expansion or is it going to be a Pay-to-Win model?

[b]My original criticisms of the game still stands. Games take too long and still not fun to play. [/b]

It's like playing DOTA 2 without any of the satisfaction of playing a game. I LOVE DOTA 2 despite the fact that games can take too long, the people I play with and against may be terrible human beings, and the game has a steep learning curve for a beginner. Why?

Because playing and learning to play DOTA 2 is FUN!

Artifact games take way too long (compared to other cards games), have too many random elements that are not fun to play with or against, and there is no progression system that incentivizes me to continue playing.

Winning or losing a game of Artifact is not fun.It's not necessarily a bad game, in fact, Artifact is a well produced game with high production values. But it is not fun.

- Potential expansion and exploration of DotA 2 lore.
- I'm glad there was a refund option.

Cons:
- No progression system.
- Super long games (My time was about 30-40 minutes per game).
- Boring gameplay masked to be complex. But, in reality, gameplay feels like a chore.

However lack of cards to give good variety and too many random elements hold it back.  Card games like this should be mostly games of skill.   So randomness should be kept to a minimum. 

The chance of drawing what you want will always be of chance and it's something that can't be fixed.  I also don't mind cards like Luna Eclipse being random, but creature curve is just stupid.  Having a curve could kill an enemy hero or prevent a lot of damage hitting a tower that you wanted.  Curve randomness can greatly effect the outcome of the game.

You have your offensive cards, defensive cards, resources, creatures, spells, win cons, etc. All the things you need for the card game to actually function. Many of the cards feel balanced and it does give you a wide variety of strategy. You also have a real money market which I prefer over a crafting and or pack opening only game. So there you have it, all the things you need to make a playable card game. 

However I still want to talk about what I dont like. The win conditions feel like a lot, you can win a game by destroying two towers or a core. It seems like a lot to focus on with three lanes, most players coming from other card games are used to just a straight one on one field and might have trouble adapting. Its almost like playing three games at once where you can ignore one or two players and just focus on killing another one or two. The RNG is around Heartstone level and everyone loves Hearthstone RNG so no problem there.

- Trying to copy other game designs but only enough to not cause legal issues. Magic the Gathering much...
(games that do this make you buy the game coz it seem cool. But then you think its shit because the mechanic isnt really ther)

- Lack of cards
Seriously The Original 150 pokemon card game has more cards than this game.
One of the main reasons people play card games is the joy of getting new cards to use in cool decks.
But not this game.

- Pay then PAY even more.
So not only is there almost not careds, getting them is an extreme grind unless you par for them.
And since most people use the same OP card combos, you better expect to pay 50% of the original game price just for one of those cards.

- Restricted Meta.
So most card games have counters built into each different deck type to balance them.
However you are forced to either play a mixed deck of something with blue containing some strong heros & something to cast your blue cards. Or a pure deck and hope that you can cheeze it.

This is just not fun as you cant make the fun decks you want like you can in hearthstone.
I could go on & On, but you get the point.
Valve just wants more money.

The tutorial felt good and were well done. The gameplay seems intresting. I open my 5 packs packs and think OK now I'm gonna get into this! I test out a couple of bot matches to realize that they give 0 xp of progression. Ok, well then I'll try test my newly aquired skills against som fellow players.

Well thats learning the hard way I guess. No hard feelings. But...

Losing games have rewarded me with between 8-16 xp. You need 500 to level up to level 2 which grant you the 1st reward that I have already PAID for. So I have to lose ~40 matches to get my first already PAID for pack? WTF... One match is at least 15 min.

I'm VERY disappointed. No other game with forced gameplay to unlock PAID content expect you to grind 100+ hours. That is nothing but a scam. I have to WORK for what I have already PAID for. I have better things to do. You are prompted to open the packs after the tutorial so no refund is available. That is NOT the problem. The problem is HOAX marketing.

Artifact is a beautifully artistic creation. It has Many aspects going for it. The animations are impeccable and enjoyable. The combat is really cool and enticing. However it falls short in many ways. 

The biggest downfall of artifact has to be its lack of a F2P Model. The player can't invest time in order to earn rewards like more cards etc to create a sense of progression (I do believe they may have updated this I will update the review to reflect accordingly). You have to buy your way into the market place in order to have access to cards you dont have. You can argue that the secondary market is good for the game but it only benefits valve. They keep a % of a transaction as a fee for using the marketplace. Secondary issue is the RNG of the game creates a chance to lose by flipping a coin. No one likes bad RNG and this is an example of bad RNG. It will often decide the outcome of the game at the beginning.  Having access to only 4 colors kind of sucks, and not being able to cast cards unless you control a hero of that color. I think there should of been more colors introduced into the game tbh.

It got bashed a lot, mainly due to the marketing idea of adding value to single cards and making them a legitimate source of trade. There was also a lot of hate going on because the game mechanics were ""too random"" for some.
They fixed a lot about the first issue, adding free packs (allthough very limited) and being a little less forceful about making people buy ingame ressources. They also added a very nice idea for a chat-system where you speak ""through"" your cards, which I found to be really creative and fun.
Considering the second ""issue"" about the randomness though: I completly have to disagree. The randomness is part of the Game Design, which was, from my point of view, absolutly awesome from the beginning. The games were exciting and it was very enjoyable to have some really genuine gamedesign for a trading card game, where the ""usual behaviour"" from other trading card games just isn't guaranteed to work. It is a game about weighting on which lane to shift your efforts and being able to deal with a certain amount of randomness and adjusting your tactics to it. I really got full respect for the game as it was during the launch, allthough I think mostly the marketing mechanisms and lack of unlockable packs killed it for many who are used of being fed sugar from those people trying to sell them something ...

You might wonder why I am still giving this game a negative review then. Well, it's mostly because of the direction of the latest patches. For some reason they seem to have decided it would help the game to make it faster.
Well, I can certainly see which target group this decision tries to appeal ... and I think they throw away the inherent strengths of the game with it and rather scare away those people who were happy with the initial game by doing so. Before the latest patches one match did take a while, yes, but it was some interesting and exciting time where you knew it would take a while and where you always had to be careful of any decision shifting the tides of chance against you on some lane.
But after those newest patches you are strongly stressed by short turn timers while they messed up the animations to compensate for it. Where the game previously feld wholesome and interesting ... in a relaxing yet exciting way ... those last patches mostly help it lose its own identity.
And yes, thats why ~now~ I too would not recommend it anymore, at least in the current state. I hoped for them to make some good changes and were always curious about how this game evolves, and now it just seems to be a shizophrenic mess of an initialy deep game design as core and some rushed makeup, made for an impatient target audience, on top of it, which really betrays its previous strengths and is bitter to look at.",1547909245,1547909383,False,6,0,0.4921875,0,True,False,False

What initially looked like a reasonably clever monetisation system has completely fallen flat as Valve has failed to update pack prices to match falling market prices.

Additionally, it's come to my attention that the ""Prize Play"" modes use MMR to match players against equal opponents. This together with a 2-loss defeat, with 3 wins to break even mean that every player, no matter how good or bad, is going to lose in game currency on average. Nobody is ""going infinite"" in this game. There is nothing to aspire to.

With no reasonable motive to play Prize Play, which is clearly supposed to be the main format, there isn't a lot to be excited about. The lacklustre card design makes constructed modes unplayable and the preconstructed mode gets old pretty fast. The game has so many formats, but only the free draft mode (that almost didn't launch with the game) is remotely interesting at this point, but even that is tainted by bad card design and with only a slapdash token grindy progression system, it just feels bad.

I'm still hopeful that things will change significantly and revitalise what could have been a great game, but I can't recommend buying it at this stage.

Original review

Well, the business model is kind of predatory and at first glance, totally reprehensible, but I was surprised to find that if one looks a little deeper, it's predatory in a way that's a lot more rewarding for long term players than other card game business models.

Essentially, it seems that the people who get robbed in Artifact are the same people who get robbed in other card games: people who don't have the patience to grind a full collection and prefer to throw money at the problem. The big difference is that by participating in the game and providing opposition for these people, the grinders who might F2P in other games actually earn a large fraction of what's spent on those cards, similar to how you can earn cosmetics in DotA 2 and reliably sell them for a profit to people who don't participate in the events.

Basically, even if you immediately retire your keeper drafts and don't get any in game currency rewards (packs and draft tickets), the market value of the contents are going to be roughly equal to the cost of buying the currency. The ""going infinite"" possibility is just a bonus reward for playing the games.

So, I was extremely sceptical of the business model at first and of course it's a pity that so many people like to throw money at stuff that won't really get them anywhere and a pity to take advantage of that, but I think it's probably not actually as bad as other card games in that respect, crazy as it may sound. It seems that Valve wants people to play the game so that some of those people will spend a lot of money and is prepared to basically employ the other people to keep up their participation in the game, so that the money keeps on flowing.

The game itself is a lot of fun. My games so far have probably lasted about an hour on average, so it can be a lot more emotionally engaging than shorter session card games. Even more than Dota 2, imo. Maybe the fact I'm fighting for real Steam Dollars adds to the suspense, but possibly the length and nature of the game contribute more to making it so involving. I've found myself jumping for joy more than once when the ""WIN"" button has revealed itself at the end of a long game. It also has enough randomness that you don't feel like a failure when you lose, so in my experience so far, it offers a very positive experience on the whole.

My biggest gripe with it is actually that a lot of the card designs seem really awful and unbalanced, but at least for the moment, the rarity balance and popular metagame choices in draft mode aren't anywhere near as obnoxious as they could be, so it doesn't come up very often. I'd definately give the game about a 2/10 for card design, but the core gameplay is so good that the card shortcomings can kind of be ignored. That's right, ""6 mana condemn all units"", I'm kind of ignoring you, but also kind of wishing you didn't exist. Maybe Valve will ramp up and condemn all of their terrible blowout swing cards, but I kind of doubt it.

I think in the long term, people will probably realise that they're not judging the business model fairly, relative to its competition, at least, but the lazy card design is always going to haunt the game and I think that's probably why even pro players aren't excited about the constructed mode, where all of the dregs can be collected together. So, the game certainly has problems and obstacles to overcome, but even if nothing changes, there's a lot of fun to be had, so I recommend.",1543768440,1547798750,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

There are very few times playing the game where random chance plays a small enough element for the average player to make a significant outplay, or carry out a game-long strategy outside of the premade 7+ mana game ending cards. The game includes a random element at each stage of gameplay - creep random lane spawns, attack direction arrows randomly generating, random card draw from your relatively large deck, random shop items each turn. This in my opinion leads to the vast majority of games being decided by which player draws the right random chance at a critical moment, rather than which player predicts the play of an enemy and plans around it. 

Sometimes all you needed to win a lost game was 1 card the whole game, a tp scroll to change a heroes lane after getting it deployed in a bad matchup for example, but the shop does not have a standard set of items, so you're out of luck. While winning, games feel very straightforward - you draw the right cards once or twice, and the game ends, in spite of losing your heroes over and over, or many misplays along the way. There is no clear path to victory without a good measure of luck, which makes a lot of your wins feel hollow and almost out of your hands.

Having said all that, the visual and audio design are fantastic, with a sleek menu system in the style of Dota, and an incredible amount of voiced lines for each card. There is clear effort and care taken with every part of the game, which only makes me more disappointed at how much of a near miss this game was.

Pros: 
The voice acting is good, 
lore is interesting 
3D art and animation is stellar.  
There are interesting modes that don't require owning lots of cards
A full collection is ""only"" a hundred bucks. 


Cons:
Card combat: In hearthstone you choose the blockers. In Magic the enemy chooses the blockers. In artifact it is totally random and automated.  
Card variety: Most of the cards just minor stat variations
Card balance:  Rare cards are often stupidly powerful and straight upgrades of common cards.
Card market: nearly every card is worthless, except the OP cards that are over priced and in every deck 
Card mechanics:  the card text is inconsistent and many mechnics are unintuitive
Deck progression: there was none until the community demanded it, and then it was just slapped on in a shallow miserly way. 
Game feel: It is difficult to play many games in a row, each game requires a lot of attention and feels tiring

It appears that Valve landed on a broken experience early and then polished it to a mirror sheen. They will probably fix it, but its hard to know when since they aren't communicating.

[b]Gameplay: [/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[u]Pros[/u] - Very fun and tweaks your brain. If you're coming from more traditional games like   backgammon, poker; or other cards games, you might find this an awesome change of pace.

Matchmaking in standard constructed also seems OK. The people saying this game is -EV are talking about tournaments (edit: prize play). If you're a shark in this game playing tournaments for packs with an EV of under a dollar please reevaluate your life.

[u]Cons[/u] - Got a migrane binge playing this.

[b]Cost[/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[u] Pros [/u] - I just started playing recently and it looks like cards were way expensive when the game released but a majority have decreased to less than 0.06 cents at the time of writing. If you really want to spend the least amount of money on this game either: 

* Don't buy Axe
* Don't play standard constructed and play one of the f2p modes
* Wait for the game to go hopefully free to play
* ""If you want to build a deck"": 
      * Buy game. 
      * Play free modes and figure out what kind of deck you want to build. 
      * Lose a lot. 
      * Buy cards off marketplace you want. 
      * You can flesh out a desk for $10-$20 depending on your starting packs.

The reason I never started playing Hearthstone or other deck builders was because you literally have to buy pack after pack for you're 3%  chance drop. The marketplace is god comparitively. 

[u] Cons [/u] -  Its a card game; you have to pay for cards. It seems like everytime a new pack comes out you either have to wait for price to go down or gamble on packs to stay competitive. Valve please don't take advantage of this. 

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is awesome and while it may be pay to play, it does it way better than any other card game with the same quality of gameplay. If you like strategical games, or want to give card games a try I would recommmend it; in my opinion its the best card game of its type out there. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]F2P Note to Valve[/b] - Also I hope they are planning to make the game free to play. The whole I have to pay money for this game thing seems unneccesary especially since you can just get packs from playing, people like to gamble, and to be competitive you'll still need to buy cards on the marketplace or trade the ones you get from packs. Without doing any math, the cost of cards is dependent on its supply, so steam sharks will always buy/farm packs to keep the market in equilibrium, and free to play will boost demand if more people start playing.",1547458617,1547645955,True,3,2,0.522505700588226318,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is great, it's enthralling and challenging, and by the end of a match you almost always feel like you seriously worked for your win, or just barely lost by a hair. Your decisions FEEL so impactful and the game demands your constant attention. However, these also work as downsides for the game, at least for some people. A match of Artifact can easily take 30 minutes or more, and unlike other card games where you can afford to divert your attention for at least some moments, you need to be watching your Artifact game intensely pretty much from the get-go. The game does have some flaws in particular that would be argued, but I would agree are flaws. Attack arrow RNG is commonly touted by many as something you can play around, and while that is true, at a certain point you're just going to lose games because you kept getting bad arrows; especially more likely when not playing red and/or blue due to the lack of redirection. Not being offered the Town Portal Scroll item as well also severely hampers your gameplay, especially against better opponents. Despite my agreement with the statement that ""Artifact doesn't need a hook to be fun"", it's just common knowledge at this point that players of (multiplayer, at least) games look for some kind of hook, be it the daily quests and drip feed of gold or whatever currency in various other card games, things like free alpha packs for winning in Rainbow: Six Siege, etc. Valve added some account progression sure, but it's not really enough in that regard.  Of course, there's the business model as well which has been discussed ad nauseam, and while I don't necessarily think it's a bad one, this game would have likely seen so much more success as a living card game where you just bought the next expansion for X$ and got full playsets of all the cards. Then Valve could have sold card cosmetics or whatever and things certainly would have been better than what we have now. Ultimately, while I truly do want to recommend Artifact and like it more, I just cannot in its current state, especially with the ever-dwindling player count. The one thing I will say is I don't think Valve will abandon this game so quickly, however the first impression they left was certainly a poor one, both with the Dota community and gaming communities in general.

Recommendation.
1. Organise more Artifact tournament from valve. Make it like The International and eventually attracted more people to play. Or else people play with no goals. If dota 2 is without The International, then i guess i wont be try hard playing. At least every dota players have a dream.
2. Going FTP is not a bad move imo but bear in mind that people who bought this game might get triggered. (maybe compensate with some packs or certain things that equivalent to the game cost might help as we are the player that actually supported this game from the very beginning) (to be honest, many people regret buying it)
3. Everyone makes mistake, but i think valve is smart enough to figure how to recover this game.
4. Dont let the community down.

I will still support people to buy this game. The game value is there.

This is the best strategy game I have played, in all genres. The game is unforgiving with errors but wins for smart play are highly rewarding.

This is only the second review of a steam game I have written after 10+ years on the platform. As a longtime (Tempest block) MTG fan, I was thrilled with Arena when it came out, and thought just for fun I would give Artifact a try. Only 20 bucks, free draft, why not? Well 220 hours later I can honestly say this is the best game strategy game I have played, in all genres. 

Most of my time has been spent in draft mode, which was also my favorite format in MTG. This format allows for a new experience every game, and with all colors and a majority of the cards being playable, drafting and tuning the deck is nearly as much fun as piloting it. Constructed is also currently fun, even with just the base set. The meta is still shifting, but there are at least 4-5 competitive builds right now.

My review will mostly address the negative reviews as the appear so frequently, namely cost, randomness, not being fun: 

The cost is only prohibitive if you intend to buy the game and purchase every card, don't do that. Buy the base game, play against the bots without a timer to learn the game, then play the Call to Arms event decks to learn the cards. Then free phantom draft to hone your understanding; this whole experience will take you 40+ hours and will have cost you $20. If you then feel the game is worth it you can purchase the cards to make a couple constructed decks.

The events that are randomized in this game are numerious, dozens to hundreds over the course of the game. This can be jarring at first and it easy to blame the loss on the last random event of the game, but it is the randomness that occurs throughout the game that give the players an edge to interact with the game state and make the overall game interesting.

As to it not being fun, this game is not going to appeal to everyone, I think alot of people tried this because it was the first Valve game in years and they were interested. It is a deep turn based strategy game with dozens of decision points over the course of a game, any one of which could lead to you losing or winning eventually. You need to know most of the cards in the set before it starts to click as well as the core gameplay and nuanced mechanics of hero deployments. The first few play throughs feel like you don't much control over the game, just playing cards out of your hand. Knowing when to defend and abandon a lane, when hold intiative, to hold back cards in your hand, letting your heroes die or the enemy heroes live, all take many hours of gameplay to understand, and it is mastering these aspects of the game that are for me the most enjoyable.

TLDR; In its current state, I can't really recommend this game.  I think there is some merit to the core game, however it remains deeply flawed in its current state.  I look forward to valve trying to get me back in the game in 6 months after their player base has disapeared.

Pros:
* Effectively captures the moba feel, with heros, ganking down the river, and buffing your champions to rage quit strength.
* The 3 lanes, similarly to your typical moba style map adds a little depth to the CCG realm.
* `Lock` was an interesting new mechanic (for me anyways), which delays your opponents to play certain cards.
* Visually very satisfying.

Cons.  Lets get this started:
* Very slow progression of cards with out spending $$.  Others have mentioned this. I agree that it blows.
* It feels like there are not a lot of cards.  For example, blue only has ~5 creatures you can play..
* It does not feel like there is a lot of card synergy.  Perhaps I am just not that familiar, but sticking the best cards you own into a deck seems like the breadth of the strategy.
* From DOTA, this game inherited its incredibly long game length.
* No mobile client.  I mostly play CCG's on mobile.
* I would buy cosmetic changes, but the board seems so intricate that I have a hard time imagining them releasing any sort of quantity of variety.
*  Single player mode does not contribute to ones advancement and collection of cards.",1543714899,1547344026,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game model that is essentially the usual ""freemium"" except that you have to buy in.

You get a pack on each level. 550xp to reach new levels. You have a WEEKELY thing where you get 550xp. You average >30xp per game. It feels there is no incentive to be a new player.

now the solution
-if market was the main reason why this game weird in first place
just remove cards on market, but open the option for player to get daily income
this way atleast maintaing daily basis player base,
pretty much all their problem because cards selling in market,
if they give daily income, every cards price will be a trash like not even a cent

It's as deep as it is unique. Valve have done a wonderful job transferring the varied characters of Dota to a card game format, with each hero representing their skillset in fun ways. Mechanically, it's brilliant. 

However, Valve has attempted to create a user-run economy with Artifact cards. You can buy/sell any single you wish on the Steam Marketplace. While this improves access to ""key"" cards, it means you may have to keep spending past the initial investment. It also means you could sell all of your cards for Steam wallet funds and stick to free-play. This has had a carry-on effect whereby Valve have been hesitant to reward players with booster packs (as doing so would drive down card prices as supply would exceed demand). Only recently have they reapproached their philosophy on player progression, which is why I'm writing this positive review. Valve have indicated that they are listening to feedback and making improvements. While we are still waiting for proper skill-ratings and better matchmaking, the base game is complete and shows a lot of promise. 

Regardless, while the price may be a sore-point for some, Artifact includes unlimited access to phantom draft and use of ""free"" decks. I particularly enjoy this, as I'm not required to ""grind out"" packs or digital currency. In short, Artifact is a digital TCG without the tedium of a F2P model. 

You may not enjoy Artifact if you ou love the thrill of opening boosters for rare cards and ranking up on leaderboards. But you will enjoy it if you have an interest in mechanically rich card games (especially if you love draft, like me!).",1547170966,1547171045,True,7,0,0.528304100036621094,0,True,False,False

Been decent at a few... not pro level but could follow a meta and win a local tourney or two.  Magic, Star Wars (the original) CCG, LOTR, Hearthstone, Eternal CCG.  All had/have flaws, but I don't regret any of them.

I regret Artifact.  It kills me but I do.

Never in my time playing card games has a collectable game been so... unfun.  I read the hype about how it was designed by Garfield, was made to be an extremely competitive and cerebral game, and it sold me.  I would have tried it had the reviews been entirely negative, because I would have rationalize those people just weren't ready for a competitive card game.  Man was I wrong.  And I'm not even sure WHY I was wrong... it just isn't good.  It may be extremely tactical, and for all I know at the very top level of play it's the greatest game ever.  But for us average to even ""good"" players?  Horrendous.

The three lane concept is cute but ultimately unrewarding and extremely frustrating.  Part of the joy of playing these games is the cards, and Artifact uniquely is designed to prevent that.  Crucial moment in a lane?  The enemy can kill/silence your hero and prevent the play of that entire color of card.  Tactical?  Sure.  Fun?  Absolutely not, its awful.  I've played vintage through standard magic extensively, the mind games are not new.   What is new is the sheer amount of ways to prevent cards from being played.  Not countered, or nullified via clever play.  Stuck in your hand, useless, for extended periods.  Add this to the fact that the game is extremely long and tedious (single games can take an extended amount of time), and it really isnt any fun to play at all.

Flavorwise?  None.  Like dry toast left in the rain.  The cards, the characters, the mechanics... its painful to even look at.  How do you enjoy a game when everything from the art to the style of interaction is so dry?  I can't do it, I'm sorry.  

I really get the sense that the entire focus of the game, from A to Z, was twitch streamers.  Somebody thought this would be a great E-Sports game.  They lost sight of the idea that E-Sports games require an audience that gives a crap, and from my experience and the reviews I've read I don't think anyone will in a year.  A painful flop, that I really didn't want to be a flop.

If it's still around in a year, read the current reviews and see if they've fixed anything.  But I doubt it.  I think this one is stillborn, sadly.

boring cards with shit spells and average graphic effects. i think its the only game that dont show effects from cards.

The pack cost of $1.99 each is a bit steep, and there are some heros and deck builds that are just plain out of reach without good RNG on pack purchases, or buying from the steam store at some pretty hefty prices.  As of now, Axe is a good $15+.  Having opened 35 packs, I'm just not sure on this one.  The game is fun; don't get me wrong, but it's going to be pretty darn expensive to enjoy.  I'd guess that new packs will feature new heroes and cards, and that if RNG is not on your side, you'll be continually over spending on packs or making transactions on the marketplace.  I hate to make the comparison, but it feels a whole lot like the Diablo 3 marketplace that Blizzard eventually removed all together due to its adverse impact on the game.

/** 20 Hour Gampelay Update **/
With 20 hours on record, there is absolutely no doubt that this game is amazingly fun!  I enjoy the strategy and the complexity of the card game itself.  It takes a good dozen matches before I think you really latch onto what is happening in the game.  That being said, I like the expert games with the reward payouts.  That means, you guessed it, more money spent on tickets.  Unlike packs, a 5 set of tickets is 4.99; so call them a buck a piece.  If you win 3 games before you lose 2, you get your ticket back; otherwise you don't get anything.  At 4 or 5 wins before 2 losses, you can claim a ticket + 1 or 2 card packs respectively.  Right now, my deck isn't as solid as I'd like; so I'm running about 2/5 on actually getting a pack out of it.  What does that mean?  Well, it means I'd of been better off buying the packs.  

For those debating on rather they should buy the game or not, keep it in perspective.  You need to spend money for cards, period.  No matter how you get them, they cost money.  However, the game is fun.  When there are some cash shop improvements, I will likely change my review to a thumbs up recommendation.  I just can't recommend a game that I'm $70 into already, and I still don't have the deck I want to build due to card RNG.  Many people, rightfully so, don't want to invest that kind of money into a digital TCG.

/** 12/21/2018 Patch Update **/

Ok, they finally fixed a lot of the early game pack monetization by adding levels to the game that give you rewards based upon your obtained level.  You can get card packs as well as tickets for the various levels of progression.  The biggest issue I have with this at the moment is that rewards seem to drop off after level 16.  AKA - you only earn an extra 15 packs from the leveling / progression system.  That may because of the early introduction of the system in this latest patch, but so far so good.  The balances in this patch seem reasonable as well.  You can start to feel the meta dynamics come to play, and understand why a dynamic play style will be important for quality players.",1543536465,1547067799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And you WILL get to experience this often.",1546910129,1546910129,False,7,0,0.538661479949951172,0,True,False,False

583950,48128407,76561198022178864,0,3,3722,0,3722,1546983873,"Too much variance from the first turn, your decisions almost don't matter if you lose heroes on turn 1 due to placement of units that you have no control over. Compare it to a game such as Hearthstone or Magic. What's the worst that can happen on turn 1 in these games? Your opponent plays a 1 mana minion and you don't have a play. The worst that can happen in Artifact is you lose all 3 heroes, you have no cards to play in response, your opponent has cards to play as well, draws cards he can play on the next turn because his heroes aren't dead, he buys items from the hero kills so that his heroes also survive turn 2, and at that point the game already lost.

Sure there are cards that can change attack directions or unit placement or alter randomness in general but you need to draw them, so again there's no decisions to be made, the game is still largely decided on the 5 cards out of 40 in your opening hand plus starting spawns.

For games to be close you and your opponent both need to be playing cards in response to one another but when one person has 3 cards to play on round 1 and/or get hero kills, and the other person does not, the game will usually snowball out of control for one player. This is what makes the game feel unfun - because before the game has even started, your chance of winning is arbitrarily decided.

Sure, it's not impossible to win a game that started poorly but when you go through 15-20 minutes just to still lose a game you were losing from the first turn, you just think ""what was the point in even trying"". And when you do win a game that you were losing from the start imagine what your opponent was thinking - they felt were ahead for most of the game and lost due to one lucky draw or one good turn. It doesn't feel fun to win due to luck and it feels even worse to lose because of it.

Rarely do you get a close game where both players are having fun because that requires both players to draw good cards consistently so that they both have cards to play in response to each other.

Most cards are deliberately bad, and a few are ridiculously strong which makes winning games mostly reliant on drawing these one-card win conditions when you have enough mana, not gaining small incremental advantages from making better decisions than your opponent. Some of these cards did get nerfed, but the nerfs were most likely only because players were dropping like flies, and they still are because the core gameplay is still the same. Even if the game were to become balanced, that doesn't make it fun to play. Flipping a coin is balanced, that doesn't mean it's fun.

It's no coincidence that many late game cards with powerful effects that almost win the game on the spot are also the highest rarity e.g. Emissary of the Quorum, Time of Triumph, Incarnation of Selemene, Apotheosis Blade, Horn of the Alpha.

The last two are the most expensive items in the game (25 gold) so you'd think if you managed to acquire that much gold, then it can't have been due to luck but no, there's a 9 gold item (Golden Ticket) that gives you [i]any[/i] random item, so if you get some lucky kills on turn 1 or 2, and the ticket gives you an expensive item on turn 2 or 3, the opposing player is probably going to immediately surrender.

One of the most powerful heroes in the game is Drow Ranger and it was initially an uncommon card. Valve's solution wasn't to change any of it's stats, but to make it rare instead. If that's not a sign of careless greed I don't know what is.

This did affect it's occurence in draft mode, but draft mode also has it's flaws. Phantom draft can either be played for free with no reward, or paid for with Event Tickets and potential rewards for winning 4 or 5 games before losing twice.

So naturally, newer players who are aware they are not good at Artifact will avoid the paid mode because chances are they will not recoup their investment. The problem with the free phantom draft is there is no cost whatsoever to draft a deck. Other card games that have a draft mode at least cost in-game currency which takes time to earn.

If you want to practice getting better at draft in the free mode so that you can become good enough to win rewards from the paid mode, you're going to play against players that will keep drafting (and abandoning) decks until they get an amazing deck that can easily go 5 wins versus players that are actually playing draft mode in the intended way, where you try and build a deck with subpar cards that you wouldn't normally use in constructed.

I don't normally make reviews but if there's any game that people need to know to stay away from - at least in it's current state, - it's Artifact.",1546714125,1546880947,False,6,0,0.497907280921936035,0,True,False,False

If you're interested in this game, read through the reviews. 80% of the bad reviews are not complaints of the game, but complaints of the monetization model. Valve has already implemented changes that allow players to earn packs and tickets simply by playing the game. Obviously you will still be charged $20 to obtain the game, but in my opinion the game is worth every penny. The three lane strategy implemented here is rich and deep. There is a ton of give and take and each and every win is exciting. You'll find yourself deeply evaluating what seem like the simplest of moves, because the card you're planning to play could potentially be more useful in another lane. 

If you are interested in this game I URGE you to do your research. Watch Twitch streams. Read articles (negative and positive). Understand that its a card game and if you want to be competitive, you will likely have to buy some cards, just like a physical battle card game. Don't give up on Artifact before trying it.

BUT: Monetization is horrible. It's NOT a TCG. You can't trade, but only buy/sell directly. There are no costs for retailer or physical production of cards, yet it's still expensive. Yes, compared to other card games it's on the cheaper side, but there is no way to get cards besides paying. This is the biggest problem.

People who primarily play this game might be fine with the overall cost. But casual gamers don't get the opportunity to get into the game at their own pace. 

I play Magic:Arena and Hearthstone casually as F2P. It's great to jump into these games, do some matches to earn cards/gold and than with that gold do arena/draft and FIGHT for something. Rushes of adrenaline because there is something at stake. And slowly with gathering more and more cards you build different kind of decks with cards you have.

Artifact basically tells you: Check some meta decks and buy those cards directly. Casual gamers won't ever find a way to do any kind of deck building. Also the free draft mode in Artifact is to some extend just a draft simulation because people don't really care if they win or lose. And why should they. There is nothing to win or lose.

I knew all these problems very early at a point at which I could've refund Artifact. But I still got my hopes up for it to some degree. And if it won't get better there is at least those 1-2 games a week I can find some enjoyment with.


EDIT: Now there are rewards you can get with leveling up. This is a huge step forward. I'm not sure how significant 15 packs and some tickets are for a whole season but it's better than nothing.

The market wasn't the reason to play the game, but forcing creativity around what you have was a major part of MTG in the 90's. Sure, now everyone can play but since it's just netdecks and pre-created, what's the point. Creativity lost. The mechanics are still interesting and unique - but I'm ashamed at Valve for bending over for people who were never going to play. I'm all for progression but the artificial progression added in isn't the answer. I think earning packs should be rewarded based on creativity. Pack progression is currently limited to the premades. Levels are built around ???. 

It's become too corridored. Creativity is dead. Happened to MTG but should have happened so quickly here.

Original Review
-----

Artifact is a refreshingly good card game with a paywall for entry and horrible DotA 2 aesthetics (why are there cat monkeys flying around my cards?).

With the simplification of mechanics in MTG and Hearthstone - Artificat gives galaxy brain-tier tacticians actual gameplay. Deep, dynamic games and freedom to build as dumb of a deck as you'd like without arbitrary restrictions.

I understand the complaints for the pricing but I don't know if it's actually ""predatory"".

The part of me that loves/hates Richard Garfield for creating the most predatory gaming platform (TCG) will say this:
You can't play paper MTG without buying the cards. You can't draft paper MTG without buying the cards. Right now, a Magic 2019: Core 10 pack Booster Bundle is $35.19 on Amazon.

$19.99 gives you entry to Artifact and 10 booster packs. You're able to then play the game and a variety of phantom modes. You're able to construct decks without restrictions. You can buy cards you need versus buying more packs to DUST them. You can trade duplicate cards for event tickets or sell them for other cards.

This game feels like a card game and not a ""card game-like"" experience (ala HS). 
The fear is the meta but most people don't play Yu-gi-oh or MTG competitively. Here's a rant.

I don't see any dishonesty in how this system works or how Valve has framed it. 

It makes sense from a technology standpoint for this to be completely digital. A game this complicated would be a major headache to keep up with on paper. The mindset that all digital games should have a F2P method to 'earning' more gameplay is a problem of the space in general. For years we complained F2P was predatory and cancer killing gaming. 

""REEE Pay to win"" and all that. It's fine on ""paper"" though. I played Magic from 1994 to 2015. I probably spent thousands overall on cards. The older I got the more competitive I wanted to become so decks became more and more expensive and less and less creative. The price guaging got more and more expensive as it became a speculative market. Rares went from a few dollars to tens and twenty dollars. Limited releases became a barrier to entry. Multiple formats were made to appease the gamers and speculators and traders. Rules were dumbed down to bring more people in as the game began to lose players.

This game has been out less than two days at the time of writing this. Card prices on marketplace vary from .01 to a few dollars. Meta is evolving. Game will evolve. If they add card p2p trading any hestitation I currently have on predatory practices will be relieved. That will complete the IRL Trading Card game experience. 

I have no problem paying for this game. My deck is shit, I haven't read any meta guides, I'm playing blind. It's a cool feeling that I haven't felt since playing magic as a kid and making 200 card decks. Valve will likely provide a ""FREE"" version in the future which doesn't give the entry packs and just lets you play phantom or pre-constructed. I wonder if that will appease people. Not everything has to be competitive. Some people just like games to play games.

Big rant, I'll probably clean this up later after I play more. 7 hours isn't enough to talk on anything outside of initial impressions.",1543515347,1546754188,False,1,0,0,3,True,False,False

It's entirely possible to just straight up lose before the end of the first turn, and that means the most efficient way to play is to just keep surrendering after turn 1 until you get a hero placement that's favorable. Why they decided to bake so much RNG into this game is completely beyond me because the alternative to surrendering games where you don't have a favorable starting position is to dredge through an RNG slogfest where you're spending a very long time losing and if you start to creep towards a win, variance can instantly push you back into an unwinnable game state. It's like someone listened to Mark Rosewater talk about how slight variance can give people a chance that makes games intersting, and then implemented it backwards in that every game is a roll of the dice with a slight chance of the better player winning. Every single aspect of this game is randomly decided and as a long time competetive tabletop gamer across many systems including MtG, Android Netrunner, WH: Underworlds, YGH, and PKM.

You can only play cards on a lane if you have a hero on it. So naturally if your heroes die you loose the game for sure. Mulligans are not the only RNG in the game as units have their own will and sometimes refuse to attack the target you want. AND the start of the game is completely random too. Sometimes your starting heroes die on turn 1 because they may face a stronger hero on the other side. So these are 3 factors that are RNG.

So my experience after a few dozen game is that you watch unskippable and long animations for 2-3 minutes, while having very little control over what is happening on the board in each turn. The few cards don't allow the meta to go anywhere but the 2-3 deck that wins you games. Experimenting is actually punishing you.

And the rest?

There are no achievments, progression, no story, lackluster tutorial, no quests, no daily-weekly-monthly bonuses or login bonuses, you can only win packs for free if you already have one of the 2-3 meta deck to win them over. There are no rare or animated versions of cards, there are no sleeves and communication is limited. The options menu is a joke and customization is non-existant.

And as a veteran Dota player i am livid that they only introduced very few heroes from the game. The voice acting is cheap and the art on the cards is horrible sometimes / not in-line with the game.

Overall you better just play Shadowverse. That game is a prime example of how a CCG should treat new players. I got 10 packs for free from each expansion, a guaranteed legendary, in-game money, tickets for tournaments and all for just logging in for the first time.

I think Artifact is a game with great potential that's been plagued by some serious issues. However Valve appears to be making progress towards these issues, in their last patch they nerfed some overpowered cards, introduced a ladder system, and introduced a way to obtain packs without having to pay.

Gameplay is fun and engaging, I never feel like I'm ever locked-out of the game, there's always a chance for me to make a comeback if my opponent misplays and likewise I have to be on guard even if I feel like I have the game in the bag. The interactions between the cards don't seem too mired in RNG, and the concept of re-spawning heros and signature cards is fascinating.

My criticism is that the games are too long, there's too much time to invest for each game. This isn't something you would casually play while waiting for the bus like in Hearthstone. Likewise losing a game feels that much more painful because of how long each game takes. I feel that you don't earn card packs (for free) fast enough. I feel that Valve would be better off releasing this game as free-to-play. And I feel like the gameplay could be strengthened by introducing a faster meta and additional mechanics.

However I feel that criticisms of this game being 'pay to play' are somewhat valid but far exaggerated. I've been having a lot of fun without paying anything but the sale price. Phantom Draft is enjoyable, the current guantlet game mode allows you to play with around 8 very powerful multi-colored decks, and you can use these same decks in private games with friends. You only really need to pay when you're building a custom competitive deck and when you look at how much card packs cost in Hearthstone, how many cards they give, and how much rarer the good cards are, I suspect that Artifact isn't particularly expensive, it's just honest about the prices for cards (which you can buy direct off the marketplace). Collectible Card Games are expensive if you want to play competitively.

All the issues I've mentioned above can be fixed with patches. And since I'm running Ubuntu as my main operating system and Hearthstone and Gwent don't run on Linux, beggers can't be choosers. Overall I've been having a lot of fun with Artifact (more than I thought I would) so I'll recommend it to my friends (although none of them want to play after all the mixed reviews).",1546708195,1546708195,True,2,1,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

With that said the draft mode is fun building decks out of nothing. However this can become super RNG when someone gets a super OP hero card 2 or 3 times. Sometimes you get destroyed in the draft because you couldn't get a decent deck together and have to suffer through it.

[*]Three Boardstates - This is what sets the game apart from MTG and Hearthstone. Managing your boards and knowing when and where to throw your resourses is key.
[*]Mechanics - Similar enough to Magic that any player of MTG will feel at home, but just different enough to feel new and fresh.
[*]Free Play - I enjoy that I can fire up a standard draft and practice as much as I want before throwing myself into prize play. Same thing for constructed, I played probably 10-15 matches in casual honing my deck before bringing it into prize play.
[*]User Interface - From the matches to the menus to the deck building it's all layed out beautiflly. Everthing is very intuitive and user friendly.
[*]Graphics & card art - Card illistrations are fantastic. The board and little helper imps are very well done. I like all the subtle animations like the little river running through dividing the play space and the helper dragons reacting to the action on the board.
[*]Ranks and Progression - A much needed update. They give you nice incentives to play every week. You gain experience from matches played and modifiers you've earned throughout a match. As you level up you unlock event tickets and packs, up to a max of 10 packs and event tickets per season. It sounds like seasons will last about a month each.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]$20 price tag - Do I feel like it's worth it? Yes and No. They give you 2 starter decks, 10 packs (Each containing atleast 1 rare, and normally cost $2 each), and 5 event tickets. I feel like without any further investment you could have 20 hours of fun playing casual without any further investment. If you pull an Axe or Drow in your 10 packs you could probably try your hand at expert (Or sell them to bolster your deck.)
[*]Prize play - it's set up well enough. You wager a ticket ($1) to play, if you win 3 matches before you lose 2 you get your ticket back. If you win 4 matches you get a booster, win 5 get two boosters. My only problem with the system currently is that you need to invest like $10-40 to be competitive (based on the card economy as of December 1st, 2018) or be really good at drafts.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Cannot trade with friends - I understand the reasoning behind it. They don't want to repeat the problems they've had with csgo (gambling and scamming), but the fact that I cannot give my spare cards to a friend just sucks. Seriously, just making cards only tradable to people you've had on your friends list for 30 days and put a cap on the max number of cards you can trade per day/week. I'd be happy.
[*]Steam market & card economy - I view this from 2 different perspectives, and neither is great. From a PC gamer perspective it's a joke, $20 for a game should allow me to be competive as I put more time into the game, not more money. From a Magic players perspective it doesn't feel like a bad deal, that probably says more about Magic than it does about Artifact though. When I started the game I put about $30 into buying cards and felt like I had a pretty solid deck (total $50 investment.) Let's compare that to magic: If I bought them discounted online, $50 might get me a preconstructed deck (60 card deck with some rares) and a ""fat pack"" (10 fifteen card booster packs, some lands, a d20, and a sturdy card container.). With only those two products, even if you were a great deckbuilder, you'd likely get stomped at a Friday Night Magic. The other consideration to that comparison is that you are atleast getting physical cards that you can sell without Valve taking a 15% cut.
[*]In conclusion, the monetization isn't good, but I don't think it's a dealbreaker. You don't need to buy 3 of every card in the game. Play the free preconstructed decks to figure out the colors you like. Focus on one or two colors and only buys cards for those colors. Once you get a competetive deck you can earn the rest of your cards in expert constructed (or expert drafts.) The core gameplay is fun enough that I'm willing to put up with Steam's marketplace.

Unlike in dota where you control a hero, in Artifact you control a side (e g. Radiant) playing against the opposite side (e.g. Dire). You're the commander, and heroes and creeps are your troopers.

Common sense dictates that their basic behaviours (i.e. movement, combat a.i.) should be predictable and controllable since they are under your command. Unfortunately though, creep and hero movements are randomized along with their combat targeting.

Why is this fair or normal? Are my creeps and heroes mentally ill? Are they rebellious? Why is the stupid enemy hero targeting my creep when it can hit my tower? Why is it fun to watch drunk units acting weird on both sides of the board?

Surely there are other forms of RNG that could be applied to both players fairly that doesn't offend players' sense of agency while still appealing to their love of unpredictability. 

Some examples:
- Weather effects that buff/debuff/heal/damage/stun/slow/reposition/charm
- Fog of war
- Neutral creeps
- Random appearance of third parties that do something

This is my main gripe with Artifact. I think the RNG with spells, structures, items amd the item shop is fine provided they balance some of the more OP ones. The RNG with creeps and heroes, on the other hand, will always be unacceptable to me (and possibly quite many others) simply because they defy logical perceptions relating to player agency. Unless the devs make a drastic decision to redesign this aspect of the game, I'm not sure they can ever find a wide and growing audience. There's simply no buy-in. Heck, I paid $20 and I stopped playing after 5.8 hours. That said, I respect people who find this brand of RNG fun. I just cannot, in all honesty, recommend it to anyone I know of.

As a side note, I think it is a mistake to use existing dota heroes. There is more creative freedom in coming up with new heroes.",1546689345,1546690005,False,7,0,0,0,True,False,False

Apparently the real issue is just in the monetization model, paying 18 € to play a game where you have to pay for everything else is not viable when competitors give you stuff for free and playing doesn't feel like a chore. Anyway, since my first review, literally nothing changed, even with this patch. The ranked system works in a weird way and you don't usually get matched with the same rank, meta decks are still there, no way to use a hero that's not fucking disgustingly strong, and the exp system to level up your account and get more free packs, is quite fast in the first levels, but since each level needs more point to get to the next, you get to the point that it's not viable. Someone on reddit even made the maths and found out you need a ridiculous amout of time to get to max level, because you get 60-70 points for each win, and like 8\10 for each loss. The real core of the game is really interesting, but the delivery is quite frankly a disaster, looks like valve didn't learn from their mistakes in the past, or worse, is testing the market to see where they could push their greed, but stats show it's not working. Expecting this game to go f2p soon, maybe with its monetization model reworked or something like that, because now to break even with the tickets system you need a 65% winrate, which is possible but for a very limited number of skilled people that can easily go infinite with their 40-50$ decks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is very fascinating, the gameplay is just one of the best in the genre. Having to distribute properly the resources in your hand is really interesting as a concept, having spells, improvements for the map, creeps, and most importantly, different colors for different kind of playstyles. Summoning a creep or using a spell requires you to have deployed a hero of the same color. Games can last up to 40 minutes because of the intensity, and every choice you make can cost the game. It's a very nice TCG experience and i would totally recommend it. There are 2 different game modes, the Casual and the Expert. Casual is free to play, with different modes, such as a single-game matchmaking with your deck, a Phantom Draft gauntlet where you have to win 5 games in order to complete your run and you can lose up to 2 times, but before joining the matchmaking you have to create a deck drafting random cards out of some packs, and then there's the Constructed gauntlet, with the same 5wins-2defeats as its Draft counterpart but with your deck of choice. Expert is literally the same as Casual, with the only difference you have to pay to partecipate in a gauntlet in order to win some rewards. Basically, the entry fee to play in Expert mode is literally 1€ for every gauntlet, and this honestly is absolutely not viable for the average joe that wants to have some risk in his games. The whole system of Expert mode, to be honest, is bad and leads players to leave the game more and more. Players who are average, finish their tickets fast, and since they don't really win anything from the Expert mode, they'll leave the game, making the stronger guys waste tickets on people who's stronger than them. 

The only game mode that is viable is Phantom draft, both Expert and Casual.

But let's be honest, you play a card game for the constructed experience, you don't want to pay 18€ to play random drafts forever, the real core of the game is creating your deck and testing combos and shit. The problem with the game comes exactly at this point. You're having fun crafting your deck, then every constructed game is dominated by the meta heroes and spells, and every single game is just a random selection in the meta decks pool. The real issue is that this situation is dictated solely by the fact there are only 2 type of cards in this game: trash tier and god tier. God tier cards are expensive, like in any normal TCG, so it's still a ""normal"" situation. The whole point is, this is a online game, and balancing cards should be a literal change of some variables in the source code (not a programmer but i guess cards stats are hard coded). This lack of balancing is most likely a problem that comes from the monetization system of the game, which in my opinion is the weak point and the main problem that led away most of the playerbase in less than a month since launch. When you have a literal stock market with people investing in axecoins and drowbucks like they're a cryptocurrency, nerfing the strong heroes would just lead whales away, and that's not gonna happen. This game was clearly made to get money, but it's a totally anti-consumer way to do it. Any average player that likes the game, will just be crushed by some rich boy with the best cards, and altough it's true skill beats money, that works only for actually skilled players. 

Spending money for cards, is not that bad per se, every card game requires you to get the cards to play, so in a sense the game is doing what it's supposed to do. But it's not working, and numbers show it. The complete lack of anything remotely player-friendly is encouraging people to leave, once they've finished their 5 starting tickets and are left in the pain of playing constructed vs axe legion forever. 

I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state. There are some features missing like player profile, replay + spectate system, and altough a ranked system is coming next week, i really don't think it's going to fix anything. 

I didn't have high hopes for this game to be honest. When i saw the announcement during TI7 i thought this was complete bullshit and valve fucked up, but i bought it anyway, just to try it out and give my personal opinion on this, and here we go. The core game is incredibly good, but then after you play for 15-20 hours, and start to understand what's going on, you get that the meta is already stale and the game isn't interesting anymore at all. 

The positive side of abandoning this game is that you mostly get back all your money selling the cards without having to refund, which is nice. And also you can't refund because the game almost forces you to open the 10 packs you get with the initial purchase, making it very explicit that you can't refund the moment you decide to take those starting ""rewards"".",1545074466,1546688234,False,92,2,0.721077322959899902,0,True,False,False

RNG makes the game almost completely non-tactical. Yeah, it can be interesting and fun and I loe the fact that the RNG element makes it feel like a moba insofar as parts of the game feel out of your control, but that gimmick fades pretty quickly when a really tense game is shattered by the arrows falling in the wrong places. 

The power of the cards is all over the place, many of which are nonsensically overpowered. 

The initative system is fun at times, but, predictibly, it can turn into a disaster pretty quickly if you have something like Tidehunter in your deck. 

The cost of the game, too, if nonsense. It isn't worth the box price at all, not to mention the cost of packs. They try to butter you up by saying you can sell cards on the market, but, because a handful of cards are so much more powerful than anything else, there are only a few cards that are even worth selling, and, IDK about you guys, but I never get them. 

It just feels like a cash grab. I don't know why I would choose this game over MTGA or Hearrthstone-- even with a tier 1 draft deck, I never feel like I have enough control over the situation to actually enjoy the tactical aspect of TCGs.

So you saw the update and fell for the trick huh?

So you're wondering, ""Did the update make the game better?""

Short answer: No. 

Long answer: There are fundemental problems with the game that this update doesn't address.

Problem 1: Still no worthwile system for excess cards. I'm sorry. Paying $1.99 for a pack and getting back 12 cents (maybe) on the market is awful. It's really bad, I don't want to hear the MTG turn overrate retoric because quite frankly it's bullsh!t. This game needs to submit completely and change. There is no value in digital cards. Period. I don't care if Axe is selling for 9 dollars still. Axe has never and will never be the problem that people swear he is. Drow has never and will never be the problem that they swear she is. The problem is the game. And it's greed driven concept of your card is worth 7 cents we'll tell you it's worth 3 cents because we do not actively update the prices. Which means you'll have to ALT+TAB to see actual value. And while you're tabbed out why not just play another game? It's a bad system that at first I was excited about and now I realize. Yeah. MTG:A and Hearthstone are doing it right. The market is near endlessly flooded with more duplicates which means your 2 dollar card is now worth 20 cents if you're lucky. That works with a physicall good. Not a digital one. I played the TF2 stock market. I played the Dota 2 stock market. You sell high and then you leave because the lows will be super low and they will not increase. 

Problem 2: Content. This game needs bi-weekly or tri-weekly updates. It needs events. It needs cards. Balance patches. Etc. I've played all the cards. I've seen all the decks.. This has been out since November. You changed some cards I don't care about and added a system that has a finite reward system. Yes. It's finite. You will not constantly be rewarded packs. You will not constantly be rewarded anything. If you lose this system is basically useless because you'll be lucky to get more than 25xp and each level requires hundrends of xp. You will hit a wall and like they often do, Valve will tell you to pay up or move on.       

This game. Could be and should be better. Valve, could be and should be making this game better. They are not. I can't tell if this is because they're upset that it wasn't an instant success. I can't tell if they plan to slow ween Dota for this like they did TF2 for Dota. I really don't know but there is literally hundreds of images of concept art that could have been used for cards that they simply never used because they want to hold back. This game needs content. Fast. Quickly. This isn't Hearthstone now. It doesn't have thousands and thousands and thousands of cards with arena and story modes and so much content that just throws cards or packs at you. This isn't Magic, it doesn't have infinte replay ability because billions of deck possibilies and new game formats. This game is Artifact. It's boring. There are 3 decks worth playing. There are 10 heroes worth using. It's time to either make some changes and add some content or give refunds and admit it was all a mistake. 

Do not pay for this game. It is not worth it. At all.",1544732860,1546453094,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now that Valve introduced some semblance of free ""progression"", I'm going to change my review as promised.

Everything I've said below complimenting the mechanics is still true. Without crunching out a true composite score, I'd easily say this game is a/an B+/A- overall. There are a few heroes/champions that are much, much stronger than others, and a few regular cards that are too powerful as well, but not really anything game-breaking.

In terms of gameplay itself, my biggest complaint is pacing. Turn-timers work great in games like Hearthstone where your attention is wholly focused on the board in front of you. Multiply that by 3 and you have Artifact. Slow internet, not paying attention, actually needing to concentrate- whatever the case, a ""round"" (going through all 3 lanes) of Artifact takes way longer than it should, or at least it feels like it does. Maybe the turn-timers need to be adjusted to apply a bit more pressure than they do now? All in all, it's a minor complaint.

That being said, I'd like to talk about the progression system. Valve has now added a leveling system, as well as weekly bonuses. The leveling system will give you a few packs and event tickets, as well as avatars, at a gruelingly slow pace. The weekly bonus rewards you for your first 3 wins (in any mode, I believe- did not check Bots), and resets a week after your first win. While both of these do not allow for ""rapid"" progression, they are obviously better than nothing, and not too far off from existing games' models. Maybe with a bit more tweaking, some people will feel compelled to come back and try a game that I genuinely do find fun.

Old Review:

This game has some seriously solid mechanics that anyone who enjoys CCGs would find appealing. Each turn is dynamic and requires you to think 3 steps ahead, ensuring that all of your lanes are balanced and defended, or determining whether it's better to slog it out for 2 towers or slam a single lane twice. The draft mode is exciting while also providing a safety net of being able to take ""extra"" cards (more than the standard deck size norm) to play around with, unlike in games like Hearthstone.

Ultimately, this game will not survive if it continues with its current market structure. It is inconceivable that I not only have to pay $20 just to get the game, but that there also is no ""free"" way to grind out cards...you can't have it both ways. Hearthstone isn't perfect, but with enough time and skill, you can definitely acquire a meta-deck. With Artifact, you have the packs that you received at the start.

Your options to gain more cards are to spend 1 of the 5 free event tickets (given to you at the start) on competitive constructed or draft play. If you're like me and got absolutely terrible cards at the start, the option of comp. constructed play needs to be tabled until you get more cards. That leaves comp. draft, which is essentially a gamble. I've probably done about 12 casual drafts and won only 1 (admittedly, the first half or so of my games were me getting the hang of drafting and playing effectively). Instead of a simple majority wins, you need to win 5 games without losing more than once (2 losses is out), which is another challenge in-of-itself. The other half of my casual draft games were 3/4 wins and out, which did not feel good. For comp., you do receive a ""refund"" of a ticket after playing 3 games, but no real reward unless it's 4 wins. Given that you only have 5 free event tickets, I can absolutely see people only successfully completing 1 of the 5 comp. gauntlets (term for an entire set of draft games). Hopefully the reward is enough to bolster a not great deck to take into comp. constructed?

Surprisingly scummy behavior from Valve. Until the marketplace issue is resolved, I cannot recommend this game. Sure, you can have ""endless"" enjoyment in casual draft mode (constructed as well, if your deck isn't bad), but even those will get stale without additional cards for you to toy around with and keep. It's really a shame that such a brilliant game is ruined...well, maybe not ruined...but certainly marred by greed.

(And yes, I need to git gud and also realize that MTG has a similar cost overall. That doesn't give Artifact a pass.)",1543961347,1546451879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With digital card games, there are many possibilities than cannot be explored on physical card games, but most games have done this mostly by adding more RNG factors to the game, usually way too many. Artifact does this in a good way (except for maybe arrows.. they could use some tweaks). The game is still in it's early stages so diversity is not much, but it's easy to see that the mechanics can create lot's of depth and complex decision making, which I personally believe that are the best features a digital CCG can have.
Once you become decent playing, it's also easy to go ""unlimited"" with tickets, and you end up even getting some steam account balance (don't except to get rich or anything) just by playing. Also, when you want a specific deck for constructed, you can use that same balance to buy the specific cards you want instead of opening endless boosters of crappy cards which ends up being way more expensive.

The voice acting is great. The art for the cards are great. The three-lane concept and execution is great. The shop is a cool idea, if a bit poor in balance I personally think. The cards are fun, and whether I win or lose, I don't exactly feel like it was due to the RNG.

However, the one thing that holds the game back is the monetization, obviously. You have to pay an entry fee of 20 dollars, you get around 15 free packs, and that's it. No quests like in Hearthstone that allow you to obtain gold/currency to grab some packs, no free packs from a weekly win or something like that, nothing. I wouldn't care about that if there was no entry fee, or if the entry fee was something like 5 dollars instead. It makes me so conflicted, because correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Valve worth a ton? Don't they have money machines in the form of CS:GO cases and keys, every purchase made on the Store and Market on Steam, the occasional burst of income from the Dota 2 International Battle Pass? Again, I may be incorrect, but I don't understand why the level of greed with this game. It has such unbelievable potential to be quite possibly the best and most unique card game out there, but it's held back by what destroys most good games these days: greed.

At the end of the day, I still recommend the game. The pros do outweigh the con, but barely.

EDIT:
Some of these insane card designs have been addressed and received nerfs, which definitely improved the game. However, now I must say that there's not enough content/cards to make you want to play it for longer than a week, so it's still not an amazing purchase. If they keep up with nerfing stupid ideas and introduce at least 3 expansions a year, the game should become fun and varied enough in about a year from now.

--------------

In all honesty, there's some insanely stupidly designed cards in this game. The whole game revolves around building up your hero cards through the match, so that they can survive combat, but then you have stupid cards that delete your hero. So to make up for that, they created an optional mechanic where you can give your units 50% chance of surviving deadly damage - hardcore insane RNG. There's also a card that gives permanent invulnerability to a Hero, which is insane, because the counter to this card is not common, not everyone will run the few cards that exist that can cancel or bypass it. This game seems cool when you're playing meta decks against other meta decks, and an inexplicably stupid clown show of garbage game design when you're doing anything out of the ordinary. Not even Hearthstone makes me this mad.

I have to reneg on the RNG, though. You'd think RNG is usually fun in a card game? Not this one. Games are often decided on what direction your units decide to attack, if you get your heroes' signature cards in time or not, if you win a coinflip on the 50% death effect, if you get critical utility items in the secret shop, etc. etc.

A recurring problem I have is needing to remove a hero from one lane and putting them into another, but never getting any Teleport Scrolls or Blink Daggers in the shopping phases. I've lost track of the number of games I've lost where I had spent 3-5 turns without any redeployment items appearing in the shop. Sure, from a tryhard perspective, I shouldn't have had my hero get uselessly stuck in an empty lane, but uhhh excuse me for wanting to have fun as a casual player I guess.

Overall:
High learning curve but the game is ruined by awful amounts of RNG and a bunch of hyper-strong cards which seem fair in the developer's vision of the meta matches. Cheaper than Hearthstone, though. Will always be.",1544425458,1546410147,False,7,2,0.491802364587783813,0,True,False,False

The MOBA mechanic feels incredibly forced, well-implemented, but forced. For what reason did the game design revolve around a lane-based, hero selection for cards? Is it simply because it's Valve and they mode DOTA thus this game must be similar?

The aesthetic, voice acting, lore, card illustrations are all very well done. However I don't find any particular card combinations or individual cards really exciting the way I do when playing MTG. There isn't a particular card combination that I see as being incredibly powerful/OP/or exciting to play when it is drawn. Everything feels pretty balanced, almost to a fault that there are linear build paths, and a lack of diversity. This will probably change in a couple of years when many additional cards and mechanics have been implemented but at the moment it feels stale before I've really even begun diving into the game.

I also am not a fan of hearthstone and in general, round based mana allocation. I prefer a land based system (that yes is more random and can result in floods or scarcity) so take my review with a grain of salt. If you like hearthstone then you'll probably enjoy Artifact more than I do. I don't think there's any huge problems with the game, cards are pretty cheap now.

At the end of the day though there is too much working against this game, from stupid RNG mechanics to poor card balance, with a multitude of issues in between.

Artifact produces some of the most amazing comeback moments I've ever seen in a competitive game. I've lost count of the number of times I've been able to swing a losing match for the win - even sometimes on the last turn.  Every game feels incredibly balanced and you never encounter a match that feel impossible because you have the wrong cards (unless you’re playing constructed without a meta deck, but that goes for any card game) The point is – in modes like draft, or pauper tournaments, or the event – your success or failure comes down to how well you play, not how lucky you are.  

The key to Artifact is thinking about why you lost - there is almost always a play you could have managed better - or a lane deployment that could have made the difference.  I'd recommend starting with bots until you get your head around the game - then move into the casual competitive modes.  Draft is the best place to start because you don't have to own all the best cards.  The event mode is great too since you're given a pre-constructed deck and get to face off with other pre-constructed decks.  It makes for a pretty level playing field that focuses on skill.  Learning how to deck build in draft is a fantastic way to move into constructed - but if you're like me, you'll probably fall in love with draft and move into expert mode.  having to use a ticket to play really turns the heat up and makes people play very competitively.  You get some great games out of the buy in and winning back your event ticket on turn three feels fantastic not to mention the free packs if you make it to round 4 and 5!

Beyond the gameplay itself, I've really enjoyed the lore and all the voice acted card text.  There's actually a narrative  - don't miss out on the comics! I've also really enjoyed selling my valuable cards on the market and using the money to buy and sell other cards for a profit.  The Steam marketplace app becomes a little card stock market in your pocket - spotting good deals and flipping cards for cash is a blast, and can help you fill out your collection or buy event tickets without spending anything more than the initial buy-in.

I've played around 35 hours or so and I think with the right direction, the game can definitely become much more popular than it is currently. Artifact however faces a lot of issues, I personally only picked up the game after the in-game progression was added, this is because for me personally it feels much more rewarding when you play a game and know that your time invested reaps rewards of some kind, especially in the digital card game space. (I've played Hearthstone, ESL and MTG Arena and the pokemon tcg) With this in mind I think the progression system needs a lot more work, as right now it is a very slow grind in order to get anything, this also nullifies the ""buy the game and get x amount of packs"" because whereas before you could buy the game and were automatically rewarded with the booster packs for purchasing the game, after the progression update you have to essentially still grind to get the packs you would have got with the purchase before the update which I think is pretty stupid. Keeper draft is also mostly pointless as because of the low player count you will almost always be matched vs streamers or very high skill level players and the matchmaking time is very long additionally the rewards you get for doing well are not really worth the entry fee a lot of the time unless you are an exceptionally skilled player. Keeper draft is also far less forgiving to players who get an average amount of wins in comparison for example to Arena in Hearthstone where someone who is a casual player can still get decent rewards for average results.

Regardless I think Artifact is fun and has a potentially bright future ahead of it if Valve continues to make adjustments to progression and to come up with creative ways to keep the game fresh and exciting and accessible to new players (which  would be a huge boon to smoothing out the matchmaking balance issues).

It's tough to say at this point whether I would recommend the game. It will certainly be interesting to see how the game plays a few months down the line and I'll certainly recommend it if things improve, but until then I'm leaning toward (if you enjoy tcg's) rather wait until Artifact's more glaring issues are ironed out before committing yourself to this one.",1546350873,1546351572,False,11,0,0.550966858863830566,0,True,False,False
583950,48013158,76561198267546719,0,2,2002,0,1539,1550966208,"Artifact is a great new take on a TCG with Dota characters. Knowing the heroes is a nice little touch for those who play Dota 2, but anyone who doesn't know the heroes can still easily grasp what is going on and really enjoy this game. This game has a unique and challenging formatting for a card game.

First major point to discuss is the talking about how it is pay to play or pay to win. My only response to that is: Yea, of course it is? It's a TRADING CARD GAME. I don't think anyone complaining about this game understands how these games work, so let me talk about the ""pay to play"" and ""pay to win"" elements people talk about.

[h1] Pay to Play	[/h1]

This game (other than it's $20 up front price) is not pay to play at all. The tickets that you can use to play are not for competetive mode or anything else you may read in the reviews. It is mainly used for what can be called ""wager matches"". It is pretty much what Arena is in hearthstone. You draft or make your own deck, and you use it until you win 5 times or lose 2 times. If you can win up to 3 times, then you get your ticket refunded. Getting 4 or 5 wins will get your ticket refunded as well as give you one or two decks respectively. 

You also get tickets (and packs) to play wager mode as you level up for free. So overall, there is no pay to play aspect of this game, other than of course buying the game itself.


[h1] Pay to Win	[/h1]

So people who complain about this game playing pay to win: Every single TCG in the world is pay to win. That should have been known since it was announced. It is a pay to win game but there are some great ways that Artifact mitigates the pay to win aspect. 

[list]
    [*]All of the cards on the marketplace are EXTREMELY cheap for a TCG. The most expensive is less than $10 right now and well over half the cards in the game are only $0.05.
    [*]The complexity and rng of the game make it so even some of the best decks can lose to good decks and good decks can lose to just ok decks. This makes it feel like you always have the ability to win, even if your deck may be heavily outdrafted.
    [*]Being able to buy single cards seperate from packs is honestly the one thing every TCG needs. It makes it so if you want to design a deck, you don't need to spend $60-$100 on card packs and hope you get the cards you want like in Hearthstone.
    [*]The best decks in the game can be bought off the marketplace for only $50 or less. For these kinds of games, that is really cheap.

[/list]

Although this game is really good in my opinion there are still some issues the game has.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]Artifact introduces players to a very unique take on card games which is challenging, yet fun to play.
    [*]Cards are insanely cheap and you can buy them individually off the market place.
    [*]The best decks can be made for a fraction of the price that you would need to pay to get the best decks in other TCG.
    [*]Tournaments are insanely fun to play with friends and there are many other modes that you can play to show off your deck building skills.
    [*]Cards actually get tweaked in order to keep the game balanced.
[/list]


[h1] Cons	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]While I have no problem with the game being $20, the game doesn't allow refunds if you complete the tutorial and accept the packs, which can be very problematic for many players.
    [*]The gameplay is very different from any other game, and some players may not like the way Artifact plays out. 
    [*]A lot of the game seems to rely on RNG even when it comes to things like what will your unit attack, or will your hero be placed where it will instantly die. 
[/list]

All in all, Valve and Richard Garfield did an amazing job in designing this game. I was really skeptical at first, especially after seeing all of the mixed reviews surrounding Artifact. I can say for certain that a lot of the negative reviews I have seen don't really give a legitimate explanation on why Artifact is bad. I can only assume a ton of Dota players thought it would be fun, without every actually playing a TCG before. If you are a fan of games like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, and don't mind a more challenging take on the game, then Artifact is definitely the game for you.",1546349885,1546349885,True,7,1,0.51370704174041748,0,True,False,False

I am a draft/arena type player. I was hesitant about buying Artifact because of the fact that it doesn't have in-game currency. However, after buying it, I want to clarify to SOME players sitting on the fence here like me. I don't feel like this is ""pay to win"" any moreso than any other card game. A bit of information about me

- Player of Hearthstone since the game was released.
- Picked up MTG: Arena.
- Dabbled around in some other card games.
- As of right now, I've spent £10 or so into this game and I've got what I need for the most part except for the top end premium cards like Axe, Drow Ranger, Annihilation and so on. Although, to be fair, I don't really play constructed.
- I've spent 4x that amount and much much more into other card games such as MTG Arena and HS. 

Most of the cards are fairly cheap. We're talking pennies here for most of them. Legionnaire considered an S tier Hero is about £.0.06 on the market. It's just the exceptionally top end ones which may cost a few £/$ such as Axe, who is £7-£8.

- You can recycle cards you don't want to draft an arena ticket. 20 for 1. Good for excess cards.

There seems to be levelling up rewards. Every 2 levels you get 2 free packs and 1-2 arena tickets. It will be hard to grind more than two levels in one week though, so it's capped.

There is a season ranking system as well, but I'm not sure what the rewards are for that as of yet. Both for constructed and draft.

As for the gameplay itself? I find it fun. I find myself playing even the free to play draft mode and enjoying it. The top end competitors such as MTG: Arena and HS don't offer free to play draft runs. So if you're a player that really enjoys arena/draft modes, you always have to pay for the privilige to do so. In this game, you don't need to invest a penny into draft mode if you don't want to. 

There is A LOT of RNG elements into this game. Where your arrows on your attackers point, to the creep spawns, which lane your heroes end up in against what other heroes and so on. That's without taking into consideration card effects. So if you're someone that cannot stand RNG, you might not enjoy this game.

So despite my hesitation to buying this game because of everything costing money, I recommend it. It's not as bad as it appears, seriously. If you're someone who casually just puts in money to other card games like HS/MTG, I say you get far more value here. You don't have to buy 82173837 packs to either get the card you want or enough resources to craft it. You just buy it from a reasonably priced market and skip all the hassle. There is SOME incentive for weekly rewards such as packs/tickets, and perhaps even the season may award some. Although I'm not sure if the levels reset at the end of a season as well as your season rank, otherwise the level rewards will be one time only.",1546259734,1546259734,True,3,0,0.487253963947296143,0,True,False,False

Despite having 3 lanes, the game is fairly restrictive on where cards are placed - you can only play matching coloured cards in the same lane so if you're light of one colour in a lane and the RNG doesn't deliver draws to mitigate this; you can lose just by bad luck alone. 

The business model of pay to play, pay more to compete and pay even more to win isn't quite as bad as first feared especially with card prices sliding however despite its stylish aesthetics and DOTA 2 lore; the game feels rather drab and not worth investing in unlike comparable games in the genre. The population is also quite low and many still seem on the fence about truly committing to the product.

This is definitely not the quality game I was expecting - Valve have made some small strides early on with adding progression and improving balance but the one thing than cannot be fixed is the fundamental RNG which is the foundation of this game. Strategy can win matches no doubt especially with well-established decks of experienced players but at its core, RNG can prove too much of a factor for most players.

It is designed to have a lot of strategy involved. But does so at the cost of the fun you could have.

For exemple : 
To play a blue card you need a hero with the same color on the board. That involve a lot of thinking ahead. But you just ends up in a situation where you could pull of a really cool combo and you just can't because you don't have all the required colors on heroes. You needed them elsewhere. That's not fun.

But it goes way beyond that because of initiative.
The way the game work is like this : you have initiative you can play a card but if you do so the opponent will get initiative.
And you have 3 boards.

Exemple :
You have this really cool combo you could do. But you're not gonna do it to keep your initiative on the second board because you know if you don't he will kill your hero and you won't be able to play a card.
So you play nothing istead of a cool combo just so you can use a stupid ""kill hero"" card. Then the enemy surely had a cool card for the situation but can't play it because he has no heroes anymore. But hey you thinked ahead of him and kept your initiative. Does this feel rewarding ? Not at all. You know it's the better play but you're still sad you had to give up on your combo. 
And I say combo because i'm used to playing card game but in this game you can't even combo 2 cards because after the first one you give initiative so the opponent will play something to fuck your combo. Yeah more fun ruining


I'm kinda sad to not reccommend this game. I've loved valve and their games and despite all the critisism the game received I still though it was going to be good. I had to much trust in them. I really wanted something new in cards game. I've played magic, hearthstone, gwent, and other less known cards game with more strategy involved. They all had goods and bad. I though Richard Garfield with all his experience could do something really good with Valve. I was wrong. 
I mean the worst thing in magic is when you don't draw any land or only one color when you play 2 or more. And you can't play any cards. 
And here you still have this shit where you don't have initiative so you get your hero killed so you can't play any cards. 
If only someone could design and balance a game where you can actually choose whether you want mana or spells. But that's another story I guess.

Whining people talking about how microtransaction ruined this game. There's this mode called draft where you draft your deck (which open up like 5 pack and construct it before a match), you'll play this deck until either you lose twice, or get 5 consecutive win. no need to spend any money. The microtransaction made for people who love to collect card or wanted to feel the satisfaction of winning with your own well-constructed deck.

In my country it wasn't very popular so I had to buy them eventually in shops who imported them. That was expensive and even then you had to search for other players which was tough.

So a few years ago I started playing the Magic card games on PC. I think overall they are well executed, but they lost some connection with the original paper card games.

I also play HS (Hearthstone) now and then. I bought all expansion packs, a few card packs a month and do my daily quests. I have a decent collection now, but I start loosing interest since they split the play modes, and made a lot of cards and collections obsolete.

This exactly was my fear for a PC based collection game.
If the digital content get restricted, you actually loose your collection, the cards their value.
The playmodes offered to play with all cards are less interesting and it has become less rewarding to play and to collect.

So I was very happy when Valve announced Artifact with the intention to solve some of those issues.

But stupid as I am I took the negative Steam reviews too serious and hold of on release day.
Lucky as I was (thank you Ryan Dorkoski who answered all my questions honestly at forehand) a Steam reviewer and Steam friend told me to give it a try, warned me about not opening the packs yet so I kept the refund ability etc and he answered all my questions. Not all what I wanted to hear, there are still negative parts (later more), but honest and it helps a lot to make my choice to step in.

What NOT to expect:

This is not a free game and it's not a free to play game. People who play paid serious money for the games framework and ability to play. That means most people who play now play because they like to play and not because they like to grind.
Profit is that you will not encounter many people using ""concede"" and you will encounter longgoing games (10 -30 minutes) even since you start with the TWO basic decks offered when you start.

Next to that you will have FIVE packs of cards, containing 12 cards each, wich will give you at least some rare and uncommon cards that you can alter the standard deck with.
Together with skill in playing cardgames, the very interesting mechanism (later more) that will not decide every game by the opening hand. There is variation in tactics you need luck and patience, but as a generic player I was able to win a few games against lvl 5 to lvl 7 players with and lvl up to 4 quckly that also gave me experience, tickets for special events and card packs.

You CANNOT trade your cards directly with other Steam friends or players, but there is an economy so you can sell unwanted cards and buy cards you want. This is great because it gives the feeling of a real collection with some value if you have expensive cards in your collection.

You CANNOT buy the game, with the very standard cards offerd build your own deck and be competive in ranked play. Don't try, you will be crushed and the fun will go away. Maybe some masters in mathematics and prof players can, but my attempt stranded badly. But I don't see this as something negative. I knew this at forehand and it's fair to the collectors with bigger card collections.

What you CAN DO in Artifact is A LOT

You can play games with constructed decks of cards you do not own. So you can experiment with all kind of decks. Your opponent play with the same decks, so it's totally based on skill and not on collection.

You can earn (or but) tickets and participate in tournaments and special events. This way you can earn rewards like XP, new tickets and cardpacks in different play modes and if you are getting skilled in the game at a more frequent rate.

What people say in their reviews that you will get nothing for free is simply Bull Sh#t!

I was not even planning to start playing Artifact this weekend, but since I pressed the play button I have 8 hours in and did not even used any of my tickets yet. I was just playing, leveling up, learning the game, watch opponents strategies etc etc 
More then enough content offered for the price you pay for the main game.

If you really want to invest in the game, the price for 60 cards is lower then 10 Euro in my country atm. Don't forget those cards also have real value after you bought them. This is NOT expansive compared to other games in the genre. It's not even possible to compare since ""the other"" games don't have an aconomy around the cards at all.

If you want to play with friends, but you don't want to function as a food for one of your friends who already invested a lot in the game you can organize tournaments with deck restrictions. I didn't tried any of it yet since I only have 8 hours ingame so far and simply have more to do then I can handle.
At work I was even thinking to play Artifact at home. That mostly means a game is good.

It's getting a longer review then I was planning to write, but I'm simply excited of what it already is and what it can become.

The game itself is a very traditional compared to other games, but with some fresh twists never seen before.
One game you play on multiple boards (3), those ""lanes"" you can continue monitor the whole game.
But if gives an extra layer of strategy and helps mid and end games not become boring.
You or your opponent never play well on all three boards at the same time, so you will use this as an advantage even when you are at the loosing hand. Important is to know that you always need to destroy two out of the three towers, but even if you are able to destroy only one, you have a change to win on that board by also destroying the artifact.
Well there is a lot to tell about strategy, carddraws, ingame shop while you playing to buy cards while you play etc etc etc. 
You simply have to experience it yourself.

This is a great game, made with lot's of love and attention to detail.
For example: EVERY card not only have a custom text and artist name on it, but also a play button that gives you fully voice overed comments on every card. Every card a different comment with all totally different voices.

The same for the cards, the lore and the UI. It's all very smooth, but not casual smooth. There is handpainted art combined with effects and very funny monsters on the board, fully animated and funny, that function like some kind of audience while you play. This is really great and adds to the game imo.
I have really totally nothing at al with DOTA, but I love the lore and don't feel I miss anything because I don't know that other game well.

I really hope that if I have some Steam friends in my activity feed who love to play a good card game now and then will consider to pick this game up so we can play together and organize tournaments.

Feel free to leave feedback and/or questions in the comments or talk to me on chat.

I would give the game 85 out of 100 now, with improvement that can easily turn it into 90 very early in 2019.

Overall I have blast with the game and I believe it's really made for players to have fun.
If you already want to call it a cashgrab or money grab feel free to do, but keep in mind that it also offers value for this money.

Sure, it is annoying and outright.. well, greedy, to have a system like that in place, while many other card games dont have that system.

The solution to all these problems are tournaments, granted you have friends to play with.
Or draft mode, which is probably the most fun mode regardless.

I forced myself to be hyped while it was in ""open"" beta and watched videos and streams to learn more about it. After it became available I started playing right away. Now after spending 50+ hrs in game I'm changing my review from Positive to Negative for 2 obvious reasons.

1: Lack of interaction. This might be suprising, but in reality it's not fun. Most of my games go to a point where either I win on lane 1 or 2, or my opponent wins on lane 3 in the same round, or vica versa. Games are usually intense and very close. I like winning by suprising my opponents, like doing 1 turn Ancient kills out of nowhere, or turning around a board with some combat tricks. I really like that last damage back and forth play when each of us equip items, use cheap spells or creeps and holding on to the big guns until the very last moment. I don't like winning or losing by taking interaction away from my opponent. There are tons of cards which aim to do that. You deploy 3 heroes in a lane you are losing to turn things around. You have 10+ mana and plenty of cards to play with. You'll do well, right? Wrong. Primal roar, Sucker punch, Intimidation, Gust, Enough Magic, Nyctasha's Guard, Coupe de Grace, Assassinate, just to name a few cards. I had a tournament game recently where the only thing I had available was passing on one of the lanes for 4 consecutive rounds regardless that I deployed heroes there each round, because of the above cards. The game is not that much fun when all you can do is watch your opponent playing cards.

2: Randomness. I've been liking card games since I was a kid, and I'm well aware of how they work, you draw cards, good or bad, and do stuff with them. What I hate here is the randomness of attacks. 30+ damage can easily curve into a singe creep round after round and while you have a few cards which can change those arrows, it's still very annoying to just observe your tower killing dmg being sunk into a 4 health creep. Another part is the flop. There are games where you instantly lose your heroes in the first round because of bad luck - they went against Phantom Assassin, Bounty Hunter, etc... All you can do is hope that your starting hand of 5 cards will have at least one cheap creep or target changer, otherwise you'll be damned. The games aren't short, so after this start for the next 15-20 minutes you'll be constantly playing from behind, struggling to get to the board and turn the game around. You'll still win a few games if you're playing good and your opponent bad, but most of the times you'll be losing. And after losing a 20 minute long game you lost in the first second of seeing the board, it feels like a waste of time.

It is possible that after a few hundreds of hours into the game you'll really know what you are doing and have a better control over your luck and can manage to pull all the nasty interaction-killer cards yourself and emerge victorious at the end of each battle. But I'm afraid for most people, the road getting there would just not worth it.",1543495418,1546087099,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ever felt bad about really expensive CCGs like Herathstone and Plants vs zombies: heroes (from elwectronic Arts BTW)

well this one takes the cake. i ve spent $100 on HS and on PVZH and got basically full collections and they are the most expensive CCGs, then there are other good CCGs like pokemon TCG Online, Duelyst, Faeria, Gwent Shadowverse etc.

All can by enjoyed full without spending any money or spending very little

Played most of the other titles for more than artifact (except for gwent, since i personally didnt like it) and all offered a lot more without wanting to take my money at every point.

This is the most dissappointing thing valve ever did. I like the gameplay but the monetization is so disgustingly bad and scummy, that it makes you want to play those pay2win mobile games instead, like Clash Royale or something....yes even those things that Valve bashed on so hard....are waaaay less scummy than this game...and at least they are more upfront with it.

mind you,  tickets are worthless unless you go 4:2 or better...you cant turn tickets into packs in any way...gonig 3:2 10 times (which happened to me and means 66% winrate) means you get NOTHING....you just get to try again.

ironically the game isnt as deep as it pretends to be and honestly....just stick to anything else. 

this pay to play, pay for decks and pay to compete is bullshit.. oh and theres also no ladder...just stupid ggauntlets where you go to 5 wins or 2 lossess...which sort of resembles arena....except Valve did an even more scummy thing: add MMR to it, so a good palyer will eventually drop in winrates and this makes sure there wont be so many 0:2s and 5:0 but instead a bunch of 2:2 and 3:2s so almost nobody wins any packs....

As a veteran card game Player, this is the Worst game Valve has ever made and the scummiest digital card game on the market.

However the launch was rough and the game was lacking many core-features. Valve listened to the community and quickly released a patch adding many important features and great changes. Artifact is similar to dota in so many ways; complex gameplay with strategic elements, different lanes, abilities, items and heroes. Gameplay is great - the effects, the music, the characters interactions with each other and the lore and voices behind the cards. 

I would say that the business model is fair, I like that you can buy the cards you want without opening a lot of packs, but also the free gamemodes that don't require you to spend any money at all. I've been playing the ""call to arms"" event-decks and won a lot, resulting in higher level, earning more cards and tickets. RNG is a factor, yes, but it also keeps the game interesting for replayability. Just like with Dota 2 the developers keep updating the game and adding awesome features and improvements. Dota 2 is one of the most balanced and fair games on the market and Artifact is moving in the same direction. 
I would highly recommend Artifact even to players that don't like MOBAS or Dota 2. Artifact is the best card game I have ever played and I'm excited to see all the upcoming patches, new cards and further improvements!

---------------------------------
Am a casual gamer and usually don't find any need to review games.  But after playing Artifact for sometime, I needed to get this off my chest.

Pros
Yes, it is a fun game, in-depth, engaging and the mechanics make sense.

Cons
No, you don't get to win packs to add to your collection without paying real money for tickets or packs. 
It doesn't make any sense after paying 20 odd dollars for the game. 
So you're basically stucked in casual/solo mode until decide to pay for a ticket. 
We can all agree that much of the fun in any card game has to be the thrill of obtaining and getting packs(without involving real money), but it seems like the developers don't get it even after countless feedbacks. 
It is much like buying a cake with half the buttercream and toppings, and to get a complete cake you have pay for the missing buttercream and toppings. 

Balance needs work. Cards like Cheating Death make the game unplayable. 
Hourglass card blocking item needs to have its cost way up. Red cards in general needs balancing.

No profile, no ranking. You only get to chat with your opponent after the game on a separate pop up window.

This is my first time writing a review for a game.
Artifact is a card game like the card collection game in the real life except it is digitalized.
At the moment when i wrote this comment, I gave a ""not recommend"" for this game.

This card game is not balanced at the moment. The designers are not yet finalize the cards cost vs cards advantage. Quite alot of cards are poorly designed with no meaning for it to be in a deck at the moment.

If any players want to play this game and win, he or she will need to buy cards. Got money, please buy the blues cards such as Annihilation and At all cost, Conflagration which are All blue OP Cards (they are not cheap and all are expensive cards). 

The first few rounds are not able to win; the blue deck or semi blue deck will drag using those 3 sets of cards with a Ogre Magi and his Ignite total 9 cards which is damned high ratio to get. then the blue deck will win after mana cost reached like 7-9; you can use Annihilation in a group of opponent's lane with just a single blue hero and win the game easily in the middle game. Just don't need to be afraid to lose any blue hero; and in case and if possible, need to lose 1 hero each round so that every round you can play a hero card in an advantage lane to win; and play Annihilation or At Any Cost if needed.

I do not recommend the game to player who don't have budget to spent. It is very disheartening to lose most of the time.
That is why Artifact lose more than half of the players in the first one week of the launch!!",1546002478,1546003664,False,10,0,0.543132960796356201,0,True,False,False

I have almost 3,000 hours in DotA 2, which makes me even more disappointed in this game, because I like the characters, the art, the lore, and the idea with the seperated playing field.
However, there are so many fundamental issues with this game:

-RNG can screw you just as much as in Hearthstone. Games can be decided by creep RNG, attack arrow RNG, item shop RNG and initial deployment RNG (and all chance based cards of course, but at least you can influence those). You can lose a hero in the very first round without being able to react at all and from that point on you are in an immediate disadvantage in that lane. You can win or lose games because in the decisive moment, one player got two creeps in the lane where they needed them and the other player gets the creeps in lanes where they are completely useless. 
And why can't I at least decide which opponents my heros attack? It feels completely stupid when my hero would be able to deal 10 damage to the opponent's tower but rather decides to attack an enemy to the side that would die in this round anyway.

-No way to earn cards without paying. You know f2p (free to play), you know p2p (pay to play), you know p2w (pay to win), now get ready for the next step in the evolution: p2p2p: Pay to pay to play. Sure you can play without buying tickets or packs. But in that case you will not be able to earn cards and there is no incentive to play, because there is no progression towards anything at all.

-Losing in any of the modes where you can earn cards is so much more frustrating than in similar games. When I have a bad arena run in other games, I just lost a bit of in-game currency that I earn back relatively quickly by just playing the game anyway. When I have a bad arena run in Artifact, I feel like wasting real money. This is even worse when you lose due to bad RNG.

I could write more, I'm just so disappointed in this game. Anyway, here's some suggestions how to fix this:

Reduce RNG impact:
-Get rid of random attack arrows for heros. If there is no opponent blocking my hero, let me decide where I want to attack. Arrows for creeps are ok.
-Make a deployment phase before the first actual round. Keep the limits that you have currently (e.g. one hero + creep per lane), but let the players decide the position of the units. Have alternating turns for this, just like the normal rounds and give initiative in the first round to the player who passed first during the deployment phase.
-Let the players position one creep per round themselves. I know this is not how it works in DotA, but the creep RNG can just screw over your game so hard, I cannot think of a better solution. I'm not only speaking about losing games here, you can win really contested and exciting lanes simply by lucky creep deployment. And then you're sitting there: ""Thanks for winning the game for me I guess"". Doesn't feel like a deserved win.

Ways to earn cards without paying:
-Make an arena (or some other mode) that you can enter with some form of reasonably aquireable in-game currency to earn cards. At least for me, this is the minimum they need to change in this game before I consider playing again. There is simply no excuse for not having this in the game. I guess this is the result of publisher greed winning over player satisfaction.

That's my opinion of the game's current state. I could maybe overlook the annoying RNG factor, but not being able to earn cards by simply playing the game is just horrible. Valve seems so step in line with Blizzard and Bethesda by prioritizing monetization over player enjoyment.

The production value of the game is certainly very good, but I cannot recommend it at this point (it also took me five tries until steam finally decided to post this review...).


Update after the first patches:
You can now earn a limited amount of packs and tickets in the game. I played another five hours to see if that is enough to make me like the game, but it just isn't. The RNG just sucks out all the fun for me, it is still one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.
I would give it a medium rating now if steam had that option, but because I have to chose between recommending it or not, I won't change my rating. I still don't have fun with the game.",1543738534,1545968158,False,6,1,0.542680501937866211,0,True,False,False

I could write all my detailed thoughts on this game but I'll try to keep it to some limited points:

1) The graphics and sound are amazing.  While it is becoming more common for card games to have an audio cue when a card is played, Artifact goes above and beyond this.  From opening cards in packs to random dialogue from heroes, this element is amazing.

2) The draft mode is amazing.  You can play a free mode or a prize mode for tickets.  Drafting is far superior to Hearthstone, both based on the format and the prizes.  I won't describe everything that makes the format awesome, but after drafting your cards you then get to craft your deck.  Thus, if you are forced to pick some really bad cards at times, you don't then have to include them in your deck later.  From the prize perspective, if you go at least 3-2 you get your ticket back.  In Hearthstone, a portion of your prize is always sunk into a pack, thus making your prize very often a discounted pack.  Here, you get nothing for really bad runs, but you always get a ticket refund on above average runs.

3) Draft games tend to be very close.  Often in other card games you tend to see a lot of polarity these days, but Artifact feels like one or two decisions can often swing the game.

4) Valve is on top of its shit.  It quickly dropped two patches within the first three weeks that greatly improved the game.  Other games would probably tend to release an announcement of the changes, but wouldn't be able to patch for another few weeks.  Valve got that s**t done quick.  They've earned a fair amount of trust from me to improve this game even further.",1545949921,1545949921,True,5,0,0.524092018604278564,0,True,False,False

Gameplay:
First half of the match doesn't matter what you do.  Lose a tower in three turns, dominate all lanes, doesn't really matter.  Mid-late game is just about spells and that is what you're playing for.  Got your hero to 20/5/20, still doesn't matter, what spells do you have?  There are so many ways to instantly kill a hero, move them to another lane, wipe out an entire lanes units, wipe out almost all enemy heroes, it's pretty crazy.  And this isn't just one color, Red, Black, and especially Blue all have great ways of destroying a lane instantly.  After a while you realize you're never ""ahead"" or ""winning"", you're just hoping that even though things look good the last three cards in the enemies hands don't immediately turn the game for them.  Sure in the begining you are impressed with the three lanes, cards, and overall gameplay but then after 50 or so hours you start to see that spells > everything and the first half of the game is pointless.  I'll keep playing, at least for a while, mostly because hitting my head against a wall hoping the outcome will be different is just something I'm found of apparently.


Flawed from the start:
I applaud Valve for realising that their game had major weaknesses upon release and that's why they went from 60k peak users the first two days to 5K daily users by the end of the first month.  The introduced player levels, free packs and tickets for levling, card balancing, etc. but all of this was an afterthought and happened because they realised they messed up.  The damage is done and at a fundamental level they misunderstood the market.  I don't see this game dying as I'm sure they only expected a hardcore niche to stay, but for your average player I see this being a bad investment.




Original Review: Posted: Nov 29 @ 10:41pm

The gameplay is good and I like the three lanes and strategy that goes into each match.  There is a lot of depth here and building decks and testing strategies is definitely fun.  With that said, I don't think this game appeals to the masses and will be very niche, even for TCG's.  Here are some thoughts.

*The only thing I currently don't like is... winning doesn't feel that great, because it doesn't really matter.  When you play free modes winning doesn't do anything.  There is no Win/Loss record, no ranks, no working towards free cards, you just beat a random player on the internet.  When you buy the game you get 5 tickets ($1 per ticket retail) and you can enter Expert Play and work towards free tickets (3 wins) and packs (4 and 5 wins) which adds excitement to the wins but long term, if you run out of tickets, you have to buy more.  I don't see myself constantly buying tickets to get a little more excitement.  I've heard there will be tournaments sponsored by Valve so that really excites me and I'll be waiting to see how the game progresses.

*I like the Marketplace.  You can buy almost all cards for 5-10 cents which helps you round out most of your decks.  Sell duplicates, cards you'll never use, and use the money to buy more cards.  The downside is that although you can do well just using the base $20 game and selling/trading cards, there will be matches you will lose very badly because someone else bought the $10 hero's and spent a few extra bucks here and there.  It's not the end of the world and doesn't happen oftern, but even after two days of the game being release I'm starting to see players understand strategies better and use the epic heros better (Kanna just destroyed me).  95% of cards are under 50 cents, most are under 10 cents, but I'd say there are about 10-15 over 1$ and at least 5 over $10.  But you can always sell items from other steam games (CS:GO, TF2, etc.) and use the cash for cards!  Or spend some money here and there, overall the system is good and it's a big plus instead of rely on buying pack after pack looking for certain cards.",1543549319,1545943161,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

**FIRST** Regarding the 'cash-grab' - I disagree with this sentiment. If I want to play Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic, Dragonball-Z, or any other TCG I am going to have to either buy a mediocre starter deck, or buy the cards I want off the market. Also, in these games when I want to play with stakes I go to a cardstore and pay an entrance fee. This game is really no different except that it is virtual. $20 Entrance for starter cards and 10+packs and 10+Event tickets is a very reasonable deal.

Pros:
- You can buy straight from the market. The closest I have seen a computer game come to feeling like a real TCG
- The gameplay loop is actually pretty fun. There is a lot of strategy involved even with simple abilities and games are surprisingly very close. 
- It seems like even with only a standard base set of cards, the meta is still evolving
- Updates have improved leveling, progression, etc.
- Heros, gold/items, minions, and lanes are pretty fun

Cons: 
- How accessible the game is from the start could very well depend on the cards you open in your starter packs. I was lucky enough to get very good packs, so I can play constructed without too much of a worry.
- Games are relatively long. (15-25 minutes)
- If you get a bad opening hand, the game is not fun (this is present in all card games but Hero placement RNG in this game makes this a bit more sour)

But I didn't buy it when it first released because everyone said it requires your wallet to win games. So I decided to wait until I am convinced for the game that is not pay to win. So here is the basics about the game that you are wondering about:

First of all, I want you to think Elder Scrolls Legends and Magic the Gathering(MTG) had a baby and named it Artifact. 3 lane system with 4 different colors but the colors are simply like MTG colors w/out white cards. Instead you have some other kind of cards called items. 

There are 2 different game types called Draft and Constructed. And 4 Play modes called Solo, Social, Casual and Expert.

[b] Draft Mode [/b]
There are 12 cards in a pack. In the draft mode you open 5 packs which makes 60 cards and build your own deck from those 60 cards. You need 5 Heroes, 40 playing cards and 9 item cards. But you can increase the number of playing card and item cards in your deck. So like you have to have 5 heroes but you can have 50 playing cards and 10 item cards. Becase even if you don't choose any heroes game gives you 3 same heroes from each color. And you can play gauntlet which is basically 5 wins and 2 loses allowed game mode. 

[b] Constructed [/b]
Constructed game mode is the mode that you play with your own deck and you need to have all the cards (no sh*t Sherlock) to play with your deck. So to answer some questions [b] YES [/b] there are some decks cost you 25 bucks which is so expensive. But you dont need those. Because there are some budget decks cost you only 1 or 2 bucks but can help you to win 5 games in a gauntlet. So You don't need a blue-black control deck for the start (The most expensive decks) but still can win a ton of games. Just don't forget every deck has a counter. And also you can save a deck that you dont own its cards to see in your collection to finish it later.

[b] Play Modes [/b]
Solo: 
In the solo mode you can play a game or a gauntlet against the bots. Which is great because hard bots are not that dumb. But the best thing to play against bots is you can give the bots a deck that you dont own its all cards to see if that deck is good or not. So you may not to buy it after your games.

Social:
In the Social mode you can construct some tournaments or you can play with your friends.

Casual:
Ok in the casual mode you can play constructed or draft. You dont have to give anything to play. If you have a deck play constructed if not play draft. My suggestion is to play draft and get better and better till you can enter the expert draft gauntlets to earn packs to finish your collection. 

Expert:
Expert mode is the ranked mode for the casual. In the expert mode you have to give a ticket to play. If you can win 3 games in a gauntlet you get your ticket back. If you win 4 you get a pack in addition and if you win 5 you get 1 ticket and 2 packs. Which is ok. Its not that much of a problem to win 3 games in a gauntlet so just try some casual drafts and begin playing the expert mode. Yes its not that fair to give something to the game after you bought the game but, you don't have to. You can always play casual to get better. There is no rank system so you only get packs which you dont have to get for the first round. But there is another game mode called KEEPER DRAFT. 
KEEPER DRAFT:
In this mode you give 2 tickets and 5 packs to play. Do you remember what i said about draft mode? You open 5 packs and create a deck with them. In this mode you keep the cards that you draft. So you dont lose any cards. But If you win 3 games in this mode you get 2 tickets and 1 pack. If you win 4 you get 2 tickets and 2 packs and yet if you win 5 you get 2 tickets and 3 packs. So after you get better in the game Do a phantom draft which is a 1 ticket exchange draft mode and earn some packs then use the packs in this mode. 

To conclude I must add that you start with 5 tickets and 10 packs. So I dont recommend you to open those packs. You can save them for Keeper Draft. But I highly recommend the game. Search the internet for decks and copy their decks codes then paste with ctrl-v in the game's build section. See the prices, see the cards and dont buy them. Untill you opened some packs and earned some money from the game. Because remember if you buy the cards, you can sell them too. So you may not lose any money if you open every single pack and sell the extra cards. In my first deck I opened Axe which is 10 dollars.

If you are lucky enough to get some top teir cards (costs money for packs) or buying cards outright, you will get be left behind in cases where you go against top teir DECKS (many already estimated over 100$ on marcket if you copy). The tutorial (there is not really one) sucks and you rely on reading the hover overs. There is no ""friends"" list, stats page, any way too communicate with your opponents. To be a competitive game, a social game, it feels very lonely. Getting ""free"" packs is nearly impossible as well, so you pretty much have to stick with what you get at the beggining or spend more money.

Compared to Hearthstone (which I hate to compare) the balancing and strategy is lacking. The teaching of cards and strategy and the glipse of hope for getting free cards/packs that Hearthstone has makes you look at your wallet with Artifact and ask, ""Do I really want to invest more money on a new game?"". There will always be balancing, and changing of strategies, and as such, more cards and demands. That means pay now at high cost, and risk being shafted later.

Release, Patch, Cards, Market, Transactions
I bought the game at release, edition 1.0. I was happy with the game. Today I looked for some cards, I've been purchasing cards, and found some at my preferred price point. 

I couln't buy them though. Patch 1.2 meant that card changes, despite a marketplace to obtain cards, is the horizon. Why buy cards if one expects prices to go down even farther from altering the commodity?

What I would really like to hear from Valve is: We had to alter cards for balance, given a market, we will not do it again. We will be crediting users affected as much as we can since we profited off their transactions. We will not be changing any more cards in the future, but we will consider play bans, mode bans and the like. We are interested in the success of this game for everyone.

Short of a statement like that, I just can't find a reason to collect any more cards.""

Disappointing. Changes appear to be sheer confusion and chaos.

Game at release and  patch 1.1  was great. Patch 1.2 changed the game package, some cards, and thus game play. 

(As of writing) You can buy a lot of cards for five cents a piece right now. That's over 66% off the price of buying in a pack. As some cards have changed, obtaining by either method seems in question.

The game is not fun and frustrating at times. Did Richard Garfield have any involvement in this game? It seems like he just spent time in the valve offices to give ideas and not get hands-on, since I see no evidence of playtesting to see if gameplay is fun. Every card game has an element of randomness but the randomness in Artifact is on another level. Creeps can spawn in lanes that you don't need them in or enemy creeps spawn in front of your heroes denying killing blows or significant damage on towers. Arrows directing damage is also random and direct a lone creep to destroy a tower or a hero to direct all their damage to a lowly creep. These aspects are not small things, they can add up to a win or a loss. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MONEY, I thought if you did you kept the cards in the decks that you can play. You do not keep them, you only test them out and cannot change them. That means you have buy all the cards you need to get a deck you are interested in playing (and how do you know if you are going to like the deck? you only can test out only specific deck created by valve). The item deck is also random. Want a teleport scroll to move a hero to another lane? Tough luck, you don't get one when you need it - better stock up. There are huge disparities in the power level of heroes - some heroes are unplayable (if you do you are playing at a disadvantage), most of which are the ones that you are given for free. 

Perhaps draft will be the great equalizer, you don't need to buy a constructed deck to play (although you need to pay to get into a draft). Draft is confusing and a bad experience, mostly due to heroes being in the packs you draft. You need to open a good hero (later in the draft you need to open a good hero in the colours you picked) in your first pack as all the good heroes are picked early and often so you will get those underpowered heroes. It feels so bad playing this game: intiative is confusing and frustrating (making sense to people who play this game for days), most cheaper spells have such a small impact so that they are usually useless, colours do not have a solid identity and having heroes of a certain colour in a lane to cast spells of that colour is stupid. They can try to balance the game as they are trying with the patches but what is needed is a complete redesign of the game, as it stands the game is frustratingly dull and I am baffled as how people can play more than a couple of games in Artifact (perhaps they bought all the cards they need and now are invested?).

Valve can do wrong (remember Ricochet?) but I recommend that they now stick to developing steam and updating their previous games. Artifact is further evidence that they do not want to make (fun) games, riding the card game bandwagon and trying to get a quick buck off the steam marketplace - no-one is forcing you to make games Valve.",1545796227,1545796227,False,23,0,0.580342710018157959,1,True,False,False

IF YOU NEVER PLAYED A CARD GAME BEFORE, READ THIS:
PROS
- You get your money's worth in packs, so it's ""FREE"".
- This is the only card game I've known where you can play infinite draft for FREE.
- Forget about playing any card game without spending money (or a LOT of time to get free stuff instead). Even Hearthstone you can't get all the cards easily.
- Most of the cards are VERY CHEAP, check out other card games and you'll be surprised on how cheap Artifact is.
- You can play several modes without having ANY cards.
- You can play with pre-built decks for free with expensive cards on them and get to know different ideas IF you want to build something for yourself.
- Valve is trying really hard to make it work, making a lot of good changes. You can even sell back cards that got nerfed so you don't lose money.

CONS
- Not many cards yet, but the game is still young so...
- Part of the community is new to card games, so they give up and tend to give bad reviews without even giving a try to it, but eventually the game will form a strong community (I think/hope).

I have played Magic: The Gathering (MTG) for over a decade and tried some other card games. Because of the MTG's complexity I never thought I'd find another card game I could enjoy, but as it turns out Artifact is really nice and I'm excited to see where it'll get.

This is the first time I have experienced buyer's remorse w/ a game on Steam. 

I paid $20 entry price for a game which is worse than Hearthstone and Gwent (both are free and a load of fun), and which expects me to pay a ton more just to make it playable. Worst of all, the game isn't even fun or enjoyable. Very random, extremely boring matches, games taking like.. 5x as long as Gwent or Hearthstone. Much less enjoyment for time spent.

If the game was free I could have at least tried it out, decided it wasn't good, and uninstalled, but now I have lost 20 bucks and can't even refund after 30 minutes of playtime because of their parlor trick making you agree not to refund if you want to actually try playing. 

I am going to give this game a little time to see if I can get some fun out of it but I am doubtful at the moment.",1545773897,1545773897,False,8,1,0.542490780353546143,0,True,False,False

-----
1. The average time for each round of game is longer than the average card games. There are a lot of interesting mechanism but...it just takes way too long to finish a game (in my opinion).

2. The mechanism is a bit complicated. It is interesting that the developers created a new mode that the gameboard is divided into three lanes, this gives the players more choices of strategy but it also make the game more difficult to play. In other words this game is not very friendly to new players. Compares to HearthStone, HS has more friendly interface and the animated characters are also one of its selling point.

3. The game is expensive. It cost you much more money than most card games, which are either free to play or sold at a cheap price. After you purchase the game you still need to buy those expensive cards to get good cards.

So again, I wouldn't recomment this game for now, but if you are a big fan of card games you can try it. I would rate this game neutral if possible.

======================
已经玩了几局但是综合来说并不是很推荐，讲道理要是可以选中评的话就好了。个人现阶段不推荐这款游戏，但是如果你很喜欢纸牌游戏并且有点钱的话还是可以入手的，原因如下：
1. 这个游戏一局的平均时长比其他卡牌游戏要长。在游戏复杂的机制下会使得玩家比较容易失去兴趣。
2. 这个游戏的机制还是很有意思的，毕竟是第一次看见有人把MOBA和卡牌混一起的，要衡量重心放在三路的哪一路，但是机制过于复杂对新手就显得不太友好，上手时间更长而且也减少了可玩性。
3. 这个价钱尼玛太贵了吧，虽然有提供免费的卡组，但是要特别好的几张卡牌都得花不小的价钱去买。

I kept uninstalling and reinstalling the game. When it's fun and you and your opponent have a similar set of cards, holy hell it is fun. The gameplay loop is there and it is great. When things are even, it works. 

But when they put down those bullshit rare cards or heroes - you know the ones I'm talking about - and all you have in hand are commons and uncommons and what you started the game with...it's disheartening. It's like, you cannot play the game unless you pay out of the nose for it. I tried the phantom draft, but it only seemed to make the frustration even more rather than less.  

At least in Hearthstone you had an opportunity to actually get those cards or make them. Here the grind is slow...so very slow. Levelling up can be a horrible pain, especially given that you will loose to players that have better cards than you a lot. It doesn't feel fair, it doesn't feel fun. 

Do not buy. Do not waste your money here. Just...walk away. These kinds of games are terrible. They play terribly and almost always favor those that have more money over those that do not.

One of the advantages of making a digital ccg over a physical one is that you can get rid of all the problems the distribution of physical card games have, like replacing paying for individual cards with things like Hearthstone's dusting system (which is admittedly on the stingy side when it comes to actually dusting cards but I digress). 

Not only does this game not try to break free of traditional methods of card distribution, it actively encourages it with how easy it is to just put cards onto the community market. The game is also twenty goddamn dollars at base, with the justification being they give you packs (which they just recently cut down to 5 from 10 btw), some event tickets (which are also for sale and your only way to enter the competitive ladder and drafts) and two semi-playable decks. But even games like Magic make and give away free decks to dip your toes into the game and figure the basics, and Hearthstone has the decency of things like Brawls and quests to earn more packs.

Ok, ignore the reviews complaining about the marketplace system, this system is absolutely amazing!!! So I paid 20$ for the game, but you actually get 10 packs x 2$ (looks like 5packs now ) each plus a couple starter decks (not sure if a free player would get this) and then  5 event tickets, so basically 5 free drafts for chance to get more packs, not a bad deal.

I didn't get a ton of great items from my 10 packs, but it was decent. Now here is why the marketplace is AMAZING. I wen't thru and purchased over 50 cards, mostly 1 of each I did not own of every single uncommon card I did not own (they are basic, common, uncommon & rare) along with a few commons I was also missing. Oh no, that has to cost a lot right, I mean people are crying about this system, lol... It cost me less than 4$

Then I go and do the same thing with the rare cards (the highest quality in the game, aka legendaries). I did not purchase every single one, I read them and only grabbed the ones that looked pretty good, but it was the majority of them. I just did one copy again and also purchased some rare Hero cards (tend to be the most expensive). So another 50+ cards of the highest tier and it was like 17$. The grand total now is 21$ for over 100 rare cards and the initial 10 packs, but honestly you would be better off not to buy a single pack and do what I did. I received maybe like 1 rare and 1 (maybe 2) uncommons per pack that would cost a new player 2$ each. Based on my experience with the market, I imagine you could buy the cards equal to what I got in 10 packs for under 10$, maybe 12 or 13$ max.. It's mostly cheap cards that sell for a few cents. 

The most expensive card sells for 18$ and the next highest one is 12$, but prices fluctuate, right now that 18$ card is 16.30, followed by 11.08, 7.18, a couple 4s then a couple 3s, then like 10 cards between 1-2$ and another 10 cards between 0.50$ and 1$.

When I played HS years ago, the initial cost of the DLC (long before they swapped modes and only use more recent cards in ranked) and enough packs to get a semi ok deck going was pushing 100$. I played that game for a couple years, didn't spend a ton, but a good 50-80$ when new packs came out and I was still missing tons of big impact cards. To be able to spend 30-40$ and have at least 1 copy of almost every card on day 1 is very cost effective, so much to the point that I don't see why people would waste time buying packs and it's going to force valve to remake this system.

The Elder Scrolls Legends was another one I played a lot and that game is much cheaper to build a collection than HS. Even in TESL you would need to buy the expansions which are 10-20$ each and then twice they released card pack expansions which require a purchase of 70$ to get enough of the important cards to make you happy and on top of that you need to have been playing for a while to have enough mats to craft what you don't get on that 70$ purchase of cards. I  basically have a full collection, multiple copies of everything in that game, but I played at a high level for well over a year and spent roughly 200$ on it. 

GENERAL GAMEPLAY

So far only played a few online matches, went 4-1 so if you are experienced in these type of games you should be able to jump right in, but I did have to practice against bots for about 5 matches. It uses a 3 lane / board system, but the downside is that matches can take a while, anywhere from 20-40 minutes and it sucks if you lose a match you could have won after 40 minutes. Each board has a tower with 40hp, destroy 2 of 3 to win, after one destroys it comes back with 80hp, you could also destroy the same one twice to win.

The potential is great because it means you should see less rush / face decks like you see in a lot of other card games. I personally can't stand those type of decks because I feel they lack skill and are basically coin flip decks. If enemy has counter early or you don't win by turn X, you almost surely will lose. Those are not balanced styles which really show off the complex gameplay of a CCG. 

I have always been drawn to Tempo / Control playstyles, but pretty much anything other than face rushing. It's such an amazing feeling when you make several efficient plays and now have 6 cards in hand vs 2 and you also have board control. Let's say a rush deck takes 25 minutes to win, a more complex deck takes 32, but also plays much more consistently with a greater chance to win, I think you will see more of the latter due to the initial investment of time. It wouldn't make sense to gamble so much when it's going to already take 20+ minutes, you might as well focus on something more complex which I'm hoping is going to lead to some really amazing matches.

MECHANICS

A huge pro for me is the ""mana"" system. You start with 3, so you can play 3 cost card from turn 1 and gain +1 per turn plus some cards will add to it like any other games. When I saw who was involved in making this I was worried it would be another CCG where we have to draw our mana. You also gain money from defeating creatures, heroes or towers which you can use to buy cards from the item part of the deck which are mostly buffs, +x armor, hp, attk, etc...

Let's say I go first on board 1 and decide to play my unit, then other player drops a unit and I end turn. Now it goes back to the other player he might play a weapon on his unit, then it comes back to me again even though I end my turn, let's say I end again, but now it goes back to him again and they can keep adding more and more, but I can also decide at the last second to add something as well. I think this system would be a little better if you could lock in and the other player can only go X amount of times before the turn ends as long as you don't do anything else. Maybe it max out at 2-3 times for the second player to then keep playing. I don't know, maybe this will grow on me as I play more.


A huge negative is how the Hero and auto creep cards are played. Each turn random cards are playing with the same stats on both sides. You pick what lane to put the hero, but you have 0 control on where to place any cards. Once the turn starts you can choose where to put your normal minion cards, but too often things can be decided by where the computer randomly places the other cards. You could have an amazing Hero that randomly gets put into a horrible spot you would never play him in and he instantly dies. We need some sort of control over where units will go even if it's some type of auto system where units will always place on the far right / left and go from there, this way you have at least some control over where they land.

Where a creature will attack is also completely random which is really bad imo. Now part of this mechanic is fine like if a creature is in front of another creature it attacks that creature, if nothing is there it hits the tower. Some creatures gain cleave which can hit both sides for less dmg, ok this is all good so far, but then this happens. 

You have your card and enemy card head to head with nobody on either side. You play a card to the right side and there is a 25% chance (still not sure if this is random each turn or decided on the play, think it's decided on the initial play) that the card will gain the ability to attack to the side to do less dmg and help kill the enemy card, but it might just attack straight, it's 100% random. 

Maybe this won't be a huge deal as I play more, but I am really against adding more RNG when you don't need to. Just make certain cards always be able to hit the sides or not, add something that tells us for sure because it sucks you are forced to constantly gamble on something like this. Maybe the enemy needs 2 dmg to die, well it's random if u can hit him or not.

Even after that, your path to victory will depend heavily on luck. 
Games take between 30 and 45 minutes, so you need to make time for a match. Network is stable, and even when I got disconnected, I got reconnected quickly, so thats a plus.
The animations are long and tiresome, it surprised me how fast they started to get into my nerves, since they are an absolute waste of time. I wish the game was faster paced and matches would last no more than 10-15 minutes.

It has high replayability value game-wise, and the game might be better if you play it with friends, but I did not.

The game isn't marketed well towards people who don't have much money to spend but still want to experiment with various different constructed decks (so people like me) and it has too much shitty RNG. Cards like Ogre Magi and Bounty Hunter could be reworked to be consistant and you could reliably predict their power, but Valve doesn't seem interested in doing that: The base mechanics (hero placement, creep placement, targeting arrows, etc.) show off that having bad types of RNG is a very integral part of the game, so it is unlikely to change.

I play Hearthstone for over 4 years (wild and standard, reached legend) and Dota 2 since I was a kid (Ancient rank). Obviously like most people Artifact caught my attention immediately but the ""pay to play"" model they introduced disappointed me. After revealing the last 2 expansions I decided to try it, since valve finally started listening to the community. So let's look at every aspect of the game:

[h1]The most important one is money. [/h1]
Most people want to spent an amount on the game and not be forced to spent more. I feel like Dota's model is the ideal model right now and maybe Artifact can steal a couple ideas. People want to spent money just to enjoy the game more (with cosmetics etc) not for the shake of playing the game, after all when you pay for something you want to be able to play it. Right now they added more free packs and tickets and IF you are good enough you can keep grinding more and more for free and maybe at some point have some good cards and play constructed. The other option is the bad one, buy packets or cards from the market. Why is it bad? Because you are practically forced to buy them if you want to play constructed, even a few decks. Hearthstone on the other hand offers you enough tools and packs to be able to craft and play some decks and if you want to try more then you have to buy some packs. [b] The whole point is that the company should make you want to buy packs, not force you. [/b]  So what more can they do? One solution is add more free packs after leveling up or doing achievements, but make those cards un-tradable. That way you can play some decks and have cards for even more, the cards will have no value since they are untradable, and since you will be missing 1-2 key cards you will WANT to buy them in order to have that awesome deck. Overall after playing 3 days only draft, i feel like I wont be able to play constructed for like the next 4 months unless I spent money, but after the original 18euro why give more, there is no incentive. Even if I buy some packs or card I will be missing more.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
The gameplay honestly feels really good, Hearthstone feels so slow compared to this.  There is much skill involved and remembering many variables. There is some random factor of course like most card games and thinking about it is also a skill. So pacing is fast, skill ceiling is high, deep card and mechanics knowledge  is required. Overall it is a great game, too bad I can only play draft :/ Unless you play it watching it makes no sense, so try playing the tutorial if there is a friend who bought it.

[h1]Graphics and Sound are great.[/h1] 
Some optimization is probably needed, the GPU is like running Dota 2 but this is a card game so something is probably not right. The imps are amazing, the starting game intro also. Cards drawings are ok, I feel they could do a better job. 3d spell animations are really interesting and unique. Music is very cool but probably needs more tracks to not feel repetitive. Finally, voice lines are amazing. 

Conclusion, this is a really good game and it shows great potential, quality will only go higher. However, a game needs players. Most people face the paywall really skeptical. Moreover the after effect of having to pay more in order to enjoy even the basic aspects of the game is what drives people away.",1545670603,1545671003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There has been a lot of negative reviews saying that:

-Artifact is pay to win
-There's no level progression
-You can't earn cardpacks for free

The developers realize this and added:

-A level progression where you earn card packs and tickets when you reach a certain milestone of levels.
-Cards are fixed, nerfed and buffed with each update, making those cards fair and not overpowered.
-You can also earn both cardpacks and tickets from the Prize Play, with the entry fee of one ticket, but you can earn up to 3  tickets, and 3 card packs.
-There's a mode called Phantom Draft, where you draft all your cards, so does your enemy, so all is fair in this mode, I find it quite fun.

Edit: Updated for patch 1.2.

[b]--Core gameplay--[/b]
Artifact's core mechanics are certainly unique and I can't think of any card game that does something similar. You battle over 3 lanes simultaneously and win the game by either winning two lanes or overwhelmingly dominating a single lane. Usually this leads to abandoning one lane at a strategically convenient time and focussing on the two others, but depending on your deck this may vary. Sometimes, especially in draft mode because the decks aren't as refined there, this focus on lanes switches rapidly as your opponent reacts to what you are doing - that's probably my favorite aspect of the game. The heros are definitely a unique mechanic as well - these are the five units that enable you to use your cards and come back to the game eventually if they are killed. 
It is certainly much more complex than its competitors, as you have multiple resources (mana, cards, heroes) to manage and there are many variations to consider over the next few turns every time you play, which takes a lot of concentration each game. It is a very challenging game to learn and that definitely makes it a niche game in an already niche genre. 

[b]--So much RNG?--[/b]
There is a fair amount of randomness in addition to the card draw. However, each rng event on its own is not very impactful and they are occuring quite frequently, so any advantage usually averages out quite quickly. Most of the random aspects are designed in a way that lets you react to the outcome and a lot of skill comes from choosing which unfavourable circumstances you should mitigate. Occasionally the random aspects can be quite frustrating - especially if your deck focusses on a color with only few reactive options.

[b]--Monetization--[/b]
A lot of this game revolves around the fact that the digital cards you buy are treated like physical products that can be traded on the steam market place. This especially means, that there is no free way to earn more cards through play. Only modes with an entry fee allow you to win cards. While I think this experiment is certainly interesting from a game design perspective, and while I see the benefits of being able to buy the cards that you want directly, as a player I don't particularly like it.
Just be aware that: [u]This is not a 20$/18€ game![/u]
If you like card games for their collection-building aspect, be prepared to spend a lot more than that. For playing the constructed game mode, expect to buy many additional cards before you have a viable deck as some cards are just essential. The power level of expensive, properly optimized decks is so far above anything you can build from your first 10 packs you get with the game, that playing constructed is basically pointless without spending additional money.
The ""expert"" play modes that allow you to win additional card packs, require an entry fee in the for of event tickets that can either be bought or obtained by recycling any 20 cards. While the 5 tickets for these modes that you get with your initial purchase last you quite a bit (as Artifact games tend to take around 15-20 min each), if you favor these game modes be prepared to occasionally having to buy new tickets.

[b]--Low cost play options--[/b]
Before throwing out  the game in frustration after reading the last section, consider that there are quite a few options that don't require a big investment.
[list]
[*] Draft modes do not require that you have a big collection: The casual draft mode takes no entry fee whatsoever and draft mode tournaments are supported by the tournament system in game!
[*] There is also a game mode where you play with preconstructed decks of various colors. The way it is presented makes it look like there will be various rotating events, but the game is not out long enough to know what will be offered in the future.
[*] If you like the deck building aspect, but don't want to spend much on your collection, there are currently communities forming around the ""pauper"" format. This is game mode where only common cards can be used. Buying all the common cards from the market place only costs a few Euros. The meta is going to be quite different in this format as essential uncommons and rares are not available in this format (e.g. Blink Dagger, a staple item in constructed, is uncommon).
[/list]

[b]--Card design--[/b]
The complaints below are no longer up to date, because as of patch 1.2. Valve decided that they will rebalance cards despite the disturbance to the market it may cause. The most problematic cards were addressed in that patch.
[strike]While overall the initial set seems to be a good starter set, there are a few very clear outliers, that make me question if there even is a coherent design philosophy.
The two most expensive cards on the market right now, Axe and Drow, are the best read and green heros, respectively. There is no reason whatsoever why you wouldn't include them if you play that color. They are so far above any competition, that even if you nerfed Axe by 1 Attack, or made Drow's Signature cost more Mana, they would STILL be the best hero of their color. I can imagine no reason that does not contain the word money for allowing this to happen.
Then there is the green card Cheating Death, that basically contradicts everything I wrote about randomness earlier. It is a card that gives each of your units in the lane a 50% to not die, if they would die, as long as there is a green hero in that lane. You cannot tell whether this will trigger or not beforehand, so you can't plan around it and just have to hope. And while it is likely not overpowered (being able to simply abandon a lane mitigates stuff like this), it is extremely unfun to play against and seems to work directly against the way that randomness is generally used in this game.
The fact that Valve will treat the cards like physical objects and not make changes to them, in order to not to disturb the market, makes it very unlikely anything will be changed about issues like that.[/strike]

[b]--Conclusion--[/b]
I feel relieved that Valve decided to change their stance towards rebalancing cards. Personally, I think that the unique gameplay makes it worth the initial price tag just to try it out. If the collectible aspect and the constructed game mode are not your focus, it is not going to be a huge money sink. However, I still feel a bit uneasy about recommending this game to others because of the monetization system. I'd suggest to keep that in mind when deciding whether to buy this game.",1544875797,1545596194,True,114,9,0.591017782688140869,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a PAY TO HAVE, PAY TO PLAY and PAY TO WIN game, with 0 game and deck progress for players who want to play ""free"". Has not any features or modes which will intigue you to play, as other card games do.
If you willing to pay some money, you can buy specific cards and make spesific decks which are practicaly and literally unbeatable. 0 challenge, 0 strategy.
That's my opinion after 72h playing, as a DotA, DotA 2 and many card games player. Very disappointed.


Updated / Additional Review | After the update of December 21th :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You can now get up to 15 tickets and card packs for the current season for free ( season will last ""few months""). I don't know if this is gonna be on every season, if it will be the same number of tickets and packs and how long will a season last to tell if 15 are many of few. It's better than nothing, which it was before, but maybe -or maybe not- it's a little cheese for the 48% of bad ratings. We'll see on the future.
- Account progress is now enabled and trackable, that's good, but I would like to see which are all these ""playstyle awards"" which give you extra exp. They are there, they work, but you don't know who they are.
- Some cards were nerfed, like Traxex and Axe, but still, there are these cards combinations that i reffered on my comments earlier which are unreal. That's still a big problem on the game balance.

I stopped playing Constructed, because I was mostly encountering these 2 decks and I'm playing only Draft for now, which I find more fair, because you can't pay just to copy unstoppable decks, it's based on strategy and a little bit on luck. I enjoy playing Draft, I don't like playing Constructed.

In conclusion, the update was a good thing. Of course they had to do it to fix the ratings ratio; it's a product and they want good ratings for good money. But there is still staff that needed to be added in my opinion; It's a big company with a big product on the background (DotA 2) to be just this. I guess more staff will be added on the near future.
Since there is not a ""neutral vote"" on the review and also the game is not balanced yet, I'll keep the ""No"" recommendation, which I hope I'll change on the next update(s).",1544893718,1545591235,False,514,13,0.768907308578491211,24,True,False,False

This is very refreshing compared to what at least one popular competitor does where the game has broken cards at least until next expansion comes ~6 months later. 

Pay2play aspect of this game is greatly exaggerated. Pay2play only applies to prize modes where you can win packs. These modes are rouhgly 1/3rd of the available modes. Even in prize modes If you  manage to get a positive win rate, you can win your tickets back, win packs and recycle or sell extra cards from won packs to get more tickets => your collection will grow and you dont have to put any money in. It's important to note that you can actually achieve a high win rate in Artifact due to a high skill ceiling and limited rng!

The games themselves are very intense! 3 lane mechanic gives the players so many options; where to deploy your 5 heroes of different colors (hero of a certain color allows you to play the cards of that color in that lane). Crosslane play, building up your heroes with modifiers and items, overwhelming your opponent with minions or lane improvements... there are so many strategies you can come up during a game on how to win, and the strategy can change during the game. This is especially highlighted in the draft modes (where the decks are build from a selection of random cards). Winning or losing can often be tracked to some key decisions made during a match which is very rewarding for the player.

Gonna have a quick dinner, then it's back to the board!

All I can say is I haven't bought a single card, and yet I'm having a lot of fun. Maybe it's because I was a MTG fan, so this game feels right at home. But this is a tad more complex compared to MTG, definitely more complex than HS.

If Valve continues to improve the progression, add expansions, and so on, this is gonna be one heck of a game for diehard and hardcore fans.

For the general gaming audience, I don't see it being extremely appealing mainly because it requires ""too much"" of thinking, reading, calculation, strategy... over mindless gung ho' running and gunning.

So I just don't see artifact becoming HUGE, and we shouldn't expect it to be so.

But who knows!

Anyway , it is what it is.

Not sure why people spend so much time complaining about the cash economy and all that when the free modes are already a ton of fun.

The thing that makes me hopeful for the future is that they are willing to balance their cards in a bad/unfun/unbalanced meta going forward. Blizzard does it as well, and it works. Changing my review to a positive. There is a creative and deep game to be had here and the cards are pretty inexpensive.

---- original review ---

I've played artifact a fair amount and I think I can have enough to make a preliminary assessment on this game. It's a good game, plagued with fairly deep problems. The biggest problem in my opinion is the game balancing. There are cards that are strictly better than other cards. There are a handful of cards (the expensive ones) that will decide games entirely on their own. Games often come down to who has those cards in their decks, and who can get them out the fastest. The only way that I can think to fix this is by an overhaul in balancing of the hero cards. *All* of the hero cards need to be balanced to offer creative strategies. Right now the power is concentrated in only a handful of cards.

This isn't a P2W complaint. Even if you own every card in the game, only a minority of the cards are playable, and since decks don't actually run that many cards, you wind up playing against the same set of decks over and over again, and seeing the same cards again and again. Did you enjoy losing to Gust+combo, where you sit there powerless, unable to even take your turn? Plenty more where that came from.

That is not to say that there is not a good strategy TCG underneath the mess, because there is. There is a lot of creativity here and there is a lot to like, but I don't see valve coming down next month with sweeping changes to fix this. The other problems are the lack of progression, lack of rewards, no daily quests, nothing to grind for. Most games might be a fun time waster but you never feel like you're working towards something or accomplishing anything. Some people like the fact that there's no direct incentive to log in each day, but imo, it gives you something to look forward to. This game does not offer the player something to look forward to and I think that sums up my experience with this game.",1545350235,1545539755,True,0,0,0.540229856967926025,1,True,False,False

The negative reviews make no sense to me and suggest a lack of understanding or snap opinions without actually digging in or thinking about it much. You can draft for free and the game thrives in draft modes. If you need incentive to do well then you can draft for $1 and potentially win prizes.

If you prefer constructed then you can buy just the cards you need from other players. That's game changing. It costs way more to build a deck in Hearthstone than it does in Artifact. Additionally, the cards you buy don't become worthless like other online card games since you can always sell them.

Finally, the reason why they can't have a way to earn free cards (at least not yet) is because you can't have a card marketplace for trading/buying/selling cards if cards are entering the economy for free. Cards would have no value if they kept entering the economy for free. Eventually maybe they can offer just commons or cards from older sets as cards you can earn for free. For now though it doesn't make sense to give cards away.

In Artifact you can draft completely for free though, and this is the reason why I bought Artifact. There is a free Draft mode, there are free community tournaments and there are also Prize Draft modes which cost an entry ticket, but also have potential rewards if you do well.

Any match I win, I feel like i outplayed the opponent and any game I lose, I notice points where I made mistakes that led to it. RNG definitely exist in Artifact, but it's almost always something you can interact with before the outcome is settled. The more skilled player wins a much much larger percent of the time.

Valve's recent about face on balance and economy paradigms have given me an extra layer of respect for the game. Choosing to balance actively, including nerfs AND buffs to cards is very important in a game where such iconic heroes are so core to a game. To have a favorite hero card be bad and stay bad would've been very sad, but instead Valve decided it would be worth balancing very aggresively and actively, which I think was by far the better decision.  Not only that, but Valve has shown great understanding of their game and its balance with the first round of nerfs and buffs to cards. Strong cards maintained playability despite being nerfed while weak cards were made playable and even given new roles.

The change in economy to include some free card packs for playing a decent amount each season was an excellent choice. Player retention early on was poor due to a lack of achievement other than self fufilment and the new grindable card packs helps fix that greatly. It makes the game more accessible and more affordable to a wider audience which is key to becoming more than a niche game.

The tournament system built into the game is one of its greatest features and has helped connect me to different communities of players to get more out of the game. Being able to post a link and have up to 128 players join for a competitive environment for draft or constructed tournaments for FREE is truly incredible and is a large portion of how I spend my time playing Artifact.

Most of the issues I had with the game were fixed within the first three weeks of launch. As long as they continue their upward trajectory of excellent patches and awesome new features, this game is in for a bright future.

Pros:
-Skill wins over luck in every match
-Variety of deck archetypes
-Variety of ways to play, free and paid
-New progression includes free to play options
-Valve has shown competence in nerfing and buffing cards
-Tournament system is incredible
-Draft mode is excellent and well balanced.

Cons:
-Rough launch means lower player count than one would hope.
-Progression is shallow for now (Expect additions in the near future though)
-Buy to play only
-While less expensive in general than Hearthstone or similar analogs. It's harder to grow your collection unless you're a good player.

I enjoyed the game even before the patch, but was starting to get mildly frustrated. The patch sets a very good precedent that the game will be atteneded to and it went above and beyond not only addressing pretty much every major issue the community had with the game including adding free packs for playing, profile progression, nerfing overpowered cards, and where they went beyond was buffing underpowered cards. Cards that were otherwise strictly worse than similar cards now have unique buffs to make them much more exciting.

As soon as the patch dropped, I made a Cheating Death deck because I wanted to have a sacrifice deck but did not like relying on the randomness of the card. (For reference, Cheating Death used to have a 50% chance to save a unit each time it would die, now you activate it to save 1 unit per turn.) This change made cheating death more fun to play for both sides of the board.

Lion is another card that has been buffed and I am currently having a lot of fun playing a deck centered around a long term control plan with many cards with persistent effects that eventually stack up to overwhelm the opponent.

It is good to see that Artifact likely won't just die out and I plan on continuing to enjoy the game and will continue to pester my friends into buying it.


Cost:
I have spent about $60-70 USD on the game. If you plan to play Draft the game will never cost more than the $20 base cost. As mentioned at the start of the review I play only constructed, and have been able to build just about every deck I've wanted. 

There are some very good cards that run from $2-5 that you may need a few of, but since they are so good their use carries over between decks, otherwise most cards are on about 10 cents. Going in with a Budget of $40-60 dollars should be enough to enjoy constructed.",1545473390,1545473909,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

And also is not even fun. There is a ticket system. If you spend one ticket then you could go for ""expert play"".The most person has best deck won.And you can not lost 2 times, you have to win 5 games in a role or only lose one time in 6 games.

The good:
•	Gameplay - It is fun and at the same time complex enough. It feels like you have so many options to decide plays at any turn. You have enough cards in your hand to make pretty complex plays and even think one or two turns ahead. Thinking about what cards your opponent might have in his hand and what he could play, gives a lot of advantage. The game has a lot of randomness to it, but your choices feel impactful and mitigate the randomness.
* Economy – you can buy any card you want from market place. You do not have to grind for days and open packs for a chance to get the card you want. It is much fairer than games like Hearthstone. When buying the game you get basic set of cards, 5 boosters and option to unlock further 15 boosters. If you don’t like some of the cards you can sell them. Sure some of them will lose value with time and Valve takes a cut on the top, but at least you can sell them for something.
•	Game modes – there are multiple ones you can choose. Everyone is complaining about Prize play, but it is not mandatory to play it. It is a pretty though mode - you need to be really good or lucky to win it. I think it should stay the way it is – it needs to be though to win booster packs. If you don’t like the mode, just don’t play it. In standard modes you are able to grind for rank, so it’s good enough incentive to play the game.
•	Competitive – many competitive communities have popped up. Players are willing and seeing the game as big potential for eSports. Will it succeed is a different question.
•	Support – Valve has shown with multiple games, that they are willing to support and improve their games. They are listening to their community and trying to fix the issues that are present. I think that the support for this game during first 2 years should be quite good. Let’s see what happens afterwards. Might be that the game will be dropped, like many others (TF2, CSGO, L4D).

The bad:
•	Current state - the game has been released in an unfinished state. There are many features missing – like game history, player profiles, demos etc. After release it came as barebones product as it could be. It still need a lot of patches and updates. Valve has shown that they are willing to work on the issues, but question is whether the community will stay long enough to see those issues get resolved.
•	Player, viewer counts – because of the game state many players decided to leave the game. This of course has impact also on money flow for Valve and general game health. Currently it does not seem to be an issue and the game is slowly recovering. 
•	Game complexity – for new players and viewers the game might seem to complex, therefore it might seem hard to get into it.

That's why I was really disappointed when the game released and the backlash against almost every facet of the game happened. People tore into the economy/market, the lack of features (this is a fair point), RNG, stale constructed meta, the paywall, and whatever else they found issue with. I watched the player numbers plummet day after day all while lurking a variety of communities looking for well thought-out critiques of the game amongst the shit-posting. And I realized that if the game wasn't made by Valve we would not have seen nearly as much vitriol and one of my favorite games would of died.

But thankfully this game system is indeed being developed by Valve. And after some radio silence, they released two updates back to back directly addressing many of the concerns raised by the larger community. While it's early to see if those changes are enough to sustainably turn the ship around; I've already noticed anectodally a lot more ""content"" being produced on youtube about the game. Before, there was barely any and I went searching for it. Communities are buzzing now, and while there's still detractors and trolls the discourse isn't a trash fire anymore.

Valve wasn't going to let the game die and it's very promising to me that they listened to feedback and did some complete turn arounds on the initial vision for the game, namely in progression and card balancing. Callously, you could say that it's a pure business decision and I don't doubt that's a factor; but it's also an extreme sign of maturity and humility for a group of people to take a hard look at their creative project and admit maybe the initial vision wasn't the best for the current state of digital card games.

583950,47697210,76561198006113452,0,5,659,0,659,1545435895,"TL;DR -- I like the game. It's fun. Maybe wait until Valve makes it better with future sets/updates. The recent updates made the game significantly better. I love card games--I have high hopes for the future.

I have been playing TCG and CCG games for quite a while, whether it was Yugioh or Magic (and many others). Or even digital, like HearthStone, Magic Arena, Eternal, etc.
I am not saying that I am the best person at these games--I just genuinely enjoy them.
That being said, Aritfact definitely had a rocky start. However, Valve has shown that they do care about the game and have even changed their stance about balancing cards. Recently, a couple of cards experienced a balance change (some nerfs, some buffs). This is EXCELLENT news because, as any person can imagine, balance is crucial for a game's success.

The gameplay is more complex, but with a little bit of focus, it is easy to understand. There is a high skill ceiling, which is great for any card game (I am not one of those people). The RNG in the game, which may seem bad, does end up being fun to play around. More importantly, the RNG is not 100% factored into your win rate, unlike, for example, some of HearthStone's cards. That is not to say that RNG does not exist--it most certainly does. And, at times, it can even annoy/irritate you. But, usually, it can be played around since you *see* the RNG unfold before the combat actually begins (in other words, you can react to it better).

For those familiar with Hearthstone and Eternal (etc.), Artifact does not let you ""dust"" (break down / disenchant) excess cards. Getting extra cards requires you to either break them down in-game for tickets, or sell them to other players that want the card. Unless the card is higher rarity, not many may want the card. This market has its ups and downs. The upside is that you can, instead, purchase the card(s) you want DIRECTLY from another player. You wouldn't need to purchase countless packs to ""dust"" the extras, to then craft the card(s) you want (this could save you lots of money). However, that also comes at a downside, too. There are no daily quests or anything that can help you work towards a full collection for free (if that is something you want). You MUST buy packs from Valve or buy cards from other players if you want to do get better cards (or, in other words: you may have to invest money).
That being said.... recently, Valve added account level to the game. This lets players unlock *free* packs and tickets, per season. So, while it may not be a ""daily"", there is some progression now. *thumbs up*

Also, it is important to mention that standard play is 100% free. Whether you choose to do competitive or draft, you can no problem. If you want to, you could choose to spend some tickets on the prize mode. If you achieve higher than a 50% winrate, you can walk away with your ticket(s) back, in addition to some free packs. Be careful though!

While I do enjoy the game and, yes, I do recommend it... I have to say that it may be best to wait until Valve continues to add more features to the game, to continue improving it. They are, as of the date of this review, most definitely making the game better. The recent patch proves it. But, I also do believe they have a ways to go, if they want this to be one of the best card games on the market.",1545455582,1545455582,True,1,0,0.521997034549713135,0,True,False,False

1) GAMEPLAY: Now, the gameplay is absolutely phenomenal, like the most complex board game ever created. It features intricacy and great depth, allowing it to be quite a skill test when determining the winner of any match. RNG exists, but your capability to adapt on the fly is the real skill in the game. Also, there are ways to play around the RNG if you so desire, eg, playing cards like Ventriloquy or Pick a Fight if arrow RNG is bogging you down. Sometimes RNG does decide the winner of a game, but more often than not, one can always trace back the decisions that allowed the game to be decided on coinflip and consider the other outs one would have had. 
I'll admit that the card set at launch could be a little less like other card games and more to capitalise on the fresh mechanics that Artifact brings to the table, but it is only the base set of cards and I'm certain as we move on to new expansions, this issue will remedy itself.
Balance is great, heroes have their own niches and are tech choices in themselves - eg if we want to capitalise on a certain niche in our red black deck, we could run Sorla for running at towers, Tinker for Midrange aoe or Lich for a more control oriented deck. Some heroes feel a bit weak and unplayable due to their poor stats or sigs, but it's really only very few and most heroes are constructed playable. maybe with the new patch, blue seems a bit strong? but let's see when the meta settles. 

2) BALANCING: Valve has done something historic with their last update, freely buffing and nerfing cards despite their original ""market-driven economy and thus no balancing"" policy. This sets an incredible precedent for balancing to come, and they did address all of the problem areas in balancing. Hats off to Valve. 
Some rares do feel like they're in the card pool just to make other rares feel rarer - I know Garfield said that rarity =/= power but honestly finding rares in packs is so polarising. It's either OH WOW KANNA or goddamn im getting 3 cents off the market for this Watchtower. I do have some suggestions to even the playing field a little, but this isn't the forum for that.
Sometimes constructed does feel a bit p2w if you're severely lacking in collection, but homebrew groups like the Artifact pauper or peasant communities hold regular scrims and tournaments and it truly does emulate the cardshop experience. I was lucky to unbundle a Kanna and some annihilations and AACs, so I had a viable mono blue deck from the get go - beating decks that cost several times more quite frequently.

3) FLAVOUR: If you're a lorehead like me, this game will absolutely blow you away. All the cards interact with one another in a dynamic way, really lending to the immersive feel that every game is it's own little universe. A fun one I love hearing is the Red Mist guys played on Legion Commander's side of the board say, ""These are truly strange times, commander."". The heroes react to occurences on the game board just like in dota, talking about their allies, enemies, items equipped, cards played and so on. 
The game board feels rich and colourful, the imps add a lot to the ambience as well. They have the cutest reactions and I love how they're trying to talk to the player - hey the opponents board is empty hit the ancient, or, oh no we're being lethaled this turn. It certainly makes the game feel a lot less dry and math-y much like a lot of people have complained about. 
Every single card has it's own little blurb of story, reminds me a lot of the flavour text on old magic and DM cards that helped me immerse myself in their universe. The voice acting is phenomenal and it adds a layer of EU to the (not-so-great) dota lore that I've followed for a decade. 

4) PROGRESSION: Well they just done added it. Seems like all I've been asking for since the beginning - a couple of tickets and packs every once in a while to keep me, a pretty much f2p player, hooked. I feel like the system that they have implemented is great, it reminds me of the progression in old gwent (a game i loved muchly, not so much new gwent). They have all these achievements that give u a liiittle bit more xp at the end of the game that are actually quite validating, like winning with 1 tower hp or buffing a hero to 30hp, gives u a bit of additional workaround if you're into that kind of thing. 
Going 2-2 in any expert format still feels terrible, maybe implementing one casual consolation prize would go a long way with the casual playerbase.

5) UI AND WHATNOT: Everything in the game feels fluid and organic, be it the collection manager, recycling cards, drafting for gauntlet, the emoting, the keybinds. It feels like a perfectly polished client that seems smooth and cosy to navigate. (I know there's a lot of hullabaloo about missing features and we still beta, but this is a personal opinion). Shoutout to the new emotes system, I've never had more fun BMing in any game before, they are absolutely great. The ability to react to things that you or your opponent does adds the social facet that the game was always missing.



This game is a full 5/5 stars. It is a game that I didn't know I wanted until I saw the first preview tournament - which led to a six month long hunger of trying to catch every little bit of content that came out. I don't think any game I've ever played meets my niche dream game requisities like Artifact does - If you like CCGs as well as dota, I wouldn't even hesitate to pick this game up. Don't let the low playerbase / reddit hate train discourage you, this game is a must-recommend for me and I've been singing its praises all year.

Here's the twist -> you can outbid your opponent. So, if you're deck is based on silencing heroes you may want to buy out all three Jasper Daggers, or if you rely on improvements you would want to try to buy out Demagicking Maul.

Thought I would edit this with my updated playtime.

Valve has now either fixed these issues via updats or have changed their stance and are fixing 'broken' effects and adding cool effects to cards (such as Quicken)

I feel a lot of the negative reviews are outdated so thought I would do my part in bringing this game to the rating it deserves. (CERTAINLY is no longer deserving of the 52% rating). Would urge any new viewers of the store page to check any dates of reviews and trust more in those posted (or edited) after the 20th December (Latest update)",1543453789,1545430018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many negative reviews saying that it's a ""credit card game"" and that it's just there to soak up your wallet's cash. This really isn't true, or at least it isn't more true for this game than other card games. See, Valve does ask for a $20 entrance fee, and the only way to get cards (at least on launch) was by straight buying them from the market. But you want to know what other game uses this exact same model but is way worse yet well beloved? Magic: The Gathering. Yes, I know technically magic is free to play and you can borrow decks from friends and whatnot, but regardless you still need to pay for every single card in magic, the same you do in Artifact. But the card prices in Artifact are about 10 times cheaper than those in Magic, and that's intentional.

Firstly, there's no ""Legendary"" or ""Mythic Rare"" equivalent in Artifact. There's only 3 rarities, so there's not going to be any of those insane $80 cards like there are in Magic. In fact, the most expensive card right now is like $8.00. And a huge number of cards, even good ones, are below 15 cents. This means you can make basically any budget deck you want for the price of a coffee, and a full collection costs way less than Magic or Hearthstone's classic collection. AND you get to play what you want. The grind just isn't there. Unless you really want to play top tier competitive decks, this is a much better deal than those games, and even if you are the person who wants to play those decks, they're going to cost a fraction of what that would take in Magic, or goodness forbid trying to buy enough packs in HS just hoping to get what you want.

Secondly, even if this doesn't interest you, Artifact has a free competitive draft mode. If you only know about HS, basically think of this like a free Arena but with no rewards. You just get to play with fun. So for a flat $20 you can still play the game  in a competitive format. Almost all of my playtime has been in draft, and it's great. 

Lastly, Valve just updated the game, and not only did they inroduce a mechanism to earn packs for free just by playing, they also said they're going to do card balance, and have already begun buffing and nerfing particular cards. This is actually amazing, because it seemed for a long time they were only going to change cards as a last resort to keep the market value of cards stable, but the balance means they are now going to be actively involved in keeping a competitive and fun meta game, and I am thrilled about Artifact's future. 

Overall, really good. There are still some gameplay concerns, but this has to be one of the deepest and best value for money CCG's on the market now.",1545429438,1545429438,True,3,0,0.519194483757019043,0,True,False,False

I'm a massive Dota fan ndn was quite scepitcal about this game, after having watched some of the early vidoes of beta testers playing this.
It seemed too complicated and confusing, however perseverence has soon made this a very thoroughable and frustrating game.
It requires a lot of thought during the gameplay, the strategy is a little chess like, although there are random elements to it, which is know as RNG (Random Number Generator!!). This RNG can irritate and frustrate when you have out thought and out played one's opponent only to get foiled by this element at the last gasp, thus snatching the proverbial defeat from the jaws of victory. 
Don't be put off by the complaints of pay to win, as a casual player there are enough variations of gameplay that require no cost in buying cards to enjoy the free elements of it (apart from the intial purchase price)
Of course the die hards may complain about the market and professional aspect of it, but I don't think it seems unreasonable to have to fund the cost of development.
The card appearances are not exactly to my taste, I think they could have made them less 'arty and serious', and to make them more fun looking, especially when you compare them to the really awesome looking animations in the Gwent cards (Witcher based card game).
I hope this game survives and thrives. There are a lot of justifiable criticisms, but if Valve can take them on board and not get defensive but improve the gameplay regularly I will continue to play and enjoy this more than I thought I would.
I stroingly suggest watch people playing this over streaming or recorded content on the interweb to see how this works and whether the intial game cost is enough to tempt and tease one to dive into this universe!
I hope so!
Good Luck to all.

The Bad (I removed every negative points except one):

- The business model is overall pretty backward and P2W. They could have sold cosmetics and/or full expansion packs instead.

The Good:

- The game is fookin good. This is best card game I played in my life. I would say it's more a turn-based strategy game than a simple card game.
- It's very, very deep. There's a ton of variety and complexity. You can play the same set of cards for hundreds of hours without figuring all the possible strategies and situations. Many things can happen, and despite the random factors, there's enough agency and a lot of mindgame potential. (Note: don't play that if you want and expect a fast mobile card game à la hearthstone. This is really something that drains all the energy of your brain.)
- Free Draft! This is basically all I play. The replayability is endless and that's the only way to play with all the cards without paying.
- The multiple premade decks(""Call to Arms"" atm) that can be played within a separated matchmaking queue. If you have no money and/or no time for deckbuilding, this is the easiest way to learn the game and get fair (and fun) matches.
- Creating a deck by buying cards is cheaper than you might think. If you exclude the handful of overpriced cards on the market, you can build a decent deck for 10-15euros, which is not necessary a meta deck but can be exactly the deck you want. Most cards, even some heroes cost around 0.04$.
- Valve will never give up on this game. If people keep complaining, if the game loses too much popularity, they will prefer to change their business model than letting it die. (already confirmed by the last update)
- (new) They want to continuously balance their cards instead of keeping some of them broken for the market.

Conclusion (udpated):

I really love it and I slowly considering putting money in the game because the price are just  getting lower and lower. The complaints are still fair, but If you're like me you can still have a lot of fun without buying stuff. Despite its flaws it's an amazing and unique game, and it's just the beginning.",1543719611,1545426631,True,2,0,0.525074303150177002,0,True,False,False

Its core is one of the most innovative card games I've played in years and definitely the best purely digital one. It is focused on hardcore audience and demands an investment from its players - be it time to properly learn the game or just simply money. I will not describe how the game works, there are plenty of better people for that. 

[h1]GAME[/h1]
Upon release the game lacked several ""core"" features, such as profiles, some progression system (even though I personally do not really need it) and even the balance of the cards was off.  Valve just released a new patch with card balance (biggest change in my book) and some progression system. Should that be there upon release? Yes, definitely but Valve reacts quickly and is making the game better really fast.

And boy, does the game feel right! Matches are longer than the competititors but every single match is just so tense, you are on the edge of your seat and hope you just outsmarted your opponent and will be able to destroy his tower. 
It just feels so different to finally play a card game when deck building is not 80% of the skill and you actually need to make so many decisions to come up victorious. 

[i]Should I just kill this hero now? Or wait one more turn, so he doesn't have him during his most crucial turn.

Where should I deploy my heroes? What color of spells will I need in what lane? 

Should I actually kill my hero now so I can get him back just in time for hist big combo? 
[/i]

There is so much going on! You need to actually think! It's great! The RNG plays its role a lot in matches, but you generally can plan around it and work with it. But sometimes, it just screws you, like in any card game. 

[h1]ECONOMY[/h1]
The game is not F2P. You pay for card packs (well, you get some more with the new progression system), you pay for an opportunity to get more card pack and you can buy the single cards for real money.

And I'm one of the weird people who actually likes it more this way. I seriously hate F2P card games - they always put so many hooks and ""incentives"" to get you to play the game even when you don't want to. I don't want to play today? OOPS you just lost your opportunity to finish you dailies, you're getting behind! You want this card? Better disenchant 4 other cards or just, you know, BUY milion other packs and hope! I hate grind, I don't want to play a game to finish some quest, so I can get coins to buy pack to MAYBE get the card I want. I am a grown up, I'd rather pay some money for it thank you. Needless to say that the normal cards in Artifact are so cheap that I don't even care.

I'm not saying this TCG system is the best I could imagine but hell, I'll always take it over F2P grindfest, which actuallly ends up even more expensive than Artifact.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
If you like hardcore card games then Artifact is a must to at least try. It plays differently, it's tense, smart and you would seriously feel good about beating your opponents. It has many flaws but I have a firm believe that Valve will make the game better over time.

The draft mode is incredibly fun and very skill testing. I have high hopes for the game when the next couple expansion sets hit and how the gameplay improves. Some of the key issues involving progression, ranking, and game balancing were addressed very nicely in the most recent update. 

While you can now earn a limited amount of cards for free each season from the recent update, I must fully warn you that you will most likely need to spend some amount of money on this game in the long run. Unlike the other f2p card games out there, Artifact does not hide the fact that you need to spend money to play this game and I think a lot of people were put off by that. What I think people fail to metion is that with the other f2p games you will likely spend money as well, because I know I have. You just might not feel too bad about it when you do spend the money. It really is a matter of perception and psychology. I do however think that Artifact will be the ""cheapest"" game out of those if you DO SPEND MONEY to get cards. 

Overall, the core gameplay is very good and well worth your time if you like card games and strategy games. The gameplay is incredibly deep and every game plays differently.

People that are complaining about the monetization have a case I will admit: The strongest two cards of each color aren't as cheap as the rest of the set combined, but I feel you can still have fun in constructed even without that.

That being said, most of my time has come from drafting. Artifact's drafting is honestly perfect. I mean, it can screw you at times by giving you the same three terrible heroes that nobody wants over and over again, but isn't that kind of the point of draft? 

Anyway, people complaining about having to pay for competitive modes is pretty silly. Casual is not any different from competitive besides the tickets/rewards system. You're not missing out on anything besides the thrill of earning packs on a good draft run or trying to earn your ticket back after a bad early draft loss. It's a risk/reward system which is surprisingly generous, at least in Phantom Draft, the mode I play.

And if you aren't into that kind of risk/reward system, just go play casual draft. It's no different.

I understand the need of balancing the cards constantly, but not when this game offers the posibility to buy individual cards from the market. I mean I paid for cheating death to give me 50% chances to save ALL my troops from the lane not just one (if I have the initiative). Now there's not even a point to have it in the deck. Instead you left TOT as it was, which is the most broken single card in the game. 

The fact that you can have at least 3x7 mana cards in the starting draw (just because you have PA for example in your deck) is again pathetic. Just follow Heartsone's example and let us redraw the first cards if we want to. I've been so many times stuck for 2 rounds with no cards to play... (for those who don't know, you start with 3 mana and add 1 each round)

The hero placing at the beginning of the game is also terrible. I mean if I'm playing blue+green the game makes sure to find an opponent who plays black/red and my heroes will be spawned in front of theirs just to make sure I will lose 3 heroes in the 1st round :). 

The easiest feature to implement has been left for patch. How hard was it to have in day 1 stats of the wins/played games??? 

On the plus side, I like the design, the game itself is easy to understand and master. There are no two identical matches because of the multitude of cards and item combinations and the randomness of creep spawns. The artists have done an amazing job and I salute the developers for a (so far) bug-free experience. It is pretty hard at a first glance to learn to manage your cards+items when you play on 3 different ""lanes"", but a few hours in the game will help you. However, even early in the match, making a single mistake may give you 0 chance to win. On the plus side, the matches are short (with an average of 20 minutes). 

I wouldn't recommend the game though. It's incredibly frustrating. Although it's a Premium game, it's clearly a pay to win, since no one is lucky enough to get all the buffed heroes, cards and items in the free packs. And right after you pay for them, here comes an updated to make sure that you've thrown the money out the window.

The game does not allow for you to learn a lot about the game without either paying a lot of attention to videos and streams of the game or experimenting with the various cards and gamemodes, but if you want more cards to experiment with, you have to play expert gauntlet which requires tickets. Since you're probably not that good at this point, the risk of you losing tickets is pretty high and sometimes it can be down to RNG. Although I do enjoy the game, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not big into card games and/or does not have a lot of money they are willing to sink into it. I think it would have been much better if Valve had made the game free, and had made packs/tickets cheaper. Note that tickets are almost £5. You could get hours of entertainment buying a good game on sale for that rather than a slight chance of winning 2 packs. e.g. You could get a game like Hollow Knight for around £7 on sale which grants you up to 100 hours of content or you could get 2 tickets or 3-4 packs. Buy at own caution.

EDIT: If you like me, find draft modes more fun anyway, then you can literally just play those on casual and not spending any more money will have no effect. In which case, feel free to buy it. You'd probably enjoy it.

The game is now more affordable, more balanced, and has better progression than when it was launched.

From a gameplay perspective, this is the best digital TCG available. Valve proves that they're willing to make fundamental changes to their entire design philosophy in order to make it successful.

---

If you get the game now, you get 5 packs to start with, but can earn up to 15 free packs per season (we don't know how long seasons will last as of yet). Packs are earned by leveling up (which also gives cosmetics and event tickets), so there's no need to win, just to play. A new player without a collection can earn levels (as well as MMR ranks) by playing phantom draft, which is completely free and the most popular competitive mode. 

In addition, you can buy singles via the community market. As of the present review, the cost of a full collection, including 1x every hero and 3x every other card, is 130 dollars. 

Between the free packs and the community market, a savvy player who is not content with draft wants to break into constructed can probably earn a functionally complete collection, consisting of every meta deck, for less than 100 dollars. This price is more likely to drop in the future than to rise. So, for slightly more than the cost of a AAA game, you get a complete TCG with every single card.

The main balance issues (Axe,  Cheating Death, Drow) have all been mega clapped with the nerf bat. They even tweaked an item (Jasper Daggers) to give deck builders a powerful counter to stuns and silences. 

My personal favorite changes have been the buffs to some of the dumpster heroes (eg. Lion). His special ability got its cooldown heavily buffed, which should make for some very exciting gameplay.

You don't get this in other card games. You don't ever need to touch the ""competetive"" part of the game if you don't feel like it. I've played hearthstone and MTG - Arena, and while this payment model is different, I don't find it predatory. I would argue it's the opposite, since you can access the entire card pool for the initial purchase. The pricing for cardpacks also seem better than MTG - arena, since you get more cards in a pack, for a lower cost, with less card being locked behind different rarities.

EDIT: I've now played the game four about ~40 hours. Funny thing is, I can actually sell the cards I've earned and get back all of the 17 or so dollars I spent buying the game. If the market for rare cards stays alive I can def see draft players going infinte if they keep selling the rare cards they get on the market. I can even imagine good draft players ""earning"" a couple of bucks if they can keep a high win ratio. Obviously this only applies for players who care more about drafting then getting a ""complete"" card collection for construced play.

Edit2: Sold back some of the more expensive cards I got in packs. I earned around 24 euro in total. I spent around 24 euro on the game in total. I've played around 85~ hours. Never touched constructed. 

Only part of this game that could EVER be considered ""pay 2 win"" would be the constructed part. There's really little incentive to ever touch that, unless you really enjoy that aspect of the game, and even then, the money you have to shell out to get a competetive deck pales in comparison to games like heartstone and mtg arena.",1543496466,1545401042,True,11,0,0.508561849594116211,0,True,False,False

I think the price for the game is fair, it is the basic price for a starter deck in Magic: The Gathering, and you even get a lot more value than that. If you're lucky with the packs you get, you could potentially earn some of the price back by selling the most valuable cards.

I have not felt the need to buy packs, since the game has a bunch of options for playing free - for constructed play you can choose pre-constructed decks playing against others with the same decks, in addition to this, people online are constructing competetive decks which costs almost nothing if buying the cards off the marketplace (no, you don't need Axe or Drow Ranger to win in this game... ). There is also casual draft mode, which I mainly play, which costs nothing. 

The game is missing some key features such as a simple profile page where you could show off your achievements and collection, some simple progression either ranked or levels like Dota 2. However, I am sure these things will come in due time - It does not decrement my enjoyment of this game, I am just glad it's finally out.

What happens when you buy the game is that you're given 5 tickets, which are necessary to play draft mode, which is the game's only interesting aspect. The thing is, you're gonna run out of tickets in like 10 to 15 hours since the reward system is way harsher than other card games. What is the problem with that you might be wondering?

Well the problem is that you simply CAN'T buy tickets with in-game currency! You will have to pay with real money to get tickets, there is no other way. In fact there is no in game currency, no daily quests like in Hearthstone. You will have to pay everything with real money if you want to continue to play.

Now why did I say that the reward system is very punishing? Let's compare with Hearthstone, a game I know well and its main competitor. In HS arena, if you get a 50% winrate or less (3-3 or less), you get part of your 150 gold back. In artifact, with a 50% winrate, you get litteraly nothing. 

Maybe you're going to say that you are very skilled at the game and you will have way above 50% winrate, well you won't be rewarded either: In HS for the max number of wins (12) you get at least 300 gold, which means you can get 2 more arena runs. On top of that you get 2 packs. Well in artifact for the max number of wins you get  back your entry fee of 1 ticke and 2 packs, that's all. On top of that, out of the 24 cards you get out of those packs, you're gonna have to sell 20 because that is the price of a ticket, and you have no other way of getting tickets. Which leaves you with 2 tickets and 1/3 of a pack. For a max wins run. 

Furthermore, in HS if you run out of gold you just wait a few days, do your daily quests, and you're back in the game. In artifact, you run out of tickets, you pay. There's no other way. So no matter if you are a good player or not , you're gonna get screwed anyway because the game just doesn't want you to win. The game wants you to lose so you can pay.

In conclusion, I have rarely seen a game with such a vicious financial system. The reward system is unfair, you have no in game currency, and on top of that you have to pay to get the game! So if you're bored with you current card game: HS, shadowverse, Gwent, I guarantee you that it is way better that this game. Stay away, don't buy it, even if you can afford it. Because all you gonna do is encourage game companies to go further and further into this rapacious system.

---------------

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: I don't recommend in the current state. Without ways to expand your collection by playing, there is no real motivation to play.

EDIT: 
I realized that I'm not a player that Valve thinks I am. I don't play card games for winning with other players, I play them mostly for the fun on building decks, exploring new possibilities, and progressing with the collection, so winning is just a means to do this. The way Artifact is currently constructed, it only caters to those that are fond of winning for winning's sake. All the things that make a card game for me (building, expanding, progressing, exploring) are removed and condensed to a single thing - a monetary transaction.

As it is currently constructed, there is nothing in Artifact for me. It's not even that the game is too expensive. It's more that 'winning progression' is what's fun in my case. You make that purchase only and you remove that fun.

Damn, Valve did a great job with this game. 

Pros:
- The game is VERY deep. Even the best pro's still agree that they learn something new every day.
- Its skill based in the purest form. RNG is done ""right"" - it makes the game interesting, but it doesn't decide games by itself. Trust me, it doesn't. If you lose to a coin flip, you should have done something to not get to this situation in the first place.
- Three-lane gameplay means that combo decks are in check and with good deployment you can overcome even stronger decks.
- Controversely, by not being free2play, its very cheap! Marketplace means you can always get what you want without having to rely on RNG, and you can actually get some sweet value for your money.

Cons:
- The game is hard. You'll learn the basics in a few games, but getting deployment right, playing for initiative and other subtle mechanics will take you hundreds of games to fully understand. Be warned, you won't get any wins for free here. Great players casually mantain 80%+ winrate. (In the end, is this even a Con? Depends on what you want.)
- Games usually take a little bit longer than in MTG, Heartstone or others. Don't expect to jam that many games to your standart evening.

My thoughts about the progression patch:
The progression system might be a bit over-generous, but the game needed it to recover its playerbase. And damn, you can't really complain about free stuff, right?
From a balance standpoint, I see a very bright future for Artifact. Nerfing opressive cards and buffing those which underperform is a beautiful thing which will keep the game interesting and the format might never be really ""solved"".

First things first, you pay 18€ for the game and get 10 packs and 5 tickets. A pack costs 1.75€ and 5 tickets cost 4.50€, so you kind of get your money back. 

The gameplay in this game is really good. It's a bit complex at first sight, but it gets easier to understand really fast. (one or two games, and you start learning some strategy)

You get three lanes each game, each one with a tower, and have to fight your way to either destroy 2 towers (each in a different lane) or destroy a tower and then the ancient (I think that's its name) that shows up after that - so basically destroy a lane twice. 

Your deck consists of 5 heroes (which are the major influence on your deck) and 60 other cards which can only be played if a hero of their color is in the lane you're playing.



[strike]I just have an issue with this game, as everyone seems to have. Monetisation. I really trust Valve with their design, I haven't seen them being too greedy when it comes to sucking money off their customers. However, this game seems to have some faults in the way that you get cards.[/strike]

[strike]First of, there's no way to progressively get cards. This [b]feels[/b] wrong because we're used to being able to trade our time for content inside a game (instead of money, which, in the end, is time anyway). I haven't seen an explanation on this decision by Valve (which makes it a bit more suspicious).[/strike]

However! you CAN play drafts with every card, without [b]paying a single dime[/b]. So technically, you're not paying to play the most important part of the game (deckbuilding), you're paying for the second most important part of the game (having a good, competitive deck).

Overall, really good game gameplay-wise. Feels a bit hard and costly to get a decent deck.

Particularly Valve's decision to take a more active approach to card balancing is going to make a massive positive difference for Artifact in the future. Blue is still a very unbalanced color, having both the most overpowered swarming spells as well the only board wipes needed to clear them, but as balance changes are likely made based on tournament results, I'm confident this too will be addressed over the coming weeks.

The game still does have a lot of, in my opinion unnecessary, RNG elements. I would personally prefer non-random hero deployment and arrows to be straight by default, allowing them to be directed sideways through card effects, but at least Valve seems to have realized the swingy RNG from card effects needs to be mitigated because Cheating Death has already been fixed. Furthermore, the amount of new features that have been added in the last three weeks alone are quite impressive.

Instead, it's structured like many physical trading card games. Frankly, I think they have implemented an extremely fair system that completely eliminates the grind you see in most other digital card games, but I can understand people who don't know the model going into the game being surprised by it. In fact, they even have an open marketplace to buy and sell cards, so once the dust settles, picking up the cards you need for your decks is likely going to be much cheaper than in a game like MTG.

Artifact is by far the BEST implementation of a digital card game that I have ever played. The game offers a depth that you simply don't find in any of its competitors and the matches are exhilarating. As long as you understand the payment model in advance, this is an incredibly easy game to recommend.

Edit: Per the request of the community, they've now implemented progression (skill rating and account levels with rewards) as well as card nerfs and a card refund policy on those nerfs.

The positives of the payment model are that instead of having to rely of RNG to get new cards (I.e Hearthstone), you can buy single cards to complete a deck (usually cost ~0.05 cents each; with a few exceptions). Plus your collection of cards actually retains value, so excess/ unwanted cards can be sold for credit on the steam market place. My collection from the complementery packs provided with the game is ~equal to the price of the game itself at this stage..

The negatives are that after opening the complementery starting packs there is almost no way to get any more free cards. I also wish you could directly trade cards with others rather than relying on the market place. I can see why this isn't allowed as Valve can't take a small cut... though why not make each direct trade cost a fraction of a cent or something?

Another aspect of this game which I think is in instelf worth games price is the phantom draft mode. In this gamemode you draft 60 cards over 5 packs to contruct a deck. You compete with this deck against random opponents until you either win 5 games or loose 2. While you don't keep the cards, the gamemode is completely free and is a great way fun way to learn the game. 

The community part of this game is at its current stage minimal. There is no competetive ranking system or profile stats, and the variety of cards is quite low. As this game has only just been released, I am certain that these features will be periodically implemented over future updates.
I still highly recommend this game, as it is by far the most fun and complex TCG I have ever played.

EDIT: Valve has recently released an update which addresses my criticisms of the game. Progression and social features have now been implemented. The most broken cards have now been nerfed, and some of the weaker cards have been buffed.",1543880108,1545386256,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

if you want to buy a casual card game this isnt likely the one.  you cant earn free cards like you can in other games.  the amount you can earn is limited.  meaning you have to buy the rest off of the market or from packs.  so if you wanted a CCG, this likely isnt the best choice on a limited budget.

originally this game made you buy all the cards.  this gave the cards value.  this has changed with the introduction of account levels and free packs from certain thresholds.  if you were interested in a TCG this change just killed that aspect.  all those players who bought the game now will return, get their free cards, sell them off driving prices down, and leave again once there is no more free stuff to gain.  of course there is this delusion that will get people playing in larger numbers and it will for a time, but after the well runs dry of free goodies it will return to the state it was in that prompted this change.

overall this means that eventually the game will be f2p, but it isnt yet.  currently it fails to be a f2p ccg or a p2p tcg and is withering somewhere in the middle.

its a shame too because the game is solid, fun, with some new ideas.  i like the game a lot in fact but the model at the moment reeks of a lack of identity.  investing in cards at this time is foolish as valve has proven they cant be trusted in terms of the cards values.  just wait, in about a month all the cards will be worth pennies at most and you can buy a collection rather cheap if valve doesnt take the marketplace access away and force you to gamble on packs.",1545383848,1545383848,False,7,3,0.464036762714385986,0,True,False,False

Artifact got me excited to try it out after reading about the complex way you play with the 3 lanes as well as watching quite a few streamers play in the Closed Beta days before the game launched, it only made me want to really play Artifact.

Concerning the cost to play a lot of people are hesitant to fork over ""Tons"" of cash just to play normally. Depending on the type of mode you are interested, the game is very cost effective in my opinion. For example I value Draft mode loads more than constructed as I was never great in finding best ways to make a truly winning deck most of the time. With Casual Phantom Draft, I get to play it forever until I either expire or Steam goes under which is very unlikely. Although you do not get rewards in this mode it does not really matter as It is random draft so it does not matter what cards I get from my own personal Booster Packs.

Now for the constructed Argument, even though it will cost you some cash to make the deck you would prefer, pretty much all common and uncommon cards on the steam market is around £0.03 or around £0.10. That makes it very cheap to construct most of the deck you want. When it comes to Heroes that the deck plays around most of the common and uncommon heroes are very cheap as well Between £0.03 and maybe 0.50 if that. With more people putting up their excess heroes and cards in the market all those prices will eventually drop to almost dirt cheap.

All in all either Draft or Constructed I'm sure you will find it enjoyable even with the very little cost to play Artifact.

Update:

As of 20/12/2018, There have been two updates so far;

Last week - They added colour blind mode with suit colours to every card, a leaderboard to the Call to Arms mode which tracks highest stream for each type of deck and added Chat in the form of voice lines to every card as well as making custom messages.

As of 20th - They have no added a Progression system where you can earn upto 15 free packs and some tickets for leveling up as well as profile icons, a Skill rating of sorts that starts at 1 and goes upto 75 depending on your matches as well as Buffs and nerfs to certain cards that people have been concerned over.

Granted, the game is still not Free-to-play but for it's cost you will have a lot of free content to explore and you will now get more boosters just for playing.

You can just straight up buy the cards too and since the packs are so affordable it keeps the marketplace very reasonable since if it gets too expensive you can just buy packs and get great value out of it.  The gameplay is terrific.  You have 3 lanes to play and your heroes add a whole new dynamic level to the experience.  Unlike Planeswalkers in Magic you start with one hero in each lane and deploy 1 more the next two rounds and if they die they come back in a couple rounds so you can count of them having a consistent presence in the game.

The game is much better now after giving rewards. They have now a progression system and a way to give tickets and packs. For the time being let's hope for more to come. I feel like the game needs more. Overall good changes. 

EDIT: 

After playing the game for almost 2 weeks now I realize that this game reward good players. By winning alot of expert play you can actually make it almost free to play by recycling the cards that you have won or selling cards then buying low cost cards to recycle. 

The game revolves around the community tournaments which you can earn real money or steam wallet.

(outdated)
TLDR: Reward good players. Not casual friendly. Needs to have 1 free ticket every week.

Cons:
Artifact is not casual friendly but you can still enjoy the Casual Play and Draft.
Not much real in-game goals like MMR or archievements only perfect runs, but still meh.
Constructed Play is almost impossible to play without paying money.

Pros:
This game rewards ""Really Good Players"". 
Hardcore card gamers will really enjoy this game.

Review:
Interesting game. Only way to get free packs is to play experts mode which costs 1 ticket to play. Players also have to win at least 3 times to get a ticket back, 4 times to get 1 ticket and 1 pack, 5 times to get 1 ticket and 2 pack. Social play is so much fun especially when you have banters with your friends while playing. Casual play gives no rewards but it's free, making it a great practice ground before playing experts mode. RNG in the game are okay, simply because most RNGs can be played around with spells or abilities. Economy is much like other valve games, people who have played a valve game and used the marketplace will be more familiar with the economy. 



In short, this is a game for real-life trading card games (keep in mind trading is unavailable for now, possibly enabled in the future). Do NOT buy this game if you are looking for easy card game. This is probably one of the most deeply strategical card game ever. With that said, give this game a try and see if you like it or not. just remember about the friendly reminder above.

Granted there is a huge audience that can control themselves and not spend that money, but if Valve wants a market-driven card economy, they cannot introduce such a system to Artifact without tanking the value of ... well, everything. It's different, it's a little bit annoying, but it's honestly a breath of fresh air, too.

However, you can't take away those addicting features of a game and replace them with nothing. I get that the developers are trying to create a more traditional card game environment, but being digital gives you so many ways to keep me playing that don't have to be those toxic models that you're avoiding. Give me some form of visible MMR, a ladder system, unlockable skins for my cards or board, anything ... Don't just award my perfect phantom draft run that I spent hours on with a +1 to my run counter. It doesn't have to be these features if they're something to be avoided, but the developers need to give us [i]something[/i]. What am I playing for, exactly? What do I have to show for being better at the game? The only rewards require payment for entry, but the matchmaking is skill-based (ie you have a 50% winrate over time) so you'll quickly reach a point where you're not gaining anything.

I really want the game to be successful because it goes against the established dogma I explained in my first paragraph (and because it's fun as hell), but I literally have no incentive to spend my time playing if at the end of the day I have nothing to show for it.",1543488851,1545370190,True,0,0,0.53564000129699707,3,True,False,False

Artifact is moving in the right direction, but it needs to move a lot farther to warrant a positive review. The gameplay is great if you're looking for deep strategy, but the game unfortunately is still bogged down by it's archaic pricing model.

Literally a few hours after I wrote this, they put out an update LOL. This update gives you 
1. 10 free packs per season
2. A change to their balancing philosophy to not care about the market when balancing cards. They've already nerfed the most powerful cards and my favorite, *buffed* some weak cards! This is a huge point in favor of Valve.
3. They added ranked progression, TBD on how this will affect the game.

If the prices over time become reasonable because of change #1, I'll update this review, HOWEVER, compared to *PC Games* (not other TCGs) their pricing model is still predatory. I'd gladly drop $40 bucks per expansion for a full collection but paying >=$160 for a full collection is ridiculous. (FYI I think Hearthstone is just as bad so chill).

Original Review:

Artifact is a good game with a terrible pricing model that drags it down.
The pricing model even makes each match worse because the developers don't want to ""crash the market"" by actually balancing cards. 

People would say it's the cheapest TCG and that might be true, but all TCGs are predatory. It's like consoling you by saying this is the least hungry lion when you're trapped in it's cage. Compared to a regular PC game, this pricing model is basically a joke, especially given that non-card PC games are *more* expensive than this game to make and maintain! Imagine paying a dollar for every 5 ranked matches of Dota 2.

The only way you're going to enjoy this game is if you're a Magic player that wants to play a good digital TCG for cheaper. This is only because you're already used to getting gouged for your money.",1545339180,1545366807,False,10,1,0.539227306842803955,0,True,False,False

For all we know rares, mythicals, artifact, arcanas, etc(possible new tier of rarity based on dota 2 rarity system) will have a 0.00010% drop rate.

People will say the market will be there where it's cheap and abundant. For now that is true. However, prices and quantity won't be there all the time for the recycle mechanic encourages players to basically gamble a deck they make and fight with 5 times. If they passed the trial, then they can gamble again for a super rare cards or meta cards, which is what all card 
players aim for. It's what keeps us going and get invested in the game which is good thing. 

The bad thing is and the main argument that everyone seems to be trying to make is the drop rate system. If you fail the trial you have go back to the card pack slot machine and lose the ticket and packs. If you past the trial you still go back to the slot machine and you get more tries at it. And remember these trials you are always facing a real person, so someone is always losing somewhere that's the other thing. On average you are going to lose in expert mode => buy more tickets and packs to play. As you can see, the cycle just continues. Why would any card collector, any pro, any casual wants to stay in the meta,  ANY PERSON would sell on a market where you make a little gain when you can recycle for a chance to get a rare sk-I mean card? Edit:(12/20/2018) Value now can change the values of these cards and there is a less incentive to sell them from now on.

Based on the principle of supply and demand the market won't have enough cards and they won't be affordable eventually. That's why it's a bad system if this is the only system to rely on. I don't see any store IRL that recycles my cards for new fresh packs. Based on that fact you can tell you're going to play the long con.

Basically TLDR; it's lot of money down the road because it's gambling still. Keep in mind you don't own any of this, none of this was really yours. 

Other than that this game is pretty cool to play.

Edited(12/3/2018) : google ""The Untold History of EA's Long (and Rich) Pay-2-Win Love Affair"" for more infomation why this is a dangerous road for Artifact.

Edited(12/20/2018): As of today, they can balance change cards. Meaning they can buff underrated cards and nerf meta cards. Value controls the market. Meaning that you have no control over the value of the cards. Again nothing like MTG for it's gaming as a service.

There is some depth but it is ruined by rng. Eg. heores can initialy randomly match opposing heores or creeps. Red heroes want that, blue/black not. If you play control deck, you may get locked out of 3 lanes for 2 turns and on top give opponent a few items.

My dear reader, have patience and let me tell you all the truth about Shartifact, truly a unqiue game full of hype and fan anticipation (ok?)...

Artifuck is a game with awesome balance. More than half of the cards are completely worthless, some of them being straight up terrible in every possible situation being completely outclassed by others. (Some of them are also entirely outclassed by items everyone can buy, so no niche color specific mechanics hehehe). You would think a basic introductionary set of cards consisting almost entirely of raw stat buffs would be easy to balance... oh no! That is of course not true, it's intended as the creator of this awesome game is no other than the TCG GOD himself, Richard Garfield, with his genious philosophy of:
""People who play with the bad cards are stupid because they haven't figured out which are the good ones."".

So yes, having filler worthless cards to fill up a booster box is of course something very valuable to have in a digital card game. Artifatfuck is exactly that, a very close emulation of your typical scummy greedy TCG card game where your average competitive match consists of the same deck in every fucking damn game... It's all about skill, getting that +4 all possible stats instawin card first before your opponent. You shouldn't question why all tournaments use random draft games when this game has such variety and balance (random draft as in ""pick random cards, but not the useless ones, that wouldn't be professional"").

The promised ""highest fidelity"" gameplay is evident, with skills such as ""50% chance anyone survives on 1 hp"", ""completely stop your opponent from doing anything this turn as long as you act first"", you are left with awesome mindful games consisting of: uncontrollable random creep placement, uncontrollable random hero placement, uncontrollable random attack targetting, uncontrollable random variety of shop items... Wait, wait, I am just telling you this game can seriously be run on a casino slot machine and no one would notice.

Valve made sure to bring some very successful capitalist practices and they did well emulating your greedy uncle's game shop. With the slogan of ""no free breakfast"", you are ready to get into this TRADING card game. Just open the Steam Market and buy some effin cards (thank God the prices got lower and Axe doesn't cost more than the actual game now!), Valve will thank you for purhasing this game and then get another 15% tax on each bought card too. Don't think about direct free trade with your friends, that's illegal and hurts the free market economy... you understand, goyim?
You can't bring cards out of nothing, so NO GRINDING, sorry! This is real life TCG (but also this game is very unique and innovative don't forget!). You should know how much work has Valve put into making and distributing these cards. The only way to actually get more cards is.. you guessed it right? It's good to remember your greedy uncle's game shop now. You can play with the good guys only if you pay tickets to enter the ""local tournament"", your prize, of course, is the ticket you paid to enter.. and a card pack if you manage to finish well enough. Or you know, just buy the cards you need from the market, as that would be the only way to win anyway. (Here I should be telling you to invest in crypto instead, and make your greedy uncle pay your taxes. You can go one level further and make your video card more useful and happy to not render Artifail.)

Don't get me wrong, you probably heard lots of good stuff about this game. Valve made sure to organize a closed invite only closed beta closed tournament with all the good card professional players you all love, they surely loved this game too and weren't there only for the money. Ahm.
Of course, you heard all the good stuff about Artifag from them and how they are happily still playing and streaming this best card game ever made, and also talking about it non-stop to their friends and their friends' mothers (and their mothers' friends' friends). You should follow them too and do it exactly as well (that is: continue playing Heartsone/Gwent/thatothergameyoulove, you don't have to think about it too much, you will do well sabotaging the competition). Valve carefully listened well to all their honest positive feedback, such game consisting of masterfully perfected core mechanics barely changed throughout the whole beta period. Even the official post-beta release is still lacking basic game functionality like chat, replays, any leaderboards or any rank system or any game history/statistics at all...
Numbers don't lie. It is THAT good and E X C I T I N G! (now pat yourselves on the back Valve)

For those that don't already know, Artifact doesn't have the most stellar reputation at the moment. ""Deadgaem"" and P2P2P2P memes infest the subreddit when the mods aren't shutting them down and the playerbase has seen a drastic decline since launch.

Hyped to an extreme after several months of no information after it was revealed and boasting the credentials of MTG creator Richard Garfield on the design team, Artifact was sent out to the community at large with very high expectations. Indeed, the year long beta had big names from the biggest digital card games lauding the intricate and complicated gameplay, the silky smooth visuals and the feeling that this isn't just another children's card game and a contender for the highest level of strategic esports, some of which were so captivated by the gameplay that they moved away from the gaming scene where they first made their names. Sadly, a client that feels like it's barely out of beta and a slew of balance issues that were raised by those very testers were left untouched and the game was released into the wild feeling more like an early access title than the long awaited triumphant return of a legendary publisher. Furthermore, the market itself while reasonable by traditional paper TCG standards is still egregious from the standards of modern video games. In 2018 if any game gated entire powerful gameplay options behind $10-15 a pop DLC paywalls, there would be rioting, but this is a digital ""trading"" card game after all and, well it's cheaper than paper Magic (and arguably other F2P models if you're already willing to drop cash on the product). I fell prey to this thinking myself in the first while as I bought myself a few decks that I wanted to play and realized, after some time, that I could literally buy entire new fantastic games for the same cost as a few cards.

The gameplay itself, after nearly 80 hours of playtime, is alright. The core game itself is solid, taking ideas from HS and Gwent and refining them further while injecting the flavor and lore of DOTA2, a 3 board system that has an interesting way of handling how you use cards all wrapped up in an antiquated (if reasonable by TCG standards) economy. F2P it is not and while that's certainly good (to a degree) from the standpoint of a customer who's already expecting to drop a few hundred dollars, for the casual audience the reality of needing to pay for tickets everytime you want to play in an Expert or Keeper draft wasn't ideal and the fact that you were stuck with just how lucky you got when opening your first 10 packs, and how well you did with the tickets, greatly limits what you can do in constructed isn't a recipe for runaway success, and the low playercount at the time of this review represents that.

All in all the game is alright if you enjoy draft but expect to pay the equivalent of a AAA title if you're looking to build any competitive deck outside of the pauper scene and that, for me, is what really ended up encouraging me to sell my collection and uninstall in the end. After the time I spent I was barely logging on once every two days for a match and couldn't be bothered to finish any runs.",1545164850,1545165088,False,12,1,0.545020699501037598,0,True,False,False

Artifact has a unique system to replicate a MOBA as a card game, the hero cards keeping modifications, the respawns, the item shops in between turns, all thematically fit well with the game. 

Despite being interesting thematically, the game really suffers from its monetization scheme and overreliance on RNG to makes the game more than a number crunch. The idea of a digital TCG where the cards have real value from supply scarcity is good in theory, but Valve appears terrified of deflating the value over time. There is zero way in game for players to get more cards without paying, making the game feel like a microtransaction cash grab. The worst example of this is the arena system in Artifact which costs tickets (money) to participate in and only gives rewards past a three win threshold, I'm struggling to think of another card game with as stingy a reward system. 

Arena/Draft modes are usually played by two types of players, new players who want to experience new cards and find out what they like while expanding their collection, and Spikes who want to optimize their strategy to go infinite. The current system only allows Spikes to feel satisfied, as a newcomer to the game will not be able to get to that three win mark to get new cards, despite the run costing money. 

Hearthstone is notoriously bad for its RNG, with cards like pre-nerf Yogg turning competitive matches into coin flips on the spot. Artifact is worse. You can argue that many decisions are made post RNG so skilled players can minimize it's effects, but with the inherent RNG of card games (drawing cards) along with Artifact's additional randomized systems, it's past reasonable to say this is a skill based game. What this translates to is in game games being heavily affected, and sometimes determined by RNG factors that players have little to no control over, the targeting system, the creed spawn system, the initial hero spawns, the item shop contents, many of the cards using % chances of working, it's all too much. 

Can't say I recommend this game, as someone who really likes and enjoys a range of card games for their systems and various skill levels required Artifact just feels bad to play.",1545158833,1545158833,False,76,0,0.616973698139190674,0,True,False,False

The pay-to-play-aspect didn't bother me too much in draft. Usually I make enough packs to recycle cards/sell cards for tickets and be playing endlessly, more or less. The inital price is justified thinking about how much time I could genuinely spend on the game.

Drafting was a lot of fun for a while, but now that I have explored the process, the novelty fades. 
The endless RNG is becoming frustrating. 
Slowly farming booster packs isn't incentive enough to cover this up for me.
Getting 3 very bad drafts in a row, losing a highly favored game to cheating death and I must say: I've had it for now.

Haven't gotten behind the paywall for constructed yet, but watching streamers I get the impression that this mode has some serious issues. I won't spend the extra money just to try it.

Here are some calculations about expected return of Expert Draft/Constructed mode.

Assume an average player who's got 50% win rate, here's how much he is expected to get after a Expert Draft/Constructed run:
expected return = C(1,4)*(1/2^5)*7 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6)*(7+14) + (0.5^5 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6) )*(7+14*2) = 6.34375
So, average players' expected return rate is:
(6.34375 - 7）/ 7 = -9.43%

Explanation:
I use rmb as currency, which is 7 rmb for 1 ticket, 14 rmb for 1 card pack. But it doesn't matter what currency you use, we are calculating a ratio here.
C(1,4) means choose 1 out of 4, the same applies for C(1,5) which means choose 1 out of 5.
C(1,4)*(1/2^5)*7 is the expected return of 3 wins.
C(1,5)*(1/2^6)*(7+14) is the expected return of 4 wins.
(0.5^5 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6) )*(7+14*2) is the expected return of 5 win (with 0 lose or 1 lose).

Conclusion:

So, average players with 50% win rate is expected to LOSE 9.43% of his money each time they play an Expert Draft/Constructed game. This is astonishing and unacceptable. This is the only negative sum game that I know of (except lottery and gambling ). But Valve, you are a game company, not casino.

What's even worse is, when average players and below-average players find themselves constantly losing money, they just leave the game. That's what happened in the last 2 weeks. And with daily peak concurrent players of Artifact drops to around 10k, that means more than 80% of players have left the game. When that happens, those above-average players' win rate drops to 50% or below and starts to lose money. Then they will also leave the game. Things are getting worse day by day. Only the few top players will get positive expected returns. It's kind of like the poison circle in Player Unknown's battleground.

If there's no substantial change to this, daily peak concurrent players of Artifact will drop below 10k in the following few days.

I love the core mechanics of the game, and have spent more than dozens of Expert mode tickets. And I don't care about if it's F2P or not. But this Expert mode is just broken, because it keeps punishing players of the game until they just leave. I think Artifact has a huge potential but it's simply ruined by the arrogance of the people in Valve who ignore the urgent call of the players who actually pay for the game.",1545150453,1545150534,False,1616,103,0.90697777271270752,39,True,False,False

What it currently lacks is positive feedback mechanisms for when you win. None of the casual modes do anything to reward the player when she wins.

Deepest RNG gameplay ever and the most infuriating experience you will ever see in a card game that was suppose to be ""SKILL COMPETITIVE GAME"" also trading card game with no trade at all.

Lets talk about the RNG first :

- First round Heroes deployment RNG (you can't even choose which lanes your heroes goes in the start)
- Creep spawn RNG deployment (0 to 2 creeps will be random add to your lanes in random combat positions)
- RNG in items in the shop phase (You don't even have control over your item's deck why did we even made them in the first place?)
- RNG in deployment phase when deploying a new hero (you can chose the lane but not the combat position)
- RNG when attacking with your units (even when attacking with your hero you just have 0 control in your board UNLESS you use/have cards for that)

Now to the infuriating experience :
- Lock mechanics (Random lock in cards because of effect of cards/items that you can't counter-play at all)
- Cheating Death (50% Coin flip that something in that lane doesn't die because why the fuck not)
- More RNG bullshit (Bounty Hunter's jinada, ogre magi's multi cast, Tidehunter's Ravage,Homefield Advantage, etc)
- First player to play 1 high mana cost often win the game(Time of Triumph, Incarnation of Selemene etc)

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

Its one of the most complex card game in the market that require some effort to learn the mechanics, once you get the jiz of it its very fun to play, the learning didn't just stop there, if you want to win consistenly, you will need to learn how to predict opponent moves, mind games, efficient resource management, optimal play order ect...

Most polished card games out there, each cards have their own voice line, some cards have unique voice line interaction if play with another cards, this game flesh out more DotA lore by each card having backstory written and voice acted.

Free draft mode is a fun game mode for begineers to learn the games. Please dont be me wasting ticket on expert, free draft is a good stepping stone to learn before playing expert since expert mode have alot of experience player.

The monetization model are fine, there seems to be alot of people having trouble accepting the concept of having to pay for games but i digress. If you want to expand your card collection, I HIGHLY recommend buying cards in steam market instead of opening packs, buying or recycling cards for ticket is also a good way to earn packs too if you have more experience. The value of buying 3 copies of every single cards + one copy of each heroes in the market are around 350 dollars at early december, opening packs have the same expected value.

I played over 6k hours on DotA2, Hearthstone from closed beta untill Karazhan expension, 200 hours on close and open beta Gwent, between these 3 companies i prefer the way Valve managing multiplayer games, CDPR have good business model but very inexperience, Blizzard is really slow on implementing community requested features and instead of nerfing overpower cards, they just change overpowered cards into unplayable state. Valve can be secretive, but they seems to get important things done in a timely matter.

Game have alot of potential when more card sets being introduce down the line, i assume there will be events and free draft mode to play their new cards.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

Currently lack of mmr / ladder system, valve release statement they are currently working on it so this cons might be short live.

Feature incomplete on day one such as battle log, player statistic, proper spectating mode, draft mode with friends.

The upfront $20 barrier of entry come with 2 starter decks, 10 packs and 5 tickets, with no way to ""grind"" for cards,  grinding might be part of the expeirence some players seek.

This game can be a pain to learn, because artifact game mechanics are not obvious/straight fowards like HS/Gwent, so you might just make sub-optimal plays without knowing it, the biggest example is hero dying is not a bad things at all, if you die at the right timing, you could relocate your resources to other lane that need it, mobility is a luxury in this game. Initiative mechanic is also not obvious for new players.

You cant play this game while watching videos/movies , this game require your full attention to play optimally.

All cards aren't created equal, constructed mode can get expensive since cards like axe and drow are expensive and for good reason, they have superior stats and impactful spell compare to other cards. You still could succeed and have fun in constructed without these expensive cards but in most cases if you want a consistent and optimize deck, you might as well bite the bullet.

Steam market can be confusing to navigate for newcomers, if you want to sell or buy cards at an optimal prices, you need to navigate between in game store and steam overlay, manually changing price. It can get tedious really fast.


[h1]TLDR:[/h1]

Artifact is the most engaging card games I've ever played, however the more I play the more I find out the cons outweight the pros, the ticket system kills the game for me, in other card games, you want to play, just queue rank games and boom, you are matched with people that are equal skill most of the time; however in Artifact those free game modes are just full of people concede when they got minor disadvantage, that means if you want to play against opponent that at least trying to play, you need to cough up a ticket which will cost you money or steam credit.",1543857348,1545125312,False,0,0,0.506663620471954346,0,True,False,False

People say artifact is pay to win, but i've been having a blast just playing precontructed and casual phantom draft, which gives access to all cards and is all for free! i probably dont mind spending a few bucks now and again to maybe try out expert phantom draft or buy a few good uncommon cards, but i'm not in a hurry. People say artifact needs a progression system, and while i admit stats and a profile page would be a nice feature (which is coming soon this week anyway), but i pretty much enjoy learning the cards and the bluffs and the strategies and am mature enough to understand progression on my own without needing a colourful badge number to show. fully recommended!",1545083500,1545083500,True,2,1,0.484870344400405884,0,True,False,False

- we get the mana consistency of hearthstone.

-Very good draft mode. I just wish their were more playable cards in the set.
-A lot of completly free modes (draft, tournaments...)
-constructed is the only mode that costs money and still haven't played it yet because I'm grinding my collection. Draft seems much better anyway (because of balancing issues)

On the negative side :
-game is not that expensive for me because I have a high winrate. I still don't have used all my initial tickets... But other players paid for me to go infinite and that is not a sustainable System.
-lack of balance close to what hearthstone knew at the beginning. Valve needs to nerf axe, drow... I never used half of the cards in the set that are really too bad on the other side.

The free to play audience was and will never be prepared to pay for any product. The poor pinoys skipping school to play Dota can not afford to play this, just as they can not afford to buy their own computer.

This game is a real TCG but in a digital form. It means that there is a monetary aspect to buying the cards, and it comparatively is cheaper when you look at it from a market perspective and being able to buy individual cards.

Dota 2 as a game is far more complex than any other MOBA out there. It requires a kind of gamer who is willing to invest time and energy in learning the game for thousands of hours to truly master it. This game is very similar to that aspect, and so the game design philosophy hasn't changed.

Artifact fan based websites who are offering deck databases have decks you can create which are relatively top tier for less than $10, but even that is too expensive for the poor, poverty stricken and destitute pinoy fan-base of the original Dota 2 game.

At the end, my prediction is the following. The game will be a success as the poor people step aside, and this game will never be free to play since the initial cost is made up for in the card packs you recieve initially.

So my advice would be to buy the game and enjoy it as a more complex and advanced form of TCG compared to Hearthstone and others. If you're not into complexity, then stay in heartstone where the market is internalised and keep grinding.

However, if you're someone like me with a job and isn't living in a third world poverty stricken country trying to feed their families by prostituting themselves and their sisters,  then this game is perfect. You pay, you get cards, you play, and you can stop whenever you like. There is no urgency in ""grinding"" meaninglessly in order to save $10. My time is far too valuable for that.

For people that want a good decent and unique card game this is the one. It is really fun, it have good mechanics. It really feels like dota 2 in a card game. People seems like to exaggerate pay 2 win in this game too much, because i really think that the price is reasonable (come on guys there is story game that finished only 3 hours of gameplay that cost $20 and the card deck for the game is only $2 which actually DON'T have crazy rate drop [ i got axe that cost $10 with one of these ] so if you lucky you can gain profit if you want to sell it ). And the benefit that you can actually sell your card [ steam market function ] is actually good for players that want to change different styles of deck time to time (even there is taxes). My advice is if you want to get into this game you should make some research first and buy the cards you want so that you don't have to spend a lot of money. For me i spend like $5 more to complete my deck as they give you free 5 / 10  card deck at first i don't remember.

No replay functionality. You can't rewatch your last game to learn from your mistakes.
You can't chat with your opponent. Or use emotes. Or anything.

I will try to write a good overview: I will write it as a personal story. If your not interested, just skip it.

Here I go:
Its true that this Game is ''pay to win'', whether this is good or bad, is up to the people themselves
I've spend 75euro on this game, (bought pack after pack), and at the moment, my Decks are decent.

- For some top Tier decks I still need a few extra cards: - Which (if they are available): you can buy at the Steam Community Market. 
This can be a downside of the game, you can shop for specific Cards, and most of them dont cost much. 
(making the ''pay to win the game'' option, valid)

- I am sure many people buy these Cards, I am running into Top Tier Decks 90% of the time, when I queue for Payed Competitive. (you can buy-in with Tickets and/or Card packs)
- I refused to buy specific Cards for the first week I played, since I find it somewhat lame to buy specific cards. 
- Then I found out, it costs me to many money to collect the Cards I want, if I dont do it.
(Cards costs 8.75 for 5 Packs, and I kept looking for Luna as a Hero. I could buy her for 0.08cents on the Community Market. Go figure out the cheapest method??)

The + point of this Game is, its extremely addictive. And fun.
It contains really deep gameplay, with this 3-Lane System. Every choice you make, matters, a lot. Also the minor choices.
You also get a lot of Freedom; you can also not heavily buy cards, and just play Casual Mode. I run into quite medium skilled decks 60-70% of the time there.
But do expect that the game costs 20-40 euro on top of the Steam price, if you want to play well in competitive mode. (These contain fierce matches where you buy-in, to compete for prices, in the form of card packs and/or tickets).

Another + Point; you can get really creative with this game. You can, for example,  play Keeper Draft for that, which is basicly a payed mode on the game, where chances are quite even and fair; cause the Decks are not pre-constructed: You build a Deck from the 6 Card packs you get, and the Enemy does the same.
+ All cards you select, you keep. Its a good way to farm cards. 

Once you have a good Deck, like I have now, after I spend 75euros, you can also start winning some Expert Constructed games; Here you play with a Pre-Constructed Deck, constructed out of the cards you own. Opposition is fierce.
Probably you can start winning here with less money spend then me, while, as I said, I started out buying expensive Packs instead of single cards, because I found it a bit lame to ''only'' buy my way into victory; I wanted to learn the game the hard way.
Also, you can play a bit better as me. I am not a pro, I'm a medium experienced card game player.

+ The Deck Builder is what makes this game shine. There are endless options and combinations, and it is just so much fun to get creative with decks. You are fully free to develop your Decks the way you want, for the good or for the bad, if you fuck up.
I dont want to spoil the fun, so you have to find out for yourself which colour combinations you like.

I always look for good reviews on a game, and I hope I gave you some information now, which helps you to make up your mind whether you should buy this game or not.

From me, it gets a: Yes. Its great fun!
(When you dont get mad when you have to spend a little more money then you had in mind ;))

Topics:

1. Monetization/Gamafication
Be real anything costs money, Games need to be developed and developer need food and food costs money. So one way or another we are all gonna pay.
Question remains how are costs destributed. Other games with F2P models attrackt a huge amount of people with free stuff, in order to generate a populated game and then tax high paying customers for their well populated game, to finance it. Artifact sort of taxes everyone, but none to highly. I prefer this kind of cost spreading in a game. Everybody pays the same (I have differnt views regarding healthcare and such, but we are talking about a game here), depending on their playtime.
I say that because I am employed, have friends and family and therefore only a limited amount of time to play. Other games make me pay very deerly to only play a couple of games. So in the long run I kept droping them one after another. F2P only works if you got the time. If you haven't you pay and it is not cheap if you have to pay.
Artifact make everyone pay, but the price tag is reasonable and does not vary.

2. Player commitment and motivation
In any online game the quality of the game is drivin by its community. Therefore the motivation of the community to stay in the game very much dictats the quality of each player participating.
When looking at other games they do a lot to keep people playing their game (F2P content, let people invest themselfs with time and money). Valve seems to have reduced that motivation only to the core game itself. I love that decision. Where in other games, people keep playing because they have done so all the time and they will loose out on stuff. Or don't want to switch to another game only because they already have all the stuff in this game. Essentially making the decsion to stay not, or not entirly, about the gameplay. There is nothing to gain/loose in Artifact if you don't play. And if you want out, sell your collection and you´ll get returnvalue. Reducing your decision to: Do I enjoy the game?
This leeds to a community that is invested into the game, because it is a great game and only because it is a great game. That is a community that I like to be part of.
Safe to say: I hate gamefication of games. I play a games because I like the core gameplay. All other reasons are a coverup for bad core game mechanics, imho.

3. Gameplay
It is your standard card game with refreshing new mechanics. In card games you loose some games and you win others, here you play 3 simultaneous games essentially garanteeing, that you win/loose and go back in forth in a single game. I haven't lost a game yet, were I thought, well darn it that was out of my hands. And I lost a lot. There was always something that could be done.
Granted a lot of single cards have feast of famine typ of RNG, but even those cards don't spoil the game (yet; this would be my biggest opjection to the game). If Valve can reduce that type of RNG and introduce more good RNG (equal powerlevel, but variation), I think this will make for a far better game, that it currently even is.
This underline how good the core mechanics are and it makes me want to play more and see where this develops in the upcoming expansions.

All in all this is a game I see myself playing on a regular base for the foreseeable future.",1544887171,1544904465,True,6,1,0.495839893817901611,0,True,False,False

All the people giving negative reviews about the price are just angry. They are like my wife. 

When I go out with my wife she always expects certain things to happen. I don't know maybe go to her favourite restaurant or watch a certain movie. But in reality we just decide spontaneously what we do and probably end up eating a sandwich and just have a drink in a bar before realizing we are way too tired for anything and go home. Point is she expects certain things in her head beforehand and then gets really angry if they do not become reality.

Same happened here. People expected to be able to get cards by playing. They bought the game and now they are angry. But they should really be angry about themselves. They did not get enough information about the game before buying.

Valve made the decision that you can only buy cards, not earn them. 

Taking this example to an extreme: You should not buy Call of Duty in expectation of a Rollercoaster Tycoon because of your lack of information and then brag about that all you do is shooting people.

The angry people should also read the articles on PCGAMER.COM. They clearly write why in the end Artifact is quite the ""cheap"" collectible card game compared to the other kings like Magic and Hearthstone. 

https://www.pcgamer.com/card-game-players-and-pc-gamers-may-never-agree-on-artifacts-pricing/

Quote: 
""The very first constructed tournament [...] and the first groups have been played. In Group A, Strifecro took the win with a Blue/Green combo deck that costs $64, and Lifecoach came in second with a Red/Green ramp deck that costs $81. In Group B, Xixo won with a Red/Black Oath deck that costs $40, while StanCifka took the second place with his version of Red/Black that costs $53.

If you compare these deck prices to competitive Magic decks, you can see where the card game players are coming from. At Grand Prix Milwaukee, the cheapest deck in the top 10 was Jacob Tilk’s Mono-White Aggro, which costs $70 in Magic Online and $251 in physical form. The winner, Adrian Sullivan, played a Jeskai Control deck that costs $170 in Magic Online and $534 in paper. From this perspective, Artifact does not look expensive at all.""

583950,47552814,76561198136335723,0,18,767,0,764,1546219094,"Artifact is an excellent card game plagued by terrible decisions made for aspects outside the match.

As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, this game is pay-to-win. Not in the sense of other pay-to-win games that you can stomp every game by a single overpowered purchase, but in the sense that you cannot create a decent deck without paying far more than the game's original price. 

Let me provide an overview of the game's monetization. 
Purchasing the base game provides you with 10 card packs of 12 cards each. With luck and some clever arrangement, this is enough to craft a single C tier deck. From there you can purchase additional packs for two dollars each. Alternatively, you can sell the high value cards you recieved from the start, but don't rely on this tactic, since only about a dozen different cards have a value over a dollar. Aside from direct purchase, only a single type of gamemode allows you to gain additional cards, and it requires a one dollar event ticket to enter. In order to win back your ticket or a single card pack, you must win 3, 4, or 5 games without losing two, which is nearly impossible considering you'll be faced solely against the strongest decks others have purchased.

Essentially, your decks's strength will always be less than that of someone who's paid slightly more for theirs. 
It's simple - if you cannot pay in this game, you cannot play in this game.

Not only is this unfair, it's also not as fun. Other card games allow you to earn additional cards, so you can experience that great feeling when you open an excellent card or find the exact one you've been looking for. You can't experience this in Artifact, since any card you gain was most likely bought directly from another player.

It's clear that Valve is targetting this game to a very specific audience - card game veterans with cash to spare. 
Despite having previous card game experience and dozens of bot matches before testing my deck against the world, I faced eleven losses against high-value paid decks before my first victory. So much for matchmaking pairing you with players near your ""skill level"". 

Artifact isn't all bad, though. The mechanics of the game itself feel fair, the interface is straightforward, and Dota fans would probably agree that Artifact still plays similar to what they're familiar with. Those opposed to the payment model can instead play using rotational featured decks, or draft a deck out of the universal card collection to use for a series of games. 

However, a few decent choices doesn't justify that half of the game is locked to the top 1%. The game is just brutal to new players. Statistics show that a large portion of casual players have already left, which will make it even more difficult for new casual players to enter, since they'll only be matched against the long-time players.

If you want to purchase this game and play against only bots, then go for it. 
But until Valve ultimately gives up on this game model and makes major adjustments in a future update, it's not a game I recommend.",1544902315,1544902315,False,5,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,False

The game offers very little in the way of ladder-grinding and ranking up. Instead it offers the players gauntlets where you play until you reach five wins or two losses. You can choose to pay a small fee to have the possibility of getting rewards on a win streak of 3 or more, but you can play without paying anything and just explore the games creative side if you dont want to fight for rewards. 

I have yet to touch the constructed part of this game so I cant say much about that part. I have however spent alot of time with the draft modes and am loving the experience. So far I've managed to draft for rewards with the starter set you get with your initial purchase and the thrill when you are fighting for that extra win to get some reward is very enjoyable to me. 

I am also very pleased with the ability to play FREE draft gauntlets when my luck runs out and I no longer am able to play for rewards. This is a luxury which I dont think any other card game has provided. You don't get to keep the cards in this mode and you don't get any rewards, but the game itself is so much fun that I don't see this as a problem. 

If you enjoy drafting and a card game with alot of interesting decisions with new puzzles to solve almost every game I highly recommend this game.

What I like most about it is that there is a good balance between luck and skill. The RNG elements of the game actually require a high level of skill to deal with. Since the state of the board is always changing based on the random way the game works as well as the oponents moves it makes it so the player with the most skill wins a lot of the time. What I mean is that a new player will not be able to just buy a championship deck and win. They must understand the dynamics of the game. This makes it so the game is less reliant on the best deck and more reliant on player skill level in dealing with situations.

The other thing I really like about this card game over many others is that you start your game with 3 of your best cards already in play!

It's plays very well, strategy is challenging, games are reactive and interactive, you always anticipating, adapting, trying to sneak one past your opponent, sometimes muscling them. You never know how the game is going to go until you play it. I love this game! Animations are gorgeous as a bonus (hearthstone is very low res and dull after playing Artifact - yes I even check my graphics settings were maxed out).

Let me address the criticism: 
- Game is pay to win
There is only ONE out of SIX game modes where this matters. But say you exclusively want to play expert constructed or just for pride you want a full collection, it's currently about $US180. Based on some quick research hearthstone is about $US1280 for a full set and MTGA is $750 for enough cards to play completively - not even close to the complete set. I don't have a full set and playing constructed is not my preferred playstyle in any case.
- There are no rewards and incentives
Are we so whipped by the games companies that we now only play for digital rewards? We play sub par games, grind for 100's of hours for a handful of dollars worth of digital cards? I know I have been guilty of this. Artifact has shown me the light. Buy Artifact for US$19, never buy any cards, play the free games modes (including common card tournaments, phantom draft, constructed and leaderboard win streak event playing with 8 premade decks) and you get a much better quality game, more satisfying and the only way you aren't happy is if you NEED someone to give you a token reward that is ultimately worth next to nothing.
-Lack of social features
All this has been resovled in 1.1 and they're far better than MTGA and Hearthstone.

I decided to write this because I genuinely have not enjoyed a game this much in years. You can buy into the complaints that this game deviates from the TCG standard model or you can ignore the anti-hype and enjoy a really top notch game. I choose the latter, hope you do too.

I have the impression that it's made for cardgame enthusiasts, so it's kind of a niche game. I think it's a great game for its target group, which isn't large masses.
The draft mode might become the main competitive format for this game. Because it's online, it's more feasible to spectate competitve draft tournaments than it would be in physical card games.
The constructed mode requires the cards to be bought from the Steam marketplace. Some people hate it, but I don't care as I only play drafts, both free mode and paid entry mode. 

I've played Gwent as well, and I like Artifact more. There's more options, more choices to make.

The game is missing incentive to play, some may like that but usually to most people nowadays, they need more reward than just to know they've won. 
A good part is that they now added a few more social features, so at least it doesn't completely feel like playing with a NPC anymore. 
The incentive also doesn't exist to play the expert modes, which cost around $1 to play and break even at 3 wins and 2 losses, as the cards are currently not worth anything at all.
To some this may be a positive, because you can get yourself an entire collection for extemely cheap, but for me it takes out the incentive to play for packs.

Another big factor that really annoys me is the massive randomness of the game. I didn't realize it at first, however there are so many random elements in the game, that a lot of the time you simply feel cheated. 
Of course every card game has the randomness of which cards you get and this is totally alright, even though you can't draw as fast as in the majority of other card games and rarely actually get all the cards in the deck.
However, there is so much more random elements. Beginning with cards that will attack random enemies, creeps that will deploy to random lanes, several cards that have a coin toss on wether they are usefull or not (There is a tower imrpovement that makes it so that every unit you have on that lane has a 50% chance to not die when receiving killing damage, resulting in some units surviving 4 rounds without dying and another card that does stuff like increases its own attack by 4 with a 50% chance of happening). 
The biggest and most annoying randomness factor of them all however is the arrows. The game has certain attack arrows that come new each round and that you can't see, it can result in your units attacking enemies that will die anyway, even if said unit could potentially end the enemy.

The games are always ridiciously close and all these random factors result in you always feeling that you won or lost mainly, because random chance was on your side. It simply isn't fun to try to play around all that randomness and doesn't feel rewarding to me.
As such in its current state, I can't recommend the game.",1543461991,1544811693,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't let the cost of the game deter you. There are enough game modes to try even if you don't want to spend more money to buy packs. I have not bought a single pack and I'm having fun playing casual phantom drafts, call to arms and against the AI. 

So, spending additional money to build constructed decks is not necessary if you don't want to. It is expected that many tournaments will be in the draft format when ownership of cards is not required.

Valve will also be adding so-called progression for those players who need  a reason to play the game.

For me, I play just because it is fun. There is no progression when you gather with friends to play games over the table. The tournament mode allows you to create that experience.

If there is something that I don't like about the game, it is that you need tickets (money) to play expert modes. So, I won't be playing that much at this moment.

Good:
The core gameplay of Artifact is fun, interesting, and complex. The UI is slick, the animations are awesome, and as a dota 2 fan, the voice lines and tidbits of dota lore are cool! I don't even have a problem with the way the game is monetized. Many others have complained about the lack of rewards or free ways of earning new cards, but I have no issue with the ""paper tcg"" system Valve implemented.

Bad:
So why have I uninstalled Artifact? Two reasons: card design and over-complexity.

I know I listed complexity as a positive trait in the ""Good"" section above, and I stand by that. Complexity in a competitive game is a good thing. If you plan on spending a long time with a game, you want tactical depth and room to explore. A good competitive game provides opportunities for players to constantly discover new tactics and strategies. However, this complexity has to be balanced with a good learning feedback loop. In other words, when I try something in a game, I need to be able to judge how successful it was. Take Magic, for example. Once you've learned the rules of Magic and played a few games, you have a wealth of options for playing the game at your disposal. When you play a new decklist or are attempting to figure out the best line for the turn, you can always tell _after_ the game (or even after the turn or a single spell cast) what your mistakes were. You are able to determine whether your deck needs a better mana curve or more removal and you can also figure out whether you should have killed their big flyer instead of the trample guy on turn 5. The learning feedback loop in Magic is excellent. You may never know the best line of play in the moment, but you learn to make better decisions over time. I feel that the ways in which Artifact provides complexity, this feedback loop is not there. While playing Artifact, I can never tell if I made the right decision. ""Should I have placed that guy in that lane?"" ""Should I have put that equipment on that hero?"" I grew frustrated because when I lost, I could never tell what lost me the game. And because I could not feel myself improving, the game became unfun.

My second negative reason is card design. And by card design, I specifially mean Artifact's choice of randomness as a part of card effects. Again, randomness in a card game is to be expected. It provides exciting moments and keeps things fresh. In good games you learn to manage randomness and to play to your outs and probabilities. However, I feel that many random elements in Artifact are just unfun. There are many cards that provide randomness, but I will focus on one such card to prove my point. The card in question is called ""Cheating Death,"" and it is a improvement card that provides a passive effect on your allied units that reads: ""If there is an allied green hero in this lane, allies have a 50% chance of surviving with 1 Health when they would die."" Simply put, the randomness of this card is not fun to play against. Your opponent might waste 4 removal spells to no avail because of a bad roll of the dice. If I cannot devise a strategy other than ""hope I win the coin flip,"" I'm not going to have fun 50% of the time.",1544769986,1544770668,False,11,0,0.486848652362823486,0,True,False,False

Mechanically fantastic game, probably the best I've played since Dota 2. The dev team seem genuinely interested in developing it. Sadly it's ruined by a terrible business model. No way of earning cards out of Buying the game, tickets, packs tc.. Which is a bit much. So far, the community has declined fast particularly for a Valve game. It's down like 60-70% since peak at launch.

It's a complicated three lane/deck structure with 5 heroes like in Dota. You also have to manage numerous resources like in MOBAs like mana and abilities, items, and minions. It's incredibly unique, but also at times it feels you need to spend a lot of money one one or two decks to be competent. 

People saying it's dead, I'm not too sure. This is Valve, they could keep supporting it for as long as they wanted
Remember there is still:

1. A S1 million tournament early next year (like a Micro International)
2. iOS and Android ports
3. A lot more cards, content and gameplay features (Progression and Social features being added by year end).
4, Potentially a free-to-play model with some of the limited modes as a last resort (I think Gaben had a list of what game he should make f2p next after TF2 and Dota 2, and he ticked the CSGO box instead of this).

It's a very expensive buy-in for what it is. I don't think Valve realised this. Deck prices are not cheap (Axe, Drow etc..) and are really only worth investing in if there is a decent playerbase long-term which, lets be honest, is not incredibly likely if things dont improve. CSGO didn't start off amazing either but this game needs a lot of work.

Peak hours for this game are a little different to most of the top games. I think most players are Russia/China. Doesn't really affect me, but anyone west of EU central has a small playerbase.

In my opinion, what this game needs is:
1. A free-to-play mode or model that doesnt let you grind cards Just make the phantom draft mode free. pretty simple. Some of those users will buy in. I'd rather that than the game dying..
2. Mass promo once the Phone ports come out, and pump out streaming content for the tournament. Twitch coverage is dropping fast and interest is waning.
3. Some kind of earnable stuff, like gems or something you can earn tickets from. If Valve don't add value to the game the ""mass audience"" will leave.
4. Expand the scope of the game. It seriously needs workshop support, like card labels, changeable designs for tables new arts for heroes, flashy animiations etc. Bring over some of the Dota couriers instead of the imps (I just want cluckles) and another 6 months of updates to make it engaging.


tl;dr It's an incredibly niche card game that at the moment isn't worth the ""Buy-in"" for most people. I wanted something for work to play in quick sessions so I got it since I like Dota 2. It's not one of these digital card games that takes 100s of hours to grind for good cards (Hearthstone. Yugioh etc.) but also, it's not at the place where, for the average person its worth investing $30-$40+ for good cards. Which is the main selling point.

[u]Game design[/u]
To start with the game design, the design is really really stunning. The graphics are very well done, and the animations are amazing looking. This does give a very interactive gameplay feel, and is far superior to basically all other CCGs out there.

This is really the only solidly perfected thing about the game at this early stage. The game has real potential if it could just be more finely tuned. I'll explain these below.

[u]Meta[/u]
The constructed meta of the game is extremely boring at this stage. You basically have a 50% chance of matching vs. OP heroes: Axe, Drow etc. which are all $10+ on the market. In the early development stages, Valve exaggerated their goal of this not being another pay-to-win game, and it certainly seems the complete opposite at this point.

I'm not just giving off about it being pay to win because I don't have the money, I had almost every card in the game including Axe, Drow, Kanna etc. however I've sold them all. I feel that the experience of winning against someone with less valuable cards is extremely unsatisfying. I want to win because of skill and strategy, not by spending extortionate amounts of money on cards to get a clearly obvious mega advantage. Also Valve, stop calling it a Trading Card Game, that literally means you trade your cards with other people, not trade your money for a card with a 15% Valve tax.

I 100% recommend playing draft only at this point. It's super fun, as you come across a huge variety of decks, and if someone has an OP card or hero, you can respect their luck for hitting it in a draft, rather than being annoyed you're getting beat because someone spent more money than you, like in constructed.

[u]Social[/u]
I am writing this before chat is available in the game, however chat update is apparently coming in tonight's update. I think releasing the full release of the game before this feature was a thing was a slight mistake.

[u]Progression[/u]
As of now, there is absolutely no ranking system in the game at all. This is the biggest downfall, and the one that's getting the most attention at the minute. I'll not go too in-depth, because I'm guessing this is a feature that will be added very soon, but as with my last point, it's a shame this is meant to be a full release without such a core feature.

[u]RNG[/u]
A lot of people are complaining about the RNG nature of the game. I must say I don't feel RNG affecting the outcome of anywhere near as many games as people try to make out. Cheating Death is the only really messed up card I can think of, and I think the game would benefit from a mulligan at the start of the game, and possibly some freedom with unit placements.

[u]Monetization[/u]
The game is very rapidly losing players daily. In my opinion, I do not understand whatsoever the monetization of the game. Valve tried to say the game wasn't free to play because they didn't want it to be pay to win like other CCGs, but then they made it $20 PLUS we're expected to spend $100+ to get a decent competitive deck.

Valve will inevitably make this game free to play, but they need to act very fast. The business model of games heavy on microtransactions is about getting players into a game easily, where they then feel pressured to spend money to get boosters faster than working for them. With a high price tag, people cannot just casually download the game and see how they feel about it, they must commit to that purchase, which is why this game will never ever kick off to Hearthstone's level of popularity without it being free to play.

To sum all up, the game is good, and I can see it going far provided Valve adjust these areas of the game based on the complaints from the community. They certainly do seem to be listening to community feedback on this game, but probably only because they've seen the numbers and realised something has gone badly wrong.",1543443544,1544737541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had high hopes for this one. Some of the unique ideas (items/heroes/lanes) seemed interesting and like they could really put a spin on the original concepts from MTG. Unfortunately, it's just a dull clone, without any of the interesting card effects from MTG. Every card is quite literally just a statistic. Do X damage, spawn a token, add X health. That's about every hand dealt in this game.

I could complain about a lot of other things here too, but really at its core this is just a flavourless, uninspired copy of MTG. There's dozens of MTG clones that are free. Play those instead.

It isn't yet as deep as MtG but due to the 3 lane format and only the first edition having been released, this might change in future. Since so many bad reviews exclusively dislike the paymet model, but even professional reviews don't explain it properly, let me put some things straight: You don't need to buy any more than the initial 10 boosters that come with the game or buy individual cards to play 80% of the modes. You can play even the most expensive and rare cards for free either as part of a preconstructed deck, or by playing a phantom draft in which you get 5 temporary boosters from which you can pick cards to construct a deck (you don't keep these cards though, you can play up to 5 times with them or untill you lose 2 matches-you cn do a new draft every 30 minutes). After lerning the game in free draft mode, you can start using the 5 tickets that also come with the game to win more boosters. 
You only need to buy cards if you want to play with individually constructed permanent decks.
And if you just play casual constructed, you can often construct a powerfull deck for less than 1€.
In competitive constructed you will need the best cards though and in some cases even multiple copies of them, so this can get expensive. Actually my initial 10 boosters contained cards worth more than the game costed, but it was luck; i decided to sell 3 cards to buy another 10 boosters which didn't really contain any high value cards at all xD",1544725741,1544725741,True,5,0,0.499513119459152222,0,True,False,False

Hopefully Valve can fix these problems in the future.  Existing cards need to be re-balanced, the economy needs to be reworked, and the card pool needs to be enlarged substantially.

- the voice work in this game is insanely comprehensive and high quality

1. Random effects shake things up, but they are not well thought through which means that the fun-factor due to randomness is not zero-sum. That is to say, for the person that loses the coin toss it feels like unjust bullshit, whilst the winner will hardly notice. This means that the net effect of randomness is skewed more towards 'unjust bullshit', since even if results go 50/50 for and against you, you will feel the negative effects much harder. Examples of bad RNG include: Jinada, Cheating Death, Arrows.

2. The card pool is extremely limited. Whilst there are a variety of interesting effects, there are no ways to build strongly synergistic decks since the card pool simply doesn't support going 'all-in' on a theme or mechanic. This means that the best constructed decks are essentially a collection of the strongest cards which leads to a boring meta, and one where only the most money-invested players are competitive.

3. Hero power levels are all over the place. There are examples where choosing one hero over another is *never* better, no matter the circumstances. In particular, this applies to the strongest heroes - namely Axe and Drow, who valve have decided to also make the most rare. This leads to the situation where the two most necessary heroes for a competitive collection are also the most expensive due to their rarity - a decision that can only have been made as a cash-grab for valve in the market. I don't hate the market as a monetization strategy, but I do hate that the two strongest and most needed heroes were intentially made the rarest to artificially inflate their value.

Basically, stay well away from this game until at least 1 and possibly 2 expansions have been released. Also, if valve don't get on top of balancing card power levels soon then the game will absolutely be dead in the water. Finally, valve need to show some good faith toward the player base with regards to expense vs. power level on the market - it is not acceptable to intentionally inflate the market by making the most powerful cards the rarest.",1544693830,1544693830,False,4,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Update:
On a more serious note, a lot of people are complaining about the monetization of this game and calling it pay to win. I've only played draft so maybe it feels that way in constructed, but draft is basically pay to lose. The competition in expert is way harder than the competition in casual. Besides, both casual and expert draft are tons of fun... usually.

My biggest complaint with this game is that it feels like there's significant autocorrelation in the cards you see in draft as well as in card draw during game. A few examples:

I've played 5 keeper drafts. In one of them, I opened two Chens. I took both of them and included them in my deck. Four of my six opponents during that keeper draft were also running Chen. My next keeper draft, I got another Chen. Chen is the only rare hero I've got from keeper draft.

I've drafted every Mist of Avernus I've seen because it's one of the most overpowered cards in the game. I haven't kept exact count but I think I've had it in about 8 decks out of maybe 80 that I've drafted. Two of those decks have had 2 mists and one has had 3. This was the 3 mist deck: https://www.playartifact.com/d/ADCJaQAYH2ALrwBBiEBuF1CJt0B1gUJB0kWlA6JTQcoAXsBFwgIEDMB. I think it was probably the best deck I've ever drafted. 3 mists and 5 thunderhide packs is pretty ridiculous. One of the games I played with this deck, I got the Unearthed Treasure out on mana turn four and got an extra card that turn and every turn thereafter. I didn't count how many extra cards I got from the Oxeman arena and other sources, but assuming it was 0, I drew 23 cards by mana turn 10.  I drew 0 of my 8 best cards (the mists and thunderhides) before mana turn ten that game. Assuming randomness, I should get about that lucky or that unlucky with card draw once every 3300 games. Odds of it coinciding with the best draft I've ever had should be like 1/250000.

I played against this deck in phantom draft: https://www.playartifact.com/d/ADCJfIAJbkCAZVZAi67AgEBBgFfAwsBGpABBAcTSQwFBQMGcwFOBwQGEFBb
12 rare main deck cards, 1 rare hero, 4 rare items. The item deck is pretty terrible, but mostly because it's missing the basics (traveler's cloaks) and includes one of the worst cards in the game (Jasper Daggers, which isn't rare). The only bad maindeck rare card it has is Keenfolk Gollum. I probably wouldn't pick Centaur before the final 6 cards in a draft, but I'd be more likely to do so early in a pack if he was going to be my third red hero, and I'd usually run him over Keefe. So all in all, I don't think it looks like this person went too far out of his or her way to draft rares, which means the odds of seeing a deck like this shouldn't be too different from the odds of opening 5 consecutive packs and happening to get 17 rare cards from those packs. I'm not actually sure whether that should be an underestimate or an overestimate since 15 of these 17 cards should often make it past the cut in draft, and there are a lot of rare cards that pretty much never should. (Whispers of Madness, Meepo, assured destruction, bitter enemies, fractured timelines, watchtower, path of anything other than the dreamer...).

Yes, I'm cherry picking examples so I should be finding extrema. However, I don't think I should be able to pick examples this extreme from the number of games I've played. I've played far more games of Dominion in my life than I have of artifact, and I've played only one game of Dominion that felt this extreme. A much higher percentage of the games of Artifact have felt improbable (including some where it felt like I got crazy lucky) than any other game I've played.

At least one of the following is true:
- My experience has been an anomoly, and more extreme than the typical experience.
- There is a bug in the randomization which causes autocorrelation in what cards you see when drafting and/or which cards you draw in game.
- There is a flaw in the game design which makes normal fluctuations in card draw feel significantly more extreme here than it does in other games.


Other randomness I'm not a fan of:
Bounty Hunter's random +4 can feel pretty bad, but more so if you are playing Bounty Hunter than if you are playing against it. At least in draft, Bounty Hunter seems pretty weak. I think Bounty Hunter would be a much better card both in terms of power level and in terms of game design if the random +4 was determined after the deployment phase instead of before the action phase. (Why? Black has a lot of cross lane damage, and bounty is terrible solo black. Whenever the +4 matters, every single health item can counter it, but few damage items can compensate for its absence.)

Not quite random but I absolutely hate At Any Costs. It either needs to be buffed by being made common and having pierce added to it so that it will do something to Red/Green and become a card that you actually ought to play around because you expect people to run it, or needs to be nurfed out of existence by having the deck lists made visible. As it stands, it's a mediocre card that isn't encountered often because it's rare and frequently shouldn't make the cut in a deck but is occassionally game-breaking when people run it if they happen to find a situation where it's useful.


On the other hand, I feel like a lot of the sources of randomness that people complain about don't detract from the game.

The arrows during deployment mostly extend the game since the curves typically favor whoever is losing the lane, and you have to play around not getting the curves anyways. Also, every color has several ways to change them.

I really haven't run into many reasons to complain about cheating death. It seldom makes it into one of my decks, and I am almost always playing at least a few cards that partially counter it (Prellex, Venomancer, Ignite, Conflagration, Dimensional Portal, and Defensive Bloom to name a few). It also helps balance the game, since it counters disgusting cards like Axe and annihilation. (Except it pairs well with annihilation too which sucks...)

Lucky or unlucky creep spawns definitely swing a few games, but in most games, enough heroes end up dying that creep spawns add more depth to the game by increasing the importance of decisions around deploying heroes, improvements, and cross-lane spells than they subtract by increasing randomness. 

I have mixed feelings about the flop but mostly think it's positive. It usually just increases the variation in game play, but there are a few heroes which amplify that randomness which can occassionally make the flop feel like it has too much impact on the game, especially Bristleback and Ursa. I'd like to see Ursa changed to have an active which gives him his passive (and then increases it) on a 3 or 4 turn cool down. Not sure about Bristle. Lycan/Enchantress is another really weird one where Lycan wins when they're offset and Enchantress wins when they're face to face. It doesn't impact the game much but can feel really bad. There are cards like Juke and New Orders which rectify these situations, but only if you draw them early, which goes back to card draw feeling like the primary source of randomness in this game that really detracts.


Honestly, I think this would be a signifcantly better game if card draw was changed to be something like the follwoing: pick two cards that you start with, build two decks with at least 19 cards each. At the start of each turn draw one card from each deck. The first extra card you draw is randomly picked from either deck. After that, extra card draw alternates between the two decks. At least for draft.

I came to artifact with a fairly vast historical experience from MTG and MTGO.  As they are also Garfield games they give a good starting point for reviewing this game.  This has potential to actually be a good game.  A very good Game.

The problem is there is just way too much pure randomness spread throughout the game.  The issue with Artifact is there is absolutely no way to minimize the various.  I'm not talking about variance that comes with card games naturally.  The variance from drawing a card is part of any card game, minimizing that variance is part of what makes games like MTGO great.  

In Artifact the issue lies with the other amounts of pure randomness you can't play around in any manner.  If you play a hero (and/or the random creeps spawn) in a lane you have no control over where they enter the lane.  To be honest I actually like this feature of the game and think that, like the variance in drawing cards, this you can play around and skill will shine through.  

The problem is once a creature is in lane, there is a %50 chance that any creature will not attack the target it is supposed to (%50 straight ahead and %25 to either side).  This prevents any skill involved with playing creatures as their attack target is literally not what you planned for %50 of the time.  There are MULTIPLE cards that rely on pure chance to be active as well, things like %50 to survive instead of die, %25 to have a card return to your hand instead of discard when played, %50 to stun enemy creatures, the list goes on. and on. and on.  Like any high variance game you remember the bad beats more that the surprise wins so you always walk away feeling cheated.  

The end effect is the game becomes who can get the most creatures on the board the fastest and then get luck with attacks to buy the good item and become unstoppable.  

Again with some minor changes to remove the variance of cards already in play this can be a VERY good game.  At this time it's just a coin flip.  That always feels like it comes up not in your favor.

In 2018, the lack of external reinforcement mechanisms in a game will lead to a dwindling player base. They will go play games which do have some of these features.

---> You can actually play constructed in this game without grinding your life away or throwing away hundreds of dollars every few months to stay competetive (Hi B****ard)
---> strong decks for a few dollars (cheap cheap)
---> The cards you own hold value (A couple dollars spend for a deck doesn't mean that money is gone)
- well thought through menu, all necesarry filters in constructed etc.
- good looks in general
- deep and complex gameplay

----------------Contra--------------
- deep and complex gameplay
---> mb too overwhelming for casuals in the beginning (probably why it's not doing so well , yet)
- ""shop"" phase seems to be too luck based (my noobish intuition)
-  confusing between phases (lanes act at the same time)
- too much stuff to keep track off (3 Lanes, Hero buffs and spells, Hero [and their buffs] redeployments etc. etc.)

Save yourself the headache.  Valve completely ruined a game that had tremendous potential.  I entered the game skeptical, I gave it every chance imaginable, I listened to all the people that defended the game in order to gain perspective, and ultimately I've concluded that this is one of the worst games on the market to date.

What makes it so bad compared to other horrendous games?  The wasted potential and blatant attempt to cash grab its players with no regard for the game itself.  This is a service to designed to make money.  It's not designed for player fulfillment.

It does almost everything wrong once you go deeper than the surface level animations and game concept.  The cards are unbalanced yet overpowered cards can never be nerfed due to the egregious economic model.  The poorly designed card pool leads to spikes of disappointment throughout the gameplay.  The market economy is so badly botched that this alone ruins the entire game and demolishes any hope of future potential being realized.

I've experienced gameplay bugs that caused me to lose a few games, and this isn't even considered a major problem to me because of the other glaring issues with the game.  You read that correctly:  Game breaking bugs that cause a player to lose a game that they had to pay a ticket to enter isn't even a top concern for me at this point.

The community is destroyed due to all the aforementioned issues.  If someone wants to make sound critiques, then they are perceived by many to be overly negative.  If someone compliments the game, then they are perceived by many to be delusional.  There is no way for a community like this to grow.  The fact is that the issues, at their core, stem from Valve's greed, which the player base cannot fix or control.

Throw this game in the trash can.  It is beyond repair.

What about Valve's reputation with other games?  Valve got lucky.  They managed to find a way to syphon money from their players in the other games without causing too much damage to the game itself.  Their attempt to syphon as much money as possible from would-be Artifact players has actually ruined the game at its core.

Artifact is such a blatant misuse of a good concept that I'm considering programming my own version of this game because of how much wasted potential there is.",1544646452,1544646452,False,20,1,0.545815348625183105,0,True,False,False

It's almost Impossible to have a veriety,  Because the only cards you need to know or own are red cards over the fact that they have really solid spells and the only overpowered hero in the game. Most of the other red hero's can also one shot almost 70% of the other hero cards that aren't red with base damage and survive because they also have a high health pool. With that said, It limits your options quite a lot because they are a MUST for front lines in early game, and that becomes even more true if your opponent is wise. 

In summary, there are specific cards that just don't have an immediate check unless you own the same ones or buff and condemn them and by the time you have the mana for a condemn spell and buff your cards it's just too late because your opponent is already running a tight ship right away just buffing away on already powerful cards.

First of all it has a horrible economic model if u dont want to constantly spend money on the game. Since there is no regional price due to market, it hurts the playerbase in many countires. Being have to pay more to play competitive mode is such a joke.
  
Secondly there is no progression system or a profile page that u can track your statistics. No ranked system.

Some cards are game breakingly op (like axe and drow ranger) and they said, they wont get nerfed because of market value. ( yea appereantly market is more important than game(balance) itselfs) Constructed is a joke due to op cards. 

Some wierd rng. Among the card games I have played, this game has one of the least impactful rng but still it can get realy annoying(looking at u cheating death) and game changing. Creep spawn doesnt have to be totaly random. Why not make it 1 creep spawn for each lane every turn? Rng in this game is not horrible imo but can still use some improvements.

No social interactions. Cant chat with opponent. No rematch option after a fun dead even game.
 
This game is considered as trading card game. Except u cant trade. Like come on. 

The share valve gets from card sales in market is realy high. 

So the core of the game is fun and i will still play time to time but at this state its hard to recomend the game to anyone.

I'd say a big yes to that... here's why:


First off, when going through the forums, you'll find a lot of posts and threads about the cost. Yes, if you wish to play expert constructed, you'll likely spend a bit more on a top deck (I thikn if you add another roughly 20-30$ to that starting 20$, you should have a very competitive top deck already also for that).

That said, that's the only mode in which you'll need to put in more money. The casual modes are 100% free, even draft tournaments can be played for free fully. Expert mode requires a token to play, but if you win 3 before you lose 2, you'll get back the token (and if you win more, you get packs that value 2 tokens each). You also already start out with 5 tokens when you purchase the game.

So cost wise, the game is perfectly fine - it could very well be considered cheap even.


The release of the game was a bit of a mess, and it's still early days for the game itself. Some improvements were made in the days after the release, and a few more are still set to come. Personally I'm waiting for a fully ranked mode, where the ranks are also visible somehow, and ways to qualify for larger torunaments with big $ prizes... but that's just me.

The gameplay itself is never the same, even if you play the same deck. It's very similar to the other game the developer made (Magic the Gathering) as in how to build up a deck, but it plays out very strategically due to the 3 lanes for which you can play your cards, and the need to either win two of the lanes, or to win one very hard before the opponent wins the other two. It might be a little bit of a challenge to get into at first as now most players have some time in the game already and have the experience of knowing the cards and what to expect, but even a new player can get into it quite fast. It's got a learning curve that's easy to learn, but tough to fully master - even with there only being one card set at the moment (once most people will have gotten close to mastering it, then a new card set could theoretically turn things around quite a bit again due to the new possiblities players would have).

What are the downsides of the game - there must be some?

Well, yes... a draft tournament pits you against others who also choose to play draft - not per se against those that were choosing cards when you did. This means that picking a card for the reason that at least your opopnents don't get it, is almost useless - a difference compared to most draft tournaments. Also it's possible to be placed against the same opponent twice in a row (I've had it happen within the same tournament). It's rare, but it happens.



Looks and sounds are things I generally interested in much less than the average player, and due to where I play, I always have the sound turned off. But the game is made to be fun; the two little dragons (or whatever they are supposed to be) are a lot of fun added in to the gameplay, without actually affecting the game in any way.


I'll be very positive here and give the game an 8/10 rating right now, with a very likely chance for that rating to go up even more with future small improvements like the ones already announced.",1544627834,1544627834,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First of all, this game is, frankly, beautiful. The care that Valve put into it is obvious, and it came out looking absolutely prestine. That's weird to say about a digital trading card game, but the graphics really are remarkable. Secondly, this was not something thrown together haphazardly or ripped from another trading card game. The lead designer was the designer of Magic: The Gathering, and despite the obvious kneejerk reaction being ""Valve is just copying Hearthstone,"" this game is not even remotely like Hearthstone. Lastly, to those who are angry that Artifact is ""pay-to-win,"" I can only note that ALL trading card games are fundamentally pay-to-win at least to some extent. I have never been a serious trading card enthusiast, but I have friends who tell me that professionally competitive Magic decks regularly go for over $200. Trading card games are not cheap, and that fact is not new. However, that doesn't mean that all pay-to-win models are created equally. And Artifact does do it really, really badly, which brings me to the review.

PAYMENT MODEL and GAME MODES. All trading card games are somewhat pay-to-win, but Artifact is buy-to-pay-to-win. You pay $20 to buy the game, then you spend another $40 if you really want to assemble a great deck. As of this writing, the best cards are floating between $5-15 each. And you MUST buy them if you want a decent deck. There are also competitive game modes in addition to playing casually or against bots. These competitive game modes offer a prize of a pack of cards if you manage to win 4-5 games without losing more than 1. But in order to compete, you must PAY to buy a ticket for each attempt to do this, and to stand even a remote chance of winning some competitive games, you must have already bought all of the cards to comprise a professional deck. In other words, you pay large sums of money to assemble a competitive deck, then you pay money to buy access to each competitive event, then on the rare chance that you actually win, your prize is... a pack of cards. The cards that you had to already buy in order to stand a chance.. to..... win them...? Whose idea was that..? It's absolutely nonsensical, and a shameless money pit.

UNTRADABLE TRADING CARDS. In a brilliant [sarcasm] move on Valve's part, the Artifact trading cards are not tradable. You read that correctly: you CANNOT trade the trading cards. You MUST spend real money on them. There is no simple/legal way to just give cards to your friends. By making the cards untradable except through the sanctioned in-game market system, Valve effectively ensures that the cards will hold a value well above what they probably would if they could be freely traded. Moreover, like the other items in the Steam Market, you can't just cash out your Steam Wallet, so it is a bit of a misnomer to claim that you got a ""valuable"" card. Even if you sell it, the money can't ever leave Steam.

NO SOCIAL ASPECT WHATSOEVER. The experience of playing Artifact is identical to playing bots, except some bots these days are programmed to taunt or trash talk and your Artifact opponent doesn't. Artifact currently includes:
-no chat
-no ability to friend request
-no rematch request ability
-no link to find opponent's Steam profile
-no record or replay of matches
-no visible MMR system (but invisible, yes) to know or show your rating
-no ability to trade cards with friends, as noted above
In genuine trading card games, people are not bothered by the pay-to-win aspect, because trading card games just developed as a way to derive more entertainment from card collections. You hang out, have a beer, play the game and check out each others cards to spark discussions. Then later your collection grows, you trade, eventually perhaps you get to an upper-tier of gameplay. None of this can happen in Artifact, because it is 100% asocial.

INFLEXIBILITY. For most card games that I have watched people play locally, mainly Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh years ago, something that struck me as interesting was that at lower and mid-tier gameplay, people could think of interesting strategies, build a deck around that strategy, and it could be a viable option that would stand a good chance of winning. In Artifact, despite the huge richness of game mechanics, the actual cards available and the abnormally strong pay-to-win element ensure that you're cornered into a few limited options if you want to be able to win games. For example, Artifact gameplay revolves around hero cards, and every deck must consist of exactly 5 heroes. There are many, many hero cards, but most are so bad that nobody who wants to win ever uses them. Axe, Drow Ranger, and Kanna are objectively top tier heroes in Artifact for numerous reasons. If you buy Artifact, you'll immediately notice that everyone seems to be using Axe and Kanna while dozens of other heroes get almost zero screen time. Why? Because those players got stomped by Axe and Kanna over and over, then broke down and bought Axe and Kanna. Because Axe and Kanna are great cards. Most decent decks revolve around the same tiny number of top-tier heroes, with a couple backup  heroes that play a lesser roll. And it isn't just heroes... You see the same exact cards of each colour coming up over and over, and it's just sort of boring. Nobody plays the other cards, because they tried and got wrecked repeatedly. So they either quit the game, or bought the ""go-to"" top-tier cards. 

PAY-TO-WIN, BUT DON'T. The most amusing part of the pay-to-win model to me is that this game has an invisible MMR system. So you get wrecked, get butthurt and go buy better cards. Then you win a couple. Because you paid to win... But then your MMR goes up and you stop winning again. Gee whizz, better go give Valve more money and pay to win a few more!  This can happen several times, then you'll reach the upper tier where everyone uses the same expensive cards.

The last one I'll go into is that aside from the previously mentioned problems with perceived balance problems and being forced to buy certain cards, I have to say that after playing dozens of games and logging over 24 hours, I find that this game is just extremely and generally unsatisfying. There is just something hollow about this game in spite of the rich mechanics. When you win, it's just sort of... whatever. When you lose, it's whatever. Often, you can't help but feel that the opponent just got a ridiculously lucky series of draws and that you were doomed from round 2 or 3. The mechanics allow for such extreme strings of luck that one player can in a single turn achieve a position that is virtually impossible to stop. Here's an example: on the SECOND turn of one game, my opponent played two cards which boosted his mana to 11. He then play Incarnation of Selemene, which provides essentially, unlimited mana. He also had out an Ogre Magi, whose special ability is a 25% chance to get an extra copy of any card you played. He then, in that same single lane of the same single round, proceeded to play 4 Foresights (+2 from Ogre) allowing him to draw EIGHT extra cards, then he played multiple creeps, multiple boosts, and an Emissary of the Quorum. It crushed everything in my lane, and the next round the damage count to my tower was -81..enough to end the game on round 3. The only way to counter things like this is if you just so happen to have a very specific counter like Annihilate in your deck and happen to draw it. Otherwise, you just lose. Period. And this happens A LOT.

Final recommendation: hardcore card enthusiasts who are content with seeing artwork and appreciating mechanics, buy if you want to have a look. Everyone else, especially those who expect this to be a fair or competitive game, I strongly urge you to pass.",1544412553,1544580234,False,5,0,0.524273872375488281,0,True,False,False

 Does the game needs more cards?
Yes, absolutely. Its not such fun play against 4 archetype decks in constructed. But thats something what can be changed with new expansion.

Price of the game...20 bucks WTF?
Game costs 20 dollars thats true, but you get 10 packs worth 20 dollars and 5 event tickets worth 5 dollars...together 25 dollars goods.
Plus some basic cards which are actualy worth nothing, cause everybody has them, but hey you can still play them.

Do you need to pay to grow your collection?
That depends on your skill and luck. You can play constructed and phantom drafts (1 ticket) to win boosters and ticket back. When you have 5 boosters go to keeper draft. After that you can recycle your cards into event tickets (20 cards = 1 ticket). Anything worth more than 5 cents is better to sell on marketplace. So if you are good enaugh you can go infinetely like that, growing your collection and not spending money.

Valve is silent do they still care about the game?
That is valid point. Lets just hope for the best.

Is there are randomness in Artifact?
Yes, there is, but it can be manipulated. Just that fake death again:-((

And what about playerbase?
Playerbase dropped drasticaly since launch. But I dont have problems to find opponents within seconds, even when I have 4-0.



Overall Artifact is a great game with some problems, but those can be fixed. To be good in this game you need skill, know how and of course little luck...but mostly skill.

P.s.: Hey Valve. I think, that creeps and heroes should attack just straight if not manipulated by card or abbility. And do something with stupid fake death🤨. Thank you

There's counters, but it's a struggle while your opponent has a lot less of bad time.

It's incredibly intense but also a lot of fun; I've been experiencing a lot of exhilarating highs when clinching a tight game and crashing lows when things don't go my way. The animation and soundtrack are both a joy to experience.

It's a very tactical game and I'd say probably more aimed at experienced TCG fans than casual players.

While I've managed to have hours of fun without paying any additional money, I do have one qualm with the Expert mode (that requires tickets to enter). I've yet to play it and the reason for that is I don't think I'd be able to get to 3 wins before 2 losses, which is the minimum you have to do to win your entry ticket back. This for me, sets the bar too high. When you consider random elements of the game, such as creep and hero placement it's quite an ask unless you have a really solid deck. For me, I think it would make more sense to award a ticket after 2 wins, even if there's no additional reward at three wins.
Now, perhaps Expert truly is only aimed at experts, who are really experienced at drafting or are willing to spend a bit of extra money to put together a perfect constructed deck. I would be perfectly happy with that, but if this is the case, then I feel they shouldn't have included tickets with a purchase of the game and lowered the cost appropriately.

Now, there could be an arguement stating that one would need the right cards to counter these styles. There lies the issue: In order to get the cards, you'd either have to buy a card pack in game, or buy them directly off the marketplace, and even then, some of the best cards can be well above the price of a standard cardpack in the game itself. Basically, if you don't have the right cards in your deck either from lack of spendable cash on hand or just unfornuate not getting one in a card pack, you're pretty much screwed.

I decided to give this a try despite the microtransactions/trading. I viewed this similar to how Magic cards were when I was growing up.

Lately I've been playing Disney's Villainous with some friends so I was itching for some more card game action. 

I spent about $15~ on building myself a good deck based on some guides I found online and this has made for some very challenging games. 

Typically most games I'm doing about 50/50 win/loss ratio with this new deck I made. The games I lose are usually by a thread which makes for a really exciting game. 

Pros:
-Really addictive gameplay
-When you win there is something just oddly really satisfying about crushing your opponent
-Games go quick, roughly 20-30 minutes tops. 
-After 10~ or so games you really get the hang of what abilities people use based on the cards/combo's they have
-No game is ever the same
-I crushed some dude in a game who had a clearly put some money into his deck including a card that costs nearly $20 last I checked. This was very satisfying to know I can still win despite what cards people buy. 

Cons:
-Wish they had more stats tracking
-I like multiplayer coop games generally but this one is only 1v1 so can't really play with friends unless it's against them
-Some people say it's pay to win, yes while you do have to get good cards to play competitively you can always play draft mode which is pre-built decks. I forked up another $15 and it's like I paid for a premium game.

The complexity and yet elegance of the game is amazing. Artifact is great in achieving what would be a pain to do on a regular board, takes care of all the upkeep, nicely signifies which units are going to die, which cards you can play etc. I also love the fact that just by seeing certain heroes, you know what you can expect from the decks, something that other CCGs are missing - so you are either following the meta or you are completely blind to what your opponent can play. So it gives each hero a specific flair, some personal touch. 

Yes, the matches are longer than usual for other online card games. Yes, the game is certainly quite complex and not as straightforward as other CCGs, especially as heroes dying is involved. It is necessary to remind yourself that your goal is not to destroy enemy's heroes (as it allows them to redeploy). The strategy is is all about pacing, deciding on which towers to focus and how to misdirect and bluff your opponent into committing to unimportant lanes. Personally, I like the randomness of creep deployment and attack direction, but I understand it can be frustrating for some people to lose because of it. 

I also love the business model and I was excited for it from the entire beginning. I don't think giving cards away for casual play is necessary and would destroy the economy. I enjoy the fact I can buy decks for money directly, much more than I like getting ""free"" random packs in other games. I have bought few ""preconstructed"" decks for about 3 eur and enjoy my time with them. I love the fact I can go online, create/find a deck I think I'll enjoy and then just buy it. Sites like ArtifactFire allow you to even sort them by current market value and so you can search for interesting decks for 2-3 bucks and play with friends. Sure, you are probably not going to win a tournament, but I am in CCGs more for fun than domination :) Also, other CCGs force you to buy packs after packs and without any serious hope of getting what you need or what you like. Getting that winning deck for tournaments is therefore much more costly. Artifact tournament level decks atm. might cost 20-40 bucks, but you know what you are getting. You give cut to Valve for sure, but the main part of that money goes back to players. 

So I enjoy the game, but so far, there is also a lot to desire - replays of past games, some sort of progression (say with cosmetics, emotes) and achievements would be nice, some daily challenges etc. But I believe that Valve is listening and is working on it and I hope that Artifact will evolve and just be more what the players want.

I am a person who loves mechanics in a game above all else, so when you tell me you can play Hearthstone, or Gwent, or the other hip new card games, but with 50% more mechanics and 3 games at once, im in.

[list]
[*] Games take a long time. Way too long.
[*] Results feel random. Randomness in attack direction and hero match up plays an outsized role in the game.
[*] No recovery mechanics. If you have an unlucky first turn and lose two heros, you're very likely to lose the game, as your opponent will not only be up heros, but have 10 gold to buy sweet items.
[*] Not enough common cards. After only three drafts, I can say I've memorized all common cards by heart. This makes drafts, and matches in draft, very boring.
[*] Drafts are very luck dependant, even more so than MTG or ESL, because of the hero mechanic. Get a great hero pack 1? You're golden and can build around him. Get the same great hero pack 5 and you didn't go those colors? Gg son, gg.

If you're new to trading card games, you're going to feel robbed. It's really that simple.

As far as the actual game, this is one of the most intelligently designed card games I have ever played, but it seems like when Garfield was designing it he became obsessed with RNG. Not being able to select what lane your starting heroes go into creates scenarios where you can start the game behind just because you happened to get your weakest hero across from their Axe or PA. 

The decision to have your lanes go in random directions also boggles my mind. I shouldn't have my entire setup from the previous round because a random roll of the dice decided my hero should attack to the left instead of attacking the tower. It just feels like they got carried away with the ""layers of strategy"" and ended up putting systems in that make your strategy meaningless. 

In a genre that already has the inherent RNG of drawing from a deck of cards, it is maddening that the designers felt the need to add several more layers of randomness to what they are pitching as having deeper strategy than any other card game.

I was a casual DotA player (~3.8k hours) and when Artifact was announced, I got excited because my reflexes are too slow for DotA now and a DotA-based Valve-developed card game seemed interesting.

Thing I was expecting when Artifact was announced and not a lot of detail existed
- a card game with most of the monetization on the Cosmetics side
- relatively cheaper trading (compared to a $15-20 Axe card). Was hoping that a full deck on average would cost within $30 (given that it is a digital card game)
- a good ranked gaming experience
- some sort of grinding system

But once the game released
- paying is the only way to get cards
- a couple of very OP cards that you have no way to counter (looking at you Time of Triumph; and to an extent, Cheating Death)
- you have to pay to play ranked (WTF!)
- games are too long on average

There are a few nice thing though
- phantom draft are fun, but drafting process itself is time consuming since you have consider the packs' RNG. You cannot say ""ok I'll build a deck around summoning creeps"" in phantom draft because the cards you need might not appear. After 5 games, you have to rebuild a deck (I think). If you want to play certain ""built"" decks and not pay anymore than the game's base cost, time is how you will be paying it with
- very well made game art
- once you have a deck you want to play with, the gameplay itself is entertaining

DotA2 is insanely successful because of it's F2P model. They made counter-strike F2P now. Fortnite is an F2P game. Monetization through Cosmetics is what is getting them the play base. I dunno which genius thought about the monetization for Artifact, cause the player base is showing that it is not working. And having to pay to play ranked. And no progression system. And no balancing system.

All in all, it's a no-no",1544485674,1544485674,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False
583950,47449434,76561198097748285,0,7,3764,0,2666,1593283336,"Artifact really does well in capturing the essence of the Dota2 universe into a card format. The heros all have wonderful voice interactions with other heros and even creeps to further immerse yourself into the story behind Artifact. The gameplay is most of the time phenomenal and after most losses leaves you in a reflective period where you can point out your own mistakes and how you could have played better and this part of Artifact feels much more rewarding than other card games because you do invest so much thought and time into each match and decision. 

However on the opposite end of this there are points of RNG that can be at times incredibly frustrating. When a hero or creep is deployed it drops an arrow to indicate what that creep or hero will be attacking and this for the most part is entirely random. There are small cases where you can influence the arrows whether it be through putting a creep in front of something or specific cards but for the most part these arrows and the RNG they add are the games biggest flaw. I have lost several games due to heros piling on the same creep causing me to lose upwards to 20 damage in a turn which is half an objective needed to win. In the same vein when your heros get deployed they fall onto the board in random locations which further removes your feeling of control over your decisions in games. This can lead to really awkward feelings of lines of gameplay that can either be a really strong play or just an incredibly terrible play. Additionally at the start of the game heros are placed randomly so if your opponent has a lot of strong heros designed to kill other heros (black/red) and you're playing some of the weaker hero with low damage and hp (blue) you can instantly feed your opponent 5-15 gold in the first round and limit your ability to play cards the following round just because of the RNG placement of heros. If I could change anything in Artifact it would be the arrows directing combat and the RNG of deploying creeps/heros. 

And finally card design. What's the point of designing so many heros when you have some that completely outclass others. It feels as if you play any Red or Green deck you have to autoinclude Axe or Drow because they are just so strong. I'm not complaining about the strengths of these 2 heros but more so to the fact of why can these 2 be so strong and other heros so weak. This game is designed around the heros and it feels incredibly bland when half of them can't even dream of being playable. They need to rebalance the heros to where if it has a strong body maybe a less powerful hero card and vice versa and if this cant be achieved then all heros should be impactful both on the board and in their hero spells as well. 

Axe for example is a 7/2/7 which means he kills most heros outright and dies to very minimal heros and takes no damage from creeps, he is undeniably broken in what he offers on board control compared to every other hero in the game. Then we look at his hero spell Berserkers Call which for 6 mana allows a blocked red hero to fight all the enemy neighbors potentially not only clearing 3 positions on a board but wiping entire lanes or outright killing multiple heros in 1 card. Axe is insane. 

Earthshaker in comparison is a 2/0/7 meaning he can't kill creeps, dies to most heros in red/black outright, has no armor to prevent any creep or hero damage and comes with a stun on a 4 turn cooldown which often can be unreliable based on the RNG of positioning listed above as like Axe's berserkers call it effects enemy neighbors. Earthshakers hero card is Echo Slam which deals damage to enemies equal to the amount of enemies in lane. When there is a huge board Echo Slam can be devastating and outright win games, but when there's 1-3 units it is nothing more than a feelsbadman. 

If a hero can't kill anything on the board and often times dies to most hero on hero engagements than the abilities on the hero or its hero card should offset this imbalance and many heros fail to do this quite like Axe or Drow who are always good no matter what because they offer constant value through their hero stats and cards. If this game is to succeed they need to bring the weaker heros power up to influence more creativity in hero choices. 

Last part of rant is a specific card in Cheating Death. It's an enhancement that states if a green allied hero is in this lane all allies have a 50% chance upon dying to live with 1hp instead. If there's any card that should just be removed from this game it is this card. I've had several games that felt so good and then the guy plays this card and it just becomes this RNG shitshow and in all just feels terrible to be on the receiving end of this card. Either nerf this card to be 10-20% chance or just get rid of it because I won't play this game until that card is gone. This card doesn't cheat death it cheats players of a good experience. 

TLDR: Good game needs mechanics and heros reworked and balanced to meet its full potential. And Cheating Death should be removed from the game.",1544483526,1544483526,False,5,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The fact that you can buy singles of the market place sold this game instantly for me. While there are slight rng elements in the form a placement of creeps, I feel this game is pretty skill based and does take time to master.

I feel the biggest problem artifact is going to have is trying to appeal to their target player base. They are an online card game built with an economy like a paper ccg. Most paper ccg players arnt going to stick to this because they would rather play magic irl, but that's not the audience they are going for anyway. With all logic, they are trying to obtain hearthstone players to come play this game.
Like I said above though, this is an online tcg built with a paper ccg economy. So the progression systems people are used to from online tcgs can't exist. It would make the economy of the game unstable and unviable. Which is also going to make it look much more like a money grab.
At its base though, all card are money grabs. The fact that this one let's you buy singles though, is much less of an investment than games like hearthstone. Rather than opening hundreds of dollars in packs, you buy 20 dollars in singles and finish your deck.
The problem with this though, while I prefer it, it does not give people the satisfaction of opening packs and feeling as though they are progressing themselves. With any online game, the feeling of progression is going to keep it alive with the more casual side of the playet base. Casuals keep games alive. You have to keep them happy to keep the economy of the game happy.

But also understand that, outside of the economy, you can draft for free infinitely in this game for fun. You can get hours of playing out of this game for free. Constructed is barely half of this game, and buying singles for constructed in this game is nothing compared to any other tcg out there. It Is so much cheaper.

- Some cards are OP and some are completely useless.
- The heroes are always deployed on a random slot on the lane. With an red hero, for example, you want to face the enemy hero directly and as an blue hero, for example, you want to be as far away from the enemy hero as possible. The red heroes will destroy the blue heroes, for example, within 2 or even 1 turn. So you have to be lucky.
- The creeps are spawning on random lanes.
- The units are attacking randomly to the front or to the left or to the right. This produces situations that are very unfair.

It can happen, that the enemy hero is attacking your hero, but you are attacking his tower, so you will lose your hero, giving him 5 gold and a free round (if you don't have another hero to play cards on the lane), leading to the enemy snowballing.

Cards you receive and don't want to use or already own can be sold on the steam marketplace to the highest bidder. Original set of packs I opened was worth over $20.

It is only fair that they hear from someone who truly loves and embraces this game.

I have a pretty lengthy history in games and card games in general. For complexity and strategic depth, Magic is probably the best card game on the market atm. However, there is a fundamental problem with it being an analog (physical) game. Tournaments are cumbersome and time consuming in organization and execution. Cheating is still an ongoing issue. Card balance control is inelegant and relies on bannings. All of these issues can be solved by going digital which is where Artifact steps in.

The in client tournament system is revolutionary. Already there have been numerous qualifiers for decently sized tournaments (seatstory cup) and this convenient system is a boon for the amateur scene. Sites like doubledrow.com also help expedite the process and allow the general populace to easily and efficiently participate in the tournament scene.

Even the most negative detractors have a hard time criticizing the gameplay. Being an avid chess and MtG player, this game combines both of these games beautifully. The strategic and tactical depth is unparalleled. I have played Draft, Pauper and Meta constructed extensively with a respectable win rate. Pauper especially was a pleasant surprise. Playing only with commons did not detract from the experience at all while also introducing creative deckbuilding elements.

Draft is usually a card games most popular game mode and Artifact allows you to do them for free with the caveat that you will not be playing for prizes. I have also hosted a number of mini 4 man tournaments with friends (also free) and could play for some predetermined stakes.

Meta constructed is great and the most complex imo since blink dagger is such potent tool and creates a completely different dynamic as well as playing with the most powerful cards in the game.

The monetization model is the biggest sore spot and main subject of contention from the complainers. This game is best compared with MtG. Frankly, anyone who has a clue to what their talking about should know that maintaining a collention in Artifact costs a fraction of what it would cost in MtG. Also, the ability to buy and resell cards at similar values is significantly more fluid than the huge value hit players take from disenchanting cards in the card games that use card creation materials. Also, it is a nice option to have to be able to purchase specific cards that you want rather than grinding out those materials.

Yes, outside of the winnings that you may receive from events using the 5 tickets and the ten packs from your initial purchase, you have to spend to money to build a collection. But honestly with all those previous points and the fluid nature of the market, it is much easier to receive a higher return on investment than the other games. Another thing, if you have a friend who has access to a lot of cards there is a function to share decks with your friends so you can both can access all the cards from one collection. Sweet bonus, say I have 1 copy of axe but i built two decks that run a copy. You are still able to play both of those decks with your friend as if you had two copies of Axe.

Also, it is unlikely that the Artifact we currently see will remain the same for long. Valve has a history of evolving their games and adjusting to the needs of their players. Look at Dota 2 on release and what it is now. Valve has proven before that they adapt and respond to their players.

I am usually one of those people who would rather just observe that participate in the internet dialogue but when I see so much negativity towards such a beautiful game, I could not help myself. In an age where AAA games are nearing $100 and people are complaining about Artifact's pricing just boggles my mind.

I'm a PES fan from 2008 and i play PES about 10 years until now, quite a big fan right ? 
But from now i really dissapointed about how Konami plan/delvelop the game, specially about the offline part - master league. 
I play all Fifa and PES too, in the pass, i prefer PES but from this year, i really think that, the staffs of konami is just all the programers never play football in really life. I never write a review before event some games are really bad. But this kind of PES is unceptable, i never play it any more and will play fifa 19 instead, and in the next few years too, especially with the money you spend to buy the game, this game is really unacceptable. I play on PC and on PS4. If you buy this game to play with your friends, everything ís just fine, but if you want to play online, or play the offline mode ( master league or BAL), its really suck. The way Konami planed the game, they decided the script of the league.
Can you believe that ? i played 10 times against 1 small club from the Greek. But they acted like they all over 90. they faster than Rashford and Martial, stronger than event Pogba and Matic, event Varane, ... all of them, run like jet and bodyblock, interception all the game like buffaloes. 
when the ball comes up, pops out, i mean the orbit of ball is not idea. I - as a human, always need some seconds to guest or react, but they do not. They react with a bad, complex orbit ball event not slow the speed down. Can you imagine that ? just run straight ahead, and shoot, and goal, all the shoot is uncatchable - event with De Gea. And what about me ? Yeah, im a pes-er for 10 years, of course, i made some chance to shoot, but Lukaku, and sanchez, and dybala, ... all of them shoot straight to the keeper, you think that i dont know to to turn the ball to the corner of the goal ? 
and this is the best part, i play 10 times, and all of them, the opponent - small club from Greek, always win with 2 goals separate. If i made it 1-0, they will win 3-1, if i can have 2 goals, the score sheet is 4-2 
can you believe that ? 
I just want to play some normal game and have some fun after work. But i dont want a predefined script like this, with all of my effort is useless. 
If you are someone just like me, want to play offline mode, want to be a manager. i suggest you try FIFA19 and forget PES. 
Thank the konami for all the memories that i played with my friends, some 2 vs 2 games - really fun. But for now, cant be your fan anymore. I play you too long and understand that, that is your style. You want player go through the game as what you want. But i want a game that i can play freely and the result is just something that i can decide, or atleast, it's reasonable with the real life and the rule of phisic too.

A lot of people are calling this a ""pay-to-pay"" or ""fee-to-pay"" game, which is excessive. There is a lot of stuff to do in this game with your $20 purchase. Here is a list of everything you have access to from buying the game that doesn't require any additional money:
[list]
    [*]2 starter decks (Blue-Black Control and Red-Green Brawler)
    [*]10 12-card booster packs (1 rare, 3 uncommons, 8 commons*) *5% upgrade chance
    [*]5 event tickets for Expert Constructed and Expert Draft (yield tickets and booster packs)
    [*]6 event decks for use in featured set matchmaking event and Social format with friends
    [*]Global Matchmaking, Casual Constructed, and Casual Phantom Draft 
    [*]Play with your friends' decks in Social format via loaning feature [b] -YOINK- [/b]
    [*]Solo play bot matches against 18 decks (6 event decks + 12 bot-specific decks) 
[/list]
Artifact's monetization is for people that prefer to pay for the cards they want instead of grinding [i] for a chance [/i] to get those cards.  I would rather buy 5-cent commons, 10-cent uncommons, and  30-cent rares (average prices of cards as of Dec. 10th) for the cards I need to complete my deck than spending loads of time to [i] maybe [/i] get them.  I know Magic Arena lets you use wildcards to craft the cards you want; but those are drip-fed to you at a rate I find really slow. Also, if you don't want to pay $5 for a pack of 5 event tickets in Artifact, you can trash 20 cards to make a ticket.
 
As for the actual gameplay, it's probably the most complex card game I've every played (maybe up there with Android Netrunner).  I love games that present you with several possible decisions at every step.  Magic the Gathering is great because you have to choose when to play each card in your hand.  But in Artifact, you have to choose not only when, but where.  You also need to think about when to let your heroes to die, because #1: It's beneficial to let them die so you can relocate them two turns from now. And #2: When they die, your oppenent gets gold and you can't cast cards in that lane without a hero of the same color. There's so much going on at any time (eg. cards are activating effects when they hit the board, heroes are using abilities, lane improvents are being used before or during the action phase, effects are activating when neighbor cards are destroyed, and players are using purchased items on heroes from the shopping phase).  

You also have to play around the randomness in the game, in terms of the boardstate.  Each round starts with two melee creeps being randomly spawned in random locations on the three lanes.  And three types of arrow cards (curve left, straight, curve right) are randomly placed in unblocked spaces (25% left, 50% straight, 25% right), redirecting your unblocked cards' focus of attack. 

This complexity could be paralyzing for some, but I find it very gripping.  So many of my matches come down to the wire; and it's so satisfying to win because I know so many decisions were made along the way.  If you appreciate highly strategic games, you'll love Artifact.",1543528862,1544431719,True,1,0,0.527272701263427734,0,True,False,False

- integrated user tournaments, highly customizable
- full steam integration, which brings friendslist, groups, steamchat, market and in house streaming - you can even play it on tablet and mobile
- best deckbuilder in the industry, easy to use and the ability to share decklists via 'copy n paste'
- build in decktracker, the ability to sort your cards, clear but in depth UI
- fully voiced lore for every card

Unfortunatly it is true; you need to dish out cash for cards and are looking to honestly pay $20-70 for a strong competetive deck. You can buy singles rather then packs to ensure you know how much it will take to create the deck you're building. You can win packs and tickets from draft once the game is purchased but will need to buy singles/packs to play constructed once you've built a full deck.

This is by far the best draft digital card game i've played. Sure there are some heroes that are better than others, but in draft, the odds of getting those heroes are very unlikely. In general you will have to work with the mediocre heroes and a lot of the times, the default heroes for each color. The game itself in draft mode goes fairly long (often mana turn 10-13), and usually games are very close. Often times games you lose is because of a mistake you've made, and this game has a very high skill ceiling (unlike hearthstone, where the optimal play is fairly easy to read). The frequency of nail-biter game in draft mode is so high that winning a game in phantom draft (casual and free) are often by itself gives you such a triumph feeling that cannot be obtained anywhere else. 

Monetization wise, I found that the game is pretty fair. If you've played magic or yugioh in real life, this is what it entails to. If you want to get into the game, you have to pay to play. Realistically, this game (even for constructed) is far cheaper than hearthstone unless you are willing to committ hundreds of hours each month.  Given that there is a trade market (which I really appreciate), you cannot get free packs, or the packs won't retain any value. This is as realistic as an actual TCG in terms of existence of a market. 

In terms of progression and reward, why do we need reward to play? If you don't derive enjoyment in playing the game itself, you shouldn't be playing this game. Playing for reward is how freemium games these days try to get you hooked, but it doesn't mean you actually have fun playing the game. 

On top of all, you have free draft mode to play. Hearthstone doesn't have that, what more can you ask for? People complaining about the lopsided constructed mode should really give draft mode a shot.

With solid graphics, strategic depth, great sound effects and unique elements thanks to Richard Garfield. However with all the ingrediants to make the perfect game Valve has just spat in everyones face for all who were anticipating Artifacts release.

Even with a brand new game Valve's strong stand on ""Providing 0 communication"" stands stronger then ever. It's like they don't even want their game to succeed. There are very obvious problems with the game some being not even hard to fix such as: no replays, no MMR, obviously overpowered cards that cost a fortune, connection issues, bad tutorial, challenges that encourage discovery/diverse gameplay.

The Artifact sub reddit is just filled with complaints about the game and Valves notorious stand of not giving a sh*t about the community that WANT this game to succeed.

I opened my original 10 packs and did not buy any more packs.  I sold a few cards I opened and sold some other game items to gather about $5 of steam dollars.  I proceeded to buy almost any common and uncommon I wanted.  I stayed away from the more expensive rares because I don't want to invest that much into a digital card yet.

By not buying the more expensive rare cards, this pushes me out of meta decks.  More importantly I will have a much harder time making a strong control and/or competative deck (no blue boardwipes, no red finisher spell, no blue finisher spell, no high cost item for a black econ ramp, no blue green combo, less competative heroes).  I focus on making agro, mid range, hero killer, and green late game decks.

This does lead to some fustrating games as you will face people with more competative cards and it can feel bad.  However this is the choice I made and I can still win (odds not in my favor).

Any other person probably won't be able to enjoy it in its current state. If you're looking to broaden your game repertoire or discover the genre, the Artifact is NOT for you. 

First, [u]PROS[/u]. What the game does succeed to present, it presents well.
[list]
[*]The mechanical aspect is superb. It's an amalgam of the familiar tabletop gameplay and some new elements which greatly expands the play-space.
[*]Games are usually close, there are lots of ways of playing from behind to turn tables around.
[*]The card artwork is good. Lots of big names are on the artist list, and it's pretty consistent in all its variability. 
[*]The sound palette is stunning. Every music track is vibrant, distinct and fits the board situation well. 
[*]The lore depth is enormous: Artifact draws from the Dota 2 universe and expands on it, this finds reflection in the sound design: cards interact with other cards present and react to the situation on board. Every card has its voice-acted description and all the characters involved are cross-referenced in one way or another. 
[/list]
Lore and card interactions are actually the main reasons I bought this game.

Second, [u]CONS[/u]. Almost everything above is muddied and made corrupt in one way or the other.
[list]
[*]Aftifact announcement, post-announce management, presentation and beta were horrendous. Several key features promised way before beta are still missing (you can't spectate others in-game, for example) and people feel betrayed by the fact that e-celebs had almost a year of experience before anyone else got to try it. Valve is as silent as ever. 
[*]Monetisation model is questionable. You pay a hefty sum upfront, then you pay to complete your desired deck, there is no way to gain cards other than winning the gauntlet or buying them from the Steam Marketplace.
[*]The frequent complaint is about the RNG nature of the game. I absolutely don't mind it, after all it's all about managing the hand you've been dealt, but there are lots of ways things could go south at any point and step of the game. Tutorials don't cover those in enough depth, so only experience would help.
[*]The receding player base led to a very unfair (skill-wise) match-ups: don't expect to win if you're reading this. People who know what they are doing are the last remaining players in the game. Casual matches are impossible.
[*]The music is fantastic, yet there are only around five tracks (Caravan, Red Mist, Aghanim's Obsession, Immoral Dreams, Fires of Rebellion and main theme?). Those get old very fast, considering the average match goes for at least 20 minutes.
[*]There is no way to exchange cards with your friends (or share a pool of cards when you play tournament), you can't even play 1 on 1 in the same way you can play versus a bot. You can't transfer or share any value in any other way than the Marketplace.
[*]Game optimization is nonexistent. Don't expect it to run well if your hardware is lacking, don't expect it to run at all if you're on a laptop. Prepare to google if you're on linux.
[/list]

Last, [u]CONCLUSIONS[/u]

If you are interested solely in the mechanics of the game, you could play javascript draft simulator, javascript artifact clone, in fact those tools were made by the community even before the open beta.
If you fell in love with the Lore, the comics and dota2wiki will probably make your day.
If you like the OST, you can find all the tracks on youtube.

Wrong, you will  soon learn that outside of those starting items, you have no way to get any cards outside of either paying for them/packs or winning gauntlet matches with the tickets given.

Don't even think you can refund this game after you open those initial packs, you can't refund the game if you open a single one. Is the base itself good? The answer is yes, however with the architecure of this game be prepared to lose if you don't own the more expensive/rare cards needed to gain an edge on your oppenent.

Which brings me to my next point, the rares are SIGNIFICANTLY better then the starting cards provided. I understand the rares have to be better then the starting cards/commons, but the differences is staggering.Why play keefe when Axe is an option? Axe has better stats + a better signature card. Why use lycan or Rix when Drow exists? Drow has a significantly better signiture card and ability compared to both of them.

As the game is right now, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless some major changes are made to the game's architecture.

People complaining about the RNG probably just haven't taken the time to learn the game and build their decks accordingly. 

The amount of variables in this game is insane, you have to plan out your line of play for all 3 lanes at once, analyzing what it means for the game's status as a whole. You should always have a plan of which lanes you are prioritizing to win and what's the best cards to play in which lanes to accomplish this. This game really rewards players who can adapt to difficult situations on the fly as often times the optimal plays or lane priorities can change at any moment as each player can make multiple moves per lane before moving to the next. It's a mind game trying to outplay your opponents in the sequencing of plays and passes, calling their bluffs as if it was poker trying to get a read on their hand. 

You need to pay attention to way more variables than any other card game, like how much gold did they spend after the last turn and how many item cards did they obtain? Was their 10 gold spent on 2 items a Blink Dagger + Healing Salve or maybe it was 2 Stonehall Cloaks? Maybe you can do enough damage this turn to force them to use an item so you know for sure?

This game is just beautifully designed from a game play perspective, if you like strategy this is the game for you! I think it's so much better than Hearthstone that I can't even make a comparison. Hearthstone seems so boring and bland, easily predictable and one dimensional in comparison. You just have so many more options in this game, every turn can be so interactive with so many decisions compared to Hearthstone where you just throw down 1 or 2 cards sometimes and you are done. What they have done here is truly revolutionary for Digital Card games. 

Buy this game if you enjoy card games that make you think, a game where it's so easy to make mistakes if you miss one little detail, there is always room to learn and improve. Don't buy this game if you want to just mindlessly play and throw down cards and randomly build decks expecting to destroy all your opponents (seems to be what a lot of the negative reviews expect).

This game gets a 10/10 for fun. You can even play infinite Phantom Draft where you build your own deck of 60 cards from 5 random packs and play against others who did the same. Most games charge money to buy more tickets for this game mode but in Artifact you can do it infinitely for free! That alone is worth $20 in my opinion, it's super fun and you get to experience the game in a more wild unpredictable environment. 

If you are like me and enjoy constructing your own deck this game is also pretty good it seems with just the 10 starter packs. My 10 starter packs were only worth about $6.50 on release day which seems to me like it is below average, meaning I didn't have a lot to work with in terms of value or rare cards. But even with these 10 starter packs (a bunch of cheap cards) I have defeated countless Axe + Drow and Axe + PA decks which are worth $40 or more. Even playing against some of the most expensive decks in the game (around $80 or $90) almost every single time the games are extremely close. 

My point being is that even with a super cheap deck that I constructed with my 10 starter packs I can defeat or put up an incredibly close fight against the top ""Pay to Win"" decks in the current meta. That being said I did have to really put in a lot thought of how to improve my deck the more games I played trying to continually refine it, so like I said if you like a card game that makes you think this is the one.

There is however 1 bad thing about this game. There is currently no way to progress (gaining new cards) for free other than doing really well in Expert Mode. If they add a way to slowly gain more cards for free by just playing the game I would literally not have a single complaint about this game. Although if you do just want to build a really strong deck it's actually quite cheap compared to other card games...

I have played almost all the card games out there but before Artifact, I spent most of my time with HearthStone and Gwent. Blizzard went full casual and CDPR was proven to be incompetent to build anything that is not a single player experience. I was hoping that Artifact would be a fresh proposal in the market but unfortunately as the game stands I cannot give it a positive review or suggest it to other players. 

The positive first. The game is a blast to play. You always feel in control of your decisions and your moves are not directed just by the curve. You are playing for initiative and control of 2 out of 3 lanes. There is RNG in the core gameplay in the form of random spawning of creeps for both players but it feels manageable and doesn't break the game 95% of the time. The drafting mode is really fun and far better than anything that I have seen so far in any other digital card game.

Now to the bad. The game feels like it needs some balancing. There are bomb cards and there trash cards. The few cards that are in between are not enough to make it on their own without the bomb cards. There is at least one card that break the game (Cheating Death) which gives a 50% chance to every unit not dying when you are supposed to die. With games lasting up to 40 minutes imagine losing a game to that effect. It's infuriating. Yet Valve let this card exist in the full release of the game. 

The worst of the worst however comes in the form of the monetization model that this game has chosen. Anything you do in this game aims at making profit for the developers. You buy the game for 20$. You buy packs for 2$ each (no discount in bundles). You can sell cards in the market but Valve takes 15% of any transaction thus allowing them to make more than 100% profit from selling packs. And the worst offender of all, you have to pay a 1$ ticket (which you can only buy in bundles of 5 for 5$) to play in the competitive modes and only modes that give any sense of progression in the form of prizes (up to two packs and one ticket if you manage to win a total of 5 games). 

You can play casual draft for free which is one of the best features. But it quickly loses its allure considering the lack of rewards at the end of it. The free casual constructed mode is a joke as a free mode as you need to buy cards to play in it, so not really ""free"". 

For full disclosure, I am not against the 20$ entry fee. I am not advocating for a F2P model. In fact Artifact's model might be more affordable than that of HearthStone for people who want to get an entire collection . You can get all the copies of common and uncommon cards for about 30 dollars at this moment and that price is going to get even lower if more packs are opened. [b]My main problem that makes this game a rip-off is the fact that there is an entry fee even after you buy the game in order to play the competitive modes. This is absurd. Valve gives you 5 tickets to begin with and there is a huge psychological pressure not to lose the value. If you lose all of your tickets your only way of competing is by putting your hand back in your wallet. Why? You already pay for the game itself and new cards. Why pay for accessing the modes as well? [/b]

Another negative point is the poorly implemented social features. You cannot interact with your opponent. Although you can participate in online tournaments they are not automated and you have to clear a 5 hour block in your day in order to sit though the entire thing waiting for your turn to come. 

On a technical level the game seems to put some stress even to the most competent machines. My laptop is more than capable at meeting the required specs and can barely run this at full 60fps at low/mid settings. 

[b]All in all, I cannot recommend this game to anyone under these circumstances. The gameplay is fun but there are too many restrictions around it. The release feels incomplete as many of the features we heard from beta testers are missing. The game also lacks any kind of progression and even though Valve has said they are working on it, from what we have seen, we can expect it to have some kind of monetization as well. I am really disappointed in this attempt as I was expecting the savior of card games. It appears that the influence of Richard Garfield (creator of Magic the Gathering) affected the game's model by bringing the most outdated model from a physical card game to the digital area. This is a video game. There is no excuse to simulate all the aspects of the paper form. This could have been way more accessible and still would make a lot of profit, but no... They needed to make ALL the money. Just a lot is never enough. 

Stay away unless they make considerable efforts to make this more accessible. Personally I will enjoy it until I run out of in-game resources which should not take long. [/b]",1544022952,1544391304,False,6,1,0.529266297817230225,0,True,False,False

There is no real balance between heroes, there are good heroes and there are trash ones. The same goes for the cards
Constructed costs money to play viably and drafts are entirely dependent on luck, if the enemy draws 3 lunas in draft you just lose the game and none of your choices mattered.
In order to get more cards you either have to buy card packs or pay a fee to enter an arena type system which is Constructed ( which requires you to have cards already bought ), phantom draft which costs around 1$ a ticket, and keepers draft which is a whopping 15$, which is a phantom draft where you get to keep the cards you draw.
I can easily say keepers draft is the easiest to win because people puddle for expensive cards which are often spread around 4 colours, but even then there is no reliable way to get cards outside of continously spending money.
Don't bother buying, you can buy the game and sell every card you get in order to patch that dent you just made in your wallet, but what you're left up with is a pile of shit that will anger you, just don't",1544389892,1544389892,False,7,0,0.50820237398147583,0,True,False,False

I want a fun balanced game and willing to pay to play it, but not $200 at the initial release with all due respect. I don't need this game to be free like DOTA but I'd be very happy if Valve gives all the players the full collection for standard VG pricetag of $60, and then utilize the market to buy and sell premium version which look pretty but don't give you an advantage in the match.

After 50+ hours of gameplay, here are my 2 cents:
[h1][b]1. NO PROGRESSION [/b][/h1] - why in the world wouldn't you add a progression and gamification/level system to a game like this? You absolutely cannot level up or feel the ""completition"" achievement in any of the game modes...
[h1][b]2. EVENT TICKETS [/b][/h1]- now this one is a joke. Basically, if you want to play ranked (called ""expert"" in Artifact and earn packs) you need an event ticket that, guess what.... Can only be BOUGHT for like a $1 (or you can farm these tickets if you have high win-rate ratio in ranked), so basically you either need to be REALLY GOOD at the game to continue playing ranked or just spent bucks TO PLAY RANKED.

Amazing execution, the Development and Art departments did some great work but this is let down by Game Design and Product Management smoking crack.  
First off, the monetisation setup for this game is worst-of-both-worlds. Not sure what they're trying to acheive but they're turning their backs on network effects by making it hard for free-to-play players to enter. We'll see if that gamble pans out in the long term but I remain skeptical.  
In terms of design, firstly, its not very interesting. Its just Hearthstone but more (three boards). 
The current meta basically comes down to trying to make it so your enemy can't use their cards. So, its not fun for someone to lose. Its not really a fun game yet.    
Generally the card design/scaling/balance is completely off. I'd say they'll fix it over time but considering some of the cards available in the game i'm not sure. They'd have to delete/rework a few card effects for me to gain hope.   
Primarily, I don't understand how you make this game in 2018. It does literally _nothing_ to address any of the issues the base design of Hearthstone gave us years ago.   
For a Valve game I am deeply disappointed by the lack of game design innovation. 

Amazing polish, lots of great ideas but sadly the fun has not been found. Go back, try again. Rework the fundamental design and pacing of the game and you might have a winner on your hands.

You can't know what cards you opponent will have so you can't counter his deck, you just build you deck with the most OP cards you have.

Yes, you can't grind cards out for free, game mechanics wise this game is rather fun, so let me focus on the business model since that's what puts people off.  I'll compare it to hearth stone.

It's also worth noting that yes, Artifact does charge you more for packs than hearstone, but I'd say you get much higher value.  First of all, you're 100% going to get a card in the highest rarity bracket, and 3 uncommons, plus you always get a hero and 2 equipment cards needed for deck construction and you get 12 cards per pack.  Plus you can make budget decks that are affordable buy cherry picking them for literal pennies on the steam marketplace.   

Now yes, you can grind out packs free in hearthstone, but you can't sell them, trade them, and they throttle how fast you can grind.  You get one new daily quest per day which averages to me 50-60 gold over time, and need 3 wins online to get 10 gold so once per day with average grinding you can MAYBE get 1 pack per day for free.  Most people spend hundreds of dollars making competitive decks on hearthstone, in artifact, it's a lot cheaper overall, you're not going to build a competitive deck in a timly manner on hearthstone with how slow the grind in, you just aren't.

The starter set for artifact gives you 2 full starter decks which you can dismantle and use how you see fit, plus it gives you 10 packs for free.  

In the long run, this game is way cheaper than MTG or hearthstone if you do the math, you guys are crying because you can't spend 30-45 minutes grinding 1.5 dollars or so worth in gold for buying packs.  You can make more money flipping burgers in an hour and buy 7 packs worth of hearthstone packs from a fast food job and just save yourself time and get a competitive deck faster.  Not to mention all the money people spend on adventure packs that swiftly pull cards out of rotation for standard.

It's a very fun and strategic digital TCG. The RNG in the gameplay is enough to make things exciting but not too much to where you'll feel completely cheated out of a win. The choices you make is overall a bigger factor and much of the RNG can be curved in your favor with good play choices. Draft strongly outweighs the Constructed mode and I see that as a good thing, mainly because you can enjoy the mode FREE after the initial purchase of the game.

Everyone is complaining about the amount of money they have to invest to get much out of this game, and I can see how that could be a valid gripe with the game in terms of playing Constructed. But to be realistic any person who are veterans to MtG shouldn't have much to complain about... making a good Constructed deck cost less compared to MtG.

WITHOUT LUCK ON YOUR SIDE, YOU CANNOT BEAT PEOPLE WHO INVEST REAL MONEY.

YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR CREEPS (well there are some cards that enables you to BUT NORMALLY YOU CANT, ITS FREAKING RANDOM LIKE A STUPID AI)

All of the cards have a little 3 paragraph description of some lore surrounding the card. I'm a fan of the comics from DotA 2 and the lore in general which was neat. 

The game has been easy to pick up but I can see how a high level game could go down.

The effects when cards are being played have familiar sounds and illustrations. Which has helped me get into this genre.

So core design is great. Very good towards Dota fans(who don't play CCG anyway=)) and very fresh. Game feels more like a grand strategy, that a quick tactical skirmish like most other CCG. Every loss leaves you with couple ideas why you may have lost and what to try next. Deck building doesn't feel like it takes exel spreadsheet to do. I have been doing pretty good with just a deck built from several tries and errors. The experienxe is finished, most game go toes to toes even if you are at disatvantage there is rarily every a ""ragequit"" moment when you realise that you have already lost but there is still 20 more mins for it to painfuly end. All in all core gameplay and its execution hit a bit hardcore or just smart players very well and first hours feel great.
But then you start to notice the little things. Where do I begin:
- There is something wrong with product placement and monetization. Clearly there is.
- No progression
- A person watching a TV show while playing can make you suffer. There are a few turns that require thinking every game, but mostly you stick to the plan.
- There are 10 heroes. Not 45. Maybe other players just don't have them, but I c Axe Legion every game. Poor fellas.
- No ""feel"" to victory. I am more happy when I win vs a bot in WC3, than winning a 5streak game here.
- Animations are irritating and frankly controls feel a bit off.
- Ohh boy in game market interface does not work
- UI and navigation could be better. (I am talking about a lot of cards in the hand and minions on the field. Just +1??? Come on you can do better)
- No point in owning any cards. Therefore no point in playing for packs.
- Comparing to other games drawing is very meriocre. Unity student project feel doesn't leave you.

To sum up: Feels like a beta. Clear focus was the gameplay, but there is no ""hook"" to it. Hardcore games feel good coz you learn and get rewarded for the effort. Great idea ruined by hasty release, lack of attention to details and UX and sloppy marketing. The reception would be lightyears from what it is now if Artifact was a payed early access alpha/beta.

The multiple lane mechanic isn't very engaging, you usually end up abandoning 1 lane and focusing on two and even with just two lanes it feels like games drag on for a lot longer than they should.

While a lot of new ccg's try to move away from rng by giving ways to minimize it, Artifact doubled down on it, it doesnt give the ability to mulligan and stuffed a lot of dicerolls and coinflips in the core game mechanics while lacking much of the flair other rng heavy cardgames have, making it more tedious than fun to deal with. 

Constructed seems very stale due to the limited amount of cards and very pay to win due to the price of cards being tied to the steam market instead of a set value.

There is little hero or card  balance, in other ccg's most cards can atleast fill some niche role but in artifact a lot of them are utterly useless and some are just weak versions of a rare more expensive alternative to push players to spend money on the market.

The game seems more like a multi layered poker probability exercise than a tactical ccg, the overall mechanics design feels awful.

The gameplay is decent too good except for the dozen ways the randomness can screw you over.

Games can be lost before even one swing is done...if your heroes are setup wrong at the start.And be assured they will.
 And if you need a minion too summon in one lane, be assured he won't.
Heroes? I only see weak blue ones in my packs.. you ll have to play a lot of basic heroes in draft and face better ones time and time again.

I bought Artifact for draft I got 12 wins easy in Hearthstone but there was no real competition or the market that makes draft best playable mod in Artifact. The problem is there are few cards so OP that you can't do anything against it except surrender and there are so many bad cards at a point you can't make a viable deck. There are few rules that should allow any player to make a correct draft deck but here if you get Axe gg perfect run if you get too much low tiers cards gg lose.

Heroes are OP but basic heroes are crap and in draft you just want to get Axe, Drow Ranger, Kanna, Lich, or Tinker but you have more chance to get Meepo or Necrophos forced pick who are worse than your basic heroes... even if you got nice cards crap heroes = lose just like in DotA. I almost forgot heroes can snowball with equipments that gives them more attack or health value every turn and Claszureme Hourglass lock all the cards your opponent draw. You think you can win without good heroes? Forget about it, there are big removals that clear your entire board, cards that make immune to damage all your creeps and heroes and there's Thunderhide pack who finish you off if you don't have slay to kill it.

What about constructed? You need expensive cards to make a viable deck and if you go expert you need a ticket that requires to transform cheap cards into it if you don't want to pay the full price at the shop.

I don't have a particular problem with it myself, but I do understand when one card is TOO good it's worth a high amount and dominates the game. There's also no way to earn new cards. This is a matter of debate because if Artifact now tries to transition to a way to get things for free, the current prices will drop, bots will be created to earn money off the cards, and you'll see a drop in real players and card value. That would blow for the people who have already bought the cards and would be fucking over their playerbase more than everyone preaches they already are.

But putting that aside, monitization is only going to work if there are cards that are extremely overpowered that are WORTH the buy. I've seen a million complaints about axe but for myself personally. Drow is more an issue. Cards being powerful is a part of them being rare and having neat effects. Instead, you have them far too powerful and dominate the game. Now this would be fine if we had the ability to play around this right? This raises my biggest complaint with Artifact.

RNG. There are so many elements not neccessary that have been added and scew the game from skill to getting lucky. You can lose your heros turn one depending on how many creeps went to a certain lane, how are they positioned, and how many there are. The creeps are then constantly thrown in random dirrections which makes characters like crystal maiden who needs something to block, harder to play. You can then be fucked over by the dirrection the enemies or yourself will hit. I've lost 3 games so far in my 25 hours of playing due to a random turn away from the tower when I either needed it to hit my tower, or I needed to hit theirs. This adds even more RNG which can just completely destroy the level of skill to this game.

Overall, I'll be satisifed with the game if the RNG factor changes. The cost of cards will fluctuate over time as new ones get introduced and the meta changes. The RNG destroys the game on a skill level which is inexcusable. RNG is fine for certain decks or characters, not for your base gameplay.

It leaves room for mind games etc.

You have to be 100% zen to enjoy this game long term because there will be games where winning is completely out of your hands, even in draft modes.  The list of competitive heroes is very shallow out of the 40+ hero pool.  There's some mechanically interesting heroes like Storm Spirit, Rix, and Meepo, but the current state of the game doesn't allow much room for them.

There's too many cards,  yet minimum deck requirement is too low to allow room for some of the more interesting deck building possibilities.  This game rewards whoever builds the leanest 40 main spell and 9 item decks simply because it gives you a higher chance of drawing the cards you need at the right time.  There is very little wiggle room. if any.

Shop item values seem very imbalanced; some items are way too cost efficient to pass up (Revtel Signet Ring) while other experimental items cost too much to warrant purchasing.

It's a fun game but I cannot recommend purchasing simply because it leaves a very bad taste even in drafts.   Notice how I didn't even talk about the community market aspect of constructed.   I got my $10 worth of fun (sold some rares) but I cannot recommend this game given its current state.

Valve put a lot of effort in making sure the mechanics were great but you can tell they didn't bother to give the rest of the game any attention. You can't interact or communicate with your opponent. There are piss-poor social features that make it a chore to play with other people. There is nothing fun to work towards that doesn't involve money. They tried to emulate TCG's but failed to capture what made playing TCG's great (the physical aspect of the cards, the social get-togethers) whilst providing none of what makes online gaming great. It feels like playing a board game online against players you can't communicate with.

I was optimistic about the market but honestly on reflection it is one of the worst aspects of this game. No amount of buying/trading gives the digital cards as much meaning as a physical card. It is like collecting/trading postage stamps vs collecting/trading digital postage stamps. It isn't the marketplace that made trading cards appealing but rather being able to own and trade physical objects of tangible and sentimental value. It seems like Valve assumed that the digital format would also capture that lightning in a bottle but in reality it just rips the soul out of it. The worst part is that they have done nothing to fill the void--the game itself is devoid of any charm. I still have my somewhat valuable collection of Pokemon cards from 20 years ago. I sold my Artifact cards a week in without giving it a second thought.

The features the game does have seem to have not been tested at all. The tournament feature is not streamlined. I've joined a dozen tournaments and almost everyone of them have been a different event type. I once joined a 4 player 2 round swiss--that is, each player only played against two of the four players and that was it. Not a single tournament allowed you to spectate because no one who created the tournament realised you had to enable spectator rights individually so when a tournament was being held up by a long game people just left instead of sticking around because no one wants to sit there in a chat waiting an indeterminate amount of time for two players to finish a marathon game. There is no online browser or community feature. It just feels so lazy, almost as if they expected everyone to be so enthralled by the game that they would go out and make their own communities and organise everything amongst themselves.

This game didn't need a release, it needed an open beta so these flaws could have been exposed in a more healthy way. But more importantly it needs Valve to admit that as a video game and an online experience it just isn't very good (mechanics aside).",1543467956,1544220699,False,0,0,0.467895001173019409,0,True,False,False

TL;DR: Don't hate the game, hate the genre.

Games I'm familiar with: physical MTG, MTGO, most MTG versions released through Xbox 360 Arcade, MTGArena, Hearthstone... the gold standards. I've played both MTG and Hearthstone for 100s if not 1000s of hours in my life, and quite frankly I don't have time to dabble with all of the competitors.

Here are the top 3 things that are not articulated by most reviews:

[list] [*]$20 gets you 10 packs that cost over $2/each after tax is calculated so you are getting the base game for free based on what you receive initially. On top of that, you get 2 prebuilt decks that contain cards from the first set as well as the base set. The entire contents of the base set is 7 total cards (4 heroes and 3 items) so most of the 2 decks you receive for free are cards from the first set. Lastly, you receivet 5 event tickets that cost $5 + tax if you buy them later. So in buying the base game you get over $25 of value + a bunch of cards from the set. If you don't want to pay $20 for over $25 worth of game value to get into a TCG/CCG (no actual trading yet), move on and don't buy.
[*] On top of the starting cards you get for free, you can draft decks and play them for FREE. Anyone familiar with the games I listed above knows how ridiculous that statement is.
[*] The game itself is deep and immersive. The back and forth alternating gameplay in each lane prior to combat feels very much like a tabletop game and works really, really well. There is a lot of inherent strategy and counterplay. The matches really seem very competitive and close, with the vast majority of my losing matches feeling winnable if I had played my cards differently. Some rares are very strong. Most are situational and add more flavor than base strength to your deck. It's unfortunate that some critical traditional board clear cards are not more common. Cards of that nature don't tend to be common in TCG/CCG games. Artifact designers had an opportunity to change that but didn't. If they had it really would have allowed for more economical deck builds. I don't blame them, they have no incentive to change the model. [/list]

Sure there are some QOL improvements that I'd like to see. I fully expect Valve to make them over time. The game is barely a week old. The gameplay alone makes this an incredibly fun experience with a bit of a new take on the genre.

1. There is a lack of features promised on release:
-No replay 
-No CHAT FEATURES or any social features other than challenging friends

2. There is a massive balance issue:
-Cheating death wins games, its a 50% coin toss for cards to survive.
-Drow ranger has a 4 mana card called gust that silences all enemys in a lane, rix has a 5 mana card that silences one creature. 
-Kanna has stats of 2/12 yet Prellex is 3/5, how are these stats decided?
-Axe is a 7/2/11, and has an amazing skill card, no other hero matches up to him except legion commander.
-Legion commander has an OP card and the stats are great.

While Artifact isn’t free to play like all the competitors.

Cons:
•	Without paying money you can kind of only play casual Draft which will give you not even a reward if you finish it 5 0.
•	Constructed makes no sense because it’s Pay to Win.
•	No motivations to play since you get no rewards without paying money.
•	No ranking/ladder.
•	Playing competitive will cost you event tickets.
•	So without spending more money you are very limited.
•	When you pay for tickets, the fact that you play with your money does not make fun.
•	No daily tournaments
•	No ingame spectator mode for your friends.
•	It would also be nice to create decks together ingame with your friends.

I personally don’t like it when matches go on for so long and then you maybe lose it because of some randomness. Obviously Draft matches are longer then constructed. But without paying money for new cards to get a competitive deck constructed is no fun.

There are maybe too much random factors of which some can instantly lose you the match when both players are equally good. The random factors for competitive player are a bit too much still for the overall player it is fine and still much better compared to other card games.

It’s not only Pay to Win in constructed but also Pay to Play in competitive.

You need to consider that you also get 5 Entry tickets and 10 packages. The 10 packages are not worth much. With the 5 entry tickets for competitive you could get some rewards and keep on playing there but only if you’re a good player. Since the Streamers and so on already played the beta they are obviously much more experienced and I wonder if there is a matchmaking since there is no ladder.

Don’t get me wrong without the cons Artifact would be a great game. 
(Personally it might not be as competitive as the old Gwent could have been but that is no option now anyways)

They did a very good job on creating a different card game and the list of pros is much longer since they did a lot of good decisions.

even if some cards are expensive, the prices will probably go down with time - just a question how quick
if you didn't get a deck you find universal enough you can always go for * draft modes - you could potentially play any card ever, but that skips past a lot of people's minds
I don't see any sense in comparing a card game to any other multiplayer game either, like what's the point in rankings that someone else mentioned? it's not always gonna be about your ego, man.
also progression in a card game? that's going to be just how well you're playing - I'm glad that aside from cards there's nothing else that can distract you.

the correct criticism is that they seem to have included a replay system (sometimes the end match screen lags and reveals a text about skipping a replay), but it's not accessible anyhow - i.e. you can't also watch any games, unless you're in a tournament -- that's one part that major sucks
second suckish part is that they could have made the tutorial non-mandatory, and make it optionally a bit longer - if you want to play against AI you need to select a deck. AI's decks can have any cards at all. 
there are premades, but they didn't include the random draft mode for AI for whatever reason.

I didn't open or use any in game item, and I consider that for this kind of game 2 hours isn't nearly enough to figure out if you like it or not. My refund was denied because of excessive playtime, so don't buy Artifact unless you can try it with a friend, they won't let you try it for yourself.

Now to get the monetization system out of the way, I don't think it's good or bad on principle ; it could work because you can draft for free forever, in theory. Paying less than 20$ to have a free card game seems fair. The rewards of the paying drafts, however, are an absolute joke. Keeper's Draft is the worst offender, since even with a perfect run you still have to provide two other packs to keep playing. So let's say we ignore the paying drafts to focus on the draft and game experience, is paying to play Artifact worth it ?

Well no it's not. At all. I'll talk about the drafting system first because that's the format I'm the most interested in on other card games : first off, the card quality is downright awful. Don't expect to see any playables after the 2nd booster in a pack ; there are so many bad, bad fillers that drafting is never fun. This extension doesn't offer you to build a deck out of several options, it challenges you to add the fewest bad cards to your pool. The experience succeeds in providing the worst of all worlds : the random card selection of Hearthstone and the color restriction of Magic all wrapped up together. You can't send signals, you can open 2 powerful cards in a color then never see another for the rest of the draft. Heartstone deals with this issue by providing you playable cards only, and Magic has a closed pool of boosters running around so you can read into card selection to make sound decisions. None of this here. And last but not least, the hero restriction. God, who was the absolute moron that thought it would be a good idea to allow one hero pick and one pick only per pack ? I didn't draft that much, and I have already lost count of the number of times I picked a Hero mid-pack because it was in my colors after 2 dry packs only to be proposed a way better one next pack that I can't pick anymore. Remember when I talked about the lack of playables earlier ? Pick a hero early, then you have one less card to chose from if another hero is proposed to you. To make the matter worse, good Heroes add 3 good cards to your deck. Still remember the playables ? You can balance that by playing good heroes that will fill your deck with non-terrible cards. Couldn't pick or wasn't offered a good hero in your color ? Then feel free to add the always available ones to your deck, and complete your mediocre deck with garbage ! To sum up, the drafting system is frustrating and unrewarding.

Now to the game on itself. It feels good, it's beautiful, it's responsive, which is nice but what about the core mechanics ? Let's say there is a running game, played by gentlemen only, where the goal is to cross the finish line before your opponent, but with every step you take there's a device that punches you in the nuts. Now you can lie down, and every time you lie down you get a 5 seconds protection against the punches. One could argue that this is a strategic game, because you can try to either train in order to elevate your pain threshold and be able to run longer, or you can optimize the times you lay down to gain complete immunity to the punches and minimize the pain, allowing for a short but painful sprint in the end. You could also calculate that sweet spot inbetween where your learn to lay down when your nuts start hurting too much, but recover stamina fast enough to be able to endure another session of nut-punching. But, one could also argue that you could remove the punching component alltogether and focus on running, which would be maybe, I don't know, funnier ?
That's how I feel about Artifact. The RNG aspect of the creep spawn and the way worse aspect of the random hero positionning when you assign them to a lane, combined with the random targeting are the kick in the nuts you take at every new round. Your way of lying down is the great deal of cards designed to correct that randomness (move this hero to that place, make this minion attack this target) and when all is said and done, you end up with a bunch of feast or famine situations. Don't have anybody in front of your red hero ? Well too bad, looks like you just lost. Oh, your 12 attack hero decided to target that creep left of her instead of going for the 2 health tower ? What a shame, you just lost ! Of course it evens out and sometimes your opponent is the one suffering from it, but that absolutely doesn't make the system better. But what if instead of enduring the randomness and hoping to draw that one card that answers this specific situation, you scraped all those silver bullet cards and replace them with decent, generic ones ? Let each player chose where to deploy her or his hero, then do the same for creeps and now you have a real game, not a random number generator entangled within another random number generator.

 Only one set of cards is out so there is a very well outlined meta and there are some cards that might be ""broken"". 
 There is an in game system to purchase packs and then individual cards via the marketplace.
 If you're looking for the perfect CCG I don't think Artifact is it, but it is without a doubt the most innovative CCG I have played in a very long time.

Pros:
 The overall design and interface is awesome and simple to use.
 The design of the actual cards is awesome with voiced characters and some ""lore"".
 The game animations give the CCG genre some serious life.
 There is a way to earn packs and tickets through a drafting system for achieving at least 3 to 5 wins with only losing 1 game.   (3 wins 1 ticket, 4 wins 1 ticket 1 pack, 5 wins 1 ticket, 2 packs)
 The design of the rounds, turns and, phases is unique and creative.
 The management of three lanes is the right amount of strategy, difficulty, and excitiment at the same time. 
 The ability to blend and have success with any color combination in draft.
 The network has been immaculate not a single hiccup or disconnect. 
 
Cons:
 There is a difficulty curve and skill gap that can be quite large.
   ( I spent about 13 hours playing before I actually played using tickets.)
 Constructed is not remotely as accesible as draft. 
 To be competitive at all in constructed you need to follow the ""meta"".
 To be competitive at all in constructed you will need to spend around $20ish
 
Final Thoughts:
 Artifact is awesome. If you enjoy CCGs you should definitely get this one maybe you don't need to buy in right away, at least follow it and watch how the development process unfolds. Wishlist it if you're hesitant maybe it'll go on sale. ;) I'm glad to get in on the opening set and can't wait to see what comes next. I have about 19.5 hours logged as of writing this maybe I'll come update it after another 20 hours. Until next time I'll be stealing your creeps and frustrating you endlessly. :)

As a long-time fan of HL, Portal, Dota2 and also as a TCG player (MTG, LoTRTCG) I am bitterly frustrated with Artifact.  Seriously, this PAINS my heart, Volvo - its a broken a$$ game.

TL:DR - Gaben, give your loyal followers 10 free non-tradeable tickets a month so we can play the only fun, fair and balanced mode of this game (expert draft) because we are already paying the upfront cost AND paying for the cards AND paying for tickets.  Fix the random creep spawn mechanic because the game as it is has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with what lanes you randomly get creeps in and who has the bigger wallet.  Also, please add some scoreboards and stats and let us trade the cards.  Do that and we will recommend!  Dayum.  Until these changes are made I'm not wasting anymore time/money on it.

PROS:
- The game is smooth and looks good.  The music is great.  
- You can find the information you need with ease; For example, double click a card that says it has 'Siege' and hover the mouse over the word and it will tell you what 'Siege' does.  User friendly.  
- Fun mechanices.  You take turns batteling in 1 of 3 lanes.  There are items like blink dagger that allow you to swap lanes and of course a lot (not all) of the heroes and items reflect the DOTA universe.  To win you have to take 2 enemy towers OR 1 enemy tower and the ancient that spawns after it.  There's an item shop to visit between each round.  You play with 5 heroes per deck and each hero has its own special cards that automatically come with the hero.  (Though I think it's bullsh!t you are allowed to use two of the same hero in drafts.)
- The premise is genuinely awesome and the mechanics are really cool, and DOTA heroes abound (not all of them in game yet).  This could be a REALLY fun game.  It's MUCH better than that simplistic Hearthstone, no offense to fans.

CONS:
- There are TWO HUGE problems that need fixing before I can recommend the game.

1. THE ON-GOING COST:  (And I don't mean the cost of buying cards, or the upfront cost of the game, I mean the on-going cost to keep playing!)  
- When I first heard people complaining I was rolling my eyes thinking, it's a Trading Card Game, what do you expect?  The cost of a pack of Artifact cards is much less than the cost of cards you'd walk in to buy from a store, so who cares, right?  ...I was wrong.  There really is a problem.  You are getting tri-taxed to play the game.  
- You pay the upfront price of the game which is currently $19.99.  Okay, I'll pay that for the production value and because it's based on DOTA, and you get some cards with the purchase.  (Half, if not all, of the heroes don't even use their real voices from the game.  Maybe that's a pet-peeve but ... come on, you know we're buying this because we want to play a card game with our beloved DOTA heroes!!!!!!)   Anyway, that's $19.99 just to have the ability to play.
- Next there's the cost to buy cards and let's face it, in a Magic the Gathering (MTG) based trading card game you have to buy better cards to play better.  I wish they'd considered a more complex, strategic and solid game base, like LoTRTCG by Decipher, inc.  MTG *always* comes down to the most expensive deck wins.  But hey, MTG is still fun in spite of that.  So again I thought, okay, I'll just sell my crap duplicates and some of the rares I'm not building around and use that to buy the ones I need.  
- Then the sucker punch - YOU HAVE TO BUY ADDITIONAL TICKETS TO PLAY.  Now, you can play with friends without purchasing tickets, you can play for free with bots (who does that?), you can play casually without tickets, but you don't win anything, you aren't tallying up stats or a score, and its not like you can pull your deck out of the computer to go play with a bunch of buddies next door and you CANT TRADE THE CARDS.  If you play constructed you face someone who paid for super cards which you may not be able to afford and you lose, so that's out.  
- That leaves expert draft mode as the only fun and balanced mode of play (Casual draft without the ticket price has nothing to win, no stats, and is boring).  In expert draft each player starts with random cards and builds a deck out of them so its fair and balanced and fun.  But for this you have to buy a ticket to play.  So yes, the cost is a real problem.

2. RANDOM BUTTFVCKERY:  You might as well be paying to flip a coin.  The killing blow is rarely a matter of skill and who held onto what cards at the right time and who chose the right cards together.  With MTG its a matter of lucky shuffel and expensive rares.  With Artifact, its FAR WORSE.
- It literally DOES NOT MATTER how smart you play or how well you build your deck, the killing blow will be determined by the random number of creeps that spawn.  You can be poised to take someone's tower for the FIFTH TIME IN A ROW and the game will continue to spawn 3 random creeps for that person in that lane and you can ARTFULLY DEAL WITH THEM EACH FREAKING TIME and it will STILL JUST SPAWN MORE CREEPS FOR THEM.  But after 11 FVCKING rounds after you've exhausted everything to defend your other lanes while it keeps rescuing your opponent, it will then randomly SPAWN NONE FOR YOU.  This can happen to your benefit as well and you will sit there with a SH!T EATING GRIN about how you were really screwed but got 3 random creeps and then won....until you play again and it happens to you.
- The point - its frustrating and it sucks!  You might as well take your dollar for the ticket price and buy a lottery ticket instead.  There literally is NO skill and the winning blow is LITERALLY a matter of luck.  To want us to pay to play, after already charging us for cards and the start up cost, for a random-win game, is just too stupid.  

FIX:  Valve, I can recommend this game and its upfront cost AND its additional costs if you please 1. add some dang stats and other features to give us something to achieve in it or give us the ability to TRADE the cards and 2. please give players 10 non-tradeable tickets a month... (even if they expire when the month ends).  Make these monthly hand-outs non-tradeable and non-sellable to preserve the market of the game and the rarity, but please give us something.  Right now we are paying TRICE to play and there is no incentive and no way to earn new cards without paying yet again.  If I knew I could have a few shots at expert draft every week or so (again the only mode that's fun), I would be much more likely to play and spend money to build a better deck (even though it doesn't really matter).  I think the best solution is to keep your starter price for the game, but give us a certain number of free plays each month (non-tradeable tickets).  If I want to play above and beyond that, fine, charge me for another ticket, but you gotta give us some ability to play and have fun here ...especially for the upfront costs and microtransactions we're giving you, and the fact that skill means nothing in this game.",1543780118,1544164633,False,19,0,0.611846983432769775,0,True,False,False

Some heroes feel unplayable compared to their more powerful alternatives.
No features to interact with the other player yet. Ie chat/emotes ect.

While I'm not clamoring for a refund, the practices mentioned in other reviews are SUPER fucking shady.

I left the game running all day because I launched it and then forgot about shutting it down, so it was open the 10 or so hours I was at work.  That's my fault and I accept responsibility for it, so understand I'm out the chance for a refund no matter what.

It's a scattered game, and in the bit I played the forced tutorial meant I didn't really get exposed to much of the game, and it wasn't very challenging.   The card variety that I've gotten to see is also super poor, and given the mechanics that demand purchasing and/or paying for more cards, that means I'm not likely to get many more cards and see how they interact and whether there's the fun combinations and styles of decks other games offer.

The current impressions are that it's not fun.   It doesn't seem to have exciting cards with fun effects, but rather stock cards do stock thing, nothing that seemed super interesting so far.   It doesn't mean they don't exist, it means I didn't encounter it in my bit of playing and during opening my initial packs.

Having played CCGs competitively for over 20 years, I have seen a lot of different game styles and mechanics, and despite this, I was pleasantly surprised by how refreshing and strategically deep this game is. The unique take on the simultaneous turn system offers a lot of interactivity while not being overly complex to figure out. The level of balance between randomness (ie variance) and skill feels very good to me. So far I have only played draft, and only now do I feel I've mostly figured it out, but still yet I learn something new each day I play. Given the small pool of cards on initial release, and the depth it offers, I expect this game to hold it's own for years to come and never get dull in the foreseeable future. Richard Garfield the master has added yet another notch to his legacy.

Pros: 

1) Cost is inexpensive. 20 bucks for the game and you can slowly build up cards through playing phantom drafts. Or, if you just want to buy cards, they are around a few pennies to a few bucks each, the most expensive as of right now being 20 bucks. And you can buy and sell cards, and trade cards, so once you have a decent collection you can cycle through them for other cards and spend very little money to do so.

2) Fun! Multiple strategic paths are possible and it's never purely clear cut. Or if it is, it takes an extraordinary level of competence to know 'the best play' which would take more hours to achieve than most people have.

3) You can set up tournaments at will with your friends any time at no cost. You can play against bot AI any time at no cost. Fantastic!

4) Beautiful to look at. From start to end, the graphics and sound are top notch, animations are fluid, the cards talk to each other. Just stunning.

Cons:

1) Learning curve to be 'very good' at the game is quite high, though to be 'decent enough' to have fun and play doesn't take much. A lot of things are going on and it's a lot to take in at first. I personally have no issue with this, in fact the challenge invigorates me, but I can see how for some people it would be overwhelming.

2) Tough to appeal as a spectator game to the general public. If you have never played, watching someone play just won't make a lot of sense, and you won't understand who is winning or losing, let alone why they are doing certain things for the most part.

3) Stale constructed meta (allegedly). This will likely change when more cards are released, and this is what I've heard from people who have played longer than I, not my own opinion since I have not played constructed yet.

4) No signals in draft. Since the card draft mode uses a global player pool, there is no way to know what colors are open or what signals are being sent or who is passing to you, so you just have to go with strategies that involve 'good' cards in a generic sense, that you can cast. This method feels robotic and more shallow in terms of strategic depth than it could be to me. Also, even in a private friends only tournament there is no passing of cards between each other, which would have been a lot of fun if that was how it worked.

5) No mulligan. Opening draws being inflexible makes getting 'curved out' on by an opponent due to RNG feel particularly lame. Most CCGs do have a variance off-setting mechanism via a mulligan. I feel this should exist here too.

6) Invisible match maker ratings system. There is no way to know where you stand in terms of rank or what pool of players you are being paired against, despite the fact they admitted there is a MMR system in place.

Over all though, this game is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it for any serious or casual card game player. I already think it's just a better game than hearthstone, and it is giving MTG a run for it's money.",1544091511,1544139249,True,34,5,0.624628901481628418,0,True,False,False

I love the idea of having 3 lanes to work with and the moba feel is great, but once you play for a couple hours you start to feel the bad stuff more.

Having no ranked mode is awful, but having ranked mode in this game's current state would be even more terrible, simply because Cheating Death, Kanna and Axe are abominations that should be removed from the game or nerfed into the ground.

Hearing Dota was the ""most balanced moba"" I expected this game to be similar to it, and yet this game is far from it, which is disappointing.

Having played this game for 88 hours by the time I'm writing this I have to say that the time I spend playing it was completely wasted if you don't take ""fun"" into account, because you don't get to see your MMR and you don't gain shit from winning regular games and you have to pay to play competitive, which is ridiculous by the way.

I'd say I had fun playing this game in the past couple days, but after the first week I started feeling frustrated. I do not recommend anyone to buy this game in it's current state. Valve doesn't give a shit about anything except money, if people keep buying nothing will change. This game gives players to insentive to keep going.

Thing I'd say need to change:
* Cards NEED to be balanced
* A contructed ranked mode has to be added
* Your MMR has to be displayed somewhere
* Winning 3 games on constructed should give players a fragment of a ticket. (with 3 fragments turning into a full ticket), 4 wins = 2 ticket fragments and 5 = a full ticket.

This might seem like asking for too much, but asking the people that PAID for this game to pay even more without giving anyone the chance of not having to spend more money on the game is ridiculous.

First off I do appreciate how the three lane approach and shop system give this game a distinct feel and that's a big part of what encourage me to give this a solid go. It's not a bad game at all but it is really slow and I don't mean that it simply takes a while to play the a match. I wouldn't have an issue with a fourty minute game if there wasn't any down time in it. There are plenty of times when you just don't have anything you can do on a turn so you're forced to end your turn, wait for someone to play a card, end your turn wait for someone to play a card - sometimes going through that cycle four or five times each time having to wait for all the animations and everything to play through just to get to the next lane.

My second big issue is that there's just too much RNG. Random card draws are fine, even having cards with random percentage effects is fine, then your heroes location within a lane is random which is less fine but still doable but then... even then your heroes/creeps are assigned to targets randomly every round so your entire strategy can get screwed because of the targetting spread it chose for you.",1544128402,1544128402,False,6,0,0.500891268253326416,0,True,False,False

This card game is extremely fun, unique and complex. I haven't been as excited about a card game in awhile. I've played everything from MTG, Yugioh, Pokemon, HS, ESL, Gwent and even Infinity wars. 

I understand the frustration in not being able to do daily quests to earn packs. But their are plenty of options to enjoy with this game and there are plenty of cards you can pull with your $20 to put back on the market and make your money back. If your into drafting you can do infinite draft games which is my personal fave. And if your a competitive drafter you can earn plenty of free packs that way. The only way your going to pay to play is if you really want to create a competitive constructed deck and compete for packs/tickets. And with the option to essentially trade cards via buying/selling on the marketplace its a lot easier to get the cards you want. Instead of grinding days and days in HS.  Plus you can even recycle cards you don't need for extra tickets to enjoy the competitive modes.

My frustration with this game is that the tutorial is incredibly bare bones and gives you no idea what to do.

If you persist with it you can netdeck but there is a significant likelihood that you won't have the cards straight off the bat.

But then when you feel you may be getting a grip on exactly what the game is about you realise that random creep spawns can swing the entire game even if you have been in  control the entire time (maybe because of your own luck with creep spawns).

People have always lauded Hearthstone for its RNG but I would argue that Artifact has RNG on a much greater scale but hides it.

No, this is not a F2P game. You pay for your cards and tournament entry. That being said, this game has good value. The initial $20 buys you an equivalent amount of booster packs, so if you're gonna buy packs at all, you can disregard that initial purchase cost. If not, then Artifact offers free and unlimited Phantom Drafts, which is a pretty sweet deal if that's your thing. I haven't seen such a generous offer for drafts in other card games, and it's well worth the $20.

If you just want to play competitive constructed, individual cards are pretty reasonably priced in their marketplace, so you can skip the packs entirely, avoid gambling and/or dusting, and buy what you need for your collection. I see players spending hundreds all the time on MtG or Hearthstone, but Artifact card prices won't cost you an arm and a leg to get your ideal competitive deck. Last time someone ran the numbers, a complete playset of the game cost about $200, and a single deck would just be a fraction of that.

So, ignore the naysayers that wanted this to be a completely F2P game. This is not that, and never wanted to be that, but this IS a cost-effective digital TCG with some very unique components to it.

I haven't been able to find any one that has analyzed the pricing scheme of the game, so i thought i would do that, and in that process hopefully help you.

Currently the only way to gain cards in game, by playing and not buying from the market place, is by playing one of the game modes that requires entry ticket.

I should probably state that I don't think this I necessarily because Valve is and evil company, i fact really like them, just look at this platform where you currently is reading this review, it's pretty good i think. So why might Valve then not be giving you any cards away for free?

First: The game has a marketplace connected to it, where you can trade and buy cards for real money.
Second: The market place only works if Valve never gives away any cards for free, because otherwise it would devalue all the cards on the market place. 

Know how much is the game then going to cost you: 

(Disclaimer your price might differ, since you live in a different country)

The lowest cost for buying packs, comes when you buy 25 for 43.75 euros

The lowest cost for tickets, comes when you buy 25 for 22.5 euros.


So the big question is how much will you be paying for cards if only use tickets:

First off, as far as i am aware Artifact uses a hidden rank for determining your opponents, even in draft mode, so the average win rate will be 50% for almost all players. 

Second off, in draft and ranked, with tickets, rewards are the following:

3 wins: 1 ticket
4 wins: 1 ticket 1 pack
5: wins 1 ticket 2 packs

if you lose two games, then you are out. 

Be using math we can determine the chance that you regain the ticket you used as entry fee: 

ticket_regain_chance=31.25%

Then we can determine the average amount of packs pr. run: 

average_packs_pr_run=29.6875%

Then by using the geometric series (which in this case is ( 29.6875%*(31.25%)^n), we can determine the average amount of cards packs per ticket you buy:

cards_packs_pr_brought_ticket=43,18181818181817%

but what then gives you the most cards packs pr. spend euro:

well for buying cards packs directly that is:

packs_pr_euro_in_cardpacks=25/43.25=0,5714 packs/euro

but if you buy tickets, then it is:

packs_pr_euro_in_tickets=25*cards_packs_pr_brought_ticket/22.5=0.48 packs/euro

In other words if you only want to increase your collection, then buying cards pack is your best option.

At this point, I should probably reiterate that you can play the game without using tickets, you just won't gain any cards.

My opinion on all this, is that you become way more interested in each game, and never give up, because your money is on the line. But I also feel it's problematic you gain less cards by playing the game, then just directly buying the cards pack, but hopefully this can be changed by Valve.

Also the gameplay is just really good, so if you don't mind spending some money, then this game is leagues above Gwent and Hearthstone.",1544045300,1544113035,True,0,0,0.490594148635864258,0,True,False,False

The game desperately needs progression mechanics and being able to earn cards and rewards in-game by playing. Right now the only option is to pay cash money, and there's a lot of pressure to do so, because many apparently have done so -- and are at a significant advantage due to some seemingly questionable card balance choices.

Right now Artifact is a solid starter. The game looks gorgeous, feels great, has a good atmosphere and mechanics which differ enough from the Hearthstones and Magics of the world to earn it a spot on the map. Valve need to update the game and add in features they promised during the beta but still haven't delivered on, rethink the progression mechanics and take a look at the balance.

Like any tcg that I am aware of, cost for constructed play is obscene and proably only worth if you are making money from playing (ie streaming/entering tournaments).

They never will (and never should) give away tickets/cardpacks because it would destroy the market value of the cards.
If ya dont want to put more money in than the inital game cost play casual draft, simple as that.

There are no quests, no new player bonuses, no card rewards for any of the free events.

Interesting mechanics (3 lanes, items, heroes).

Aesthetics.
Looking at the market place currently there aren't many cards that are super expensive.

Cons
I'm a bit confused on why you can't place your heroes at the start of the game. Would add another layer of strategy. Same with the minions.
There is quite a big element of RNG. Changing the above would lessen that for me. 
The fact you have to press that coin a lot just to end the turn can get frustrating for me sometimes. I know it gives the ability to be reactive on the lane but can be frustrating when trying to set up strategies.

I think the Hearthstone like single unit attacking chosen target would make game more interesting on strategic point or allowing the hero to swap target by moving left or right once.

+ Very beautiful artwork and graphics
+ Runs fantastically on Linux and uses Vulkan ! (like DOTA2, still has to be mentioned)
+ Tight UI, well thought, setting up a game is intuitive and fast, in game UI is good too.
+ Fun imps making faces
+ Good sounds, fun voices (had genuine laugh at the Ogre Magi)
+ Some interesting tactical mechanics (lane reordering, action turn bluff...)

CONS
- Multiple stacked layers of RNG. No control on the game flow (random card placement in lanes..), personal RNG deck in draft mode (no shared draft), full RNG hand at the start of the game with no deck order control (and then RNG card picks), RNG card effects.. It's definitely not Star Realms, or to pick another Garfield product, it's absolutely not Netrunner. Results in really infuriating games where you have zero control on the game flow, be it a win or a loss.
- No personal progression unless paying for tickets AND winning which is not a given at all
- Zero social interaction even out of games (apart from direct steam friends)
- No ladder, no replay, no history. Largely plays like a single player game
- Some horribly unbalanced cards, in both directions.

Update after almost 30 hours: Well done, Richard Garfield, for a SHITTY game design. So much RNG that one can only laugh at how completely ridiculous it is. Right at the start, you can already get matched up and have heroes killed outright without player decision. It is all assigned by luck - at least let us have the illusion of choice to place the heroes. Characters attacking into unguarded lanes can randomly be assigned to attack a diagonal enemy - again by pure luck. Melee creeps that get spawned every turn appear randomly in one of three lanes - you guessed it, by pure luck again. Your secret shop shows 1 powerful item each turn for purchase, yes yes randomly. Your pre-assigned deck has about 9 items but only 1 appears each time (yesss, you are getting good now. In random order via pure luck) Ah yes yes there are consumable items available for purchase each turn too - RANDOM YAY! These are all on top of the usual luck generated by random card order when drawing from your main deck, as is typical in any card game.

Erm... what are we playing again? Roulette? I get what Richard is going for here. A brainless card game that the mass audience can have fun with, where skill is secondary and luck is everything so no one ever feels left out. If you want an edge, swipe credit card for highly imbalanced cards to draft. And yes, even then it goes down to more than 5 factors of RNG across various parts of the game as mentioned earlier. If you are lucky and you get that one card to win *cough*Vesture of the Tyrant*cough* you literally have a walk-over.

I've played enough TCG such as Pokemon, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh and the very recent GWENT (Witcher card game). My first impressions is that Artifact is very polished, high quality and refreshing. I know people are bashing its monetizing model, lets put that aside for now. 

Now the game itself feels like Hearthstone in many ways as are most generic TCG available these days. Obviously Hearthstone being a massive success, many other card games would borrow its concept. But Artifact adds its own twist, it has 3 lanes/ boards. A very unique winning condition, either by taking out 2 towers or focus down the ancient. Those who played Dota 2 might be able to relate! I played thousands of hours of Dota 2 back in the days. Valve converted the MOBA into a card game which is pretty sick. The fact that they kept the Heroes skills and personalities from Dota 2 and made it into Artifact gives me nostalgia, I love it!

One of the interesting mechanics that I like the most is the priority. where you get to initiate first or second. To me this is very fun and strategic, where you could bait your opponent and then counter them once they have expanded their mana. Or to strike first before they could play any cards thus render thier turn useless. While the cards itself feels very Hearthstone like, mechanics such as priority and phases resemblance Yu-gi-oh much. It has been a while since I played a TCG with such complexity. Now when I say Artifact is a complex TCG, please do not be discouraged. Yes, it is more complex than Hearthstone but less complex than Yu-gi-oh IMO. And the tutorial did a decent job of explaining ALMOST everything you need to know. 

Now the monetizing model.... it is not F2P, it has no grind, it can be placed on the market place. I reckoned is okay.... at least these cards have some value?? Unlike Hearthstone which I spent like over $800 but now it is just sitting there since I'm no longer playing. And trust me, Artifact is easier to get the cards you want compare to other TCG. I like the Keeper draft where I could pick the cards I want (sniping for rares). You can straight up buy the cards that you want in the market place, you'd be surprise the cards are relatively cheap compare to other TCGs. 

But if you don't want to spend much, there is always Phantom Draft which is the mode I like the most. You get to play cards that you do not own, so I'd say you don't even need to have a full collection. I would just do Phatom draft all day, I just want to have fun. 

I think most veteran TCG players would like this game.

It sucks.

The hero mechanic is just a way to get stunlocked or find yourself staring at a decent card you have the mana for but can't play. That's not fun.

The lanes mechanic is just a nuisance and adds nothing but DOTA flavor, but if you've played CCG's before, you know how quickly your hand can be depleted even with cards to draw cards. The ability to have as many cards in your hand as you want is great, but it loses it's value really fast when you have to split cards across three lanes and only get two per turn to restock--plus anything you bought with bounty.

The bounty system... I don't like it. I understand it's purpose--partly for DOTA flavor and partly as a bag of tricks to help kit out heroes and shore up weak decks and hands, but it's still a garbage system. It's best feature is that you don't have to spend mana to use your bounty bought cards--but that doesn't offset how unwieldy it feels and the overhead of having that shopping phase every single round.

The victory conditions are absurd and built on the desire to have a three lane card game.

But the real killer here is: you have so little control over the things that matter. You don't get to pick what your minions or heroes fight. You don't get to choose blockers. You don't even get to choose where on the table things end up.

I've played a few games and I still don't know what the rules are for creep resupply. It's just another random thing that happens without your input or control every turn. Maybe a lane will get reinforced, maybe it wont. It doesn't even appear to be a consistent number of reinforcements from round to round.

If you always wanted to play a Rubik's cube where the colors were constantly changing, the sides rotated on their own, and  wasn't a cube but a set of three balls you could juggle, and it looked like juggling them was causing things to happen, then this is the card game you've been waiting for.

Many of the negative reviews here seem come from people who only ever play F2P games and have also never played any sort of CCG.  All major CCGs require you to buy cards in order to create any sort of competitive deck.  I know that other games have ways of grinding for cards without paying anything, but the time required to actually have a full collection of cards, or even a top tier competitive deck is absolutely insane.  With the existence of the marketplace, I'm fairly confident that Artifact is actually the cheapest popular CCG you can invest in.  Also, many people (including myself) actually made MORE than $20 back from the market place after opening my initial 10 packs.  I literally made a profit from buying Artifact...

That being said, if you're trying to play constructed when you first start playing artifact, you're making a mistake imo.  Practice playing draft in casual mode.  Once you have a decent understanding of how the game works and start going 3/5 wins consistently, start spending your tickets to play competitive draft.  This is how you should be grinding for cardpacks to eventually play constructed with.

As a side note, constructed is probably the least interesting mode to play currently.  As with most new CCGs, the card pool isn't super huge at the moment so decks in constructed don't seem that interesting to me (and many of the pro players in the scene share the same thought).

I couldn't even bring myself to use the final ticket. I played very little constructed because of the high cost.

The Good:
-It's fun to pick up and play casually for draft -- you don't notice the issues right away, would be a perfect $5 game to binge on a weekend

-It is really simple to learn. The hardest thing to keep in mind is ""what cards will my opponent have"" but you'll learn that pretty fast.

-You can sell your cards, so the game costs closer to $10-$15 than $20 even if you get bad packs.

-The music and artwork is nice

The Bad:

1. RNG on the first turn can dictate the rest of the game

You don't decide which order your heroes are placed, where your creeps are placed, or which direction any of them are attacking. With the same hero/creep set up you can have one outcome where you kill all the enemy heroes and are able to play two improvements and Payday to double your gold... or just lose all your heroes. It just depends on how things are set up. It is absolutely bonkers.

2. RNG on ""last"" turns can save your opponent (or doom you)... or any other turn really

I don't mean top decking or what your hand is. I mean you can have lethal on your opponent and then your primary damage dealer has a ONE IN FOUR CHANCE of attacking an enemy that is already going to die and isn't blocking him. It's crazy.

Many cards are layout dependent -- Beastmaster's signature card a big one -- and the RNG determines the game. 

3. RNG from cards is pretty dumb

Cheating Death gives constant coin flips you can rarely do anything about, but it isn't the only one. There are a LOT of RNG-based outcomes in this game and outside of Blue you don't really have a way to keep your hand size large. That means the odds of you having a card that can circumvent the RNG from your opponent is low. 

Have a card that deals 3 damage to the enemy, use it to lethal an enemy hero, he survives due to coin flip. You aren't always likely to have another or enough mana to play it and, if you do, there's still a chance it can coin flip the wrong way.

4. Artificial ""excitement""

The large amount of RNG elements will make the games constantly ""close"". By design it'll come down to ""that last tower"" over and over again, even with mediocre decks. If you pick good heroes and make brainless plays you'll almost always bring it down to one last tower.

5. General poor design only highlighted in longer games

The game has serious flaws at its most basic level but you don't see them until later in the game -- right before the game ends. Cards are designed to snowball and combo in extreme ways -- but only in the late game. Blue literally has an infinite mana combo that is meant to steamroll a single lane. Green has cards that increase in health, armor, and/or attack each turn and if you end up missing two turns then the enemy is basically impossible to kill unless you've designed your deck to kill large creeps. This is all relatively normal for a card game, but it stands out in Artifact -- especially drafts -- because most of these strategies aren't clever or difficult to pull off. They require one, occasionally two, cards and are set on autopilot. 

Its designed to make you think you've done something neat. Kanna automatically brings every creep into her lane. Play Diabolic Revelation -- which has her PICTURE ON IT -- and deal 2 damage to all those creeps. Then, use her SIGNATURE CARD to play hounds of war, summoning a creature for each damaged creature on the field. This isn't a clever combination, it is a *designed* combination and its all over the place in this game.

6. Hero balance is all over

If you could pick Axe or Pugna, which are you going to pick? It will be Axe 100% of the time. Even if you know improvements are coming and you want to kill them, his ability only allows you to kill one improvement in a normal game if it happens to already be in the lane you are in. MAYBE two, if you're lucky. Maybe you want Nether Ward -- 3 damage to the enemy tower vs. a blue deck is pretty nice.

Except Axe is still better because if you were able to cast Nether Ward turn two and Blue cast a spell once a turn for the next three turns, you will have now caught up to what Axe can do in one turn when he has a short sword equipped.

Axe without any signature card -- which is really good -- is still a better hero.

Drow Ranger is basically impossible to put away, Omniknight is maybe passable if you're really specific on your strategy, but compared with someone like Rix or Farvhan? No way. Its like this for every color.

The heroes you start off with suck, there are several mediocre heroes, and then there are 2-3 ""must pick"" heroes in each category. It's such a large divide that if you do a draft and don't get those heroes you're at a huge disadvantage. It's incredibly unfun to be drafting green and then end up being stuck with several Farvhan the Dreamer heroes and their mighty 0/6 creatures that fill up your deck.

7. Drafting itself is bad

I love drafting -- making the best of what you can get. But you know what drafting was like in Magic: The Gathering? You didn't draft lands. You drafted cards and then added the lands in after.

In this game, you need heroes to play your cards. Green plays green, blue plays blue, etc. In the draft, heroes are positioned somewhat randomly and only one at a time. If you pass the hero  up, they might show up again and they might not. You can literally pick only black cards and not see a black hero for an entire pack.

Instead of starting the draft with cards and ending with several heroes on the last page, or starting with heroes and then with cards, they mixed them up so its possible for you to just get a crappy draft through luck.

You can only have ONE hero picked per deck.... which means if you see Magnus show up and you need a green hero, but you want Drow, you're gambling between finding Drow, getting Magnus, or being stuck with Farvhan the Dreamer. If you pick Magnus and the next page shows Drow, congratulations -- you're screwed. It would make sense to just not show heroes and then show an additional card, but nope. Just says ""look what you could have had"".

8. The game is incredibly lonely

There are no social features to speak of. If you know people outside of the game you can organize a four person tournament. I have four people total on my friends list with this game and only one still plays it -- I couildn't fill up the tournament if I wanted to!

There's no way to match up with someone again, no way to talk or emote. It's just silent, every game. They could be bots masquerading as humans and I wouldn't know.

9. There is no progression or rewards

Playing games for fun is... fun. But progression is also fun, even if it is just showcasing stats. There's nothing to show you making progress in any way in this game.

10. Outside tournaments and events for this game are limited to the cool kids club

Most tournaments and events you see with prizes are limited to a select few twitch streamers and the like. There is no ""scene"" for Artifact, its artificially inflated and you aren't invited.

11. Every color is basically the same

There are some very light ""themes"", but ultimately you aren't picking colors. You're picking heroes. Items -- two of them randomly shown in the shop -- can completely circumvent entire strategies and offset weaknesses to the point that it doesn't allow for differences in the colors to shine until the end game.

12. Shop RNG

Shop are RNG is bananas. You have a selection that is randomly shown -- I can deal with that, even though that's a little weird. But they also present you with two totally different items. You can RANDOMLY be shown an item that can summon a 14/14 with Siege 6. Randomly!  In draft, you need town portal to move your heroes -- it can randomly be replaced with an item that heals 6 hp.

Do not figure that your opponent bought his entire deck, instead view their deck and learn how to make yours better.

Draft and constructed are both great, though I find myself playing almost exclusively draft. I think the principle reason for this is the small card set that exists right now. There is not much variety for deckbuilding right now and the constructed meta involves very few matchups. However, variation within matchups is huge compared to other TCGs, mitigating this noticeably. Playing with Core Set 2019 only in MTG would be nowhere near as much fun. The future of constructed is bright, and draft itself is enough of a blast to justify playing anyway.

I am finding success in expert mode, but if I weren't and couldn't justify risking the tickets, I'd still be happy with casual play. The no-risk phantom drafts are endless fun, and people don't seem to be abandoning and re-drafting for perfect decks as some suggested they would. For the price tag, the amount of high-quality gameplay without spending another penny is already way more than enough, and the cost to keep playing in expert is pretty low if you're close to 50% winrate.

As for the overall economy, I really disagree with the popular view that it's a big problem. People have said over and over that it's far better than other TCGs, but I don't think that's constructive at this point. To convince you that the economy is nice here compared to a free-to-play game, I'll point out how cheap it is to ""rent"" decks. If you don't mind the money staying within your steam account, you can buy all the components of a deck, play around with it for a few days, and just sell the components again for relatively little cost. In Hearthstone or especially MTGA, once you get a deck you're stuck with it, and lose either 75% or 100% of the value if you don't like it. I always hear people asking on HS ""is this a smart craft?"" etc, but in Artifact that's just not an important question. You get to play however you want, whichever decks you want, and the investments are minimal.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend buying the game and trying a few phantom drafts without claiming your packs. Valve will give you a refund if you don't like it, and if you do, then the $20 pricetag is probably worth just that aspect, and you can decide what to do with the packs/tickets in the future, if anything.",1544070238,1544070238,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

When i purchased the game i also got a month of Dota Plus so all together I got essentially $30 worth of content for $20.

Heres the thing, nothing is truely free. If the game was free to play, but you got nothing to start with then people would complain more than paying just paying the $20 for what essentially is a beginner's pack, which is something that other online card games like Hearthstone offer .Now yes, there is a portion of the game that is ""pay to win"" but it's a card game... literally every single card game is pay to win. where Artifact stands out is it gives you free decks to play with, a free draft mode, along with tolerable bots to train with. So, a smart player would look at these options and use the tools given by the game to get better and understand the game and how to build a good deck, and then use the event tickets given to you to go play a draft where you could earn more tickets and packs. Alternatively, if you save two packs and a ticket and you feel confident in your knowledge of the game, you can try the Draft that allows you to keep all the cards you drafted in addition to packs and tickets.

is the game perfect? absolutely not. Is it fun? absolutely. I have yet to regret this purchase. so far i've been understanding how to draft better, and understanding the fundamentals of the game and how cards can work together to make combos.

The depth and complexity of this game may seem intimidating at first for new players but if you manage to get past the 10 hr mark it gets better. This game has a high skill ceiling, every action you take can win or lose you the game, the order you play your cards also have a very huge impact on the round. 
Many people are saying this game is P2W or P2P. It's cheaper to build a tier 1 deck in this game than in any other CCG just because of the trading system. Steam market enables you to directly buy any cards you want (90% cards are sold for less than 10 cents). In other CCG's you have to spend 100's of $$$ opening packs or spend 100's of hrs grinding for packs and even then you are not guaranteed to get the card you were chasing. This is the best monetization system for obtaining cards out of any other similar games. 

I'll try to list things I like and dislike:
++ Combat design.
++ 3 Lanes concept.
++ You can buy any card you want directly. No grinding 100 packs to get that 1 rare.
++ Free Phantom Draft. Draft is my favorite mode as I feel the constructed meta gets a bit stale because of the limited amount of cards.
++ Amazing in-game tournament system for hosting and participating in community tournaments.
++ Also as someone who has played most other CCG/TCG out there, Artifact feels fresh and more calculated than others.

-- There is a fair amount of RNG. RNG is in itself not the worst thing, there is good RNG and bad RNG. You as a player can play around good RNG by taking it into your play considerations. But bad RNG is unavoidable. There are some cards in Artifact that represent bad RNG and I think they should be changed or modified to a good RNG version.
-- Card art. After playing Gwent TWCG for a long time I was spoiled by its card art and premium/foil card animations. Card art in Artifact feels a bit duller. 
-- Lack of progression. Currently, at the time of writing this review, there is no progression system implemented in the game. Players don't get ""the sense of accomplishment"" and there is no ladder to gauge the skill of a player or to prove your worth as a skilled player outside of playing local tournaments.
-- Cant play 1v1 draft with your friends. Need a minimum of 4 players to play local draft. Not a deal breaker but it would be great if Valve adds 1v1 draft games.
-- Limited card pool. But it is expected since this is the first set and hopefully more will follow soon. But currently, the constructed meta is a bit stale because half the heroes are absolute trash and a handful are absolute beasts.

Artifact has a lot of interesting ideas at its core, but as it stands if you’re at all apprehensive about buying the game I would recommend against it. These are my major issues with Artifact:

[b]Power Levels:[/b] There is an obvious disparity between the power levels of cards. This is most obvious when comparing heroes. Most of them are simply unplayable, due to poor base stats and/or terrible signature cards. While some, such as Crystal Maiden, are clearly supposed to serve some sort of niche, using them is a liability because a stiff breeze will kill them, and they can’t even one-shot the melee creeps that spawn every turn without some sort of investment. Even in draft, there are many cards that are just unplayable, along with a select few that basically guarantee you a win if you manage to draw them (Time of Triumph being the best example). While drafting in Artifact might seem daunting at first, after one or two drafts you’ll realize that >50% of the cards you’re shown are never worth picking. I’ve tried to force blue a few times, but it always seems like I don’t find any of the key cards that I would need (also, most of the blue heroes are terrible), so I just give up and pick the other colors.

[b]Buffs & Nerfs:[/b] The issue of buffing objectively terrible cards is something that could be easily remedied in a digital card game. Unfortunately, at the moment it seems like Valve doesn’t plan on doing this. I can understand the refusal to nerf anything, since it would make all the people with the nerfed card mad, but there are so many cards in this game that are just so bad, and if some of these cards got a few changes maybe there would be more to the game than just picking all the best cards of a specific color and calling it a deck. Draft would benefit too, since increasing the general power level of a set usually makes it more fun. And hey, maybe it would make me feel something other than disgust every time the game forces me to pick Bloodseeker.

[b]Mechanical Space:[/b] The base set is pretty limited in terms of the mechanics that it uses, which means that most cards end up doing the same thing but in a slightly different way. You can see how some alternative strategies could potentially be used (such as focusing on gold generation), but there either aren’t enough cards to support that playstyle, or they get smashed by the cards that are just good in every situation. This is partly why every draft deck feels pretty much the same, is because the design is so straightforward that there really aren’t that many card synergies or draft archetypes. You WILL draft three colors, and you WILL just end up picking the best cards from each color and shuffling them into a deck, and as long as you don’t make any blunders or get unlucky and face a guy with two Drows and an Axe like I did, you should be able to at least break even. This is most likely an issue that will be fixed in later sets, but for now it seems like there are only one or two ways to play the game.

[b]RNG:[/b] There are a lot of RNG effects in this game and while they aren’t as bad as Hearthstone's, having bad luck can be extremely tilting. True, there are ways to play around bad creep deployments and arrow spawns, but it’s definitely frustrating when things just don’t seem to be going your way time and time again. Several cards have in-built RNG which is borderline inexcusable. The biggest offender is obviously Cheating Death, a card which you can play against and do everything right and still lose to because the 50% chance for an enemy to survive a fatal blow procced several turns in a row. Thankfully, if you play draft you won’t have to see this card very often. Cards that you WILL see often are Bounty Hunter and Ogre Magi (okay, maybe you won’t see Ogre as often since he’s blue). Bounty Hunter’s RNG usually only matters in the first few turns, but it can easily lead to a turn 1 or 2 hero kill and 5-15 gold for your opponent which they wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. Ogre Magi’s RNG effect is only set to a 25% chance, but if it procs off of a key spell, like a Thundergod’s Wrath, you’re probably just going to want to kill yourself. Mobility is very important in this game, and the one mobility option that you’ll always have access to (even if you get an unlucky draft) is TP scrolls. TP scrolls don’t always show up in the shop at the end of the turn, though, meaning that, in worst-case scenarios, you’ll be waiting multiple turns for a TP scroll to show up with a hero sitting in a lane being useless, while your opponent’s already evac’d everyone to mid. I’ll pretty much always buy a TP scroll when it’s offered to me, and I’ve still gotten screwed a few times.

[b]Reactive Play:[/b] Maybe this is just me, but it rarely feels like I have a plan when I’m playing. Rather, things occur on a moment-to-moment basis. My opponent plays a buff on his hero which will lead to my hero getting killed at the end of the turn, so I respond with a buff on my hero to give him more health. There are just so many things that can happen in the span of a turn that you’re kind of just forced to go with the flow. I mean, I usually win my games so I must be doing something right, but it doesn’t really feel like I outsmarted my opponent most of the time. Maybe this is something that will change with more experience in the game.

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] I don’t think that Artifact is completely done for, but I think a lot of the game’s future lies on the second set, especially given the aforementioned “We’re not going to change anything!” policy. There’s a lot of easy fodder for hate right now (Drow, Axe, ToT, Cheating Death…) which isn’t unjustified, but I hope that Valve learns from the problems with the base set and uses that to inform its design going forward.

I like that the monetization is closer to real life CCGs, and that it represents a barrier of entry for the less ambitious profiteers and other bloodsuckers who prey on FTP games.

I like that the hottest card in the set is only $25.00 and that I only need a single copy of it, instead of having to pay $300.00+ on a playset which may become obsolete two months into the season.

I like that the game is proposing new ideas and concepts instead of simply rehashing known ones from 1993.

I like that I don’t have to socialize with my opponents if I don't want to, since players will always find ways to be assholes, even when they only have emotes or quotes to work with.

I like the multiple lanes, the towers, the heroes, the shopping phase, the carry-over damage and the unlimited number of units on the field or of cards in hand, as they all create new design space for the developers.

I like the RNG and the symmetricity of it, and how it makes the game more organic and less like a math puzzle.

I like the length of the matches as it provides time for players to manage randomness, correct mistakes and build strategies.

Yes skill plays a part and can win you games but regardless I disagree with game design like ""Flip a coin and your hero either gets 11 attack or 7 attack"" Its just not fun for either side. Hero and creep placement is random within the lane, which targets that units choose to attack is random. Every turn you are offered 3 different items, a choice of 1 random item from any item in the game, a choice of 1 item from your deck of at least 9, or a random consumable. Yeah you get the idea. 

I usually feel like im reacting to what the game decides to throw at me, not what the other player does. Your highest attack unit gets blocked by the 1 random creep spawn so you miss lethal, your bristle decides to attack the creep to its left instead of the 5 health tower to win the game. These things can be dealt with if you draft/include the right cards, but how is a card ""Choose a new combat target"" fun to use? All you're doing is undoing what the game did to you.

When I was in high school, MtG was just hitting the mainstream and everyone was coming out with a new CCG every week.  I played them all, from Star Wars to Highlander to Netrunner along with a half dozen others I can't even remember, I've always had a deep appreciation for card games.  The randomness mixed with the strategy always appealed to me and the perfect balance was where the randomness supplemented the strategy, but didn't take over.  A solid gameplan, risk mitigation, and deck building would usually win out over a good run of top decks.  Although a good run of top decks never hurts...

So far, Artifact appears to hit that balance very well.  I can say for certain that Artifact always, and I mean ALWAYS rewards you for thinking several steps ahead.  The three lane structure forces you to evaluate each lane independently first, and then as part of the whole.  This can lead to all sorts of strategies and mind games.  Baiting your opponent into overcommiting on a lane only to pull the rip cord and bail on it so you can win a different lane feels amazing.  When you're starting a new round and you zoom out, realizing you can snipe their hero in a contentious lane 3 and deny them any plays, so you just hold priority through the first two lanes?  There are so many factors to consider at any given time, Artifact truly rewards the patient and thoughtful player.  It absolutely forces you into strategic thinking and long-term planning.  Maybe at some point it will introduce cards that will let a player autopilot through games, but so far this is not that game.  There is no equivalent to Red Deck Wins here.  Even the most simple and common action, hero deployment, can have enormous consequences if done without careful consideration.

Game balance so far seems okay, though plenty of room for improvement.  Some heroes are just bad with very few redeeming qualities, and as a result deck variety is relatively low.  In competitive constructed, you tend to see the same heroes over and over and over again despite them only representing about 1/3 of the overall roster.  Even in draft, there are a number of heroes that are just a straight avoid when you see them.  It's unfortunate because if the power amongst heroes were more evenly distributed, I think it would drastically open up deck variety.  That being said, it seems like an easily fixable problem as the game matures.  It's not great right now, but the core mechanics feel solid with a lot of room for expanding in interesting ways, and I really am looking forward to seeing what they do with future heroes.

Finally, I'd like to address the monetization structure.  As I mentioned earlier, I've played a lot of physical card games, along with a number of digital ones that I haven't mentioned, and building a top-tier deck for $50 or less feels like a steal to me.  Again, that's just a matter of perspective since I'm an adult with a job, but even if you don't have the money to build a top tier constructed deck, grinding can be very inexpensive (though not free, which I guess is the complaint).  For my money, it seems pretty reasonable that you can grind rewards at an initial entry fee of $1, which can reward you as little as nothing, you get your $1 back if you make it to 3 wins, and you can get $5 worth of prizes if you get all the way to five wins, then rinse and repeat.  And if none of that appeals to you, you can always play for free for the satisfaction of winning but no rewards.  For talented players, I think it will be a system that's relatively easy to ""go infinite"" with and for those less skilled, they can bow out and just play for free without rewards.  I'd also be a bit surprised if they never introduce a way for players to go completely F2P and still earn rewards.  I guess we'll see.

Overall, I think Artifact offers an incredibly deep and rewarding game system, despite some initial balance issues and arguably non-ideal monetization structure.  I think it's well worth the $20 for CCG lovers to check out and see if they think investing more money is worth it, or maybe just play casual drafts and featured decks for the fun of just stomping some people.",1544057682,1544057682,True,14,2,0.565068960189819336,0,True,False,False

They'll need some sort of income if they want to continue this for a long time and cosmetic purchases is probably not going to work. If the current way is properly balanced, time will tell. However, so far I have not had a single need to buy something else. The game simply offers too many options to play with cards that you don't own so that the desire is not really there.

As for the game itself, it's good fun to play. The only falls short on career options and statistics, but I don't really miss it that much myself. I just play it for a little fun, not to dive into expert mode games.

One thing I did notice is that games are sometimes decided by RNG. This can be partly blamed on the card selection in your deck, but also because you generally only get to see about half the cards. A simple unlucky sorting of your deck can leave you without a chance.

Bottom line, the starting pack offers plenty to warrant the purchase price. And getting into it was not too hard.

Three lanes means a bad opening hand and bad hero deployments are unlikely to, by themselves, lead to a loss. There are so many decision points throughout the game that you are generally not going to lose due to bad draws. If you've put together a good deck and know what you're doing, you have a chance to win in basically every game you play. I've yet to have an unsatisfying matchup, and when I've lost I can point to my own misplays, or to particularly good plays by my opponent (or both).

The biggest disagreement about Artifact is whether the monetization model is a good one, and I think the reason why there's so much disagreement is because for some people, it's very good, and for some people, it's terrible. I love the monetization model because the thing I hated most about f2p card games was the fact that in order to earn enough in-game currency to buy the cards I wanted, I had to play game modes I didn't care for, using decks I didn't care for, at a frequency I didn't care for. I had to play when I didn't want to in order to not miss out on currency.

In Artifact I just use my own money. I can buy whatever cards I want, when I want them. If I only want to play draft, I can do that without worrying about running out of in-game currency. I only play Artifact when I want to play it, and every time I play it, I enjoy it. I don't mind spending more money to keep it this way. That sits fine with me. That may not sit fine with you.

Yes this game has issues, and yes there should be some sort of in game progression which the devs have said they're working on. But at its core its a fun game and probably so far the card game i've liked the most between this, Magic and hearthstone. 

Lets start with some criticisms ""its pay to win."" Not really no, at least not more so than any other card game. I've played HS more than this and Magic and never spent a dime and I stopped playing because it just wasn't fun to get stomped by people who clearly spent a boat load of money on packs. Its not worth grinding gold when ppl can just pay money to buy packs. Now you buy packs here but the gameplay isn't nearly as card dependent as HS. As in a good combo of RNG, strategy, hero placements etc can win you games against better decks in a way that you just cant in HS and even magic to a lesser extent. Speaking about RNG its not worse than either Magic or HS and IMO its actually better. All 3 use RNG to some extent HS and MTGA dont have abilities and spells with RNG but bad deck draws vs really good ones put you in an hole you can't climb out of that this game doesn't have due to each hero entering the field at specific times. Hell I had one game of magic yesterday where I had 3 straight turns I didn't draw a single mana card after using all of mine first 3 turns and on the 4th of no draw I conceded because theres no coming back from that. The random placements on the field of creeps and heroes and their abilities or spells are not as game breaking as that IMO. ""You have to play to play"" Yea I had an issue with that at the start but the card market is good enough rn that you can buy a ton of good cards for less than a buck right now and its better than opening card packs hoping to get a good one.

To conclude, the game needs a progression system, a ladder, and something that rewards you for playing if it wants to survive in the long run. But in its current state if you have 20 bucks its a fun game thats worth playing that I don't mind spending 20 bucks to enjoy. If you dont wana buy cards play draft or casual constructed they are fun. If you want a grindy experience thats more challenging and more fun than Hearthstone but dont wana spend 20 bucks play Magic the gathering arena its also a good card game, but I would also recommend artifacts gameplay over that in my opinion.",1544032323,1544032323,True,0,0,0.453495621681213379,0,True,False,False

First up, the gameplay itself is very engaging. It's undeniable that matches are incredibly intense and absorbing experiences. There're plenty of things to keep track of without being too overwhelming, and the cards are fun to play around with even if there's a lack of fancy visual effects to everything. One of Artifact's least touted, but I believe best, features is that you're very rarely out of a match until you lose your last few structure points. I've eked out wins from opening positions that went disasterously and I've had victory snatched away from me in situations where I'd been ahead all game. That kind of balance in a card game, particularly in Artifact which has relatively few board clear effects, is pretty impressive.

On a bad note about the gameplay, the learning curve to the strategy is somewhat fiddly. You make a lot of decisions in Artifact that, unfortunately, you never really get to find out if they were good or not. For instance, if you choose to abandon a lane then you'll never really know how it impacted the game outcome, even after the match finishes, because games generally run close anyway. You could argue that this just means that figuring out the strategic nuances in the game will take longer and so players will remain invested in playing, but it's sort of frustrating when you're trying to learn, and I suspect it's the kind of thing you only really have an understanding of after a considerable number of hours.

However, engaging gameplay aside, Artifact does have one big problem at the moment and that's that there's not actually anything meaningful to do in it yet. There's no progression. If you play at the moment then you're just playing for the thrill of the matches themselves. The only meaningful progression available is the Expert Phantom Draft, which rewards card packs. If you're good then you can technically grind up a collection this way while still playing and enjoying the game. You could also get packs from Expert Constructed wins to expand your collection, however to play Constructed in the first place then you've probably paid to get a fair bit of the game collection already anyway. But that's it. There's no ladder, no visible ranked matchmaking (the casual matchmaking will put you against someone at your MMR, but it's not a visible number), no achievements, no campaign adventure, nothing.

It's understandable that the game's essentially in early days and the game itself works beautifully, but there's just not a lot to do at the moment that earns you any kind of progression. Arguably, playing the game itself and getting more skillful at it is meaningful progression, but, let's face it, the gamers of today (myself included) want something visible to show for their time. Even an account level experience bar like in DOTA would be a start!

To finish, I've enjoyed the ~20 hours I've put in so far and I haven't spent a penny other than the initial buy in. I've Casual Phantom Drafted the whole way and enjoyed it aplenty, but I'm going with a negative review overall because matches, while intense and fun, are also fairly mentally taxing and when you remember that you get nothing to show for the effort you put in then it does make the prospect of playing another match seem a bit daunting. In other games, playing for the sake of playing would be fine, but a competitive card game needs something to show for your efforts. I'm sure Valve will implement something like this in time, and if they do then I'll likely change this to a positive, but for now I'd avoid unless you really want to sink your teeth into the gameplay itself.",1544029568,1544029845,False,86,2,0.723304152488708496,0,True,False,False

Artifact is a must buy for anyone that enjoys card games.
Simple the fact that you can play a mode called casual phantom draft where you have access to all the cards should provide you hours of gameplay.This is the practice mode where you can learn all the cards before actually owning them.

1 game easily lasts for 15 minutes minimum so when you pay a 1$ ticket for an expert phantom draft you know you will play anywhere from 2-6 games hence 30 minutes- 90 minutes playtime with the chance to win your ticket back if you do 3 wins or even get 2 packs if you manage 5 wins. It is worth it.

There are only 3 top rated decks at the moment with only few days into the game and just the basic set out BUT there currently is no ladder therefore noone plays constructed.People will grind constructed once valve adds a number to it which i am sure they will then as expansions cards hit the meta will get more complicated.

There is a mode called keeper draft where you pay the 1 ticket entrance plus the price of 2 packs but you get to keep the cards you draft.Now here's the catch.If you pick cards that are not in your collection chances are you will not have a strong deck so you will not make it to the prizes.So with the marketplace in place keeper draft is not really +expected value at the moment.I expect valve to up the prizes a bit maybe to getting your initial 2 packs back after the 5 wins.Also once you are close to having the full collection of cards there is no point in playing keeper's draft.This should change.

There are no foil cards/heroes at the moment.Valve should consider adding them.It would give a carrot to a stick for people to play the paying modes (phantom/keeper) draft in hopes of getting them and sell them to the markeplace.

Finally to all the people saying this game is pay to win.You can spend money to buy all the cards but that wont change your decision making that wont give you the time needed to grind to a top spot in the ladder that will not make you a pro.

If like me you only have couple of hours each day to grind the 1$ entrance to phantom draft doesnt sound so bad specially when you get the chance to win packs and build your collection.

Despite what some people are saying, you don't need to collect cards to play.

Cards aren't given away at all, but unlimited play is possible in casual phantom draft.
Paying more than the base price is necessary to expand the collection, but I never felt forced to do it, as draft matches are more interesting to me than constructed.

If you are however interested in expanding your collection, you will be expected to either buy packs, or individual cards on the community market. Most cards have a very decent market price, the most expensive one being Axe at the time of writing, for about $20. This makes artifact a very interesting TCG, you can get most if not all cards for a very decent deck for a relatively low price, compared to other games.

I would recommend this game, unless you prefer grinding a lot for your cards, which isn't possible in Artifact. Then again, draft is in my opinion the more interesting game mode, in which the card collection is irrelevant anyway.

RNG is so horribly designed. From directional arrows to All allies have 50% chance to survive with 1 health
Bad RNG is where one player will have a poor experience of the game and believe me, Artifact got tons of it

My point being is even if you play well, the opponent can still turn it around, in a stupid way
Being able to comeback is great. But being comebacked by some coin flip isn't
Good plays should be rewarded and bad plays should be punished, this is how it should be, not only for Artifact but for every card game

It is so absurdly random even Heartstone doesn't come close to it when it was it's worst. Here are some factors that might randomly decide the the game, with (approximately) descending influence on the game:

-Unit placement at the start. Enemy red brawler hero got placed against your squishy blue hero? You're now at a massive disadvantage right from the get go.
-Unit placement after the start. You really want your high-damage hero to attack another hero after being spawned in the lane? Too bad, he's hitting a creep for the next 3 turns.
-Attack directions. Oh hey look, that hero that has nothing in front of it this turn decided to attack to the left, killing your hero there.
-Items in the item shop, especially consumables. Really need that health potion or teleport scroll? Too bad, have some card draw potions.
-Creep spawns. Your creeps keep getting sent to the lane you don't need them to be in. 
-Items, cards and skill with plethora of unpredictability, such as: randomly split damage, random chance to disarm, random change to stun, random chance to draw a card after using a card, randomly place a unit with a random attack direction, random chance to lock your cards, random chance to deal damage to your tower.

And I'm not even mentioning the monetization models which has been (evidently) thoroughly explained in other reviews here.  It's a bad card game, save your time and go play something better.",1544015641,1544015641,False,9,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, the most important aspect for complexity in these type of games comes from the possibility of being able to interact/disrupt your opponent. Hearthstone doesn't have any of it except for its Secret mechanic while Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh allow you to play cards in the middle of the opponents turn. Artifact, much like Gwent, takes a middle-road of sorts in where each of you play a single card in turns. This, by itself, gives it already a lot more design space for complexity than many other games of this genre.

Then there is also the game-design by itself which is simply pure genius, and honestly really refreshing compared to what else is out there. If you're looking into buying this game, and actually reading a review, I'm sure you're already aware of how it functions. There are a lot of small decisions to make that ultimately amount to your victory or lose and a lot of cool cards that allow for diverse playstyles. Concepts like pass bluffing and manipulating initiative are important. So is deciding to abandon a lane or purposefully keeping an enemy hero (in draft, which has limited mobility options) alive to lock him out of the game. It's just immense and you really have to take a step back and think about the overall situation rather than blindly following your simple game-plan. 

Then there is the RNG, with the advent of digital CCG/TCG there comes a myriad of advantages that just weren't possible in a physical format. Such as changing existing cards. One of such possibilities is the inclusion of RNG-esque things. The main-three RNG elements are the card-draw, the item-market, and the direction of your creeps and heroes attack - which can be manipulated. Those are all fine and fundamentally balanced parts of the game. But then there are some really heavy RNG cards. My personal rule of thumb is: Can this card more-or-less single-handedly win you the game, even if it's just a miniscule chance? If so, bad RNG. There are some cards like that in the game. Like Cheating Death which turns the death of your units into a coin-flip. Every. Single. Time. (Imagine doing that in reality, takes a while)

Compared to the most famous digital CCG, Hearthstone, the amount of such RNG-centric cards are really just miniscule. BUT they give an insight into the design philosophy of the future of the game. Essentially, it's not impossible for more of such cards to be printed and, sooner or later, they add up. An example of this would be the digital CCG Shadowverse. Which, at its release, only had a single relevant card of 'target a random enemy and deal 1 damage'. This was years ago. Now, after many expansions? There is a whole lot more.

Despite all the praise and fun I have with Artifact, I have to give the game a negative review, however. Why? Because of the pricing policy Valve is displaying and thus, by extension, that they care more about profit than their consumers.

Just for the record, I despise an f2p experience like Hearthstone, too. Blizzard designed the game in a way that, unless you spend actual money, you progress really really slow or have to invest insane amounts of time. If I had to name my ideal f2p experience it would be Shadowverse or Gwent. My ideal digital CCG experience would look like something akin to a monthly subscription with card-progression that isn't designed to get you to spend more money.

I also want to mention that it's theoretically possible to increase your collection without spending more money. By winning 4 games in a draft you get your ticket back and a card pack. And this possibility is what made me ultimately buy the game.

Now, with all that out the way. Their pricing policy. I am not talking about being able to 'only' buy more packs with actual money. I'm talking about the cut they take from selling cards on the steam market. You already pay money to receive the cards in the first place. Valve made their profit. But they want more. Because more profit is good, but it costs the consumer.  Capitalism, ho! What will this bring for the future? Nothing good.

These are things this game needs to stay alive.

- Daily and weekly quests for earning cards, tickets, and other purchasable items.
- More diverse cards. (Some cards feel as though they are just slight variations of eachother.)
- Jungle Legion Commander.

Replayability is a massive issue for this game. With how much luck is involved not only in drawing cards, but not being able to choose what place your heros go in? Taking away freedom of the player does not add complexity Valve. It seems like they still believe that the best way to make a game involves selling chip readers that sit on your desk so when you need to win a match you just pop in the good old MasterCard.

In short...

- The game is shallow.
- Far too randomized. (Even for a CCG/TCG.)
- Restricted to Pay2Play.
- Requires money to stay competitive.
- Lacks high level strategic value.

I bought a reasonably competitive and fun deck for like, 5 dollars, and I've been having a blast. If you wanted to get really serious, you could buy one of the most-played decks in the scene right now for less than 40, which would bring your total up to ~$60, which is the same price as a AAA release — except if you're into this one, you'll definitely get much more play out of it.

The complexity of the game is much more interesting to me than its competitors (especially Hearthstone), and while there are a few drawbacks (a few too many cards that incorporate randomness, not quite enough synchronization), it's an extremely deep and compelling experience. And even if you don't want to pay an extra cent, you can play the phantom draft endlessly, which is an absolute blast.

This game has GREAT potential. . .It if it was free, I would suggest it. with the current ""economy"" it’s not worth the price tag. I would be more apt to purchase in game packs if it was free. it is more pay to win than hearthstone and arena combined. (and with those two at least you get gold for daily goals)

Currently I don't recommend it, you start with ten packs and 5 vouchers, you can draft to win decks with vouchers but you have to be really good and Extremely lucky.
I find a single game against an AI or person takes way too long. Near the end of the round I’m bored and want to concede or do something else
The drafts seem wrong to me, I played other people that had cards WAY above anything I even saw in my draft. (some people had multiple of cards that were insane)

wait until they fix the economy (ADD SOME DAILY QUESTS!!!!) or add a free dlc or just make it a free game.

**UPDATE**
So you don't keep cards on phanton draft. A complete waste of time. I would refund this game if I hadn't just spent all those hours learning how poorly put together this game is. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY

STAY AWAY from this game until it has been updated unless you are willing to drop A LOT of money.  Casual is fine until you get bored of playing for NO REWARDS.

The drafts you play with tickets still seem fixed,  I somehow come across people with INSAINE decks with cards I never got to see in any of my drafts. (Almost makes you think they are AI, cause I know I don’t suck that much)

-Wondered if you would enjoy the mechanics?

~~~~~~~~~~
Mechanics
~~~~~~~~~~

I won't go too deep into the mechanics as there are plenty of videos and reviews online that go into extreme depth, but I will go into the smaller details that I happen to find quite enjoyable.

--------------------------------------
-This is a MOBA in Card Game Form
--------------------------------------

For those who are strictly CCG/TCG players and are not familiar with a MOBA, look up some gameplay of DOTA 2 as that is the game this is based off of. 

For the rest of those reading this, I'll assume you have knowledge of both genres. The three different playing fields share the same hand resources but have separate Mana pools. This often leads to each player getting an advantage in one of the lanes, and they end up fighting over the last one. This unique design alone creates the tension of a ""Snowball"". We've all been in those games where one lane is super strong, but the other two are not. How you use that advantage is up to you, because...

----------------------------------
-There are TWO Win Conditions
----------------------------------

In order to win, you must destroy the ""First Tower"" in two of the three lanes, or you must destroy the ""Ancient"" that spawns after you take down the first tower. The Towers have 40 health each, and the Ancient has 80 health. While two separate towers might seem faster, there may be a time where your only advantage is in one lane, so you might want to try and hold off the other two losing lanes long enough to win in the other one. Needless to say, it gets complicated.

--------------------------------------
-Initiative is Amazing
--------------------------------------

I've read in one of the reviews that this system resembles ""Gwent"". (I've never played that one) Essentially, a player starts the turn with initiative and they are allowed to perform an action before the initiative is shifted over to their opponent. Obviously there can be a lot of psychology with this. There are cards that allow you to ""steal"" your opponents initiative as well; you can play two cards in a row or immediately pass the turn and maintain initiative going into the next lane. Sounds broken? Don't worry, it isn't as game breaking as you might think, but it is definitely a solid strategical mechanic.

~~~~~~~~~~
Pay To Win?
~~~~~~~~~~

Now, this is the part of the review that everyone is probably here to read: What are my thoughts on the in-game pricing model? Before I answer, I need to ensure that you understand the reality of a person who plays Competitive Card Games. ""Pay to Win"" is used slightly different in this genre, as it generally means that this is a person willing to spend money (regardless of the amount) to purchase the top tier, meta-relevant cards. 

--------------------------------------
-Have you played Hearthstone?
--------------------------------------

It's easy to look at the Hearthstone Model and say ""I can technically get everything free, this sucks!"" However, is it really free? How many max rarities have you received from the free-to-play quests in a month? How many times do you just grind the cards into dust because you have maxed out the limit? How much money have you spent on expansions for 3-4 decent cards? Can you remember how frustrating it was to never have received Dr. Boom out of a card pack, only to spend money on card packs to get the extra dust for one copy? Remember when they locked it out of competitive play? Truly, Hearthstone is ultimately a pay-to-win game as there is simply not enough time given to players to farm for the cards they want before they are locked behind a legacy-gate.

--------------------------------------
-Yu-Gi-Oh/MTG
--------------------------------------

To put this in perspective, you can head over to tcgplayer.com and do some searching for MTG/Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Avoiding the ones that are strictly collectible and have no relevance to the meta, you will find that cards can be as expensive as $80-$200 a piece. Keep in mind, in order to be truly competitive, a lot of these decks needed multiple copies of those cards. When I played Yu-Gi-Oh, it wasn't uncommon to drop $500 on a competitive deck, and MTG has decks that consistently reach $1500-$2000 easy. These games, while immensely popular, feature a pay-to-win structure. Booster packs are not truly as random but are intentionally prearranged to guarantee a certain number of each rarity per Box. (The container that the booster packs are shipped in) The cost for such a gamble is usually at about the same price as that card is going for as a single, and there is still no guarantee that you will get it.

--------------------------------------
-How Does Artifact Stack?
--------------------------------------

So now that we have perspective; the most expensive card in Artifact at the time of this writing is Axe; who is fluctuating between $17-$18 USD. A solid 98% of the market contains cards that you can get three copies of for less than 15 cents total. With that being said, it is worth mentioning that this is like every other steam game that allows users to sell and trade on the market. These prices are apt to change based on balances and what the community considers to be strong/rare. In a worst case scenario, you will spend more money on a single meta-relevant core card for a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh or MTG deck than you will with the initial $20 and then proceeding to purchase max copies of every card in the marketplace. Keep in mind, if you have a little patience then you will most likely get a return on the money down the line. In the meantime, practice the game! You are given 5 keys to enter the Arena. If you win 3 games before losing 2, you get your key back and can try again. If you win 4 or 5 games, you get free booster packs (they contain 12 cards each) on top of that. This is the equivalent of running down to the local card store and playing a quick tournament on a weeknight. Taking all of this into consideration, the game has some Pay-To-Win Elements, but ultimately the best cards are well within reasonable reach and are not locked behind a $200 paywall per card.

~~~~~~~~~~
Is This For Me?
~~~~~~~~~~

This is ultimately going to depend on the kind of experience that you are looking for. Are you a filthy casual, or do you plan to climb the ladder?

There are elements for casual players. You can play against a (surprisingly) strong Bot, even giving it a deck that you created yourself and having it act out as a sparring partner when your friends are away. There is an unlimited mode where you can play against other humans in the Preconstructed mode, or in the Shadow Draft Mode. This means you are not locked out from enjoying the full experience just because you don't want to drop some money on the Keys needed to enter an arena with prizes. 

With that said, this game was designed to be played as a Competitor. The complexity of the game as a whole offers a satisfaction that you simply cannot find from other CCGs at the moment. It is extremely satisfying to comeback from behind, or to completely dominate while ahead. There are some RNG elements, but even the ""Cheating Death"" card isn't as influential as you'd think it would be in the game. If you are looking for a way to challenge yourself to think critically and outside of the box, then you should pick up Artifact.",1543991076,1543991083,True,0,0,0.498978704214096069,0,True,False,False

The whole lanes thing really doesn't take that long to get used to and choosing which to deploy in really opens up a lot of options for come backs and to fake people out.

Anyone, as someone that likes dota and card games, maybe I was doomed/destined to like this game.

For everyone complaining about the price. For the 20 dollars you get 10 packs of cards and 5 tickets (as well as some free cards that everyone gets). You can make an okay deck from these starting cards. I tried and won some games in casual matchmaking with it. 

You can also play ""Phantom Draft"" for free, which is where you draft a deck from packs of cards (not the cards you own), and you play between 2 and 6 games with this deck. You do not get to keep these cards after that. This was my favorite way to play M:TG and it is amazing that they offer it for free here. 

You can also play ""Expert Phantom Draft"" with your tickets, and if you get more than 3 wins you win packs as a reward and get your ticket back. I am still on my starting 5 tickets and already won 4 packs of cards. I have not spent any money on this game yet except the buy-in price.

You can sell your cards on the market, or recycle your extras for more tickets. You can buy any card you need on the market directly instead of them forcing you to buy packs. Over 90% of the cards cost less than a dollar on the market (and many cost only a few cents). This game has one of the best monetization systems i have ever seen in a card game.

Here are the cons, there are a few.

- Missing any kind of in game chat or community, although this may be a feature to keep it less toxic than dota...

- No progression system. You don't gain levels, there are no quests. Just the game played for the fun of it (and it is fun)

- No profile. No badges, no shiny anything.

- No tracking of wins/losses or any stats at all. This one really sucks, i am used to all the stats we can get from dota.

As this game is brand new, I fully expect that Valve will add all of these features in the future. Dota 2 changed a lot since it first came out, and this will grow too.

If you want a card/strategy game. Looking to just sort of chill, have fun, Think a bit. Ive enjoyed other card games, but couldnt really get into them. This game pulls off what the others couldnt and I'm really enjoying it.  

---THE BAD---
You WILL be spending more than $20. It is not however, an expensive game, you just need to understand what artifact aims to be. Also, Ive got some advice to make the game cheap(er) than some may lead you to believe. (we are talking less than $60 total)  

-Understand that artifact aims to be similar to REAL card games. What you are buying is a starter pack of cards. $20 gives you 120+ cards.  This guarantees 10 Hero's and a good number of rares.  Plenty of deck building fun right off the bat. enough to play and understand what you like or dont.  
You also recieve 5 tickets. These grant you access to a competitive tournament style of game. AGAIN, this is no different than if you wanted to go play in a board/card game tournament anywhere else. Not only do you win your tickets back, but you also earn more cards. Save those 5 tickets until you have a good deck/feel for the game and you may never need to buy more.  

-Speaking of tickets. A pack of 5 cost $4.99 + tax ($5.45 for me) OR 20 cards. Cheap cards cost as little as $0.05 WITHOUT tax so $5. DONT BUY TICKETS.  As you win tournaments you get cards, so you can use those cards for tickets too.

-CARDS. As I mentioned, many cards cost $0.05  probably 75% cost under $0.20.  a card pack of 12 cost $1.99+tax. So, if you buy all the cards around $0.17 and below it is cheaper than packs and you have more than half the carrds in the game for like $15. From there you can spend $15 on packs and maybe another $10 just on cards you dont have and.... you have almost every card in the game for under $60 which is what most full games cost anyways. Recycle your duplicates and you have a handful of tickets.  Use those tickets to earn the rest of your cards.  Or be the paying, working, adult that you are and buy cards/packs as you want them.  

---THE GOOD---
Not like the bad is all that bad...but that seems what people are stuck on with these reviews. I felt it important for everyone to understand.  

-GAMEMODES: 
CONSTRUCTED: Custom deck, one match OR Tournament style. 5 matches with your deck. The deck cant be changed for those 5 matches. 
DRAFT: 60 cards from 5 packs. You can change your deck each round with those cards. 

     BOTS:  Try your decks against bots. Make decks for the bots to use too! AI seems solid, challenging and provides stress free fun. Play w/ or w/o timer.  Constructed mode only. Single match.

     SOCIAL: This makes it easy to play with people on your friends list or in your steam groups. You can even create or join FREE tournaments that you, your friends, or group members make. Play how you want, with whomever you want.  

     CASUAL:  This is online mode, matchmaking. All game modes are available here as well. Free.

     EXPERT:  
          Constructed 5 match (1 ticket): 
               3 wins = 1 ticket
               4 wins = 1 ticket + 1 Pack
               5 wins = 1 ticket + 2 Packs   
          Phantom Draft (1 ticket):
               3 wins = 1 ticket
               4 wins = 1 ticket + 1 Pack
               5 wins = 1 ticket + 2 Packs 
         Keeper Draft (2 tickets 5 packs)
               3 wins = 2 ticket + 60 drafted cards
               4 wins = 2 ticket + 2 Packs + 60 drafted cards
               5 wins = 2 ticket + 3 Packs + 60 drafted cards  

CARD VARIETY
     Cards do many things and support many styles of play. Focus on strong hero builds items, maybe spell casting, amass an army, build a wall, win with gold, debuffs, lock out the other player from using cards, be an assasin, and so much more. There is enough variety that is viable and fun, that you should have a blast if you like creating decks.  

     4 colors: red, green, blue, Black. each has its own hero, spell and improvement cards. Red hero plays red cards, black plays black etc. No hero in a lane? Cant play color cards.  

DECK BUILDING
Easy and intuitive interface. A must have for the genre, very solid. Lots of easy ways to sort and find what you want.  You will spend a lot of time here not because you have to but because you will want to. It is very easy to make a deck, then go try it out and perfect it to your liking.  

GAMEPLAY
Its deep! there is a lot to learn and master, but the game is VERY good at telling you what you CAN do. What makes a good player and a bad one is knowing how that plays out and predicting your next moves with an opponent. Its not a question of how do I play, but rather what should I play.  VERY easy to learn, much harder to master, and of course learn what cards you like or not and adjusting decks.  

Pacing is perfect. And I've had a bunch of matches where im on the edge of my seat just excitied to see how things play out and if I will come out on top. So many very close very intense matches. 

The game is simply fun. If you are even looking at the game or thinking about if its something you would like, chances are you will not be dissapointed. I bought the game skeptical and am very glad I did. Wonderful game.",1543983811,1543983811,True,127,14,0.654186666011810303,0,True,False,False

I felt like I was outplaying my opponent when I succeeded, and lost when I made a misplay. Obviously including normal card game rng that can not be controlled. I found this game very enjoyable until I started playing against the ""Broken"" cards in the game. Obviously their will be stronger cards then others, but Axe and Drow Ranger I found very frustrating. I would honestly be okay with these cards if you did not have to shell out $20 for Axe and he is almost a must have in any somewhat competitive red  deck (most decks want to run him). I would honestly understand this , but you are making an initial $20 investment, and to stay competitive you need to spend significantly higher. It is also very difficult to obtain more cards without investing more because you find yourself playing against the best cards while you have your ""budget deck"" that you already spent a decent chunk of change on.

I do find this a shame because the overall concept of the game is very fun and engaging. It has been a while since I have enjoyed a game as much as I did, while beginning to learn this game. I feel this game had the potential to be a fantastic game, but they I believe Valve was a bit to greedy. This game may have the potential to redeem itself, but I feel it is to late.

This an awesome game at heart and the RNG feels so out of place with the other mechanics in the game, really taking away from the experience.

Things that are decided by RNG
-Attack Targets
-Unit Placement
-Melee Creep Spawns
-Several different card mechanics (Bounty Hunter, Cheating Death, Intimidation, Eclipse, etc.)

You can outplay this sometimes if you have the cards to allow you to do so, but since this RNG takes place each turn you'll not be able to always do that. It's feelbad RNG, when you win because of it, it feels ridiculous, when you lose because of it, it's infuriating.

But I REALLY regret that now.

First of all, I didn´t like it after the tutorial so I asked for a refund.
They falsely claimed I had already consumed or transferred any of the items that came with the game, which isn´t true.
I bought the game, played the tutorial and left it there.
The 10 Packs you get for starters where still unopened.

So I asked for a refund a second time, same claim.
Maybe something comes with the game that is consumed while playing through the tutorial which seems like a ridicolous trap to get the steam refund out of the way.

Then I gave the game a try in casual PvP.
If You win a game in Hearthstone for example you get something of a reward (Gold to buy packs)
Artifact doesn´t reward you. You get a victory screen and will be linked back to the menu.
No progression system of any kind.

This seems not too far from counter strike where one may have an account level which is barely relevant and most ""progress"" comes from having a good time while getting better at the game.

However the big difference between the two games is. In Counter strike, every player gets the same weapons and chances of achieving them without paying for each weapon.
In Artifact you have to buy the cards and there is absolutely no way of achieving them by playing.
And that AFTER you already spent 18 € on the game itself.

Compared to Hearthstone which is free to play AND features the possibility of getting boosters with new cards through playing, Artifact seems like a scam. And that without mentioning that with every marketplace transaction where you buy a card from another player steam earns another 15% of the card´s value.

If we take Magic: The Gathering for example, a competitive modern deck can range from 300 - 500 dollars. But you don't HAVE to spend that much to make a deck. You can easily build a pretty good deck for 30 dollars. But it won't be good enough to compete against top tier decks. For Artifact, it's similar. BUT highly competitive decks in this game range from only 20-40 dollars, which is very generous compared to other card games. 

The other complaint I see is, ""Why do I have to spend $20 on a game that I have to pay MORE money for just to play competitively?"" For starters, that $20 gives you 5 booster packs and 2 starting decks. Imagine that $20 as a beginner box for Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. It's solely there to teach you the game and give good cards to make those starter decks better. And considering what you get in those packs, you can sell a few and make a REALLY good deck. It's fair that they would charge for the game. Because if they didn't, the economy of cards would be fluctuating a lot more and highly competitive decks would be way more common. 

Enough about complaints, here's what I think about the game. 

Compared to other card games, this one is probably the most unique and fun one I have played. The only downside is that sometimes, or rarely, you will lose a game soley on RNG. No, I'm not talking about randomly drawing into a bad card, I'm talking about actual game mechanics. On turn one, if your heros are randomly placed in bad spots and 2 or all of them die on turn one, you basically lost. It gives the opposing player more money, more card advantage, and overall control for the rest of the game. So if you're not playing some sort of BR control, you're boned if this happens to you. Another downside is that the game lacks enough cards to see a wide variety of different decks. In competitive play, everyone is playing the same 3-5 decks. But over time this will be changed with new sets that'll be added. 
But besides those, the game is REALLY fun. Even though most competitive players use the same 3-5 decks, the RNG mechanic can make each time playing those decks interesting. Which gives the player more of a challenege. 
Artifact doesn't solely rely on how good your deck is, it's how you play it.

-I really like the DOTA2 themed card game and it's inovations and ideas
-It has great mechanics, animation and voiceacting
-Easily one of my favourite games so far


HOWEVER, what Valve is doing is oureageous. Many other games like Hearthstone, Duelist or Shadowverse are at least free when you start them. This game costs almost 20$ just for 10 packs and the oportunity to pay more.
Yes, you can play constructed, but dont expect to get far without throwing at least 3 times as much.
The ONLY redeeming quality is to play casual draft.

I am deeply disappointed that a game like Valve can do something like this, as many of us thought that they understood what games are about. They have milions of fans that would even buy the game for 30$ no problem, but at least give us some decent features in the game exept the MASSIVE CON of an external economy that even rivals the real world's.

¿Planeas jugar de manera semi-seria? La respuesta será, sencillamente, NO.

El juego es lo que vendría a ser la copia exacta de la ""Ruleta de la fortuna"" llevado a juego de cartas. (Ya sin contar la suerte que puedes tener o no a la hora de robar cartas de tu mazo al comienzo de cada turno). 
En este juego casi todo funciona por probabilidad. La línea en las que salen los heroes, el posicionamiento de los heroes dentro de las propias líneas en conjunto con los creeps (Lo cual afecta a qué te vas a encontrar delante), una gran cantidad de hechizos o habilidades que, además, están bastante fuertes.
Estamos hablando de cosas como un ""50% de que tus unidades verdes no puedan morir"".

Cuando a un juego de cartas al cual parece que Valve le quiere meter caña para que se jueguen torneos competitivos, donde el nivel de habilidad será más o menos igualado, le metes que el factor decisivo de una partida sea con muy alta probabilidad el azar, mal vamos. Y lo digo desde un punto de vista de jugador desde hace más de 12 años de Magic. Que el que haya jugado sabe lo que es meterte un flood de maná o escasez de esta misma. Pero una cosa es la suerte que viene dada de un juego de cartas, y otra muy distinta el desproposito este. 
Pero eso si, farmear sobres es más o menos asequible, que menos...

¿Quieres jugar con tus colegas por las risas? Este juego es para ti, os vais a reir. El juego en sí está entretenido y tiene su  chicha, y para echar pachangas entre amigos tienes todas las cartas.

PD: A la gente que se queja de que un juego de cartas vale dinero montarse un mazo...

Playing casual you just really hope that there wouldn't be this creditcard kid who bought all the OP stuff and just bullies the crap out of you.
The real dissappointment here is that this game doesn't offer ""coming back"" feel like for example hearthstone does with ranked games where you keep coming back to climb the ladder to achieve better rank than before, feels like there is no point of playing unless you have the best cards.
I get it it is not fully pay-to-win and there is phantom draft to play and try to get some packs, problem is that thats all theres to it with unplayable casuals and gauntlets, if you don't want to invest in buying packs there really isn't point buying this game.
They really need to change the system of heroes to more balanced and easier ways to get additional packs without paying but by playing, for example implementing ranked with reward system.
The mechanics and animations are cool along with the combat system, i'd say the games are really slow sometimes and boring but I know that's just my preference.
I rated this review negative only because lack of the ""coming back"" feeling and unplayable casual games where you intend to master/adjust your deck but it is hard when just get into onesided matches where your winrate is close to 0 from the start even with a starting godhand.

Casual Matchmaking is unreal and just downright frustrating ... You RARELY! stumble across someone who hasn't spent at least 100$ on cards and has a SERVER advantage, again if you want new cards YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM, otherwise you are stuck with your initial deck :D

The game is very fun and it shows it when you play the Call to Arms mode where you have pre-built decks and its the player's skill that determin the outcome of the game not the size of one's credit card.

Those are just gripes though. The main issue is that after you pay $20 for the game, it is still pay to play. There is no way to freely continue building decks simply by putting time in and playing. Once you run out of the 5 tickets you're alotted at purchase to participate in expert play (the only way to build decks w/o straight up buying cards). You have no other choice but to buy cards outright or buy more tickets.

I'm all for being able to dump $200 into a game that I like simply because there's something I really want and believe it's worth it. I dump tons of money into Dota every TI simply because I like the game and wants the stuffz.. but not even letting players really get their feet wet in the game before putting up a paywall and sticking your hands out is simply exploitative.

I'm baffled. Who tf thought this type of cash grab game would be sustainable?

-You use one $1.50 ticket to get into phantom draft. (5 free tickets for buying the game) 
-If you get a 3/5 run,(40% chance) you get your ticket back, and if you get more you get packs. (33.3% chance for one pack, 16.7% for two packs) 
-A pack pays for half a ticket,(20 recycled cards = 1 draft ticket) meaning you need three packs won before you can make any form of profit from it. 
For all of you gamblers out there, those might seem like good odds, but considering you're new to draft, you will spend those 5 tickets at a loss in the blink of an eye.

Constructed is out of the question. Card whales spend their money buying 50 packs, or expensive cards off the steam market to make decks that are impossible to beat. You can either fork money over to buy cards, or recycle all of your decks for phantom draft tickets.

So draft is out, and then constructed is out. What is valves response to this glaring issue?

If you favor constructed play, the cards in those packs are likely to get you some foundation for budget decks and by trading cards you should be able to construct a pretty good meta deck below the price of a AAA game, which I think is fine pricing. I think with a few more sets the balance and viable deck types will even out a bit, currently mono color is simply not viable and the meta is pretty straight forward (early board presence of red is consistently powerful, combo decks to counter that are less reliable as a result of few cards to play with). Over time the marketplace is bound to be more favorable to those willing to spend the time and effort to read the meta and all that, so that's another bonus to waiting.

Basically, if you want to do drafts and events, it's a great value proposition and game.

The top decks in this game only cost a maximum of around 50 GBP which is the price of an expansion pack of 50 packs in hearthstone which doesn't gurantee you any decks and also the cards lose value when disenchanted, while the Artifact cards , while not keeping their full value , will be able to be sold for a small loss. 

+ The game is very skill based and comebacks are very common and easy if played right, even if blue heroes might get stomped early by bristle, tresdin and axe, late game cards such as bolt of damocles and conflagrate and a lot of AoE board clears will help blue late game. The three lane system and all of the other game systems such as colours, items, improvements, the certain affixes such as Siege, Retaliate, Gold, Armour add up and work greatly together.

+ Great variety of decks for the beginning, with every colour having a viable competitive deck and also every deck having different strategies ( black = gondar track and jinada early into payday horn of alpha , green = mist of avernus + drow passive + cheating death + lycan for a lot of buffs and strong support, red = good stats, focused on out-trading and overpowering the enemy, though can fall off in late game if you don't get to Time of Triump , blue = focused on AoE and spells , starting off slow in the early game but becoming very strong  late game, a ""control"" deck)

+ The in-game tournament system , the over-all look and flow of the UI and menu's alongside with great acting and animations and the overall look and feel of the game is outstanding.

- Not global chat / in-game tournament FINDER and lack of Valve in-game amateur tournaments

- No progression system ( not necessarily gaining cards, mostly a Level and a Stats page and certaing prestige awards would be nice , like getting 10 perfect wins might get you an emblem or something to show that etc. )

- More game-modes should be added and a RANKED game-mode for both draft and constructed with no ticket requirements and with an MMR system , which could have the same ranks as in DotA 2, and also seasons such as in hearthstone, where you get rewards based on your rank in the previous season and also a reset of MMR / Calibration to climb all over again.

Overall , a great game with greate monetisation and very good gameplay. Missing ranked modes , progression system, and social aspects, which i am sure Valve is working on, apart from this the game is very good and I recommend picking it up if you are a TCG fan , a DotA fan, a valve fan or if you're curious about the game in general, you can alwasy refund the game withing 2 hours!!!",1543957836,1543957870,True,2,1,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

It is impossible to play constructed [u]at the top of your game[/u] without the current 2-3 meta decks. Those decks only contain the most expensive cards on the market.
The power distribution of cards make half of the card pool useless, unless it's draft. This is [u]only because of rarity[/u].
Powerful cards will always be expensive because they are ""rare"" and they will never remove rarity because it adds a ceiling on per customer spending.
Also the fact that there is ""rarity"" Valve has no incentive on really balancing cards out.
You might argue that this is only the first set and it will be balanced with others coming in. Under the assumption of no real balancing, the baseline power will be defined by Drow and Axe and the next set will maybe bring 3-4 meta decks instead of the current 2-3. The concept of ""rarity"" and ""draft"" together will make this game having the same problem of 50% useless cards.
Also, if you notice that a card bringing any consistent advantage, you can bet it's rare, and constructed wants to max consistency for their playstyle.  

This realisation left me with only disappointment to be honest. I stopped playing real life Magic for these exact same reasons.",1543956767,1543956890,False,2,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

First of all, I have never played dota 2, so I am in no position to comment on the lore/truthfulness to the game/etc.

However, I consider myself a hardcore TCG/CCG player, I've top 100'd in hearthstone 8 months in a row, I played MTG for 15+ years and top 8'd many ptqs and gps, I won the champion cup in shadowverse, and in general I play a LOT of card games, and tend to do well in them.

That being said I think I am in a good position to critique this game.

First of all, the graphics:
This has got to be one of the best looking card games I've seen in my life. Every card has it's own voice, lore, and is rendered wonderfully, the board, hands, and little devil-sprites (I'm sure they have a name) are fantastic looking. In my books the graphics are 10/10.

Second, HUD:
The HUD menu out-of-game is a little unintuitive, some buttons are placed in weird places, opening or editing your decks requires you to ""load"" them (instead of all your decks being listed, you have to hit a ""load"" button and then ""save"" when you're done), deckbuilding is ok-ish. Your deck is a list of card names, you drag other cards from a list (your collection) unto your deck (another list). I would've liked to see some kind of binder or catalogue where either the deck, or the collection is spread out with full size cards instead of just a ""name"" in text that you have to click on to find out what the card does. In game HUD, again, looks fantastic, but sometimes when the opponent takes a while on their turn there's nothing to do (in hearthstone you can click the environment, in MTGarena, shadowverse, and others your mouse has particle effects that you can draw with) - not really a big deal to be fair, I'm just being anal. There's also always a card pack floating in the ""buy packs"" screen, this card pack shows whether or not you have a pack, which get's a bit confusing because the game makes it look like I have an unopened card park in my collection.

Next and the most important aspect of the game - what to do:
Unfortunetly there isn't much to do outside of playing the game. There is no ranked mode, there is no leaderboard, there is no rewards of any kind, no in-game currency, no profile icons, no cardbacks, no new voicepacks/game tables, no rank beside your profile, no progression of ANY KIND. If you play a game and win, what do you win? Nothing. Play and lose, nothing. In effect there is no grind, no climb, and overall this is the ONE thing that keeps me from recommending this game to people. This encourages players to play wacky/stupid decks instead of competetive decks, which is fun for those players, but not for players who want to win. The one ""competetive"" game mode in the game consists of spending a ticket (a currency) to enter an ""expert tournament"" - A gamemode that ends when you lose twice, and has rewards for up to a maximum of 5 wins, which is a grand prize of a ticket and TWO packs. Yes that's right, TWO packs.

If you're the best player in the entire game you have to grind out this boring ""tournament"" for two packs, which is redundant for two reasons, first of all, the cards in this game are very limited (as of now) and you can effectively buy 3 of every card in the game for $30 thanks to the in-game market (you can buy and sell cards, however 95% of the cards sell for $0.02). This means that it's cheaper to buy your decks that open a bunch of packs to get the cards, and second, you get prettymuch 90% of the cards in the game from opening around 20-30 packs ($50), since only about half the cards are playable, packs become useless (especially 2 as a grand prize) and most people will just buy other players' excess cards for cents. This results in the game's ""expert tournament"", a mode where you pay 1 ticket, and if you WIN ALL YOUR GAMES, you get back 1 ticket, and 2 packs, being completely unsatisfying.

I would like to see the wins extended to 8 or even 12, and bigger prizes.

Next, I want to explain something to all of you, in any given card game, there are what are called ""whales"", these players make up 0.5%-1.5% of the playerbase but account for 50% of the revenue for card games.

I want to bring this up because there is something missing from this game. Foils.
""Premium"", ""Foil"", ""Animated"", or ""Golden"" cards are animated or holographic versions of cards that are hard to obtain. Players like me want a fully foil deck - and we are willing to pay for it. If valve implements Foils into the game, the ""whales"" will spend A LOT MORE MONEY on packs trying to get foils, the community will open a lot more packs trying to get expensive $100 foils that they can sell on the marketplace, there is FINANCIAL reasons to add foils, but also it makes opening packs much more exciting! Casual players will gamble because there's a chance to get big money, and packs will suddenly become appealing, because again, after spending about $40 you own every card in the game, and card packs become useless.

I wanted to talk about gameplay but I feel I've rambled on too much. If you're still reading this by now, this game needs a way to progress, so a win FEELS like a win, a ranked system - with monthly or yearly rewards, an esports scene, a profile that you can show off, a way to communicate in the game, and a way of determining who the best is, and ofcourse, FOILS.

People seem to be acting like it's a massive rip off, (ignoring the game mode where YOU CAN PLAY WITH EVERY CARD FOR FREE) - but it's probably the best and cheapest TCG system I've seen so far. My most powerful deck design (that I was fucking smashing people with last night) was about £1 for all the cards. I was beating people who had the expensive cards, so yeah it doesn't feel P2W at all.

In my opinion, you can have a great time with the community and playing pauper and spend around 15$ on the game (complete). I'll tell you how. You spend 18$ on the base game. You open your packs (mine were pretty bad). You sell all the cards except commons and basics => get around 7$ (or more) steam credit => buy the whole pauper (only commons) collection (around 4$) and voi lá! You got all pauper decks you will ever play until the next expansion (which you will buy from your 3$ (or more) left). And in my opinion, pauper is even more fun than normal play.

While may of the ideas put forward are great in theory, they prove to be shit in practice. Who on the team played those matches where every single hero you put down gets fucked by RNG, and then had fun passing 20 times next match as the enemy slotted his heroes and put down cards? It's fucking absurd. And by the late game, either one board or even two are abandoned by each player. This means that at all times there's one board where you won't be able to do ANYTHING. At the very least make it so that your turn is passed automatically, there's nothing you can do anyway, for fuck's sake. 
But no, this game is just a lot of flashy production values and a few good ideas, marred down by bad design, from the passivity that's forced upon you as a player at all times, to the RNG that takes place constantly and brings you down. 
I wish I could say I have hope that Valve fixes the game, but I don't. Heroes of the Storm had a similar problem of launching in an unfun state, and no amount of later content and fixes could ever bring back the community. I expect Artifact to be the same. Nobody wants to spend close to an hour in a fucking match to lose to 1 hp difference that comes from a creep put there by the game's RNG. It's just a cancerous approach to game design, and it's laughable to think that this was supposed to be the premiere competitive card game. 50% of the time your job is to unfuck the lane from the bad RNG that you've been given. That is not fun. Cards that change fuck attack direction and buff up your enemies by one point health might change the outcome of the combat phase, but is not conducive to a satisfying experience for the player AT ALL.

- Complex gameplay that's satisfying when you manage to pull off a win from behind or even when you lose by a hair
- Unlimited casual draft and rotating preconstructed deck events
- Mistakes can be punishing but also oddly entertaining and educational

- Fully voiced lore lines and the occasional quips are charming

event tickets are the currency used to enter game modes wherein you have the chance to win that ticket back and potentially earn a couple of packs. you are provided with 10 packs and 5 tickets to start with. if you open these 10 packs and get garbage rares worth nothing on the marketplace, and you exhaust the 5 tickets provided, you currently have no way to earn a single more card other than to pour more money into the game, or 'game' the marketplace with your current cards in the hopes of turning a profit.

the ability to make beneficial trades to increase the value of your collection is something seen in physical card games (such as Garfield's 'Magic: The Gathering'), and the decision to allow users to buy, sell and trade cards is a welcome one. however, physical card games like MTG provide players with opportunities to engage in weekly local contests (such as Friday Night Magic events) at little to no cost - and at these events, you can potentially earn new packs or cards, and trade with and meet other players.

the mechanics of this card game in themself are very interesting, fun to play with, and make for consistently close games. they've managed to make every game a challenge, and there is a good balance of opportunities for skillful play and roll-of-the-die chance that makes for a really fun time. but the combination of a pretty malicious monetization scheme (for a PAID pc game) and the complete lack of any social play means that i can't in good faith recommend this to anyone.

Pay to win, I don't really care but I would have liked it to be a free game

PROS
~ Even though the game is pay to win in constructed, you still need to be competent to win
~ gameplay is strategic and moves at a reasonable pace
~ I haven't seen any over the top combos. Yet.
~ Drafting, the best mode in any TCG imo, doesn't require any large finacial investment
~ The game seems complex enough to offer something for TCG veterans, but simple enough to allow begginers to enjoy themselves
~ Richard Garfield

CONS
~ The big one first THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN, but like I don't know any ""trading"" card games that aren't
~ I can see this becoming very expensive with future expansions
~ Pay to pay to win, for real why you gotta charge me for the game? Is it cause you knew I would buy it anyway
~ I would like to see locked perspective so I don't get zoomed back in and can just stay at a distance

First off, the economic plan Valve's decided on here is beyond greedy. You pay for the game and then you have to pay to get more cards (not any real way of earning cards without paying) and you actually have to pay to keep playing the real competitive modes. Looking at Hearthstone there's at least the possibility of earning in game currency and buying your way into a draft; in Artifact you have to whip out the ol' money bag.

And if you actually decide to put in money to play the drafts you'll end up playing a horribly unbalanced game, where even if you get all the best cards and play perfectly, you could still end up losing if the RNG decides it and your opponent isn't braindead. That's how much of a random factor this game has and that's not counting the standard card drawing. 

I'm extremely disheartened by how game developers decide what their game should look like nowadays, I don't know why I maybe thought Valve would be different.

I paid for the game but I regret it and won't put in another dime unless something changes drastically.

For everyone that feels like bashing the game, yes! It is not F2P get over it. I have spent a lot of money on Hearthstone and so far Artifact really does not cost more to build up a collection. Most of the cards are dirt cheap and have been winning a lot of games with a deck that costs around $10-$15 and the cards in that deck can go into several others. There are a small handful of cards that do cost too much and I wish valve would implement something to prevent them from going that high but I can easily see the market getting more flooded over time and those cards drastically being reduced in price.

What I really love about the game not being F2P is that I no longer have to feel guilty to log in every day for daily quests and play decks I don't want to play and earn a miniscule reward.

The game was tested for more than half a year by pro hearthstone, MTG players and other collectible-card-game influenceres and it shows - while for a newcomer it is rather complicated and takes some time to get to know all the mechanics and concepts of the game that affect randomizer and balance, when you get ahold to all of that, Artifact hits healthy balance between simpliness of an Hearthstone and complexity of MTG.
Every game takes 3 lanes of one standart Hearthstone game, and it also impacts the length of the game and the influence of randomness to the outcome. Contrary the popular opinion, Artifact isnt less random than Hearthstone, the difference is in the control of that random -  lets say you've got RNG'd creeps to the lane that you don't want to push anymore, you can adjust to that during deployment phase, you can deploy a hero to that lane just to play cards that move units to other lanes, or you can change your strategy and decide to focuse to that lane back, if you have cards that strengthen creeps. In other words because each random element impacts the game less and you have more decisions to make during the game, overall impact of random elements is less, even though randomness of the game is not less than in Hearthstone.
And another way to negate the RNG is the deck composition. Have the plan for the game, have the set of cards to help to bring the plan to fruition - you may not feel the game cheat you as much as you expect it from the other games of this genre.
Ant cards, decks and overall price of the game is its greatest enemy. The years of freemium collectible-card-games thaught us that the core experience should be free, and if you want, you can pay on top of that to get better cards, and subsequently better chances to get better results. ""The most powerful card in the deck is a credit card"" - the meme that is as strong as ever, and unfortunately it is true to this game, the metagame dictates the prices for the gards on steam market and you can't really play free deck competitively. The wierd way VALVE decided to cut this corner is to make this game alike MTG in the sence that is Pay-to-play - if everyone has 10 packs for 20$ purchase, then everyone has either non-free set of cards to play, or everyone has some set of cards to sell on a market and then buy a set of cards to play. On top of that you can't earn new cards/packs/tickets, unless you spent an entry ticket (that costs 4.95$ each, or 20 recycled cards that will get you an entry ticket significantly cheaper, since cheapest cards on the market are roughly 0.05$, 5 are included with your initial purchase), to get into non-free competitive game modes, and still, non-free modes do not even guarantee you that you get even your money back. Luckaly, if you don't seek to play non-free competitive experience, you get free analogue (without rewards at stake) of those gamemodes.

And that's where controversy and negativity of people have to pay for what they [b]expect[/b] to get for free meets the game that has good card design, aesthetically pleasing graphics, good soundtrack and crutially, fun gameplay. 
What I [b]think[/b] will happen is that in 5-6 months steam stats for players active in the game will plummit to a couple of thousands concurrent users and VALVE will have to make some sort of free-to-play client to play the game with free decks and in free game modes.

On gameplay, there are too many flaws in the design of this game.
At the start of each round, minions' are added randomly into lanes, and their positions are randomized. This causes make or break situations in the mercy of rng
Only drawing 2 cards per round while you have to manage 3 lanes is just silly, and greatly restricts your control in the game.

It features both a solid amount of strategic game play as well as being an overall good visual product. To me this sets it much above most of the competition. I’ve already had so many close games where myself and my opponent are trying to outfox each other to gain that critical upper hand to win the match. I can’t say I’ve felt that way with any other card game. 

Not only is the typical constructed deck game play, but there’s also draft mode, which you don’t see in all card games. This is probably the golden gem right now as you can play draft for free. If you ask me that’s worth the $20 price of admission straight up. Games are much more fun and interesting when you aren’t playing the same meta decks repeatedly. It also adds even more skill to drafting and constructing decks on the fly which I find really rewarding.

There’re a few cards with a bit too much RNG (like cheating death) but overall RNG feels rather limited in the overall design which is a good thing. I won’t say you won’t ever get screwed by it, it does happen, but it tends to be the exception rather than the rule.

Most of the time I feel like when I lose a match I could’ve played differently or made better strategic decisions that could have led to a victory. I think that is really in contrast to Hearthstone or MTG where if you don’t draw on curve and your opponent does it feels like you stand a very small chance of winning. 

This game has a lot of controversy around it, part of it is probably deserved, but I think in the big picture most of it is unwarted. 

The game is not very budget player friendly. You can’t pick it up for free and grind out free cards like Hearthstone, MTG or Gwent. To be fair even though other card games allow you to grind cards, Gwent is the only one that’s even remotely generous in terms of what you get. I don’t think it’s fun to grind months on end to build a higher tier deck. If you want to play competitive constructed in any of those games, you’ll likely end up buying cards to move along much faster. Artifact is no different, and you could argue it’s better in some ways as there’s a marketplace where you can just buy the cards you need to craft a competitive deck rather than opening packs. Over time as the market becomes saturated, I would think it will cost less than the alternatives. I’d personally rather have this system.

The game does have a few other warts. No replays are a bit of a bummer considering other Valve games have them. There’s a tournament mode, but you have the part of groups or have friends to run them, you can’t just host open lobbies like some games. There is no real “ranked” or ladder mode like you would be used to in DOTA or similar. I personally don’t think these are as much of an issue as it seems. I look at something like DOTA and have watched it grow over the years. I think in due time these things will be added and its early days so far. Valve has really supported and help their games grow, and they seem poised to do it here as well. It has more features than some of the competition whom have been out much longer.

If you compare the cost of Artifact to what it would cost to play Hearthstone or MTG competitively Artifact seems to win handily, but it’s early. I think overall Artifact is the best competitive game. If you compare which game is better for the budget player Gwent is the clear winner. If you want the most casual game, I would say Hearthstone is your best bet.

Overall, I think the game is great for a first version and it’s a lot of fun. There’s room for improvement, and it doesn’t tick all the boxes for everyone which is causing very mixed reviews. In the grand scheme of things, I think it’s a pretty competitive product that will only get better with time. If you enjoy a more complex card game, then I think it’s the best one on the market. $20 is worth it for the free draft mode alone, but if that doesn’t interest you and you’re a budget player you should look elsewhere.

1. Why is there no mulligan?
There are cards to lessen some rng, but how are we supposed to get them in time (ie. 1st turn)?

2. The initial placement + arrows matter A LOT
There will be matches where your first three heroes will die 1st round, you cannot do anything about it and your opponent didnt even have to play a card. There are enough comeback cards - but starting at a significant disadvantage or advantage you had no influence on feels weird..

3. The shop
1 item out of our 9 item deck ? Feels like another layer on rng on the 1st turn rng (prob. better in constructed)

4. The Monetization
just as a preface - I bought the game intending to play only free draft - I more or less got what I payed for even though I wish I could have enjoyed the game a bit more:

no crafting - only card -> ticket conversion (20:1?) - expect good cards to be expensive
 
The monetization is however refreshingly honest - no daily quests, no rewards, nothing to get you hooked and maybe pay  sometime in the future - you like it -> you pay more; you don't -> well thanks for your money. Then you realize they put a fee on ""expert play"": 
Pay for the game - pay for at least 1 competitive deck - pay to play ""seriously"" - well valve lost me somewhere in this process. 

5. Conclusion:

If you just want to play a card game casually from time to time the price is a bit high but you might enjoy it. (buy on sale?)

I enjoy the gameplay aspect of the board and how the game plays out very much.  It works.  It makes the game unique from other TCG and i love that.  I've play Hearthstone for a long time, alone with Magic and this game actually puts a smile on my face and makes me think about what I'm doing before I do it rather than aimlessly throwing cards on the board because they look cool.  The game forces a playstyle that requires you to forge your own decks and not look at ones online.  It forces and encourages you to try out different comps of heros, or cards, or items.

Thing with Hearthstone doing buyable card packs is that Hearthstone is initally a free to play game.  You can play the game entirely for free.  You can climb the ladder, build decks, play in the arena, and even do some of the story for free.  A FREE TO PLAY GAME, giving content to players who don't want to pay money because they want to play causally, who don't care about what cards you have or how good you are.  They just enjoy the atmosphere of the game. 

That is what Artifact lacks.  HEAVILY.  This game has no free way of getting card packs other than when you recieve your first 10 when you start the game.  You get that and 5 event tickets.  Event tickets are basically a paywall to getting more packs.   People say that this game is shit, because you already paid $20.00 to play it, then on top of that you have to pay another $20 for 10 more card packs, don't let me forget to mention that they more card packs you buy, there is no discount.  You pay the same amount.  That is $40 spend on the game when you can go play a F2P card game that will allow you to play for free and earn card packs.  That is bullshit.   I feel people would love this game more if they gave a way to earn card packs.  Don't give the packs to us.  Make us play the game to get them.  I want to be rewarded for winning.  I want to have something to look forward too.  And I sure as hell don't want to buy a fucking ""Event Pass"" to feel the sense of accomplishment that I am getting better at the game.  Give us levels.  Give us ranks. Give us free tournaments.  Give us a game that we can play and not have to spend hundreds of dollars on to enjoy it.  Give us a game that isn't a cash grab for once.  Valve used to be ran by gamers.  Now it's ran by money hungry people who don't care about playerbase anymore.  Who don't care that their game is fun and enjoyable.

I don't care that you can buy packs.  That's not the point.  The point is that there should be a way to earn the packs rather than be forced to spend your money on a game that you BOUGHT.  It's bullshit and unacceptable.  No wonder the reviews are so low.",1543898664,1543898664,False,4,2,0.524506211280822754,0,True,False,False

People might argue its a TCG that requires alot of money but it begs the question, doesn't every TCG require you to continuously buy cards and build new decks? The answer is YES. The obvious argument to this will be that real TCG and a digital TCG have different values, which is sort of true, however a digital version is more accessible making it easier to find opponents and people to play with, and when it obtains a larger base of players vs the real version of the TCG, then the value of cards will eventually decrease due to the influx of players. 

On top of that the marketplace is where players will sell their unwanted cards, and they are fairly cheap - most at the $00.05-$00.10 range and only the rare ones being in dollar amounts, and this is just when the game has just released. To give you my own experience as an example, i only spent roughly $20 and have made a few decks already, the only cards missing are the ones at the $5 or more range but I don't find those too  necessary.

If you compare this game to other TCG's, you'd realize that it costs much less to make a suitable deck and takes far less time to be competitive. I feel as though the initial asking price and people thinking that you having to buy cards makes it a bad game is ultimately the two problems people have right now, which is honestly sad when as stated above, it costs less and takes less time to be competitive.

RNG is rougher than this game than I first thought, but I feel it's a bit fixable. Biggest issue is turn 1 flop can make or break your game and if this was read based even or we had more counterplay options rather than just lmao you lost it would be better. Toning down some cards like bounty hunter would help too(I get it's not the best flopper, but RNG damage spike, and his 10 gold 3 mana spell is super strong if you get a kill turn 1.)

Only other thing is flops in general I wish there was a way to control where in lane your hero went rather than just randomly, like there are too many times where I get absolutely killed because it chose the absolute worst spot to go out of 7 possible spots.

Despite these complaints I feel like they will do something about turn 1 flop at the very least, and even despite that it's about tied with GWENT for me in terms of quality. Which is to say super good.

Draw RNG is lower in this game than basically any other card game I have played even better than GWENT I feel.

I was really excited for this game and  I have 6 perfect runs in casual and a few expert draft runs. The two main problems to me are game length and RNG
[list]
[*] Game length.
[/list]
The games in artifact are way too long unless you are playing mono red or red/black. I don't want every game to last 30+ min just because I want to play blue. Its also basically impossible to run out of time without them implementing the tournament timer into basic play. If someone's using all of their time I usually just end up misplaying a bunch because I'm so bored that I'm watching YouTube while they take their turns. Being bored and muttering [i] come on [/i] while I wait for my opponent isn't appealing to me. One of the larger problems I have with dota is the length of games from que to end, I want something faster from a card game.
[list]
[*] RNG.
[/list]
Richard Garfield talked in an interview about RNG and how it like it as long as its done correctly. Which in his words meaning the higher skill opponent will come out on top most times, and how there are tools to counter the rng in the game.

That applies less so to draft in my opinion than constructed, and I only enjoy draft. You don't have the access to the same tools to counter rng as you would in constructed. The amount of RNG in this game is just too high. You have creep deployment /creep placement /hero placement /attack arrows /item shop /card RNG (cheat death/ veno wards etc. ) on top of normal draw RNG. It feels like sh*t to get dumpstered in the opening deployment, or have some bullsh*t arrows during the game, regardless of if you win or lose. I (maybe most people) notice when they get screwed more than when they get lucky. 

I gave this game a good chance and I want to like it, but I just don't enjoy the game in its current form and would not recommend it.

For those who have played MTG Arena you will understand my point here. MTG has a system that you can play for free. Are you going to take a long time until you build your deck? The answer is yes! But at least you have the feeling that you're moving forward with the deck you wanna build.

Paying AU 2.65 per pack of cards is fine, if you ask me. Sure, we don't get the immediate player base from having having a free to play model but in my experience a large percentage of those players will quit because of ""pay to win"" players. 

Artifact is an extremely fun game with intense depth that requires you to be switched on and thinking at least up to 6 turns ahead (2 rounds of 3 boards = 6 turns). The fact that players get to interact on a 1:1 card basis gives further depth.

The actual game is fun. Its complex, deep, and rewarding. I see many people complaining about the 'pay to win' aspects of the game and while I agree to a degree, there is plenty to do that won't cost you a penny more than the base cost of the game. You get draft and prebuilt-constructed modes that always allow the game to be fair. Plus, buying/selling singles is something that you don't get in many electronic TCG games. 

Now to my experience. I understand that my setup(s) aren't typical. I'm mainly a Linux user and I have a laptop and desktop (desktop dual-boots, laptop is pure Linux). On my desktop, I don't have many issues running the game. I have hardware that supports Vulkan, but there are some weird texture/artifacting issues that I don't see in other games. It took some work to setup, but I eventually got it working. My laptop is a different story. It has older hardware (although hardware from 2012 shouldn't be defunct) and doesn't support Vulkan. Ok that's fine, I'll run Artficat using OpenGL, except I get a black screen whenever I do that. So I can't play this game on my laptop at all.

But i can reccomend this game until they add some free way to get cards and or tickets. cause until then you cant get ANY free cards when you run out of tickets which is a certain eventually that you will get unlucky RNG in rolling for cards and you will lose your tickets slowly.

EDIT: Ive actually refunded a game that was 10 dollars and with that 10 dollars I used it to buy more tickets. I didnt think i would change this review till they added a way to get free cards/heroes but i realized that irl people spend hundreds on Magic the gathering, pokemon, Yugi-yo etc. and buying the game with its starter price of 20 bucks gives you basically a starter pack that you can buy anywhere else irl. not only that but if there were a way to get free cards then people could basically just get free cards to sell on the market and make a huge profit. which doesnt seem like a good thing to do for a game to make free money... you could compare it to Cs:go really because of csgo costing money and ways to buy crates and skins but the thing with csgo is that you can actually get free stuff. but the free stuff is small things that are like 4 cents which you get from just playing games with others games aka trading cards from any game. So i would only recomend this game if you are a hard core card game fan. and if you dont think you will win in constructed where everyone has all the good decks that just stomp yours then play phantom or keeper draft! random cards and heroes for both sides. Then i just sell all my cards cause im never gonna play constructed where people will stomp me and i make profit. and If you practice enough in normal games where you dont lose your tickets or card packs and once you get good you can theoretically get card packs or play keeper draft where you keep the cards you draft (which i recomend because you can pick the most exepensive ones if you get them) then sell your cards for money to buy more packs/tickets or even other games if you get lucky enough.

Cons:
Games are a bit longer and more intense, require planning and thinking.  
There is a cost to play.  Unlike others in the genre.  You can probably have everything you need for the 20 bucks to buy the game plus another 10-20 to buy all the non-chase rare heroes.  Which, btw, you don't need and should settle down int eh marketplace.  Note that cards can be converted to tickets at a rate of about a nickel per card, so it's pretty easy to be able to continually play just by doing keeper drafting after that intitial outlay of funds.
Does not seem to be a mulligan option for opening hand, so in addition to the way lane movement is done, RNG can impact games now and again.

Pros:
Very polished game
Plenty of DOTA references if you care for that sort of thing
Strategy is deep

I've put about 50 hours into the game at the time of writing, and am still having just as much fun as when I first started. This really rewards players who are willing to invest the time and energy into taking a deep dive into deckbuilding and gameplay strategy, as I've seen my winrrate steadily climbing in both Expert Constructed and Keeper Draft despite reaching higher MMRs.

Pros: 
+ Gameplay Depth
+ Fast Matchmaking
+ Draft Mode
+ Very Diverse Meta 
+ Really Rewards Skilled Players (consistent 5-0's is very doable)
+ Great Discord Community

Cons:
- True Cost of the Game is closer to $60-70 (to build a competitive deck for Expert Constructed)
- Not Enough Cards have Flashy Animations
- $20 Paywall will turn off a lot of traditionally F2P players
- Current in-game progression is really just building Steam Wallet, card collection, and racking up Perfect Runs
- No save replay feature

I am divided between the positive review and the negative one though. The game is great, but it lacks any goal. At all. There is no ranking system.Yes, the game is fun, but will slowly die without ranking system or rewards for the grind. Games like this ( which are infinite and always the same) need goals. Otherwise people will eventually leave it and instead of grinding it for days and days, are only going to play the eventual match for fun. That will make the game as it is have a much smaller playerbase and playtime per player. Second thing is the price. Anyone who says that you do not have to pay money to enjoy this is half lying. Yes you can definetely play the events and use the cards you have to make decks, but they will be crap. Complete crap decks. This is not a turn off for me,since when you buy cards you keep their value (because you have them) and it is just the normal way of a TCG to work. I am just warning people, this game needs extra money dumped on it.
Overall : Great game, great mechanics, really needs some kind of ranking system or tournaments per week, some kind of reward for whoever puts time on it, because right now, it is a ´´Play it for fun game´´, while the game itself is made to be played in an extremely competitive format. Also, if you want to win with your own decks,expect to spend some money.

Edit:  C'mon guys,I can understand some of the negative reviews, but all the ones because they did not get the packs in the first 30 minutes logged in, or the ones saying that the game is too complicated, they make no sense. It`s normal for a game to have troubles in the first hour of launch, just wait an hour and your packs should be there,if not sooner. About it being dificult or confusing...For real? Is that a reason for people to review a game as bad, beause it is harder than what they like? Just move on,do not bash on it.

Luna kept getting ganked and never got strong enough to make a difference, so I lost that lane. BH and Drow dominated bottom lane and kept getting enough farm to get good items. Tried to roam at the wrong time and Zeus cleaned up all the damaged Heroes before I could get my spell off.

The gameplay is deep and filled with a crazy amount of decision making. Very quickly you'll be tracing the result of the game back to small decisions you made previously. ex. You wanted to get a kill on a Hero in bottom lane, so you used one more item, but that resulted in losing Initiative at the start of the next round and the Zeus was able to team wipe you despite having a Gust in hand. While there are some chaotic elements, you always have methods for mitigating them and counter-play.  The end result feels like you are commanding a battlefield, and reacting to the chaos and confusion of the fights and trying to send reinforcements where they are needed.

Deck building is very intriguing but I'm waiting for the market to settle down to buy more singles. Some pauper decks are already crazy affordable. It's nice to be able to grab a complete deck for under a $1 instead of buying packs and wasting time with crafting systems. It feels like good value when you spend money and the market is an interesting meta to play as well.

- most chalenging gameplay, the most interesting card game i've ever played. It covers all card game functionality, like Civilization ant other turn-based strategies cover their table top prototypes.
- market mechanism is AWESOME. This is how it shoul be done, some improvements there, a touch of UIX somewhere else ...

Artifact IS WORST OF ITS KIND, because:
- monetization model is outrageous, Valve is soooo greeeedyyy ...
- drop system, and adverse variance chance are WAY out of ordinary. I saw a guy, who opened pack and two (!) Axes, and three (Khallas). In my case - i received ALL THE SAME cards. Like, the same rare card IN EVERY BOOSTER. I bought 15 of them ALREADY! And i'm not willing to pay anymore.
- there is no any kind of incentive to play this game: there is level-up Dota 2-like style progress, NO (!) statistics, NO rankings/ratings, NO ladder. There is no quests, no events - and there is no adequate way to win gauntlet matches BECAUSE of ...
- AXE! When you red-green (Axe+Drow), or red-blue (Axe+Khala+Meepo) - well, you're out! And there is NO OTHER GUYS in Gauntlet mode. And if you have this type of deck - the only things left behind victory IS A CHANCE!

At this point, i'm not quite sure - i don't even quite realize. Is it that GOOD, that something MUST TO BE MADE it little worse.

Why i bought booster, but NOT the axe? Answer is QUITE SIMPLE - or Axe will be nerfed, as it 110% imbalanced. Or they will tune drop rate, and Axes card cost will DROP significantly.

A collaboration between legendary card game designer Richard Garfield and Valve, Artifact is a digital card game that combines deeply-strategic, competitive gameplay with the rich setting of Dota 2. The result is an immersive and visually-stunning trading card game unlike any other.

STRATEGY UNBOUNDED
Wield your deck across three lanes of combat, answer every move of your opponent with one of your own. Unlimited hand size. Unlimited number of units you control. Unlimited mana you can employ. 

It’s up to you to decide the best way to navigate the constantly shifting tide of battle.

FUN WITH FRIENDS
If you’ve played card games around a kitchen table, you know the enjoyment that can come with house rules. Artifact allows you and your friends complete control in creating a tournament. Simply select your elimination or non-elimination format and deck constraints; then, challenge your friends to a crucible of your own design.

First of all i paid my 20 bucks which i wouldnt say is a bad thing if it was a good game.  I have played a bunch of card games and am a fan of mobas, so this should be the best of both worlds right, wrong!  I played the starting tutorial which didn't explain all that much at all. The game gives you a couple common level heroes and once you open your packs the game is unavailable for a refund.  In the packs i recieved duplicate of hero cards that are given to every one for free in the beginning. Did i mention you can only have 1 copy of each hero card?  So they actually have cards that noone can use in a pool of packs that people have to spend cash on which should be a crime.  so after i opened my packs i decided to sell all the duplicates i couldnt use, even at day 1  i had about 30.  for me to recieve 1 cent i had to sell them for .03 because steam takes .01 and artifact takes .01 minimum.  Since the majority of cards are common, steam and valve are going to make a killing because of the $1.00 i made i got to keep .33 cents.  Now onto gameplay, you start the game and it puts the heroes you picked in random locations in random lanes.  It prioritizes in front of the enemy but once those spots are filled then it randomly picks a spot to the immediate left or right.  Then when you attack you have a 50% chance to attack forward and if noone is there you have a chance to attack the tower or a random chance to target a neighboring enemy.  None of this is explained well in the intro either.  I encountered multiple bugs in my first 5 games.  Some heroes are rediculously overpowered so you can spend $20.00 on a card that has 7 attack 11 health and cleave and fight against a guy w a 2/8 in the base game whos ability is to come back faster after he dies.  Everytime someonething dies it gives the opponant gold which can cause a snowballing effect like in DOTA.  So, while your managing 3 lanes of randomness and feeling like every match you play is an uphill battle you never give up because there is the chance you can win because of RNG.  Every game i lost i felt like i was losing and the game i won i felt like i barely made it out alive and was stressed out.  after all of that i had 0 to show for it because unless you enter cash gauntlets you have nothing to show for all of your hard work.  That is exactly what it feels like, work.  I want to like it, i really do, but i just can't currently.  maybe after another 20 hrs of playing it will grow on me, but do i really want to spend 20 more hours on something when i have no sense of accomplishment, i dont see any reward, and it feels like work...",1543855604,1543855604,False,8,0,0.513190209865570068,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is extremely thought provoking. One of the only card games so crazy it's almost a competitive puzzle peicing.
 The overall aesthetic is INCREDIBLE. I hope they implement some way to change the board, or maybe change the lil courier creature.
 The MMR system is fair. I went from STOMPING people with any deck I made off the top of my head, to playing people I can't even read their names and I STILL win fairly consistently(3 out of 5 games). 
Money although an issue, isn't THAT big of a deal. It's more the tickets I find a fault in rather than the card packs themselves

but I Think the core problem of this game. Is if you don't have the right cards. (AXE AXE AXE, blink dagger) you can't rank games, you'll get screwed. 

I've done a few draft games. Last one I had Axe, how did I do? 5-0. Axe died 0 times. It's way to OP. That makes the game so unfun. 

It's a game where you need to use your brain big time. Sure it's a bit RNG as well but I don't mind that. 

Good game, but I wish they would give out a free pack, or a ticket ones in a while. If you are out of packs/tickets. You have to pay money for more.

-Expert Play is kinda ridiculous that you need to have a 75% winrate just to go +/- 0, so actually winning packs is only possible if you buy a powerful deck for constructed play so you are competitive or really need to get lucky in Draft. You can easily waste 10€+ for tickets in draft without ever getting new cards there.

-No Draft mode for the social play modus.

I can recommend the game if you look for a free casual Draft mode at the moment.

The game mechanics are solid(tactical depth) and is fun even with the sometimes very random nature of the game.

I really would like to see some more fair chances at earning new cards or recycling for packs instead of tickets because tickets are pretty much useless progression wise because of the low chance to win.",1543854442,1543854442,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I understand what Valve is trying to do with the monetisation of their game. They are trying to give their digital cards, physical value, making opening pack and trading a core aspect of the game - similar to what you would expect from a physical game such as Magic. 

Here's the real problem with the game.. Most card games rely on a bit of luck in the card dealing phase of the game, but It is almost always possible to come back from a cr*&&y draft and end up winning the game. 
This is where Artifact differs, the ENTIRE GAME is based on being lucky and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
Your cards are dealt to you (luck)
Your heros are assigned to random lanes (luck)
Your cards are given random positions within already random lanes (luck)

If you're interested in serious constructed formats, this game will cost you an arm and a leg. However, I find the limited format, draft, the most fun and least expensive. There are also free modes, but these don't yield any rewards (yet). With that out of the way: this game is excellent and a ton of fun. Artifact is intensely complex and has a huge amount of depth to it even with the small card pool. It is also possible to ""go infinite"", which means to play the ""paid"" modes indefinitely, without actually paying (if you're really good!)

Also: I paid $20 for the game, played a couple Keeper drafts, sold the good rares, walked away with $27 and two extra packs. Bad news: I'll probably end up spending that on Keeper drafts and tickets.

Update: 40 hours played and I'm still really enjoying the game. I'm currently sitting at about $60 in my account after winning packs and using them to play Keeper drafts and then selling the cards.

It's so full of randomness and disbalance, I can't even believe it. I mean, if it was an indie game made by some unknown rookies, sure, no problem at all. But this is a multimillion dollar company we're talking about with decades of game development experience. It's ridicuolous. Honestly, I can only see two reasons here for this: either this is a blatant cash grab or the game was simply in the development hell and nobody could do anything for some mysterious reason. 

Now, if you want some facts: 
[list]
    [*]You start with three  heroes deployed to each of three lanes. You can lose all three of them on turn 1 due to random placement and your opponent simply having more tough and powerful heroes. Which means your opponent has 15 gold advantage (which is huge), and on turn 2 you'll have 1 hero vs 4 of his. Guess what happens next.
    [*]There's a card Cheating Death which boosts a lane in such a way that there's a 50% chance that your units will not die due to a lethal damage on this lane. Yeah, you can feel true e-sports vibe already here.
    [*]There's a hero Bounty Hunter who has a 50% chance to gain +4 attack making it 11 in total, which one shots almost any other hero. Which means each turn you or your opponent will get frustrated by this passive ability depending on the outcome.
    [*]I think someone responsible for balance really liked red heroes. Because I can't imagine another reason for why there're so hilariously strong. For example, Axe has 7/2/11 (attack, armor, health), Bristleback has 8/0/12 but he gains +2 armor for each hero kill which is so convenient considering he one-shots most of the non-red heroes. For example, blue hero Prellex has 3/0/5. Or Ogre Magi - 3/0/7. And what is even funnier - most damaging spells do not penetrate armor.
    [*]If you don't know this already - you have no control over where exactly in the lane your heroes deploy or which direction they attack. There're some cards that allow you to do it, but playing these cards to fix it means you don't play something else. Or you might not even have those. Same goes for creeps - they attack in random directions.
    [*]Most cards are just modifiers like +1/2/3 attack/armor/health. Comparing to Magic: The Gathering it is so, so bland and boring. I buff +1, my opponent buffs +2, etc.
[/list]

I mean, seriously? And they advertise it like The Richard Garfield designed this game? Well, I hope at least he had some fun while doing it, because a lot of players certainly don't while playing it.

And what's most sad, this game easily could be absolutely amazing. I mean, the IDEA is great. There're three lanes of action, lots of decisions to make, lots of strategic potential. All you have to do is remove or rework randomness, balance heroes, add more interesting effects for cards, some abilities that not just modify stats, but DO SOMETHING ELSE. 

But frankly, I'm having a hard time believing any of this will be done. And there's no way this game goes big in e-sports with this balance and design philosophy in general.",1543838685,1543842060,False,8,0,0.526056826114654541,0,True,False,False

There is just zero incentive to play, zero ways to get cards outside the starting packs they give you, you are forced to play the only game with a population and that's free draft and that gets old fast, constructed is the foundation of cards games, draft popularity is more recent but not as big, and it's popularity is based online from it being best way to earn packs/coin in others online card games.

Each mode has major flaws with no overall objective or incentive to perform well or continue playing. The free Phantom Draft is so easily exploitable as each draft can immediately be scrapped and re-drafted until you have an unbeatable deck, this makes playing the 'casual' mode extremely frustrating and boring. The expert version of Phantom Draft requires entry tickets which are only obtainable through purchasing them, or sacrificing your collection of cards (20 cards for a ticket). This entry fee requires you to sacrifice any hope of constructed play without forking over additional cash. The constructed mode is a complete joke as to have any chance of winning you must invest tonnes of money to form a viable deck, with no progression (levels, ranks, MMR, anything). The gameplay becomes extremely stagnant as you verse player after player in the casual modes with more time and money than you, without any interaction at all (no emotes or forms of prestige).

There are around 300 cards in the game now and for 17.95€ you will get 2 starter decks with 54 cards and 120 random cards. This sounds good but is by no means enough to be competitive. More interesting to understand the game are time limited event decks with strong cards that introduce into different play styles. However, as the name says they may only be available from time to time.

To build you first competitive deck you will need to invest at least 5-10€. The auction house is very well implemented into the game (lock here for Diablo 4 Blizzard^^). It is a joy to use as long as you don’t think about the money. Most cards are very cheap for 4-15 cent now and prices will most likely fall. A good deck needs a minimum of 49 cards. The most expensive card “Axe – a rare red hero” was sold for 16-20€ last weekend, the second most expensive card was for 12€. That means you decks may realistically cost everything between 5-100€. Indeed, the most expensive rush deck that hit me completely unprepared was close to 90€. The game gives you a one click option to buy your opponent’s deck or to safe all the information for later analysis.

The card prices are by far not the most negative aspect of the game. Most hardcore card game players will not mind about the prices. The main problem are the entry tickets (0.95€) for competitive expert play or arena. After 3 wins you get a new entry ticket and card packs when you win more. However, it is the best way to play for experienced players because you will learn here the most and the matches are very enjoyable. The people mostly know what they are doing, and they will fight until victory or death. The free competitive play is more for tinkering around and learning the decks, but perfect runs are not difficult to accomplish for more experienced players here.

In conclusion, Artifact is a freshly new card game in a unique mooba style. The game mechanics are pay to win, but they are very good and it takes long to understand the underling mechanics. It is something for people that like to customize their decks for a unique plays style. After 30 h of play I did only encounter two decks that were similar but not identical to my cheaper dark assassination siege deck. On the other hand I did encounter quite often variations of 2 very powerful decks that were most likely copied from some website, this does not mean that they always win (after a while you know exactly what to expect and how to counter; luck plays also an important role), more dangerous are unique custom decks that can surprise.

[h1]What does this game play like?[/h1]
     In Artifact, you battle for control of three lanes, much like the game DOTA 2 that the game's heros/creatures come from. Its like playing three games of magic/hearthstone at once. Like Hearthstone, you gain 1 permanent mana at each of these lane's towers each turn. This is renewed at each turn. You can spend this mana on spells that match the color of your hero that is deployed at each lane. You get random creatures that spawn in each round for yours and the opponents three lanes. 

    After an opponent plays a card, you get to play a card. This goes back and forth until both pass their action. After this, your creatures attack whatever is directly ahead of them on the table. If a tougher creature is not going to be killed by one of your creatures, its neighbor ally will join in on the fight to ensure it dies. Finally, heros that are killed in combat or are late arrivals ( you get more heros on rounds 2 and so on), you can choose where they go to support a lane or ensure victory at an opponent's weakened tower. Heros can be equipped with items you buy with gold you get from killing heros or creeps ( creatures). This makes Heros an escalating threat throughout the game.

     Anything that is not blocked deals damage to that lane's tower. If you lose a tower, that tower reveals an ancient with 80 health, four times the amount of a tower. If you lose two lane's towers, you lose the game. If you lose an ancient, you lose the game.

[h1]What does this game do right?[/h1]
Artifact gets it right when it comes to pacing, deck building, and surprisingly, getting the cards you want.

[list]
[*] [b]Pacing - [/b] Artifact's pacing compared to Magic is much better because of the victory condition of losing two towers or one ancient. In Magic, 20 life goes by very quickly unless the game stalemates due to bad draws. Artifact's adaptation of Hearthstone's 1 mana per turn increase permanently makes the game play out nicely, so no bad hands here with no land in it or the wrong types of mana. Combine this with Artifact's victory condition, and the game allows many more comebacks and epic victories or defeats because you have more chances to change the game's direction.

[*] [b]Deck building -  [/b] Deck Building in Artifact is a breeze. You select five heros, three of which come out instantly on the board. This allows you to have a definite strategy in mind when designing your deck. Each Hero comes into your deck with its signature card, giving you a basis to build around and support. Sorting through your owned collection of cards is easy due to the filters you can apply to see only hero, creeps, spells, or items. There is also a graphical breakdown of the amount of each color in your deck, so you can eyeball if you have enough of each color to support your heros on the board. Decks are 40 cards minimum, no maximum and you must have at least 10 items. 

[*] [b]Getting the cards you want -  [/b] Unlike other digital card games out there, Artifact allows you to buy any card that other players have put up for sale. Prices are adjusted due to demand and some other factors. But to break down the price points of this - I paid 3.50 for 25 cards , some of them rares, that completed a fun blue/black creep rush deck. You are easily able to buy commons and uncommons you need for a mere .05 USD cents or a bit more for popular cards. Some cards that are highly in demand right now will go for up to 10-20 dollars. This is the norm for any card game however and should not be a fault of this game. 

[h1]Should I get Artifact?[/h1]
I believe Artifact is the logical evolution of Magic and Hearthstone. The pacing here is what Magic players will crave. The price points are perfect for a player on a budget who loves card games ( boosters are 2$ USD and you can pick up single cards for mere cents). Plenty of people are online and playing it, matchmaking is quick. Finally, the game is pretty and has a solid sound design, with heros making fun statements every now and then. Artifact gets it right across the board as far as I am concerned.",1543827699,1543828515,True,91,11,0.613638997077941895,4,True,False,False

You can definitely feel the inspiration of MtG in this game, but it has an interesting twist on the mana system: Heroes determine what sort of attribute cards can be played per lane while your towers increase your maximum mana by 1 per turn (There are cards that can modify this aspect). I didn't think the three lane system would be simple/easy to understand at first, but once you play through the tutorial levels (or watch a few rounds online), you'll quickly begin to appreciate how this system allows for more widespread gameplay and tactics based on personal preference. 

Pros:
- Intuitive laning system allows for more strategy/deck possibilities
- Market place allows for individual card trading/purchasing
- Integrated marketplace system for selling/buying cards Also allows for people to purchase individuals instead of chancing it on $2 boosters
- Card art/voice acting is top notch
- 10 packs/starter deck given to you on purchase.

Cons:
- No profile system in game yet.
- No replays in game yet.
- Selling cards should have their own Artifact currency, as exchange rates tend to chunk off profits for those selling rare cards. (debatable) 
- Tutorial levels leave more to be desired. 
- No in game chat system/communication during matches with opponent. (Might be a blessing in disguise)

First of all, the gameplay is top notch and can be intense most of the time, when different built decks collide and different players and different playstyle battle it out -  its thrilling, its intoxicating. It could be more!

But that intensity is lost when a player has a higher premium in their card collection compared to the other, so there will be times when playing a 20 to 40/50 [even 60] minutes match (which should be long, exciting and overwhelming) - its purpose as a game as a whole is completely defeated by having to surrender 2 to 5 minutes in due to monetization that can at times give an unfair starting advantage.

So you pay A$30 for starting packs and some boosters like everyone else. Cool. But I don't wanna keep buying cards that aren't tangible, so sometimes it doesn't make sense. But Valve is the developer and publisher, so they own the market and IP - reminder that Artifact needs to compete with the other Digital Card Games and their prices in order to appear reasonable to a player.

I'd advise Valve to allow the community to judge the price of a card (or a pack) and allow reward packs  - generous rewards - not that cheap, unwanted and unfulfilled reward system. 

Still, the neglect and heartache fans, communities and hobbyists have suffered throughout years since Trading Card Games were concieved is present. It will improve - many games have had poor launches in the past.

I have a heavy background in both physical (YuGiOh, Magic, Game of Thrones LCG, Keyforge) and digital (Hearthstone, Duelyst, Slay the Spire) card games, and while it may not be the strictly most mechanically complex card game I've played, it is certainly the most mentally complex and strategic. Every game, it feels like a win was earned by good play, or a loss was due to poor play. There is minimal randomness to the game compared to other digital card games like Hearthstone. Besides a few random damage and discard effects (mostly in Blue and Black), almost everything is non-random.

I can see how there may be some concerns that the game is P2W, but the initial $20 purchase is a great jumpstart to the game. I'd recommend playing with the preconstructed Call to Arms decks for a bit before moving onto casual phantom drafts. These let you learn the cards and also the drafting mode, which is my favorite. Once you get the hang of it, you can start doing expert drafts to try to get packs, or doing keeper drafts with the 10 packs you received, or others bought (I would be careful not to jump into keeper drafts right away, though - wait until you've won a couple 5-win gauntlets or phantom drafts).

I do wish the game had ways to talk to or interact with your opponent in chat, and the tournament and find-a-friend features don't seem to be fully functional (unless they're only meant for LAN situations), but overall it's an amazing game.

Review Edit: It's now on Day 5 of the game, and I've finally gotten a few 5 win runs, and have made close to 60 dollars by only playing expert draft right now...your mileage may vary though obviously.

tl;dr: Economy is actually set up really well for those who've played any other card game ever, or even recent games of almost any kind. Those complaining likely jumped right into the events without understanding game mechanics and lost all their tickets to beta players.

To address everyone complaining about the economy model: it was designed by the same guy who did a lot of Magic The Gathering, what did you really expect?

Currently by using the Steam Marketplace you can ""buy"" an event ticket for ~70-80 cents by buying 20 cheap cards and recycling them, rather than the $1.99. I wouldn't really recommend using your event tickets until you're comfortable with the game mechanics though.

In this draft mode you can play for free using casual and its just as fun. With the event tickets, your event is done after 2 losses, but you get your ticket back after 3 wins, you get a pack of cards after 4 wins, and 2 packs of cards after 5 wins. Even without a single 5 win run so far on event runs, I have ""made"" money playing Artifact so far, as I'm sitting at 21 event tickets currently (I bought cheap cards to recycle), and have sold cards out of my packs. If I hadn't ""bought"" more event tickets, I'd have 4 event tickets left and per my steam market history, I would've made $6 dollars for a game I'm thoroughly enjoying so far.

If what you want to play is constructed decks similar to normal MTG or even Hearthstone, to build a top tier super competitive deck right now on the Market would likely run about $75-100, most of which would be spent on a few big cost cards (Axe is currently running about $25 himself). I'm sure this price will go down as time goes on, because there will be more people like me essentially ""trading"" cheap cards for tickets, then using the tickets to get card packs.",1543648222,1543822636,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

thats the only point id give hearthstone over artifact, yes it costs money, but hey id rather spend $5 and buy the card i want on the market palce than spend hundred and maybe never get it on hearthstone. there also seems to be some misconception about the entry price point, you arent paying $20 for the game you are paying $20 for 10 packs, the price it costs, in otherwords you are paying for the cards you need to play the game, even if it was a free download youd need the cards to make decks so it wouldnt get you anywhere. 

dropping the business model for a while and talking about the actual game, this is the first time ive played a TCG since i picked up magic all those years ago that actually feels unique and like its doing new things, for those unfammiliar this is effectively a best of three except you play all three rounds simultaneously across three lanes, building a deck also has an interesting twist with hero cards, for those that have played commander in MTG you already know how these work, you choose 5 heroes for deck, which determine your color identity, you can only play spells in a lane if you have a hero that matches the color of that spell, mana also ticks up once per turn like hearthstone, however there is no forced cap of 10 mana. you also have a seperate deck for items, (think equipment if you are coming from MTG) instead of drawing cards from this deck you ""buy"" them with gold which you earn by either killing your opnents creeps and heroes or from certain cards. 

The game itself is fast paced and displays calculated combat damage for you at all times so that you always know exactly what will happen in the combat phase with the current board state and allows for plenty of strategy when considering weather to go all out to tkae control of a lane or if you would be better off conserving resources for another lane, there are also specific strong cards that can target any lane which allow you to get the best use of your mana in an uncontested lane.

Overall Id say artifact is a fun and unique card game with a fair business model, yes it costs money, everything worth having does. atleast if you decide to walk away froma rtifact in a few years you can sell your cards to recoup cost. goodluck getting any sort of refund partial or otherwise out of blizzard for your hearthstone account.

*As a game, not as a purchase.

The issue with trying to review a card game like this is whether the review is of the actual game or the value of the required entry fee. So in the spirit of being fair, let's review both.

[b]THE GAME[/b]

The game itself is great. It marries the gameplay of Magic with the structure of Dota... And it just works. The 3 lane board sounds complicated, but ends up adding a lot of strategy without slowing down the game. The core design works because every aspect of the game is simple to understand, but all the mechanics together make the decision making fairly complicated.

Artifact's presentation is also just nuts. Excellent animation, good art, and fully voiced lore for every card. Again, fully voiced lore on each card. Much of which is delivered from the perspective of individual heroes. The amount of flavor this adds is just fantastic. It's a joy to listen to all the cards. It's great to see a low-cost Windranger attack spell have lore read by Drow (her rival). Lore indicating that she's not good at shooting (according to Drow).

It's a great game that offers a good alternative to Hearthstone. Hearthstone's hook is that games are simple to understand and fast. That ends up being both its biggest strength and weakness, because the simplicity limits design space. Artifact probably won't replace Hearthstone, but offers a lot more decision making and counter-play over longer games.

What is left to be seen is the effect that RNG will have in Artifact's competitive scene. To be specific, RNG referring to random effects other than the inherent luck of card draw. Random effect BS nearly killed Hearthstone at a competitive level. It probably still hurts it. Artifact brings in a lot of it too, let's just hope Valve's design team knows to pull back if it becomes too much.

[b]The Entry Purchase[/b]

And here is the other aspect of reviewing Artifact. The one that is probably a thumbs down for a lot of players. The game costs 20 dollars to start. It's still essentially a F2P game, but your forced to pay out for 2 starter decks, 10 packs, and 5 tickets.

The other important thing you get access to is phantom draft. A free drafting mode where you draft from cards outside of your collection. You can play this forever and its practice mode for the real draft (where you pay in and keeps the cards, you don't keep cards in phantom draft). This was added due to outcry during the beta, since all of the competitive modes cost entry fees. And for 20 bucks, being able to play phantom draft infinitely is arguably a good value for your money.

From a card collection standpoint though, the value is barely over just buying 10 packs. Barely. It will probably leave most players unsatisfied for a couple reasons.

First, those 2 starter decks are hot garbage. If you ever played a card game back in the 90s, you'll remember starting off with starter decks and feeling like you got a jumpstart into the fun. Not here. Your starter decks consist mostly of terrible commons that you'll dupe in 10 packs. Really none of the cards here have any value because everyone has to buy the same 2 decks and that makes every card here completely worthless and pennies on the market.

The 10 packs are obviously RNG. I got Axe. Axe is Axe. He's also the most desired card of the expansion. I could cash out of Artifact and make money. Most players won't be this lucky.

So what does 10 packs and 2 starter decks get you? The inability to craft any sort of meaningful deck. The game has 4 color archetypes all heroes/spells/creeps are tied to those colors. You'll probably end up with a large spread that can't effectively do anything without buying cards to fill in gaps. Realistically, you'll need to pay in again another 10-15 bucks at minimum to get a useful deck. More if you want certain key cards with much higher power levels.

This leads to the biggest strength and weakness of the current monitization. Ranked is the only way to earn free packs. Ranked costs an entry fee ticket (these cost real money, you get 5 free). This is a gauntlet of 5 matches with the same deck that is double elimination. Winning 3-5 matches refunds your ticket and gets you a pack depending on how many wins.

The ticket cost is actually good because card games work best when something of value is on the line. Of course, you won't be winning with your starter decks. So the only way to earn free packs in-game is to spend more money on packs before wasting your tickets. 

[b]Is it worth it?[/b]

If you like CCGs, then yes. This is a good one. If you're planning on spending money on buying cards, this is a good game for it. Otherwise you have to just ask yourself if 20 dollars is worth unlimited phantom draft and the starter decks only mode. Because 20 dollars does not get you enough to play constructed in either casual or competitive. I'm loving the game so far, but the mixed reviews seems completely understandable.",1543782483,1543820994,True,2,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

having consecutive ""Annihillatie""  turns. Those card have their draw backs so it's not too bad.

-Red Heroes: Over statted units that allow you early board presence and general buffs to heroes(typically other reds) they have access to such notable cards as : Time of Triumph , Clear the deck , and cheap shot.

-Green Heroes: moderatley statted units typically with some kind of win more passive/effect that either protect/heal themself or other units, they have access to such cards as : Rumusque blessing, Mist of avernuss, Thunderhide pack Alpha

-Black Heros: stats weighted heavily for offense with a lot of single target removal , bonuses when fighting other heroes , general lane mobility and gold generation. With such notable cards as : Pick off , Gank, Payday, steam cannon.

-Blue Heros : under statted units with high value passives, big board clears, card draw, mana refresh for combos, they have the best spells in the game, such as : Annihilate, At any cost , thunderstorm, Divination , Conflaguration. and many, many more

TL:DR  Good game, good mechanics, Good balance, good engine. Low card diversity, but they've only released one set. Not a great monotization strategy but it's surprisingly easy to loop in phantom draft, though that may change once people improve at the game.

comparing to hs for example where you would farm for like 2 years for a god deck or pay 50 $ but cards there dont retain value when new expension comes out they disappear they even taken out from comp and go to wild.

now for those who cry this is not pay 2 win as everyone has to buy first of all.

and you can play phantom drafts and get new cards and use all cards all the time the game dosent make play with starter noob deck for the rest of ur life , the problem is adressed with drafts.

pros :
great animations
great gameplay
market system
drafts
you can get value out of any card in my opinion if played right.

Forget about having this as a Trading Card Game (BTW, the game is wrongly tagged as TCG by Valve once that there is no trading). This is a hole new genre that I call CCG (Credit card game).

Artifact matches take around 40 minutes to complete and the game (will) require a constant flux of money in the order of $100 – $300 a Season to be competitive. Less will give you selective cards, so it can be possible to play with less but you wont have most of the cards.

This game is NOT for you if:

* you want a game for quick plays and casual fun. A match can take as along as a DOTA 2 match.

Pros:
1) Very different playstyle than hearthstone, magic or gwent
2) Deck building is fun, and playing requires alot of strategy from card placement to buying cards 
3) No grind for cards (i guess its also a con) o
4) I like that valve listened and added a free casual mode to practice decks
5) You can spectate friends and watch the game

Cons:
1)  Assembling decks or staying competitive costs alot of money. It costs around $200 plus to completely get all the cards (not that its needed, but its kinda helpful if u switching up the decks and wanna try new playstyle). It still costs $50-100 bucks to still have a competitive deck
2) It is a paid game (yes you pay to get into the game) and it isnt rewarding enough. To get rewarded you need to pay or buy tickets (which cost real money) to play arena etc. I dont think this game will go far if it does not do anything about ways to get ticket other than recycling cards (which again requires you to buy the cards in the first place).
3) The idea you dont need every card is fine, but it is annoying because I rather be spending time playing the game thing worrying about which cards to sell or buy to make my deck and if i sell i a card am i making a mistake etc
4) The game can be unforgiving in terms of rng sometimes if the card placement early on is bad and also it just seems that it will burn you out.
5) No way to spectate games other than friends games, I would like to see the ability same as dota 2 but right not its not there

I really hope they do make other ways other than recycling to earn tickets, cap the pricing on cards as I can see pricing inflation making the game worse. I did enjoy the game, its fun and addicting, but there is too many cons at this time for me to say its long term prospect is worse than hearthstone or magic.

The game has one of the most enjoyable experiences in CCG gameplay.
Even when making a bad move that causes you to lose there is a moment of ""Ah!~"" that leaves you wanting to play again. 

I have thrown together a deck in phantom draft without any thought in the cards, (clicking at random). Won 4 Lost 2. 
Decks are only worth the effort you put into their use.  

Pros:
-Unique mechanics.
-Phantom Draft
-The rules of the game. 
-Turning points in the game always make you aware of mistakes you have made.
-Using the items you can purchase at the end of each turn to just teleport your heros back to well after baiting out your opponents cards then place them all on another lane in at the start of the next turn causing your opponent to have a bunch of cards stuck on one lane and you wipe out his guardian in 2 turns. :)


Cons: 
-Games can take a while 20-30+ depending on how the game is progressing.
-I cannot listen to an audiobook while playing if I want to win.
-""Good"" decks dont make good players.

Card games inherently have RNG via drawing cards, and it's unavoidable and not worthy of discussion. Artifact has more RNG than any other card game that I've played due to the fact that its very fundamental mechanics are built upon RNG. Heroes and creeps are deployed randomly within a lane you choose. When placed, they attack via a 50% chance to hit straight across, and a 25% chance to swing left or right. Cheating Death is the single-most complained about card when RNG is involved. What does it do? When played, each Green hero in the lane played has a 50% chance to not die to lethal damage. Coin flips on coin flips on coin flips.

Richard Garfield and Skaff Elias, two of the Artifact game designers, went through design with the mindset that cards will rarely, if ever, be changed in terms of buffs or nerfs, and that they plan to update the game and therefore the meta with new sets. The problem? The hands-off approach leads to a months-long stale meta with, in Artifact's case, cards like Axe and Drow (two cards that are *significantly* stronger than any other heroes) run rampant on those not willing to shell out the market price for the card or the money to gamble on unpacking them. 

While Valve has the final say on what happens to Artifact, i.e. they may nerf cards if met with overwhelming feedback, I don't expect much of the above to change due to how much Valve has already raked in via the market.

Hear me out, sorry for the rage.  The idea and game play is really up to preference but the way they managed the ecosystem of the cards is really really bad. 

1) It is modeled after a free to play model

Facts:
- Your cards are not worth the same value after you open it
         - After opening your cards the only worth is for you to turn 20 cards in to create a ticket
         - What is a ticket? you might ask? it is a gambling chance to get a pack
         - In Hearthstone or Shadowverse, the cards are directly marked down to 1/4 their market value
                    - However, this is done for a number of reasons:
                            1) The game is FREE TO PLAY
                            2) There is no trading
                            3) You can EARN packs
         - So the game is made in such a way where trading with your friends is required to make the best use of your pack opening and you are supposed to sell your extra cards for cash. WHICH brings me to the NEXT reason

2) it is linked to the STEAM MARKET
- THIS IS EXTREMELY BAD!!! Why you may ask? we get cash instead of dust back which we can then use for packs?!
- Firstly it is on the OPEN STEAM MARKET and not just the players of ARTIFACT. 
        - This inturn leads to a number of issues
                          1) Price flipping!! People who are not invested in the game are just increasing the price needed to let's not 
                              say compete professionally but to even ENJOY the game
                          2) Pay to Win no real need for explaination This will lower the new comer's fun of the game on an even 
                               greater level than Hearthstone or Shadowverse. Including the fact that the game is not free to play and 
                               that there are price flippers, the entry fee not just 20 USD but maybe in the hundreds range
                          3) But isn't that the same for MAGIC or any PHYSICAL card game? You might add. In my defence, the 
                               steam market is WAY too open for this game. In the real world if a person comes to you to purchase a 
                               rare card, you will be able to tell 3 things if he is a price flipper, a collector or a player. In the steam 
                               market it is all handled by algorythms and the cash is just flowing outside the game and also in to 
                               steam. 
                          4) STEAM MARKET TAKES A CUT OF THE SALES 


In other words ARTIFACT is a VERY lucrative business
They get money from MANY places and by they I mean STEAM. 
They do not protect the ARTIFACT community.

Places they get money from:
1) initial purchase
2) packs
3) tickets
4) SALE BETWEEN PLAYERS (which also includes FLIPPERS which allows them to earn more MONEY)

Things they can do to help protect players:
Close the ARTIFACT MARKET: 
DO NOT LET PEOPLE WHO DO NOT OWN THE GAME PURCHASE OR SELL CARDS
but Mr you might add why won't these flippers jsut purchase an ARTIFACT game to do so?
There you just answered your question most flippers will not do so unless the returns outweigh the risk.

Long have I been awaiting Artifact, the Dota Card game.

You will definitely have an opinion on this game's pricing model depending on whether you approach it as a card game player or a video game player; but even if you have hesitations about the pricing let it be known that there are amazing modes you can play here for free indefinitely once you've paid the base price.

Artifact isn't a copy of any other card game on the market, and its unique 3 lane system give an amazing amount of depth to all of your decisions. The constant alternating back and forth between player and opponent with each turn taken gives you agency in responding to each of their plays, and all of it is tied together with some incredible polish.

If you're a fan of card games, this game is well worthe taking the dive into. If you're not a fan of card games, both the pricing model and the games mechanics may be a bit overwhelming at first.

1) No progression at all. No account profile, rankings, history, etc etc. Really moronic. Doesn't take away from the gameplay at all, but may take away from your enjoyment of the game. It's frustrating to go on a losing streak and not have anything you're working towards

2) Getting packs for free is pretty much not going to happen. 20 cards recycle into 1 ticket, which is 1 chance at getting 1-2 packs if you win 4-5 matches before losing 2 in certain modes. Moronic, because those cards most likely sell on the marketplace where you can at least use that to then purchase cards you need. If you're an average player, you won't be making this goal and will feel frustrated and again, without account progression, question why you bother pressing launch. It feels like a vicious cycle that you have no other option but to spend more money into an already $20 game. Players arent expecting insane amount of handouts, but being able to some extent grow your collection naturally even through lengthy goals would give great incentive and quell the freaking out

Great game at its core, that is overshadowed by quick launch missing core features of a ""live game"" with a questionable monetization behind it.

However, the game plays very well, the mechanics are well thought out and fun to play, even against the bots.

People complaining about ""P2W"" and the ""predatory monetization"" obviously have not played a TCG before. Why should you expect to receive all of the cards for free? If you look at Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon TCG and others, the prices here are very fair. The game is setup in such a way that you can play for free through casual play (this includes preconstructed decks and the most popular, Drafts), or if you want to play competetive constructed, then yes, you will have to buy packs or single cards, just like in any other TCG.
The difference here is, due to the ease of selling cards on the market, you can build a decent deck for just a few $/£. The only expensive cards are a handful of heroes and spells that, while good, are by no means necessary to winning. 

It's fine to be put off by the ingame purchasing of cards, but I'd say its wrong to score the game down based on that fact alone. I wouldnt expect to walk into a game store and demand a full set of Magic cards for £15, so what makes this game different? The game has potential to be a serious competitor to some of the physical TCGs out there, and I say give it a chance before jumping on the ""P2W"" hate that's going around.

The three lane dynamic really adds depth and forces you to process more information  to be successful. I've played ~40 hours so far and I'm frequently face-palming with some of the mistakes I do. 

You can trade cards on the market which is great. You can buy what you want and don't have to RNG open hundreds of packs if you don't want to. You can also sell rare cards you get but don't plan on using. If you check card prices most cards are below $0.20. Top tier decks you buy outright are ~$100. In other card games this goes well over $200.

Being a Dota fan, I have a much higher appreciation of the heroes/items/spells etc and it adds more enjoyment for me.

The pacing feels good. You will feel rushed when you start out but once you familiarize yourself with mechanics and basic strategy, you will have plenty of time.

The fact that it emulates dota and has three different boards/lanes to fight over does not make this game feel any different than Hearthstone, or any of the other dozen CCGs out there, it just feels like a gimmic meant to slow the game down.This may be partially due to the fact that every board change is acompanied by an unessisary animation done by the two helper imps... 

One of the major mechanics is that you choose 5 heroes, in 4 colors depending on the playstyle. Blue = Magic, black = removal, red = aggro, green = defensive. When a hero dies it automatically gets resurrected a turn later. Not only is that color association overdone, it feels completely un-nessisary, but that's not the worst part of the hero system. In order to cast ANYTHING in a lane you need to have a hero with a matching color there; This is one of the clunkiest, worst feeling mechanics I've experienced in a CCG, it means that if your oppoenent manages to hulk a guy out or has removal, you can do NOTHING in lane.

When someone is dominating a lane their opponent litterally cannot fight back. This plays as bad as it sounds.

I can see what Valve were going for, something strategic, but rather then a methodical play / counter play most of the games I've played have been one side snowballing on powerful cards and the other side not having enough ways to counter.

The worst part for me is the game just doesn't feel fun. It feels like the game was designed for compeditive play, Valve wrapped it in a public friendly IP, but only enough to draw people in. The current game modes feel like they're for people to practice and refine decks, they're not for two friends to sit down and play casually.

1.) Im a very critical person when it comes to video games. Especially with so many simillar games already out.
2.) Monetization is normal for a game like this. Literally any card game (IRL) costs money guys, so cut the crap.

Going into Artifiact i was pretty skeptical after the widely negative response following its intial unveiling. 
However despite the card game genre being numerous in number, Artifact actually stands out pretty well.

Pros
1. Wide range of playstyles
2. Outside the box card game unique mechanincs.. feels like a game of DOTA
3. in game card tradeing and selling made easier then ever with the steam market ""go figure""
4. Intensive play that can have you on edge, card play after card play
5. Able to examine opponents decks to alter or copy them for yourself ""assuming you have the cards""


Cons
1. Only 1 type of card ""pack"" you can actually buy right now. It contains cards for every color and use, so you cant yet open specific colors of cards like a booster pack.
2. ""Expert Phantom Draft"" one of the more fun game modes to play, is SEVERLY unbalanced because you can use up to 5 of the same hero, so stay away from this mode if you want to actually have a chance to win some card packs.
3. While casual mode is very fun, players can leave the moment they are disatisfied. (Not a big deal)

The game was designed in a really interesting way.

Unfortunately there is a lot misinformation being spread around by Heartstone and Half-Life fans.
Artifact is actually a lot cheaper than other online CCG/TCGs in the market while also not requiring you to do a horrible grind like in games such as Hearthstone.
For only a few bucks you can get your deck since most cards by far are only 5 cents with barely any expensive cards.
You do not have to buy packs but if you were then every pack costs 2$ for 12 cards and every pack has a guaranteed Rare and Rare is this game's highest rarity. It's like if you were always getting a guaranteed legendary in every HS pack.

Most people seem to prefer Artifact's draft mode to constructed. I also really love draft which is the opposite than other online card games I played where Arena is incredibly boring and it is all about constructed.
Artifact offers completely free draft with no ingame or RL money required to participate in which means that you essentially get access to the entire card library for no additional cost. That is an insane deal and easily beats whatever these other CCGs have to offer.

About 30 hours into the game and I haven't spent money on it yet but I'll probably just buy a deck for a few dollars.
However I do not feel like I need to spend more money because of how good draft is and had a blast hosting some draft tournaments with my friends.

Short Answer: I hightly recommend this game for 3 reasons:
- Very enjoyable game full of complex decisions on every turn
- The free casual phantom draft is awesome and makes every game unique
- The free preconstructed gauntlet is a great way to learn different cards and play a quick game when you don't have time to draft

Pros:
- I have tried numerous CCG's (Hearthstone, Gwent, Duelyst, Faeria, Eternal, etc.).  Artifact is the one I have found most enjoyable thus far.  Every turn is full of complex decisions: which heroes to place in which lanes, which cards to play where, do I let someone die so I can reposition in 2 turns of use my one item to keep it alive possibly sacrificing a later hero, etc.  
I believe this level of decision making coupled with the free draft system will keep me coming back to this game for countless hours of enjoyment even if I never spend anything beyond the initial purchase.
- The free draft system is wonderful.  This system allows me to experiment with drafting many different decks and seeing how they hold up without any financial costs.  I am thus encouraged to try strategies I normally wouldn't pursue which has led to some very enjoyable wins (and humiluating defeats).
- The preconstructed Call to Arms decks are a great way to learn about the cards and strengths/weaknesses of different colors to prepare for drafting.

Cons:
- The game takes longer to play than many other card games.  This is partially caused by the benefit above of many complex decisions for both players which take time to digest.  However, it also means I can't play a quick game in 5-10 minutes.
- It is not always clear what is happening with some of the cards/effects which can make it more difficult to learn.
- There is no way to earn free cards/packs.  However, while this is a con, I enjoy the fact that I don't feel any pressure to play every day or go after a daily objective.  I just play for fun whenever I feel like it in the format of my choice.

Overall, I think that Valve has created a great foundation for a game I will enjoy for countless hours to come and am excited to see where it goes in the future.",1543787445,1543787445,True,1,0,0.498761951923370361,0,True,False,False

Get decent enough at the game it looks like you'll just be able to get more cards that way. 3 wins in expert phantom draft breaks even (4 = 1 pack 5 = 2 packs).

Beyond the initial purchase price, there is no need to spend money ever again and play competitively in much of the games varied modes.

Constructed decks, what pay to win is referring to, are a very minor part of the game and in any TCG where cards can be traded between players will remain “pay to win” as long as individuals are willing to shell out hundreds, and in some TCGs thousands of dollars to build gimmick decks design to be nearly undefeatable.

Casual Drafts and Preconstructed Gauntlet (themed events) offer unlimited replay and are where true “skill” and knowledge of the overall card system come into play. In order to do well in drafts, you must do more than just swiping a credit card to build a gimmick deck.

Even though it isn't free it really isn't that expensive to play and getting individual packs is pretty cheap on top of that most cards are cheap to buy as singles with only a select ammount of cards being moderately expensive at the time of writing. (Axe is like 20 bucks, who happens to be the most expensive card). I've had other friends try the game out too and they all agree that the game play is excellent. However it does have it's drawbacks at the moment. 

Obviusly the competitive modes require tickets to play however there is casual versions of those same modes so it really doesn't hurt that badly. There is no ranked ladder yet and no way to tell ur mmr, match history etc etc. however its been said that around december 14 some new content will come out. 

Another annoying thing is that while the custom tournament mode is very VERY FLEXIBLE in doing things how you like it, it requires a mininum or 4 players instead of a mininum of 3 players to do a round robin. There seems to be some optimization issues for slower PC's which knowing valve will get fixed at some point. 

The market it self is not bad though, as previously mentioned most stuff are cheap and it does have the option to only search for stuff that is unowned so you can buy the whole collection if your someone who likes to collect, it also lets you search for cards you have in excess and you can just sell it in bulk. One of my friends who only had the base game with the 10 packs made like 15 bucks or something off sell option and got stuff for other games using that money. 

As for the meta state, there is a few problem cards that are locked behind the rarity, as mentioned before AXE is the most expensive due to how strong his stats are and his card, and drow ranger are two that come to mind, she has too strong of an effect with too strong of a spell card. Also since release day it seems that allot of people have been spamming red black decks due to how aggressive that colour combo is in the early turns which nets a gold lead. Thus it seems that if you wana try hard you got to run red green or red black. At least for now of course you don't have to meta slave but these are things to be aware of.

Despite this most matches I've played have felt close, occasionally some games are too stompy but u can tell early on to be honest. The big thing to really understanding this game is that its basically a TCG you play online it isn't a CCG view it as playing magic or yugioh or final fantasy not as another hearthstone.

Filled with so many mechanics, plenty of which are filled with RNG. Yes, maybe if you're in top 1% best players, you can nullify some of RNG by good plays, but the majority will get screwed by it in most games. Hero placement - RNG, minion placement - RNG, items in shop - RNG, lot of cards - RNG. Games feel like you just play ranom cards you happen to have mana for, that don't do much in most cases, because you got fucked by RNG. 
 Then there's monetization. One would think, you can get a decent deck by paying initial price. LOL, not here. But why would you need a deck anyway, if most people don't even play constructed, because it's boring and pretty fucking bad. I guess, if you have game so filled with RNG, you can just go all the way in by making draft modes the best way to play.
 There's one plus for this monetization model - you can make some steam bucks by selling cards you got from initial packs... but you probably won't, unless you were lucky to get some of the top priced cards. And if you buy the game and don't like it, you better fucking pray you get those cards to sell them, because guess what... Valve won't refund you, even if you didn't use tickets or opened the packs that come with the game.

Almost every time I've lost I can look back at a specific moment and see where playing differently may have won me the game. The draft mode is excellent, and it can also be played for free.

I was initially concerned about the monetization when it was announced but I've been pleasently surprised. As a long time Hearthstone player who spent Way Too Much Money On Packs as a teenager and later grinded gold on a F2P account, I think I genuinely prefer this game's open market to the standard closed digital TCG structure. Already you can build the majority of a deck very cheaply, and once the bubble on the meta rares pops then the price to construct a ""tier 1"" deck will most likely be around £25, with many cards being usable in several decks. This is cheaper than dumping £50 in to Hearthstone packs and hoping you'll get most of the cards you need and enough dust left over for the rest, and in that sense it feels less predatory. In the same vein, the cost to make a tournament ready deck is already much lower than MtG, whos decks often cost several hundreds of pounds to put together. Still, the £15~ entry fee is a barrier to players who want to try out the game, even if you get more than £15 worth of packs and tickets out of it.

Outside of the gameplay, there's some stuff that Valve need to work on. It'd be nice to have a robust profile system with stats and replays, as well as a ranked system for constructed and maybe even draft. Valve has publically stated that a ""progression system"" is their top priority post-launch, and there's a lot of beta features that were taken out at the last moment like chat and emotes, so it's reasonable to assume that the game is going to be getting these in updates over the next few months.

As a longtime Dota and TCG player, I can't really stress how much this game impressed me. There were many, many points since release where there was cause for concern about the quality of the game and the integrity of monetization, but I'm overwhelmingly pleased that Artifact isn't lacking in either of those fields.

- The full set costs around 250-300 euros. Most of this value is in the playsets of the few good cards of every colour. Now, I'd be more willing to pay this if Valve didn't tax the shit out of cards on the marketplace. The taxes (and release of new sets and time) lead into cards not retaining their value, and therefore I cannot justify the several hundred euros as some sort of an investment. 

- The game lacks balance and is full of heavy RNG-mechanics. Now, these could be fixed by balance updates. Which Valve has claimed to avoid as long as possible, maybe to mimic the real-life TCGs more and to make cards preserve their values (which they already do not). If they change their mind and manage to do balance updates (and hopefully card reworks for stuff like Cheating Death), I'll come change this review into a positive one and maybe throw some more money on the screen. Balancing a digital game around new releases, while leaving the previous content into unplayable state is just lazy and greedy design.

Really like how planning ahead and figuring out which lanes to play your cards in makes a difference.  I had played MTG in the mid-90's and Hearthstone for a bit.

I have played Draft (Casual and expert) as well as constructed (Casual only).  Draft sets a nice even playing field regardless of how much money you have spent on the game (have done well so far in draft 3 wins or more each time).  For constructed my deck (built out of 20 packs of cards) has been able to get me about break even (so would need to buy some cards to be competitive).  That being said you can play draft mode for free once you buy the game.

As for the Market and pricing It provides a good opportunity to build a deck at a relatively cheap price, but you do have to pay.  Since there is no free grind constructed is probably not for people who don't want to put money in but casual and draft modes are great.

TLDR: Great strategic depth. Draft modes is great and you can play that forever once you buy the game.  Constructed beyond playing with friends is probably just for people who want to pay money.  Get the game if you like Card games, but don't get it if you want to build a collection for free.

So far I'm enjoying the game a lot.  The feel, artwork, sound, lore etc I all like.  I have seen, however, a lot of negativity regarding the monetisation.  To me it seems reasonable given that the marketplace makes acquiring the cards you want less rng.  The only thing I dont like is that currently there is no progression when you dont spend anything.  I use the word currently though as Valve have mentioned they intend on adding a progression system.  So we'll see.  I think a lot of the negativity is down to players being loyal to other card games and maybe they are unwilling to admit even to themselves that they are reluctant to switch card games yet again.  Which is understandable givin that you can spend a lot of money on them and form a commitment.  If thats true coming up with excuses is pretty lame, and thats exactly what it seems like to me in some cases...

You can play for free after the initial purchase, and that includes constructed and drafting with no rewards.  If you have a specific deck in mind for expert constructed(entry price with rewards based on the amount of wins), it shouldnt cost too much extra with the marketplace.

Like everybody says, the game itself is great, brilliantly designed (like every Valve game) with endless possibilities for high-level play, much like Dota 2. They have marketed this game to fans of Dota 2, announcing it at last years International, but have gone for the total opposite monetisation model.
You pay for the game, you pay for the content, and there are paid modes with no way of entering without paying more still. There is also no direct card trading, only selling and buying on the market, where the GabeTax™ can slowly whittle away any extra cash you may put in.

There is no progression system whatsoever. No stats, no ladder, no cosmetics to earn (although you can be sure when cosmetics come to the game they will be far from free...), no levelling, and no incentive to keep playing at all.

Valve these days seem to be only interested in making games that print massive amounts of continued money, and seeing if they can get away with providing nothing else to players but more ways to spend more money on more random rewards. TF2, CS:GO, Dota 2 and now Artifact are the only games Valve are visibily working on, and they are ALL fueled by some form gambling. To me, it seems clear where Valve's interests truly are. I have never seen a company fall so out of touch with its own audience as Valve. They only see the money now, they don't hear you.

Now I'm certain Valve will improve the game, correct some issues and make it much more enjoyable, but they could have done all of this BEFORE and released a complete and satisfying game for ALL players on release, not just the ones okay with spending more money. Valve have made many stellar games and this is their first ""full"" new game in over 5 years, they should be held to a higher standard than most, and they've failed to even reach par.

If you're okay with enjoying the game just for itself without any real progression other than owning (see: buying) more cards, go ahead, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, and this release should now ALWAYS be held over Valve's head.

EA Games once made a RTS 3d card game called battleforge, which was f2p but with the same idea as artifact; cards would only be obtainable by paid boosters, with no way out of the starter decks. Artifact is poised to be in the same position.

For the initial cost, it does give you a great deal because it allows you to: 
-play the ""call to arms"" preconstructed mode
-free constructed 
-free phantom draft 
-bots matches
-play against friends 
-enter into any public tournament

If you're trying to build specific decks without trying to gamble by opening packs to find the card you need, or scrapping/dusting the cards to make what you want, then the Steam Market works really well to lower costs to create decks you want. Being able to sell extra cards for steam balance helps to lower some of the costs for the game as well. The only option in a f2p game is to dust/scrap them. Thanks to the market, buying semi-compeitive decks will cost $5-10 to make that are able to win plenty of games against even the most expensive decks if played out well.

I have mixed feelings on their ""expert"" modes because it seems to just be gambling to try to win more than what you put it. They are the same exact format to the constructed and phantom draft but with a chance to win packs plus your ticket back. It's like playing high stakes poker versus playing poker with your friends with play money. It depends on what people are looking to get invovled with.

In addition, they could have added a few ways to gain packs or tickets for free through ways like a ladder, progression system, or even by winning 5 games in the free modes. It would give people something to set a goal for. Valve currently has the option to recycle 20 cards for one ticket, which is great, but it still costs some sort of money to get the cards. 

The gameplay is very fun though. It is a very unique game that themes well with how Dota plays out. Having to manage three lanes at once adds another layer of depth that gives people more thought. I think there is a lot to learn with this game. However, it's a fairly simple game to start picking up because the interface is very descriptive of everything you're doing, it calculates damage being done, and allows to see where damage is coming from. etc. 

Overall, even with my mixed feelings on Valve's approach to monetizing the game, the gameplay is very fun with a low cost if you don't mind trying to be highly competitive or gamble at any of the ""expert"" modes. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay out of the intitial cost and a few common/uncommon decks. For anyone deeply into draft modes, the free draft mode alone could have endless hours of gameplay. No one is saying that you have to go and buy all of the cards because there is a lot of fun within the game at a much lower cost than it may seem.",1543770383,1543770567,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Once you have opened your 10 packs to find a mish mosh of cards that you may be able to turn into a sub-par deck, or one of the 2 pre-made decks, that you can take into constructed with your 5 provided tickets. Once you quickly find that your sub-par deck is just that, or that most people are running decks that do well against the pre-mades, you'll move to draft. Being that you are new to the game, you can't quite be sure what consitutes a good deck, so you take the ""best"" cards you can, just to find that you're ideas of good were not as good as you though.

Out of packs and tickets, you are left with a few choices:

1. Spend money. The easiest option. Just buy more cards/tickets. Sooner or later you'll get the great cards you see others with. This is the best way to fix your issue, but most people report spending $300+ and still not getting enough to make the top tier decks.

2. Sell/buy cards on the Marketplace. The open market is a great place to round out your deck. But, if you don't want to spend your money, you have to sell cards first. The next issue rears it's head. If you are trying to sell something that isn't a top tier rare, you are averaging .01-.06 with small spikes in the middle. For compairison sake, I sold all my cards when I backed out of the game. Sans the Axe that I got (~18.50), all my cards combine sold for $5.57 USD. This is not sustainable for someone looking to spend as little as possible.

3. Modify cards into tickets. You could take 10 of your worst cards or your duplicates and turn them into event tickets. This is a great use for duplicates if you don't want to sell them on the market. IMO, this is the only viable option for sustaining a F2P mindset in this game. But, you fall into the hands of Lady Luck once again, since if you lose that ticket in the same way as before, you will need to start canibalizing your decks.

4. Accept your fate. If you don't want to do any of the above solutions, then enjoy casual and social play. There is no in game progression system that can help sustain a F2P mindset. Just some casual modes that yeild no real value other than playing the game.

This brings me to my point. Artifact isn't a F2P game. You bought it. There is no option to play for free. So, why do we expect it. Because pay to play doesn't work in a digital card game.

In a physical card game, there are many ways other than packs for a casual player to get cards that are not as ""throw you to the sharks"" as Arftifact. Trying to make a deck out of the cards given is a near-impossible task, placing you up against your lack of knowledge and the lack of a knowledge base to try and figure out what consitutes a good game. ""Is it better to lean in on one win condition?"" ""Should I go mono-color or mix in others?"" ""Can I do a 3 color deck?"" ""How do these mechanics interact?"" Nothing is learned easily. 

Moreover, I feel no need to keep playing. I'm in no way incentivised to continue playing casual modes with my bad decks. Nothing about playing these bad decks is going to make me better. Nothing about playing these bad decks is going to improve my winning odds. All that happens is I get matched against much better (and more expensive) decks. Any idea of finding a playstyle that works for me is gone. I'm expected to either play one of the two easily counterable pre-made decks, or flounder while you try and learn the game with your own bad deck.

This is going to be a game for the highfalutin gamers. Those with cash to burn. Without a sustainable reward system, I don't see this game setting the world on fire.",1543756298,1543768668,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a few drawbacks though which I feel limits the audience and hopefully get addressed in the future:

1. you can't trade or gift cards to friends. 
I understand that this is the case to prevent side monetizion of gambling sides but for me this is a key motivation to get my friends into the game.

2. No help in building a deck
Deck building is quite difficult. Ofc that's half of what makes you a good player but the game itself doesn't help you much with it. Of course you buy the missing cards for one of the 5 pre-authored decks but that can be up to ~$30 depending on your initial booster packs which come with the game.

For me th gameplay itself so far makes up for these two and I see the latter point being addressed by fan sites using the Web-API of th game but the first really is a pity.

MtG is a damn good game that inevitably rewards spending money, but it's about your skill.

and sorry, but breaking the game up in 3 parts, while cutting down the positioning and timing, isn't adding anything. it's just hiding how limited the game is compared to MtG

more often than not, the game decides if you win or not(!), since blocking is based on luck not strategy when the game decides that your randomly spawned cards are aiming at an angle, or your placed cards are opposed at an angle.

What a lot of these ignorant critics don't understand is that this is more of an online TCG rather than a CCG, like Hearthstone or MTG Arena. Meaning that, like an actual card game, you have to buy the cards and packs you want with real money, or simply trade them... which you can't do... Thats right. You can't trade.

Why have a game where in game purchases are necessary, but you wall off potential buyers with a price tag on the game itself?

After buying the the game (20 bucks because its the cost for 10 packs you get from buying the game.) you have to spend $0.00 (and still have access to all the cards) as long as you play against bots or stay in the casual que. (draft and comp decks.) 

if you go into expert play (before opening your first 10 decks) if your good enough you never have to spend any money to keep going. playing keeper draft, you give up 5 decks, keep all the cards you draft (if u see axe you take him, that will pay for 10 decks) if you win 3 matches you get 2 tickets and a deck, if u win 4 2 and 2 decks, 5 wins 2 tickets and 3 decks. dont open the decks, sell the rares you get to buy more decks, keep playing keeper draft for an infinte loop while building your collection to sell or keep. if your good enough...

In the end the fact you can trade cards with others makes this model better than the RNG of other card games. you know how much you will have to spend, then debate in your mind if you should just buy the card or go RNG and buy a deck.

Constructed in artifact is not the only way to play the game! A great example was the first tournament hosted where they chose to use Draft as the mode of choice (in my opinion it is a very good competitive mode).
In general you don't actually need to open packs at all to have a nice experience in the game. The draft mode (casual or expert) is very fun and the expert version only costs 1 ticket which is 0.9 € or just buy 20 random cards (20*0.4 = 0.8 €). 

What do you start with: 
10 packs with each 12 cards and including atleast 1 uncommon. If you are lucky (like I was) you get one of the top priced cards like drow ranger and simply sell them. In total I managed to get 19 € (~24 draft runs) so I actually gained steam currency. If you are one of the very unlucky people you might end up with all your cards being at the lowest price (0.04 €) which you could simply convert into draft tickets (120 cards -> 6 tickets). 

In summary even the most unlucky person will start with 11 tickets. How long you managed to keep playing the expert mode until you managed to not reach 3 wins (11*) times is up to your own skill (the draft system is imo not as luck based as the HS arena). Additionally every run with more than 3 wins is very likely going to give you another ticket on top!

[i] *this number depends on your initial pack openings (luck) and your skill (more than 3 wins) [/i]

Furthermore you can play all the modes which do not require tickets or your own cards as the above mentioned casual version of phantom draft or the event mode call to arms preconstructed. The only downside of not having cards (other than not being able to play constructed duhh) is that there is currently no option to challenge friends with the draft mode (currently you have to host a tournament with at least 4 people). Therefore playing 1v1 with a friend might get boring after some time as you can only play the 2 starter decks or the one of the 6 event decks. 

I realize that there are people who are diehard fans of constructed and for these people this game might get expensive depending on your personal skill and the ability to grind with phantom draft or not. The amount of money you will need to follow the meta is hard to determine as this highly depends on the dynamics of the market place, your skill and the time you can invest. Additionally for future players this business model will be fairer than the one used in HS considering because it is very likely that older cards are going to be less expensive. Also new players will have the opportunity to buy the cards they want.

Overall I'd recommend people with low budget to simply stick to the draft modes, play tournaments with friends and avoid going for constructed.",1543694450,1543759952,True,8,0,0.418002486228942871,0,True,False,False

Yes, rare cards are powerful. And Yes, they are somewhat valueable.
This is a model familiar to anyone who’s played MTG or whatever TCGs, buy boxes or boosters when new expac hits or wait for resellers. And you don't need 4 dupes of rares or mythic rares like in MTG. Prices are going to drop soon.
$20 tag for 10 boosters and starters is reasonable to me though.

I have also spent thousands of hours playing Hearthstone, ESL, Eternal, and MTG: Arena now. Overall, I will say this game deserves a chance. However, I believe there need to be a few changes to open this up to a wider audience. While I below have more positives than negatives, the one negative I have is an substantial negative. Do I recommend this game? Of course! However, I believe we as a community need to voice our opinions about the game and make sure Valve understands that this game could be the best CCG, with a few minor tweaks. 

+Pros
- One of the best feeling CCG's I have ever played. 
- A great new mechanic when it comes to the ""Lanes"" to give it the DOTA / MOBA feel
- Great visuals and audio. The interactions with the cards and the soundtrack are great!
- A great mix of a variety of CCG's elements (MTG, Hearthstone, and ESL). 
- The variety of play styles (Casual, BOT's for training, Tournament mode, Competitive modes) are amazing! 
- The overall UI and smoothness of this game show's there was a lot of passion and dedication put into this project.
- It may be me, but I this game as an easy to learn difficult to master. Though, I have been playing CCG / TCG's for a long time.

+Cons
- There is no way to ""grind"" or a complete FTP model for this game. The reason I mark this as a negative is for simple reason is that not everyone has the capital to play this game, thus lowering the amount of players. Having the capital to buy every card doesn't make you a good player, excluding potentially amazing players from playing this game. Every other CCG (Hearthstone, MTG: Arena, Eternal, ESL), all have this. With the release of MTG: Arena very close to this one, it could push people away completely. The $20 entry fee I don't mind but, it could be used as a ""bundle"" to buy and TONS of people would still buy it.

As for the monetization, the game gives you a ton of cards, and being able to buy and sell them directly makes building budget decks pretty cheap / easy. For the asking price of $20, I was able to build a budget deck owning almost none of the cards, and a more expensive deck based on some of the rarer cards I got from the starting packs. Both were rated very highly on the deckbuilding site I looked at.

If you're willing to sell some of the rarer cards you get that you don't plan on using, you can easily make at least a deck or two without spending any extra money on the game. If that's good enough for you, then I highly recomment the game. It's worth noting, I've played other CCG's exclusively as a F2P player, and was never able to scrounge up the resources for a somewhat competetive deck.

The three lanes and the amount of RNG make each game feel very different - being able to react to changing conditions through tactical decision making is significantly more important than in other card games i've played. Deckbuilding is important but less so than in other card games. I think it will take a long time before this starts to feel repetetive. I love that they've solved the problem of mana screw in a straightforward and thematic way but in a way that leaves for more exciting decision making than something like HS. And i think more than in any other card game i've seen, a very strong player with a very weak deck could easily defeat a weaker player with a stronger deck, due to the high skill ceiling created by the interaction of the RNG and the laning and hero deployment mechanics.

I love the thematic and mechanical parallels to dota2 - they've really captured the spirit and some of the strategy in that game here in Artifact, in a lot of suprising and wonderful ways. The overall balance of the game and the cards seems more or less fine so far in my amateur opinion, and i'm excited to try out a bunch of different decks with different color and hero combinations.

The production quality is top-notch. Incredible UI and sound design. The quality-of-life features in the drafting, deckbuilding, and collection interfaces is unheard of. building and sharing decks is incredibly streamlined.

That being said, the game is missing a few things i would expect from a modern competitive game... (optional) chat, competetitive ladders, a replay system, etc.. I'm confident that these will come eventually, so it's not a big deal.

A lot of people used to other digital CCGs are complaining about the monetization model. I was skeptical at first, but i believe valve has done this right. The unlimited free ('phantom') drafting is worth the price on its own. In addition, i immediately bought all of the common cards and some of the better uncommon cards for less than $5 total - more than enough for a lot of deckbuilding and dynamic play, especially among friends or in the 'Pauper"" (commons only) community.

I understand that due to exchange rates, this game is prohibitively expensive in other countires, and that's too bad. I hope valve figures out a way to address this to make the game more afforable outside of the US, without undermining the stability of the card market (no small feat, i would imagine).",1543757242,1543757242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] What is Artifact ? [/h1]

Artifact to me is a refreshing tcg, easy to play, hard to master.
I'll be keeping the 'is it p2w or not' reasoning for last.

For the € 17.95 you get 10 boosters and 5 tickets.
Those 10 boosters is what you'll have to struggle with to make your decks to play constructed.
The boosters are very generous though, 1 guaranteed rare, 3 uncommons, and 6 commons.
In total you receive 96 cards. Of those, to make a playable deck, you need 5 heroes, wich automatically bring 3 signature cards each.
so besides those 5 heroes you get from boosters, you only need 25 more cards to make a deck, plus 9 more to make an item deck.
Considering all this, the free packs they give you is quite generous.

I would suggest testing out different kinds of decks, either by making decks with the cards you own, or playing the [u][b] Free[/b][/u] Phantom draft.
Once you get the hang of things, you can sell the cards you wont use, to try to make the best deck you possibly can.

You get 5 tickets to play 'expert constructed' , wich pits you against other players with their constructed deck.
Once you lose twice, you're out of the running. If you win 3 times however, you get your ticket back. Win a 4th time and you get a booster, win a 5th time and you get another booster ! 

Rinse and repeat, sell the cards you dont need, improve your deck, if you're good enough you can just sell the cards to buy other games ! 

Now I can see where people are complaining about the ""hurr durr p2w game"" part.
Axe is one of the strongest heroes atm, and also the most expensive card ( around €19 atm). Now if you just play a deck with phantom assassin (wich costs like €0.50 ?), you get the signature card wich just literally destroys a hero.

[b][u] TL;DR [/u][/b]

People who complain about the game being p2w, havent spent enough time exploring the game and just expect free stuff from launching the game daily. 

[b][u]For the casual player:[/u][/b] this game is great fun to play against friends, alot of fun mechanics you can build decks around. you wont get too many cards though if you're not committed to spend hours on crafting your deck, finetuning it and winning boosters with your tickets.

[u][b]For the more dedicated player:[/b][/u] This is a great TCG, you will spend HOURS upon HOURS trying out new decks with all the fun mechanics they offer you to build around. highly recommend it for any fan of the TCG's out there.",1543754727,1543755199,True,4,0,0.549188137054443359,0,True,False,False
583950,47255599,76561198044322521,0,4,6120,0,2841,1548185380,"The thing I've noticed about reviews being written about the game is that there are 2 types of reviews: Either the person is complaining about the monetization model or they are loving it. 
This is because group A comes from the gaming world where f2p is a thing and people are dissapointed they think they won't be able to play Artifact. However, this is simply not true, you can play any mode in the game for free without paying an extra buck. There's a preconstructed event and there is free drafting. The thing f2p players won't be able to do is build a collection.
Group B comes from the cardgaming world of things like MTG, HS, Yugioh etc etc and they all think: OMG this game is so cheap yet so competitivly viable. (which they are, imo, right about (the competitive viability that is). This is an entirely different mindset.

Consensus: Both groups WANT to play Artifact, but some have a budget available which makes them able to play every aspect of the game and others don't have that budget. Expensive is different for each person and each person individually has to make up their mind whether they want to invest into the game or not. 
Personal opinion: We, as gamers, are not entitled to be able to play anything we want for no cost just the same as you don't feel entitled to having a Lamborghini because you bought a Renault Clio. But you can still get your mileage out of your Clio, which brings me to the part that I don't see referenced in enough reviews:

This game is simply amazing. Very complex, multiple layers of strategy, very smooth gameplay (as opposed to getting landscrewed in MTG...). There's also a huge amount of game modes and possibilities and a very active community (allthough the community currently seems a bit split up between different hubs all over the internet)
I have honestly never played a CCG before (and I've played quite a few over the years, MTG, HS, Eternal, Gwent) that gave me the same amount of hype when I win a game. Every game seems close and you can't just randomly sling cards at the board, you actually need to think your moves through preferably one or multiple turns ahead.
The satisfaction that comes from seeing that outplay you just figured out come into fruition is simply extatic.

To anyone doubting to try it out due to the reviews about the monetization model: just give it a go, the initial box cost isn't expensive and will get you many hours of fun and maybe after those you'll feel like you want to invest into a card collection, or maybe not, but you'll still have had many hours of fun for very few $.
The best way to learn the game anyway is through either the f2p Preconstructed mode or through free phantom draft mode so if you are like me and you expect a 1$/1hr played ratio from games, Artifact will very easily deliver that for it's original box cost and beyond that, everything is up to you!

You won't gain any card for your constructed decks except if you pay money on top of the initial price of the game. There are ""free"" content though, in the name of draft modes. I will now focus on these modes for the rest of the review.

Crafting the decks sure is funny and requires some skills. But even if you come out with an interesting deck, most outcomes of games completely rely on the RNG.  Indeed, on turn 1, your heroes and creeps are placed randomly on the board, and depending on how the RNG goes, your heroes or your opponent's ones might die on 1st turn. This results in an incredible snowball because the 1st round winner will get coins, and thus be able to buy items to keep making good trades, while the 1st round loser won't be able to play cards for at least a turn in the selected area.

Besides that fact, you will not get a competetive deck in heartstone without spending money og several hours grinding every day, and once you grinded enough the meta prob already changed and you have to get a new deck.

Infact Artifact is one of the cheaper card games because of the market system which allows you to buy specific cards you actually need and not rely on luck like in other games... heartstone..

That said, don't buy it. It's a mess currently. The amount of RNG in this game is staggering, it makes Hearthstone look like a good game. Now if you play TCGs you'll know that managing RNG from draws and resources is par for the course. It's literally the bread and butter of deck construction. Minimizing bad outcomes and maximizing good ones. However this game has 4 layers of RNG, all of which work against eachother to make preparing a winning boardstate almost entirely a matter of chance and very little skill.

The 4 layers of RNG are 

Your spell deck
Your Item deck
Your lane placements
Your arrow placements

How do we prevent ourselves from being fucked in other games? Well we build a good deck with a good resource curve and a win condition, then we fill out our deck with ways to get our win condition on the board, OR survive long enough to get our win condition on the board. We can do that in this game, for the most part. We can still get bad luck and draw cards we don't need or can't play, but that's ok, we're used to that RNG that's part of deck building.

Now you also have an item deck, you put 9 cards, they show up in the shop in random order, hopefully you have the resources to play them when they show up. Maybe you won't. Maybe you won't see the item you need. Same kind of thing as above, however these compound as one of your items may be part of your win condition. AND the resource generation for this deck is based in... ANOTHER LAYER OF RNG.

Lane deployments! Your first turn your heroes go to what are essentially random lanes. I honestly can't remember if the 1/2/3 order puts them in left middle right, or if they just randomly get assigned to a lane, However it doesn't matter since you don't actually get to see what heroes the enemy is fielding before the decision is made, so they're essentially random anyways. You don't know where the turn 1 creeps are going, and you have no option to perhaps double up heroes in 1 lane and sac a lane. You also don't have your cards drawn at this point either so you wouldn't be able to make an informed decision about what spells you have when deciding lanes. Then at the same time Creeps are sent to the lanes randomly. Enjoy that. Do you have a hero who buffs creeps? well he might be alone. he may NEVER get creeps in his lane. Sure there are cards that create creeps, but that's another layer of RNG of course. Now, Depending on how the game matched up your heroes and creeps in lanes, 1 or 2 of 4 situations will occur in each lane. You'll have a hero vs a hero, your hero vs their creep, their hero vs your creep, or creep vs creep. Depending on how this Randomly assigned lane organization plays out in each lane, you may just lose a hero on your first turn, giving the enemy a gold advantage. Maybe you drew into a 1/2/3 cost card of the color of your hero that needs it, but maybe you didn't. Anyways now you have no gold, and your enemy has some. Turn 2 comes around! They buy items, you don't. Welp snowballing has already occured, and now it's time for RNG 4.

The arrows! you get to deploy your 4th hero, Maybe you're putting in to a lane to replace a hero, or into a lane to support another hero. Who knows! Well one thing you do know, you won't get to choose where in the lane it goes! You just send it to a lane and hope it ends up where you want it to. And you also hope that it is attacking the thing you want it to. YAY more RNG. Sure there are spells that will move arrows, or move units. However they're rare, there are 2-3 effects that swap units, and under 10 that change attack targets accross all 4 colors. Sure it's set 1, but this is a HUGE part of the game. Hope you draw into them, oh btw arrows reset after things die. hope you get an advantageous 2nd arrow.

If you're still reading at this point, know that I've been playing card games for 30 years at a highly competitve level. I have no problem with the draw RNG inherent in deckbuilding games. However these layers of RNG compound on eachother to take away any and all agency you as a player should have. That is why I cannot recommend this game despite how excited I was for it.

I should point out, I only ever write reviews for games that I care about. There are plenty of other games out there that I hate, that I silently just uninstall. This game could be amazing, however currently it's not worth your time, let alone your money.

very simple mechanic but with a complex gameplay
pay attention for tyring to figure which board your hero will deploy and going where your creep to deploy

There are some killer decks you can make with the cards you get for buying the game and then I'd say about a $5 investment buying some other cheap cards from the marketplace.  

I've got two pretty good decks with only spending that much and that is all you need to start enjoying the game.  The prebuilt free to use ""Call to Arms"" decks are also fun to mess around with if you want to try out some of the more expensive cards.  

The game itself is such a fresh take on the CCG card battle genre.  Having three lanes to worry about is really the coolest change.  There are tons of little things on top of that to worry about and optimize as well.  Having three lanes and choosing where to deploy heroes coming back, what items to buy and equip between rounds --- it all just boils down to having a bunch of complicated options that can feel a little overwhelming, but don't worry, one wrong choice doesn't neccesarily lose you the game.

That's brings me to the other really awesome thing I've noticed.  Almost every game I've played has felt close and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The way the game works is each lane has a tower with 40 hp that when it gets destroyed spans an ancient with 80 hp.  You win by either destroying two towers or destroying one of the ancients.  Sometimes you'll realize you're going to lose a lane and divert resources to another, but maybe your opponent starts to double down on the lane they're winning and it ends up being a race to see if you can get the two towers in the other lanes before they break your ancient in the lane they're pressuring.  Or maybe you have a hero coming back after dying with a cheeky spell to slow their push so you spawn them in there to disrupt even if they'll probably die.

Each match is full of difficult choices and a much closer ending compared to other CCG's out there.  I think that's ultimately what's going to help Artifact stick around.  That said, Valve still has a lot of work to do when it comes to activities/systems in the game that give the player a sense of progression, because there's pretty much none of that and getting packs is a rare occasion compared to CCG's with a little more genorous progression and card acquisition mechanics like Shadowverse.  It's not the biggest issue though.  75% of the cards in the game are less than 25 cents on the marketplace and about half of them are less than 10 cents.

First things first, besides the cards you get in the begining, you must either sell your cards to purchase new ones or spend real money. Outside of that their is no in game currency or method to earn packs by simply playing. They give you ""tickets"" which you can use to play an arena mode, if your familiar with hearthstone its like that, but you only get 10 tries. During that if you lose twice your out and need 3 wins just to earn the ticket back, problem is you will be facing people with op cards and I will further explain.

People will say that you can play draft and that it isn't pay to win, BS after you draft it allows you to add cards that you have to the draft and swap them WHICH COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF DRAFT.
Don't buy this game, it uses the skin of Dota 2 to lure fans and cover a sea of microtransactions, this is not worth the full price I paid. I think Valve knew this as well as they even go the extra mile to make sure that once you realize this you cannot get your refund as is stated and I quote, ""Refunds: Once you've claimed your Starter Decks and Card Packs you will be ineligible for an automatic refund of Artifact via Steam. Before claiming your Starter Decks and Card Packs, you will be able to play games against bots and other players using pre-constructed decks.""

Thats like right after the tutorial why would you give players free cards and say if you open them, too bad so sad no refund for you, that is so idiotic, seriously what were you thinking !?!

No, this game is not pay to win. Like with any paper trading card game, you get started by purchasing a starter pack (the $20 game in this case). What you get is pretty generous: $20 worth of boosters, 2 free decks, and 5 event tickets good for 5 phantom drafts where you can win more packs and tickets. And like any other TCG, you expand your collection by purchasing boosters.

Rarity is not correlated with power, so you don't need to buy tons of packs to be competitive.

And like all good TCGs, your cards actually have significant real world value, and can be traded on a market. This is super refreshing compared to grindy games like Hearthstone where you cards are only worth 1/4 of their value as dust, so when a new set comes out you have to spend a lot of money to keep up (or grind hundreds of hours).",1543720655,1543735791,True,1,0,0.513924062252044678,0,True,False,False

While you do have to pay $20 dollars to ""play"" the game this is no different than if you bought one of those starter deck packs they sell in the store for yugi-oh, pokemon or even magic. The difference between those guys is they don't include 10 packs with those bundles. Now those 10 packs you get you can open them all up and sell all those cards and probably make back your $20 or maybe even make some money. After that you don't even need cards to play the game. All the casual modes even the draft mode (casual) allow you access to all the cards even if you don't own them. However you won't be able to play expert mode without the cards. Hearthstone does not allow this. You want to play casual you have to own the cards. Arena sure you don't but you are going to need to pay for it (gold or money). Artifact you get to play both modes at no additional cost (read that again ""no additional cost""). This way you can practice get better and then if you want you can move to the next level which is expert play. Which yeah will cost you tickets (one except keeper draft) but it you practiced then hopefully you are winning enough to get back your ticket (2 wins) which isn't like Hearthstone where you need to win at least 6-7 games to make back your gold.

No its worse. And that being said i also want to add that i dont like hearthstone(played it for couple of years, got enough of waisting 200$  each years on cards that dont exist just so you could make only 1 or 2 good decks, now sitting on mtg).
1)Money grab-i made some quick calculations and i must say what to make full collection you will have to spend something around 300-400 dollars to get whole collection(if you will have some lock and if you gona resell all doubles ofc). Hearthstone players may say what this is releatively cheap, but Ranked-game equivelent require ticket to start game(ranked games are  better for any dicent card game player cz in normal its just stupidity fiesta) and if for example HS charges 2$ per run, AF wants whole 5$. Also if you will lose too soon you not gona get pack or anything-just kiss goodbye 5$ bucks goodbuy nerd. And no one said what Valve not gona go Blizzard way and not gona start ban old cards, take from ranked some op cards or nerf that op card you bought for 10$ to useless crap worth 2 cents at best.
2)Luck>brains - no matter how good you play,you still can be owned by complete idiot just cause he is more lucky. You are not only dicerolling on topdeck cards, and dice effects of carrds, but you also have no povers on unit positioning on each lane and their way of attack. 
You can easily get fcked on the first one or two turns just because game made every single enemy lane to focus your champs.
Your perfect game winning combo can be denied cz of 5 possible points to spawn it spawned on that point where his game-winning spell will be nothing.
You can loose just despereatly trying to buy at least some teleport or mobility items while enemy gona just keep geting one after another from shop.
3)Balance- right now its green-red controll meta(with blue and black for cheesy situation), but game still not perfect. Some cards defenetly gona get nerfed. In random draft its even worse-usualy you gona just get to see enemy champs on starting screen and perfectly understand what ""yup, im fcked"". Too many cards which instantly remove heroes and at the same time dening any comeback. No one will convince me what Phantom Assasin which have 6 mana insta  killing hero card is balanced
So yeah 10 packs is not enought to build even 1 good deck, and with 5 tickets i manage to get 3 more tickets and with that i manage to get 1(one) pack. After that i checked run price(5$) and realised what fck this sht im out. I realy liked random draft but in free there are too many guys who dont care about game and thus making mistakes and thus its not fun(realy you just roflstomp guy who have 0 intentions or 0 abilities to win-what is the fun in that?).
I would have played more of it if price for tickets would not be so ridiculous(5$ Karl! 2 and half packs! Which retard in Valve said what it will be good idea to sell ranked tickets for more money that actual packs?) or if i got at least one pack out of bad ranked run.
One thing to loose on cz enemy plays better than you and other thing to loose is when you see enemy managed to draft luna and phantom assassin and you realise what at turn 6 you gona instaloose just because they have op 6turn removals and there is no way to counter it,and you wont even get anything for your suffering.
You could say many thing about HS but it have many thing to keep you in game(dungens, brawls, packs even for bad arena runs) and huge paywall if you want to go in ranked with more than 1 or 2 aggro decks.

Heroes and mobs are placed in random positions in the lanes, and what they choose to attack is also determined randomly during placement. To cast cards you need to have a hero in the lane of that color, but if your opponent randomly got to go first that round, given the right circumstances he can kill your hero before you even have your first turn, and so now you can't play any of your cards. The game on top of that nonsense also has rng card effects like those seen in hearthstone.

Blah Blah Blah Yada Yada Yada, a better player will average more wins, but that will be frontloaded mostly in the deck building aspect as with any rng game. There is just far too much going on in this game that is completely out of your control while affecting you greatly. 

Comebacks do happen and it feels great when a choice you made eeked out a win, but due to all the factors not in your control, during some matches you might feel like a chimpanzee hitting a big red button to pass your turn instead of making meaningful choices.

This game is easily more complex than Hearthstone, which to my kind of people means it is already better, but I am still dissappointed in the sheer quantity of rng mechanics woven into the fabric. 

I want MORE of a gap created between a good player and a bad player in my competitive games, not less.

On the extreme positive side, the monetization is fantastic if you enjoy the idea of having a market back up your card game. In Artifact each of your cards has value and you can sell them freely, while being able to DIRECTLY purchase cards you want in order to build a deck (this makes it the CHEAPEST card game, f2p or not, if you're looking for competitive constructed play). On my end alone, I made back far more than the price of the game just by selling the cards I got from my 10 boosters that were included. 

With all the cards not worth selling after I did a few cycles of [sell cards][buy boosters][repeat], I recycled them 20 at a time to get a total of 15 event tickets (1 ticket is valued at $1). 1 event ticket is the entry cost to a phantom draft (my mode of choice), where you play to 5 wins or 2 losses, and 3 wins will net you back 1 event ticket, with 4 and 5 wins netting you 1 and 2 card packs (1 card pack is valued at $2).

So, with the $20 purchase price, totaling raw wallet value and event tickets, I made back $45, and am now pretty much set to go a few thousand hours without dropping another dime if I intend to only do competitive draft.",1543541246,1543731447,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, mana and spell system: gone are the days of magic where at least 25% of games you lose just because of mana screw or mana flood. Also, drawing 2 cards each turn means you are a lot less reliant on RNG / top deck/ luck. in fact, luck plays smaller part in the game then a lot of other card games like heartsone which are now all about praying to RNGesus.

The game is super interactive and fun - you can do a lot to mess with state of the board and your opponents plans. Majority of games come to the wire and reward wiith real sense of achievement when you win.  


A lof of people seems to be not recommending the game because of monetisation model - it is not a F2P model. Whilsts you can play a lot of modes for free - including drafting which is simply amazing- to earn new cards you do have to put in money. Maybe you don't think it is ""fair"", especially if you are just a casual player - but don't kid yourself that it is more expensive then Magic or Hearstone if you play seriously / competitavely. 

First, top decks in Magic cost way more (both online and physical versions). 

In Hearstone, each new expansion costs you around $40 and will only give you a fraction of cards which you will never be able to convert back into real world currency. If you think that is a better ""deal"" you really should go back to math class in school.

While I still have some disagreements in the game, the lack of a progession system that makes it feel like you're improving and how the card market place is more or less rigged to give valve the most amount of money, the gameplay is actually quite solid.

Certainly pouring money into this game gives access to better cards, which in any other digital card game would make decrees of Pay to Win, the actual price of many good cards, even those that one might say were lesser then other good cards, allows for a good level of play and less of those ""he has axe? this game sucks because I have to pay money for axe."" many cards feel powerful, with only a few that feel weak (I'm looking at you OD and CM) but it's possible future expansions make give for creedence for such cards, only time will tell.

To end, I enjoy the game greatly and will play a great deal of it, but it definitely needs some work before it can really shine in the future, but Valve is and always has been the company to make things work in the face of adversity, so maybe I should give them a chance? 

As per progression, while it seems that the main way to get more cards shall remain purchasing packs, doing keeper drafts or even browsing the ludicrious marketplace, I still would like some ways to get cards outside of those options, I'm not counting on it but it would certainly take away from the 'pay to win' feel that many cry out against.

The game mechanics are not difficult to learn but you have to play it to really get it and if you are just watching videos on Youtube or Twitch, they don't show the game for its mechanics and game play. From what i read  and understand, there is no real way to refund this game as well. 

Pros:
Game design and music is great. ""I am a doggy"". Casual Phantom Draft is the game mode I recommend before launching off into Expert Play. 
- This game relies a lot on your strategising and brain power. Makes the game exciting, and sometimes turning the tide gives a very high satisfaction
- THERE IS A LOT OF HIDDEN LORE! If you like that in your games, go and delve in and figure out what's going on and who's on who's side
- Unique gameplay. The game play for Artifact is so well crafted and unique that no two games feel the same. unless you are playing against a constructed blue-green with Kanna and Incarnation of Selemene. 

Cons:
- Currently no way to interact with other players
- Expert constructed is a field of pay-to-win. *BTW this will be the only game mode that really matters when it comes to pay-to-win.* - also note, cards like Axe and Drow are possibly the best cards in the game but do not worry if you don't have them in constructed. I've seen games where those cards don't get a chance to shine because of RNG.
- This is a card game, so you better be ready for some Cheating Death, Eclipse or Chain Frost RNG. 
- There are no in-game stats. This needs to be added as soon as possible, Valve. A proper ranked draft matchmaking would really be cool and create for some interesting competitive games.

All cards are marketable and are selling for cents!

[strike]Despite only playing for 5 hours, I've got a pretty good image about this game (I was following it for a good while).[/strike] Now that I got to peak in myself, I can comfortably say that Artifact is one of the best online card games out there. While people will be turned off by the price model (understandable), it's still not as expensive to play Artifact as it might seem from the backlash it's recieving. 

Here's what you can do for free after buying Artifact:
[list]
    [*]--Play the featured event; the current event is ""Call to Arms""where there are 6 pre made decks you can play with against an opponent. You opponent picks form the same 6 decks. This one will last until the 14th of December of 2018, then the event rotates.
    [*]--Play contructed against friends, opponents (casually there are 2 variants), or practice agaisnt a bot.
    [*]--Play draft. There's a free version of draft.
[/list]

[h1]So the long talk about the pricing, value, and such... [/h1]

Well, this is the hot topic and this is what most people want to talk about really, so let me share my honest views. While you don't recieve any rewards for playing the non-ticket modes, it's still fun to play even without spending more. Unless you like building from your own pool of cards, drafters however can still have fun for free and then take on expert phantom or keeper draft when they're ready. 

Building decks isn't too expensive, apart from few cards, like Axe, most other cards are dirt cheap already. Where you can generate a lot of value is keeper draft, if you're good at the game you don't have to spend a lot to keep playing this mode, you get to keep all the cards you draft (so you can even snipe what you need) and potentionally get rewarded with more than you've entered with. And this really goes for the other expert modes, ones that require an event ticket but reward you for doing well.

Every duplicate that is not worth much selling can be recycled, after recycling 20 cards you get a free event ticket for exper constructed or draft (phantom and keeper draft). For example, after I've opened the first 10 packs I was given with the purchase, I recycled 15 duplicates from it that I didn't feel like selling for cents. I also unboxed a hero that was fluctuaiting between 6 - 8$ in value at the time.

Obviously, if you don't have any income, then Artifact might be a tough one to get into if you like to stay up to date in cunstructed meta, or if you like to play competetivel. You can play free draft and the other free modes, which is fun as I prefer drafting, but some are into consutrcted, and so if you are a fan of cunstructed and you are a student withou any disposable income, then big oof dude. 

However, when it comes to paying for the cards to build the decks you need, it's more fair than any other digital card game I've played so far. While in other games you can grind for free (remeber your time is NOT a free resource), it takes a hellishly long time to get meta decks. In Artifact, everyone has equal oportinuty in the marketplace. The value of pack is very good since there are only 4 rarities and you get 12 cards per pack and you're always guaranteed to get 1 rare (highest rarity), a hero and 2 items. And to repeat this point, you can completely bypass buying packs and just getting exacly what you need. And if you get good rarity duplicates from your expert play, you can sell them to fuel your Artifact addiction.

[h1] Ok, what do I think about the other aspects of the game? [/h1]

First of all, it's fun. It's got depth to it, it's got some complexity, but the complexity adds up together and makes sense. But that's not a big surpirse, gameplay-wise, Richard Garfield is simply the guy you can rely on to deliver the quality. There's no point in talking about the gameplay though, it would be a lot more simple to just look at a video that explains how Artifact is played, because typing it out... well, that would just take too long and no one would want to read it either way.

Now the UI, visuals, music, performance, network - really great, really comfy, it's nice to look at, it runs well, so far haven't encountered any issues.

*Edit- I have had the game crash once, during a match. Luckily, I was able to reconnect so quicly that I didn't lose out on anything.

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
    [*]+ Unique and fun gameplay
    [*]+ Many modes to choose from
    [*]+ Building decks is more accessible, you can get the specific card you want
    [*]+/- High skill cieling, a lot of depth and strategizing involved [i](COULD BE A NEGATIVE - it depends on what you're looking for)[/i]
    [*]+ Art, visuals, UI
    [*]+ Music (I am a doggie! FrankerZ)
    [*]+ Good performance, network/servers are stable in my experience
    [*]+ It is in possible, in theory, to go infinite. Of course you need to be very good to begin with. (Get return in tickets and even bonus packs)
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b]
[list]
    [*]-  While the pricing is fair imo, it still is something other might not like, fans of CCGs and LCGs will be turned off. This might change in the future.
    [*]- No direct player to player trading (yet)
    [*]- Even if you generate a lot of value, money is still trapped inside your steam wallet. Gaben's perfect trap.
    [*]- Games can be long
    [*]-/+ Casual players might find learning slope to be too steep, or perhaps just convoluted [i](THIS REALLY IS EITHER A PRO OR A CON, again, depends on who you ask)[/i]
    [*]- RNG can sometimes be unfair
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you like card games with depth (the likes of MTG), prefer the model of paying to get what you want as oppsoed to grinding or relying on the dice rolls to maybe get something worth, if you want to spend time with a card game and grasp it's dpeth and take your time to get good at it, Artifact is something I absolutely reccomend to you. I really need to emphasise that the gameplay is amazing for anyone who likes strategy, complexity and card games.

[b]HOWEVER[/b] - if you expect to be able to recieve free rewards and you want to play competively without any additional investments besides the purchase, or you prefer more simple card games (for example if MTG turns you off and you just like to chill with HS), Artifact will probably not be a game I could reccommend for you!",1543469853,1543721005,True,2,0,0.518544912338256836,0,True,False,False

Pay to Win:
There are going to be two sides to this.  You're going to have one group of people who claim that the game is pay to win and that they won't support a game that supports a pay to win model.  On the other, you're going to have people who grew up playing Magic the Gathering and other like games and are used to dropping $3-$50 bucks a week at their local store on card packs.  My vice (when I was a kid) was Star Trek The Next Generation: The Customizable Card Game.  Starbase One, my local gaming store at the time, got hundreds of dollars from me and I never played professionally.

$20 gets you 10 packs and 5 event tickets for expert play.  You can buy additional packs for $1.99 or individual cards ranging from $.01-$21.  Personally, I found the buying and selling of individual cards to be smooth and fluid.   One specific card costs $21 at the time of writing, more than the game itself.  Does that make the game pay to win?  Probably.  I'm assuming the card isn't priced that way for aesthetics.  It CAN get expensive, but most card games of this type already are.  You're either going to hate that sort of business model or shrug it off as the norm.  There's no right or wrong viewpoint...it's just up to personal preference.  Luckily, you can play against friends and also participate in drafts, avoiding the card purchasing altogether.  My sole complaint is that there's no current way to trade cards with friends.

Yes, I'm a newbie, but I'm liking the game so far.  I learned it fairly quickly and like that it's not just a copy/paste of Hearthstone.  Sure, there are similarities, but the heroes, fountains, three lanes, and etc. makes it stand out as its own product.  I plan to keep playing and possibly purchase more cards in the future.

The economy model is going to get hated on, but it's better to go in not expecting Hearthstone. 2 initial starter decks plus 10 free packs is a good start. You have to earn your free packs. But you can trade in your cards for steam wallet money and buy the specifc cards you need. Most cards are under a dollar, with the commons being around 4 cents. Yeah there are some cards that can be expensive, Axe is 18 dollars at the writing of this, but it is exactly like buying cards and packs for games like Magic. 

Overall, you can still make some good decks with the cards you have. You may have to spend some more money, but I personally prefer this type of economy since you end up being able to get what you want, rather than hope for free packs. Does it make it pay to win? Yeah, at least outside the draft mode. But all card games are pretty much pay to win, and I cant justify calling that a negative in this game, when it happens in others.

You can lose turn 1 of a draft because of the way minions line up in lane. Coming from the world of boardgames a lot of people talk about random mitigation, and the fact is that there is little to no counterplay to most of the random elements of the game.

And the DOTA feel is just sweet. They nailed it with the mechanics.

To be fair deckbuilding is MUCH MORE cheaper than any other card game around where in HS you need to spend a couple hundred every expansion to craft legendaries where in Artifact you can just buy unowned cards from other players without buying a single pack. But, ALL of the rewards in this game are gated behind paid tickets... If people cannot casually win small rewards and progress slowly without paying for tickets, I don't see players keep coming back in the long run.

Then, as release got closer I began to see gameplay, and let me tell you guys it looked GOOD. Hearthstone's one sided turns always felt boring to me, and so I looked more into Artifact. $20? That didn't seem too ridiculous of a price to me, especially compared to how much games can cost. So I bought it on a whim.

And I absolutely loved it. I spent the first few hours losing literally every game I played, rebuilding my decks, opening packs, and trying again. I was a bit put off by the fact that I could only buy packs with money, but the cardpool was small and the game was fun, so I let it go. Then, I saw the 'sell card' tab.

I freaked out, in a great way. You could trade your cards to other players, and then buy what you wanted?! You could get every card without opening a single pack? I was hooked. I've spent about $60 on the game, including the buy in price of $20, and have been able to make decks very similar to what's seeing tournament play. For $40 more, I could not only make several diverse decks, but I could also make some fun rogue ones too! (Currently, I'm looking at a stunlock deck) Admittedly, I did get lucky (opening both Drow Ranger and Axe in packs, each of which is $15-$20 at the time of writing), but that doesn't change the fact that this model, in my opinion, is either comparable or better than any other online TCG. 

To put it simply, I spent $60 on this game. That's about equal to the Rakastan preorder price for Hearthstone, a super budget deck for MTG, or a AAA game. For me, as someone who loves card games, this is insanely cheap. To build a competitive deck in Magic, which has the closest model to this with actual trading, you need to spend between $200 and $600 for a competitive, pro level deck (link for those curious: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/tournament/pro-tour-guilds-of-ravnica#paper). For Hearthstone, that gets you a preorder (50 packs) and some change. Assuming you open a legendary every ten packs and an epic every four (pity timer is 20 and 8, respectively, so I feel like that's a fair estimate), you'd end up with five legendaries (plus the free one you get for logging in), 12-ish epics, and 50-ish rares. You could then dust what you don't want and make a decent deck if you got lucky, but in the end you only opened a quarter of the legendaries, about half the epics (but you need doubles, so a quarter of the full set), and enough rares and commons (link to the full set: https://www.hearthpwn.com/guides/6052-rastakhans-rumble-card-reveals-and-details-for). 

The math could be wrong, but I tried to get it as close as I could. My point is: the game's great. It's not F2P, so if your goal is to play a game without paying a cent, that just can't happen here. It's not a free game, and it's designed to be closer to a physical card game than an online one. In the end, it's up to you if you want to play it or not, $20 is a lot when you can play other card games for free, but I hate seeing so many people turned off by the price. I really enjoy the game, and I just want you guys to be able to enjoy it too!

The pricing model appears to not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally think it's nice to copy a deck in from a deck site and buy all the cards in it for a total of like one dollar then be able to go right away. 

The pricing structure is more like a paper TCG, rather than an online one, and I think that's totally ok and in many ways preferable for people who have any amount of investment in the steam marketplace (sell a couple DotA items or CS:GO skins or TF2 items or Steam trading cards, get a full deck in this game). There are plenty of free modes to play, and if you're comparing it to paper MTG, it's nice to have your deck and be able to play any time against other people, because, you know, the game is fun and we play games because they're fun, not because of an arbitrary progression system.

- the tournament system in the game is GREAT but is lacking a spectator mode, why launch without this?

For the people crying pay to win, have you ever played a card game? If anything this seems far less pay 2 win than something like Hearthstone which doesn't allow card trading or purchasing. While you can make a reasoanable constructed viable deck relatively cheaply (I did one season with an all commons and basic cards warrior), if you want to be remotely competitive in hearthstone there are very specific high cost legendary and epic cards that you have to have. Even down to rank 20 people are playing these high cost decks (which is why they had to introduce lower ranks because the new player experience was becoming utter trash). While you can craft cards from dust, the amount of card packs you need to open to get a decent amount is abysmal. Serious players are spending hundreds of dollars each expansion. In this, it doesn't seem like any individual card is really that deck defining, so while it might cost you a lot of buy Axe off the open market, you could replace him with a 1c card instead and still be competitive play viable.

- its buy to play, so you dont really expect extra 'fees' (but to get a decent collection expect about double (that is; to get all the cards i wanted -not for one specific deck, just the ones that seemed interesting to me- i dished out another ~£20 on the marketplace) what the base game cost, and for a full collection maybe triple or quadruple)

- packs cost real money, the game gives you 10 to begin with (about the upfront cost) and you cant really earn more without spending more money (well there is; but on that next)

- the game gives you 5 'event tickets', these are used to enter some events; like drafting... theoretically you can go infinite in these events, getting slightly more wins than losses equals a ticket and going more gives you packs; so theres that but its unreliable

- cards are marketable (on the steam market)... and honestly most are pennies; theres a couple relatively expensive ones (axe being the main one, though drow and kanna are pretty high too) which creates a weird situation where it doesnt seem worth it to buy packs indvidually (you could get lucky with multiple axe drops and recoup the cost, but chances are itll be a loss compared to just buying what you dropped on the market)

- you can 'recycle' 10 cards into an event ticket (previously mentioned); obviously intended to get rid of bulk 'trash' (few are actually trash) cards and maintain a healthy price... but seems to be failing as most cards are less than £0.10, and very very few are over £1 (though last i checked the three major outliers; axe, drow and kanna were sitting at around £12, £7 and £5 respectively... currently these are very low compared to the high end of other paper TCGs; but ofcourse the future is sketchy and prices can easily fluctuate)

- unlike other online ccgs (well, artifact is tcg, but obviously the comparisons are going to be to hearthstone, mtg:arena etc due to its online nature); theres no daily quests or the ilk... like a paper card game, unless you spend money, your collection wont grow

- also a personal grievance; no integration with DotA+ (dotas optional subscription)... like buying artifact even gives you 1 month of dota+ and im surprised/appalled (maybe a strong word) that there isnt like daily/weekly quests for shards (dota+ currency) and shard integration in artifact (buying cosmetic card backs or those little imp things)... i think theres a massive missed opportunity to have the sub as a cross game feature
