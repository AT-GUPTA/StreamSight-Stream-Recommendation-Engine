It's also one of the best examples of in-game mechanics reflecting in-game story, Exemplified in the boss battles quirks, or even more meta-narratively (Cognition filter, or how the gameplay it feels like an endless cycle of pulling yourself through a bed of glass shards reflecting the in-story reality).

This is not a fun game, it's not even particularly engaging, but there's depths to the gameplay and story that are truly gripping.

--
My advice to players:
Retrying a day, and more importantly Resetting to a checkpoint (5 day check) AND resetting back to the start (day 1 of 50). WILL and MUST occur, repeatedly. Accept it. Embrace it. Doing the early days over again is EASY relative to the later challenges. You will only make your suffering worse if you don't use all 3 resets and frequently, or you keep trying the 24hr day resets without going back to a 5 day checkpoint of a full-resets. Look up how to use 5 day resets to 'learn' a monster and gather EGO gear..because once you have it and know it, *it stays with you*.


Do the side-missions as soon as you are able, and do the boss battles. They're game-changing and some are so powerful it's worth instantly reseting to day 1 to play WITH the improvements.

I recommend you do play with mods though, particularly ones that let you save your agents on resets, or ones that improve quality of life.",1708886241,1708886241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, after playing this game for a bit, it didn't take long for it to get on my nerves from a gameplay and design perspective. I will be the first to admit that I have probably barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, but in all honesty, that is all that was needed for me to dislike and refund it.

I find the graphics, UI, and overall design of the game very unappealing. The animations are very stiff and clunky and remind me of what you would encounter on those cheap early 2000s free game websites, where you would find a bunch of poorly made Mario knock-offs. It was either that or Space Cadet Pinball back then, so you would just spend the afternoon scrolling on that website in the hope you would encounter something that vaguely resembled a quality game.

The UI of this game is weirdly confusing because of the many different statistics vomited randomly on the screen, and it doesn't help that even the tutorial rapidly starts to throw absurdly complex terms at your head, making the whole thing unnecessarily confusing right from the start. And then the music... boy... it has been a while since I've encountered a game with a soundtrack that burrowed its way into my brain... in such a bad way. It's very repetitive and relatively short, stopping after a minute or so, followed by complete silence and then abruptly starting again, over and over. I prefer more mellow or catchy melodies, especially in my management games, so I can just happily hum along while enjoying my management duties.

So yeah, as a fan of SCP and management games in general, I don't really get why this game is rated as overwhelmingly positive. In my short time playing this game, I have very few positive things to say about it. One of which would be that the written, mysterious backgrounds of the 'SCPs' are fun, interesting, and creative. But yeah, I'm afraid that's pretty much where the praising stops.

Maybe it's just not for me. Maybe this game is positively review-bombed because of some online following or meme I'm not getting. Whatever the reason for my distaste is, I thought I would share my 2 cents concerning my personal experience with it.

[hr][/hr]
I'll try to keep this review [b]spoiler free[/b], because there is a overarching plot in this story that builds up into this grand finale of a stage play, and it's best to go into this game blind to experience it yourself.

If you're into management sims that has punishing-but-satisfying gameplay and turns into an RTS when an abnormality (the game's term for the monsters) breaches their containment, or if you're just a fan of cataloging and managing monsters beyond your comprehension, then this game is for you.

[b]The Gameplay[/b] is punishing. Yeah, that's no exaggeration. Lobotomy Corporation, at the very start when you have none of the abnormalities researched, is a game of trial and error. You will not be able to beat the game on your very first try. Think of it as a rogue-like, but when you die, you can still restart the day. Eventually though, you'll hit a major road block, i.e: an abnormality might be too strong for your employees to handle, that or a certain abnormality breaks out because its guidelines conflict with another abnormality's requirements.

But that's strangely the fun of it, because when you restart to the first day, certain progress doesn't get lost. Sure, your employees and your abnormalities may be lost, but your research progress on abnos, the missions you complete that continue the story for each department and their respective rewards, the EGO Weapons and Suits you get from abnos, they all stay. So you have this slow climb of power, and at certain points, you may not even realize you do. 

You'll know which abnormalities to take with you and which you shouldn't because of conflicts that might arise, or you might even take them on purpose because you want a challenge, or you simply want to watch your employees absolutely decimate them with the new gear you got.

This game can be punishing, but it's rewarding, that triumph you feel when you overcome an obstacle you never managed to hurdle over until now. That's what pulled me into the game, and if this intrigues you, I highly suggest you get the game.

Just be ready to hear the first five notes play again and again until enough employees die and abnos break out.
Speaking of which, this leads me to the next section:

[b]The Music[/b]. It's phenomenal, there's no questions about it. Each warning (there's three) perfectly represents the situation you're in, and the music during cutscenes really sell the atmosphere they're trying to go for. The only thing I have a problem with is the music when there's nothing happening in the game, also known as Neutral 01 to Neutral 04. They are all identical in melody. Actually, it's the exact same song, but the difference between all four neutral sound tracks are the additions of instruments into each one. This can work in its own right, but most of the time, you won't even notice the difference during gameplay until you pay attention to it.

Otherwise, the music is great. Crazy impressive for just 10 people working on the game.

[b]The Story[/b] is great. That's all I can really say about it without going into spoiler territory. It can be pretty surface level at some points, but as you keep progressing, you become entrenched in the Lobotomy Corp's worldbuilding and its religion and [spoiler]stage play[/spoiler] theming. It leaves off a lot of questions to be answered in their sequel game [b]Library of Ruina[/b], and I cannot recommend this game more because of the story.

The background art, the abnormality artwork and the EGO items, they're all really good. They're not pure masterworks, that award goes to Library of Ruina, but for what it is, I like it. [spoiler]There's even a reason later as to why your employees look the way they do in game[/spoiler].

Overall, this game gets a 9/10. This game is absolutely worth its price, and I would have paid more if I could. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did. Just remember to face the fear so you can build the future.

And one more thing, if this review sells you on getting it: If you find a small bird with a red stomach, a long bird with a scale on its neck and bandaged face, and a big bird with many eyes, let them all escape at once. You'll get something cool out of it.

Turns out, they lied. The real game wasn't managing the Abnormalities. It was managing the constant deplete in energy, the repeated Ordeals that just get more difficult to predict and adapt, meltdown after meltdown after meltdown, praying something doesn't go wrong. That the Mimic won't just snap one day and eat your innocent Level 5 Employee at only -6 Overload, relapsing the entire 2 Hour Day. That you won't have to deal with the invulnerable worms next dusk. That the Meltdown doesn't target the ONE ABNORMALITY you can't deal with, much less ALL OF THEM. That the tiny white clothed girl doesn't just so happen to wipe out half your facility with a single attack unleashing two of the meanest abnormalities you have under containment, triggering a chain reaction of every other abnormality breaking containment, slaughtering all your employees through proceedingly more intricate methods. What was I talking about again? Right, Red Riding Hood Sucks. Did I mention White and Black are now my least favorite colors? I'm pretty sure the facility layout is based on the rings of hell. I survived undertale with the help of a tree, but everyone else died and the mimic killed me later anyway. Can someone tell me if the Memory Repository takes your Egos away too? Man this plot is kinda confusing.

Anyway, the game is pretty fun. If you're easily drawn into fictional worlds, have a life, and enjoy persevering through un and im possible odds, you'll find that this game is not for you! You will not win, the game won't let you. You'll quit within the first 5 Hours, 10 Hours, 50 Hours, and look back on it as a failure. You'll tell yourself you'll finish it one day, and never will. Even if you do manage to get one ending, you'll never get the others. Even if you get the endings, you'll never get all the abnormalities. Even if you 100% the game, you'll never be satisfied. You failed. Everything was for naught. How do we escape this hell we live in?

Fun Game.

||Edit||
Now that I've doubled my playtime, I've learned the truth. This game isn't hard, it's actually kind of easy. In fact, I'm gonna say it, the game is only hard because the hitboxes for literally everything are terrible. That and you have literally no direction for how your supposed to properly manage the corporation. No, I'm not talking about the Abnormalities, if those guys are giving you trouble, it's either because you don't know how to read or you're bad at the game described as ""Managing Abnormalities"". What I actually mean by ""manage"" the corporation is grinding your employees to their max capabilities at every moment of the day, completing the Records Department Research, and his Core Suppression if you're feeling real spicy, then restarting from scratch to construct your own personal army of roided up psychopaths to bonk all your problems away at a moment's notice. Once you understand this absolute truth, you'll realize that Lobotomy Corporation is actually an easy game and the only reason people say it's hard is because the Tutorial is obscure enough you don't know what you're doing half the time, you've no way of telling if the work you're doing is actually training your employees properly unless you download a mod for that, and because the majority of these people are a bunch of pathetic babies who don't understand that to enjoy a game you need to spend the first 80% of the playtime grinding at 2 am hating yourself and everything around you. Essentially, if you have less than 30 Hours in this game, your opinion is irrelevant, and you need to get off the computer grandpa. Yes, I understand you need to feed your family, but this game has a very deep and complex narrative that absolutely requires the 100 Hours of filler inbetween it all and you need to suffer through every second of it. Anyway, just like most people recommend, if the game is that hard for you, just mod it. There's a very handy dandy guide here on steam that is actually quite simple and concise to the point in which you'll only spend about 10 Minutes setting it up. Of course, it won't help you, it will only make the process much less frustrating. Just remember, if you use the Super Agents Mod, you better lock your windows because oh boy do I feel abnormal tonight. If I'm being at all serious, if the ending for the game wasn't so painstakingly difficult to reach, I probably would've capped my playtime out at 70 Hours, but man do I love jumping through hoops. You should do it too! Ignore the flames and angry man whipping your behind, that's just a feature. Anyway, I'm shooting for around 160 Hours, after that, I'm gonna assume I've absorbed everything this game has to offer, because if there's a Secret Ending D, it probably wasn't worth the extra 40 Hour Grind anyway. I'll just look the ending up on Youtube.

I ended up skipping the later parts because it took so long. The UI is pretty, but not very intuitive and super inefficient. The game as I understand is also translated to english, and that is very obvious when playing it, as the words used are often very weird and make little sense. 

The writing itself is infuriatingly bad. After spending way too long in the tutorial just reading, I have to read super awkward dialogue from an AI which describes how it looks in great detail, which I can obviously just see by looking at the picture. And this kind of pointless waste of time reading continues as I'm told how to drink champagne from a glass. It is also filled with logical inconsistencies that makes you wonder if the translation is super off. 

The gameplay itself consists of you gambling on which colour you think a certain abnomarlity wants. My first attempt I guessed the wrong colour and instantly lost the game without being able to do anything about it. The description of the game was not lying when it said ""and watch as it unfolds"", as it seems you cannot actually influence what is happening at all. You can just watch your guys die slowly. Thankfully the game lets you reset the day so I could gamble on another colour, which was correct that time. Once you know the correct colour for the abnormality, then you basically just tell your guy to go in there and do that colour, wait 30 seconds and do it again until the day is complete. I managed to complete 4 days of this exact gameplay with 0 new mechanics opening up or anything before I just could not get myself to play anymore. 

If I were to guess, then the interesting part of this game is the SCP-like descriptions of the anomalies. Maybe I was just unlucky, but all 3 of those I got were incredibly uninteresting. One of them was literally just a dog, with a page of text explaining that the dog is cute. The other had 2 shrimps wearing pants next to a vending machine. Not sure what the deal with the shrimps were, but the text described 3 different colours of grape soda that you could get from the vending machine, with 3 different ways to phrase that they give you energy, making it feel like I'm wasting my time reading nothing once again.  The third one was almost interesting. The lore was that it gained energy from having sins confessed to it. The description describes 3 levels of sins. Level 1 being a harmful lie, and level 3 being a horrible sin you'd tell no one and bring with you to your grave. That piqued my interest, but as the level 3 sin was explained, it turned out to be a guy who dressed up as a deer in a forest with a group of friends. Apparently the writers think that dressing up as a deer is so horribly sinful that you'd never tell anyone about it (Except the friends they did it with???). 

I do not understand what anyone could get out of this game, unless the writing is leagues better in its original language and you can read that. If you can't, then I'd advise you save your money and time",1706235696,1706235696,False,2,4,0.427530348300933838,2,True,False,False

The real challenge of the game, however, comes in the late game where the bulk of the gameplay is micromanaging your units so they don't get shredded.
It is messy, it is aggravating. And at it's worst when the attempts at a day get long enough to surpass an hour of playtime, you'll want to pull your hair out when something slips your mind a hour and an half into an attempt and half of your facility instantly dies.
The game is merciless, the gameplay is a little jank, and the later days are completely unforgiving. I don't wish half of the jank in this game on my worst enemy, there's no glory to be had here. I wouldn't even consider most of it too difficult, but walking on eggshells for an hour straight really builds on the pressure and hammers in each and every mistake you make.

That said, it's probably one of my favourite games period, for how gripping the setting is and how well the gameplay is integrated into the plot. The light at the end of the tunnel is absolutely worth it, the question is whether or not you're willing to sink the time into finishing it. If you don't like real-time management games, it isn't for you, but if you're alright with the genre I'd recommend giving it a shot and experiencing it for yourself. Even if you regret it, you'll come out the other side a little more well-rounded than before.

If you do decide to play it, I'd recommend touching up on the 10X speed mod, the performance mod that fixes the memory leak, and the mod that tells you the Ordeals for the day at the beginning on Nexus Mods.",1705809287,1705809461,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I loved the premise of being in a facility having to deal with deadly monsters, suppressing them, and gradually upgrading your employee from working with said monsters. The creativeness and uniqueness each abnormality brings to the table always kept surprising me, even the way every character had such an important role to the story and ending of the game, even when I would be convinced a certain character wasn't very important I was always proven wrong. The game is a ton of trial and error learning and improving and just a single day in the game can take HOURS if you chose an abnormality too difficult to deal with currently. Another interesting thing about this game is that every facility anyone ever makes will be different, there is plenty of different combinations that could be in ones facility for better or for worse. The story is also very amazing and immersive, I feel like i'm actually on a mission to finish what Carmen started and to finally free everybody from the cycle of pain that is the Lobotomy Corporation. As i'm a sucker for lore in games this is where i found most of the enjoyment, being interested in the story also helps deal with how much of a low point the gameplay eventually reaches.

For the things i dislike about this game, the game play will inevitably reach the point where it is essentially spamming working with certain abnormalities just to get your employee's stats up. This is a process that is not fast by any means even on the fastest game speed, you also cannot tell if your employee had their stats increased until you end the day, so you pretty much have to just guess if you worked enough, and sometimes you wont resulting in you having to once again spend more time stat grinding. Another issue that's mainly just a petty one, is that some abnormalities have certain quirks or conditions that can lead straight to instakills since you wont know about them until they happen once or you get lucky, leading to having the restart the day and can be very time consuming if you're decently far into a day. Of course the game is meant to be this way and is part of the difficulty and learning that it requires. Another issue is that the game can definitely lose its charm once you research most of the abnormalities as a big part of the fun i found with the game was discovering and learning about the new abnormalities, instead of just working with the same ones over and over. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive at this point and you will most likely just be more focused on wanting to be finished with the game. 

tl;dr
The game is worth the price if you're looking for a management simulator or you like SCP, the game has great story and is very immersive. The game has plenty of gameplay taking days to finish the game once, the gameplay gets repetitive though later on and the game is very hard.

With that being said I definitely recommend this game, it was a great starting point for Project Moon and for the other games they make or will make in the future. 9/10 game

These are all games where the actual ""skill""/""gameplay"" elements are fairly minimal, and instead the player is treated to a gauntlet of Meaningful Choices™, the results of which could determine whether you get stuck in an inescapable fail state 4 hours of wasted gameplay later. In these kinds of games, the player's primary resource economy is accrued [b]knowledge[/b] over repetition: through subsequent and seemingly arbitrary failures, the player is equipped with hundreds of things [i]not[/i] to do, and so is steadily shepherded into making the correct choices to move further and further each time.

Whether this game will vibe with you or not is already probably clear to you based on what kind of gamer you are. I've been increasingly falling out of love with this kind of experience, myself, due to market over-saturation and the growing sense that they're intentional wastes of my time, but I'm still giving [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] a thumbs-up of my two available choices since I think it's a bit more transparent about what it demands of you than some of these other 'timewasting failure'-type games.  Consider this ""thumbs up"" maybe 51% to 55% of a recommendation. 

[h1]What is Lobotomy Corporation?[/h1]

[i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] is, 'vibe' or 'ethos' aside, a facility management simulator with control elements from a RTS title. The facility in question is the titular Lobotomy Corporation, a sprawling prison for eldritch and supernatural threats. If you're familiar at all with [i]The SCP Project[/i], you should be recognizing the SCP Foundation, and that's not an accident. The game is [b]very[/b] blatantly a [I]SCP[/i] riff, albeit with a heavily -- how do I put this -- ""Manhwa Webtoon"" presentation, complete with [i]Madoka Magica[/i]-styled magical girl outfits for your little employees and a poorly-translated, jargon-filled misery-porn storyline that takes itself way, way too seriously.

Coming at the game as an American player, the game's overwrought, melodramatic daytime-TV storyline, cutesy art style, and heavy reliance on clicky micromanagement strike as extraordinarily 'Korean,' but this foreignness to my own sensibilities accentuated, rather than detracted, from the core hook of the game: its mysteries.

Every 'day' that passes in [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i], the player is given a choice of three new monsters to add to their facility. Initially, the player has absolutely no knowledge of the monster, up to and including what they even look like. Employees then have to 'work' with the monsters in your facility, in one of four color-coded interaction options not unlike a Hasbro Bop-It™.  Do this a requisite amount of times to fill up a power meter. When the power meter is filled, the day ends, although if you're feeling risky you may instruct your employees to keep playing Bop-It™ indefinitely afterwards because it will make them progressively better at pressing the associated colored button in the future.

However, each monster has some kind of gimmick, or frequently multiple gimmicks, that will cause them to do terrible things to your little employees if you don't know the warning signs. Most commonly, the monster will break out and start killing people if the wrong Bop-It™ button color is pressed. However, some of these gimmicks are considerably more esoteric, like a monster that gets jealous whenever any other monster is worked with and so you have to keep working with it to mollify it, or a monster that turns the employee working with it hostile and so you need secondary guards around to then pacify that employee.

At first, these will seem completely arbitrary to the player; as arbitrary, indeed, as playing Bop-It™. As the game goes on, though, the player will accrue the knowledge of what to do and what not to do for each monster, while the monster gimmicks get exponentially more complex, and the gradually-increasing dozens of monsters in the facility make every subsequent day more heavily micromanaged. Near the end of a single run of [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] (about 60-100 hours, terrifyingly), the game resembles [i]Starcraft[/i] more than [i]Prison Simulator[/i], with the player feverishly hotbuttoning around and rapidly clicking to put out dozens of fires, personally ordering every single one of dozens of employees because there's no automation features.

On the surface, this game is the absolute biggest waste of time I could ever recommend to you. A roguelike-styled game that takes 100 hours to complete? And you restart everything if you lose the facility? TwoDee, are you [i]high[/i]?

Well, the game's Rewind system cleverly salvages this.

[h1]Rewind, Rewind, Rewind[/h1]
Unlike your typical ""go back to start with nothing"" roguelike game loop, [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] gives the player the ability to rewind several days back, a welcome reprieve if you drafted the wrong monster and it wrecked your facility. It also has the standard 'go all the way back to the start' option, although curiously both this and the several-day rewind can be initiated at [b]any[/b] time, and not just after losing the facility.

This is because, although both options remove your monsters and kill off your employees, you [b]keep[/b] everything else: facility upgrades, purchased gear for your employees, and -- most crucially -- knowledge of what each monster does. The game seems designed around the [i]strong[/i] intent that you'll revert the entire save file at least once: several permanent facility upgrades are locked behind devastating boss encounters that can gut your staff and put you in a poor position to go on and win the game, and two of those boss battles late in the game are mutually-exclusive, meaning two playthroughs to the endgame are necessary to obtain both associated facility upgrades.

On the second, and third, and fourth and so on run of [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i], the player can breeze through the early levels, accruing power freely like how a ""New Game Plus"" works in most conventional RPGs.  This puts the player in a better position for the endgame, and each subsequent reset allows the player to accrue more stuff, more skills, more [i]monster facts[/i]. It's a deceptively forgiving system for this kind of unforgiving game, giving the player a massive and potentially game-winning consolation prize for the pain of having to restart everything.

This does return us to the biggest problem of [i]Lobotomy Corporation,[/i] though: it really wastes your time. By the time you're factoring progressive restarts into your power-building strategy to eventually take on the crushingly-difficult endgame, you've sunk hundreds of hours into this facility micromanagement sim and are just ready for it to be over. There's light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a hundred miles away, like a speck on  a black horizon.

I didn't have the endurance to finally power through and finish [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i], even if I enjoyed the process of discovery. Maybe you can incorporate this knowledge into your run, and win where I didn't have the patience to.

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] is an Extremely Korean facility management roguelike about putting frilly tutus on the [i]SCP Foundation[/i]. It does not respect your time at all, but it at least has the good sense to do some fun things with all of the time it steals, like your clingy friend who likes to drink. Although the gameplay itself is not particularly engaging, the process of discovery is, and the game puts a cushion on its sharp 'losing is fun' design philosophy by giving you some nice perks [i]for[/i] losing.

If a little bit of masochism and a lot of time investment sounds great to you right now, then I can wholeheartedly recommend [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i].",1705612553,1705612553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're not scared of the difficulty, you must try this game. And if you don't want, then watch it on yt because the story is too good to just miss out on it because is too hard for you.
As the finall [b]tip[/b]: DO NOT GET THE TRAIN. I had a luck that i didn't get it in my first gameplay but i know that it makes most people restart entire runs to day 1. And also be wary of a doctor from old days, because he isn't what he seems to be.",1705347202,1705492092,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game is a fucking nightmare. It is from hell. This game is an agonizing slog that will take years off your life because you realize 20 hours into your run you cant do the boss fights because of an abnormality you picked 15 hours ago. It is a massive grind. It is soul crushing and agonizing and miserable and stressful and hateful and starts to require an ungodly amount of micromanaging to clear certain threats. The core gameplay loop stops being difficult and becomes EXTREMELY repetitive, especially if you picked up abnormalities like Magic Girl or Ticket to Hell that force you to constantly micromanage some malarkey, and when you're zerging a tough anomaly every healthbar stacks on top of itself and you cant tell if someone's low so you have to get the stacking healthbar mod, it's mandatory, and while you're at it get the detailed statistics mod because ""Very High, High, Common, Low, and Very Low"" are terrible denominators once you find out that an Abnormality's response to two different interactions can be rated ""High"" but that's a 15-20% difference, which is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT if you have an abnormality that only wants a very specific result. 
This game is very micro-management heavy, but it is almost completely lacking in any form of meaningful automation tools. That means you have to keep re-assigning agents to abnormalities, you have to keep an agent in every hallway prior to a red dawn ordeal, and while there are abnormalities which punish repeated assignments, the overwhelming majority of abnormalities can safely be spammed with the same approach by the same agent ad nauseum. While WAW and ALEPH abnormalities punish overuse by decreasing success rates, and for some of them it's severe enough to force you to stop using them, but a lot of them can be safely milked for all they're worth, as the Qliphoth meltdown resets their exhaustion. This forces the player to utilize a wide array of abnormalities to consistently make quota, because with each meltdown 
the game gives you a chance for a free go at one of your most lucrative abnormalities, or a forced interaction with an abnormality that poses a significant risk to your agents or the facility as a whole. Unfortunately, with the game's meta progression, the Qliphoth meltdown gets nerfed significantly, to the point where it removes a lot of the fun decision making, and it also drags out each day's run time because you're not getting the surplus of energy that meltdowns trigger.
Meeting the quota is never a struggle. the real challenge is when the game wants you to make it to a certain level of Qliphoth meltdown, with two of the game's quests involving you taking on a midnight ordeal, which are very challenging fights that are very punishing, that if you screw up bad enough can send you back 20-30 minutes. 
But I really like this game. It's really, really compelling. The setting is really unique, despite wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, and the worldbuilding is always incredibly intriguing and makes you desperate for the rare glimpses you get into the outside world as you unravel a horrifying, Sisyphean loop that is sustained by blood and tears. It's also the only SCP management type game I can think of, and for all of the problems I have with this game, it has provided me with an experience completely unlike any other game I've played, for better and for worse. I am very excited to be able to move on to the rest of Project Moon's catalog because they all take place in the same world, and I'm desperate to dive more into this setting, but I want them to one day try this SCP management formula again, because there are so many different directions to take this concept, there are so many improvements to be made, there could be a passionate modding scene if there was a toolkit available to this fanbase, I really want to one day see a redo of this game, with all of the budget and experience that Project Moon has gained on full display.",1705472900,1705472900,True,2,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

The characters and many of the anomalies are very interesting. However, I was constantly frustrated by needing to figure out each anomaly through trial and error and replaying each day until I could get through the day without any employees dying. I felt like I was save hacking, but there didn't seem to be any better alternative.

The anomalies should have more meaningful clues or start with enough context that I don't need to just restart the day enough times to try all the work+agent combinations until something works. Some anomalies were just annoying. I had one that needed to be interacted with every two minutes or it would kill random people. I found dealing with such things to feel more like a chore than meaningful interactions.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was an anomaly I got on day 21. It looked like a gray box with circular saws for hands. Nothing I tried would generate any energy boxes, so I couldn't get any clues to how to work with it. It just escaped every time I worked with it for every work type, and I had a level 5 agent working with it. Maybe there's some magical combination of stats I need to work with it, but I don't want to keep restarting my day until I get the lucky combination...",1705462981,1705462981,False,1,1,0.483221471309661865,0,True,False,False

First off, this (hard as ♥♥♥♥) game is a madhouse simulator. You're basically trying to farm energy from a bunch of psychotic monsters called abnormalities (like SCPs) that are about as stable as my last relationship and just like exes - unpredictable and dangerous. All abno's can ruin your life if you don't pay attention, each of them having their own risk level and a set of (initially hidden) rules or guidelines that you are asked to follow to make sure they don't escape and/or kill your personnel. Later on, any 'accidents' in your facility can lead to a chain reaction of death and decay which will force you to restart the day (sometimes causing you to waste 20-40 minutes :D). Btw, for the true ending you'll have to restart YOUR ENTIRE RUN once or more since it requires you to have researched ALL abnormalities! ALSO, RNG CAN BE A ♥♥♥♥♥.

This game is a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ excercise in patience, and frankly I would not recommend anyone play it. BUT, if you do decide to go through all the pain and hardship... you'll find yourself strangely rewarded. The story is great and is surprisingly deep and intricate. Every abnormality feels unique, and seeing your facility grow in size and complexity over time feels like you're always progressing. The music goes mega hard. There are mods out there that either fix bugs, add some QoL, new abnormalities and armour/weapons, etc.

In the end, LC isn't just about surviving through all the days; it's about embracing the insanity that goes with it. It's a rollercoaster ride through a nightmare that you (eventually) can't help but enjoy. It's stressful, it's overwhelming, but damn, it's satisfying.

Although I'm sad that it ended, it was worth it.",1653310389,1704517233,True,3,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

Lobotomy Corporation is a game about failure. You WILL fail. Repeatedly. You will have to do days over and over again. Sometimes even weeks over again. And, eventually, most people will need to restart from day 1. 
But, that's fine. This game isn't exactly fair. But, it's still pretty fun, if you like to manage stuff.

With all that out of the way, now I'd like to discuss the mechanics, story, art, and other things like that.
The actual mechanics of the game are pretty simple - Click on work to do. Find out if it's good, or not, learn about that thing, repeat. Occasionally, die, or kill things by sending people after it. Pretty simple, but alot of trial and error, and alot of repetition.
The story is pretty nice - I've not finished the actual ""true ending"" yet, but I know of its existence. I don't want to touch on it too much, as it's very spoiler heavy, but I think it's a neat world, and the other games in the series expand on it.
Personally, I love the artwork in this game. I love how it is contrasted with the darker tone of the game, as well as the violent deaths your agents will be having. I also quite enjoy the sections in the game where the art changes to be more realistic, rather than cartoon like. Overall, I think it's good.
The balance is pretty bad, both in and out of the players favor. Some abnormalities feel way too strong for their class, while others feel basically like a non-issue for how dangerous they are considered. But, at the same time, the magic missile rifle exists, and it really funny. But, being more serious, basically any abnormality that deals pale damage early in the game is quite strong, and should be avoided, at least until you get a few high level employees (Judgement bird destroyed me when I first got it, and since then I've been scared of Pale damage).
Some abnormalities are also not difficult, but rather annoying, such as Plague doctor, as it constantly moves around. As far as I'm aware, there's only one other abnormality that moves around, however. Don't touch me also exists, and should be interacted with frequently, as it's incredibly funny.

All in all, if you've read all that, I take it you're already knowledgeable enough, or have a decent enough interest in this game. In either case, best of luck, managers. You've got some PE boxes to generate.",1704132990,1704132990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A few of the final days are complete garbage regardless of what you have, though. I think generally you'll have more fun than not, but when you get a bad pick it may ruin your entire run alongside your mood (for a bit). I had to do a 2nd run in order to beat the game and when I originally was forced to restart my original one, it was due to the fact that I had about one of the worst facilities you could have [b]AND THEN[/b] got a specific abnormality that made it impossible for me to beat the day I was on. In case you're curious, it was [spoiler]WhiteNight on day 16 alongside Army in Black which I got the day before; I was unable to manage either of them.[/spoiler] Anyway, I obviously wasn't very happy. In fact, I dropped this game for about a week after that because my interest in it temporarily dropped to 0 after getting fucked over that much. 

However, my 2nd run is the reason why I still recommend this game regardless. I had a [b]TON[/b] more fun with it compared to my previous one, partially due to how I decided to treat abnormality picking. I streamed the game to friends (who have played the game themselves) mainly for fun, and whenever it came time to pick an abnormality I asked them which ones to avoid choosing, just in case there happened to be any at all. Then, I selected whichever one seemed the most interesting to me from the vague descriptions in-game out of the options I had left (unless I could only pick 1 of course lol). As for [spoiler]the tool abnormalities[/spoiler], I searched up what they did and picked for myself. That's just how I chose to enjoy the game and while I don't think anyone necessarily needs to do something like this to have fun, it really helps if you are afraid of getting unlucky, [b]ESPECIALLY[/b] if it has happened before to you like in my case. Also, I would recommend to anyone playing the game for the first time to immediately download the ""more detailed info"" mod at the very least. It has QoL changes that very much should be in the vanilla game.

With all that aside, Lobotomy Corporation is worth a shot. It's definitely one of those games that clearly isn't for some people, but I still think anyone should try it out because it has a lot of charm to it that may interest you enough to like the game, even if you aren't normally into micromanagement games of its type. In my opinion, if you aren't having fun by at most day 15, then it's likely not for you. If you are into it though, good luck. This is definitely not an easy game. I almost wanted to quit a few times and just watch the rest of the story on YouTube because some of these days were not very fun at all (only a few, but they SUCK).",1701621972,1703845797,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

-given me multiple lesbian panic attacks
-given me multiple ACTUAL panic attacks
-has made me write entire essays worth of contingencies, strategies, and game plans for a single ingame day
-has repeatedly sucker punched me after i dare think the thought ""Surely it can't get worse than this""
-has made me laugh, cry, and stare blankly at my screen in terror and concern
-has kept me up at night way more times than i care to admit

Storywise, it's one of the best games I've ever played for the characterization and worldbuilding alone, but in terms of gameplay it's a spaghetticoded laggy nightmare. I would not recommend playing it without casual and optimization mods, as the second half of the game can become extremely grindy and punishing (and the memory leaks tend to make certain missions extremely aggravating.)

Also, don't try to 100% the Seed of Light in your very first blind run. Not even out of spite.

You got these weird korean scps you need to play simon says with to gather energy and unlock their information, if they escape you gather all your little dudes and beat the living soul out of the monsters. Some monsters oneshot so you have to kite by pausing the game and ordering your guys to move to another room. After day is over your little dudes gain more stats rpg style depending on which work color they did and you give them stronger weapons and armor which most of them are reskins.

That's literally all the gameplay.

You will do this for 130 hours.
There are also boss fights that give you a handicap (not a smart/interesting one. you get stuff like your screen is pixelated, all your stats are lowered etc) or make you fight a robot with one shots you need to dodge by kiting. You also have to grind a quite bit to stand a chance at later days or at least cheat by downloading some QoL mods.

Just watch a funny lobotomy video on youtube and move on. This is not the SCP game you are looking for. This is an ""experience"" game. The experience being grinding and suffering through a clunky awful game for 100+ hours and that's the point of the game kinda.

Pros: It gets easier the more you play, It has some unique ideas you (probably) haven't seen in the ancient tales of SCP.
Cons: Sometimes it becomes infuriating when something gets out, the ALEPH abnormalities punish you for thinking that this will be no problem and that's about it?

Working with them generates energy, and your goal is to meet a daily energy quota to finish a day and advance to the next.

The game's strongest aspect is its very unique atmosphere. There's a very wide variety of bizarre entities, ranging all the way from the weird and funny to the incomprehensible and nightmarish, each one with its own lore that you gradually unlock as you work with them. The game has a very mysterious and ominous vibe to it, and an intriguing story that'll always keep you wondering what's next. On top of that, the soundtrack is also great; there aren't many songs overall, but those that the game does have are quite memorable and fit the dark, bizarre atmosphere very well.

Each abnormality is unique and has its own set of guidelines that you'll slowly uncover as you work with it, and you'll learn the most effective ways to deal with each abormality, and how to avoid your employees dying a horrible (perma)death when working with them. However, the game lets you retry each day as many times as you want, so you have an infinite supply of time to figure things out and master the game.

As you work with abnormalities, you also unlock extra equipment for your employees: first there's armor that not just helps protect them when an abnormality breaches and must be suppressed, but it also protects them during the work itself, as the simple act of working with an abnormality already deals damage. Second, there are weapons that help you suppress breaching abnormalities and other enemies that occasionally appear. Third, there are ""gifts"", little items that give each employee a small bonus in certain stats. Therefore, the game encourages you to work with all abnormalities and unlock all equipment associated with them. However, you need to be careful, because, If an employee dies, you lose their equipment and must get it again.

Due to its high difficulty, the game has some systems that help you grow stronger and more prepared for the endgame. Namely, if you restart the story mode, you actually keep all the equipment you got, and also all the information you've gathered on abnormalities, as well as any general upgrades you've unlocked. Therefore, it's a good idea to occasionally restart the game because you'll be stronger each time, and it never feels like grinding, because there are so many different abnormalities to discover, and it's impossible to see all of them in a single run. So every new restart feels fresh and fun, especially as you become more experienced and manage to beat the first few days more easily.

All in all, Lobotomy Corporation is a very unique game with an amazing atmosphere and engaging gameplay, and it presents you with a tough but fun and rewarding challenge. It'll pull you into its bizarre, intriguing world and keep you coming back to learn more and master it.",1702483087,1702483087,True,41,1,0.789476156234741211,0,True,False,False

1. if i didn't make it clear already, this game is HARD
2. clearing every mission of a department is helpful, but also will produce a new challenge  later on unless you are already past the point i'm referring to when i say ""later on"" (i cant remember which day)
3. if multiple abnormalities seem to share a common theme, it probably means they affect each other or have a special effect when you have all of them (i'm talking about you ""birds"" (also yeah watch out for the birds. and unless you want to do a memory repository, don't let all 3 escape at once))
4.employees are super easy to kill so make sure you stock up.
5. some work types will have a special effect when its used on a certain abnormality, and its usually a negative effect. so yeah watch out.

One must imagine x happy

edit: Im not really good with making serious reviews but Ill try just this once for this game. 

Despite everything it made me went through, this game is one of my favorites. The days may be rough and challenging but each time I got access to a piece of the lore by completing them to figure out what is going on in this place, I felt pretty good. Mostly everything included in the game is canon to the universe,the ordeals forshadow the future, the abnormalities are all unique with their own cool designs and mechanics that will make you either love them or hate them. This game also have a banger responsive ost when things dont go your way. Its a management game and things will go south pretty quickly if you dont pay attention to the abnormalities in your facility. Every choice you will make is going to be bad and thats on you, Its how you weight them with your experiences through the loops that will make you a better manager.

Personally what I love the most is that the whole point of the game is trying to make things right. As you continue your grind toward the end of the game and develop each departements to get to the next layer, you get to learn more about the sephiraths. They are in a way your assistants as well as being your tormentors. Their traumas and guilt will be redirected toward you and you will have to overcome them in special events that you can trigger when you feel ready for it called : core suppresions. They can range from pretty fun once you get the gist of it to extremely painful but despite that really enjoy the sort of bond that you can make with them as they finally come to their own realization and change their point of view to hope toward another future.

Even though all of this may sound great its a pretty hard game to recommend. All of project moon games have a difficulty spike and this one will test your patience as you will make mistakes because of your lack of knowledge. You will have to restart either the day, the facility or memory rep a lot of times to make it through the end. For that I recommend using mods to better the quality of life like chesed fixed if you are able to make it to that departement, perma agent but mostly the one that allows you to see the stats percentage of each work types (i always forget that mod name sorry). It wont spare you from the suffering that this game brings but it should at least alleviate the pain a little bit. After all this facility is your own prison and you will have to discover the point of all of this by yourself(or with the wiki if you dont feel like it lol).

I recommend that you get this game on sale, you may like it, you may hate it or perhaps you may persevere and come to love it. I wish that you give this game a chance as well as other ones. Project moon are really great with their story telling and I only wish that you enjoy their universe as much as their fan do.

With this i wish you all best of luck if you do pick it up.

This hidden gem offers a unique and interesting world and gameplay that kept me invested enough to do a full playthrough despite the game's steep learning curve and difficulty. 

For pros, i would say that the visual style, gameplay loop, horror elements and interesting post-apocalyptic world were very fun and kept me very engaged. The game is very SCP containment breach meets management sim, which is something i haven't seen done  before. 

That being said, there are definitely some real negative things about the game.
The most striking thing to me was the lack of trigger warnings for the shock content in the game. To be very frank, I would not recommend playing this game if you are sensitive to topics of [spoiler] Suicide and Self harm. [/spoiler] The way that the game handles these topics is very insensitive and poorly handled. [spoiler] Suicide [/spoiler] is a massive focus of the game's story and is shown in graphic detail in several different ways- even in the gameplay itself. There are also items in game that make very insensitive remarks to [spoiler] self harm, [/spoiler] which made me very uncomfortable. 

This game features many different types of horror in the stories of it's various monsters- from slasher-type monsters to purely psychological-horror inspired entities- but for every unique, interesting and familiar take on horror one might also find something done just for shock value, which i think takes away from the experience. If you love shock horror and don't care about the game's insensitive handling of topics of mental health, [spoiler] suicide, self harm and drug addiction [/spoiler] (perhaps if those things just don't bother you), i would recommend the game. 

Another quick thing to mention is that i would not recommend this game at all if you are looking for a casual gameplay experience. This game is incredibly difficult- and, without the heavy use of a wiki, will result in many, MANY failed runs before you will likely be able to get too far. The difficulty spike as you progress is a straight-up vertical wall, and the game does not hand-hold you with tutorials. It can be very difficult to understand and learn if you haven't played before. 

Overall, I would recommend Lobotomy corporation, but please remember to be safe when dealing with the  triggering topics and content of the game, as i do not believe the game properly warns the viewer of the sensitive topics that it fumbles around with constantly, and could cause significant discomfort in the wrong person.",1701383698,1701383698,True,0,0,0.460251063108444214,0,True,False,False

The abnormalities aren't even the worse thing [spoiler]besides White Knight[/spoiler] because the game throws a bunch of things at you that make you plan your work orders wisely and makes sure you won't stay on one day too long, I found it a little frustrating when one of your agents dies and you memory rep they don't get their stuff back and when I did a day one rep I lost all the gear my agents had equipped and i had to find those abnormalities again in order to get them back I also find it annoying when a abnormality brakes out when you [spoiler]get a good result like with silent orchestra or when you work too fast with meat lantern.[/spoiler]

Lobotomy Corporation is one of the most fun games i have ever played, its also one of the hardest, that ""difficult"" tag is not lying during your first play through you WILL have to restart the week, that being you lost a lot of employees or you got an abnormality that is too difficult to contain, your first play through will have at least one restart (and that's where i find some of the charm of this game), so this is a basic review for someone who has stubble onto this hidden gem of a game

[h1] Whats the premise of the game? [/h1]

This is a Tycoon/manger simulator that is based of the SCP foundation, each day you get a new abnormality, varying in difficulty, to competed a day you need to work on abnormality (4 types of work, some are better than others on certain abnormality) to get Enough E-box to pass the day, using said E-box can be researched to discover more about the abnormality and its habits or use to acquire armour and weapons, with some armour/weapons being able to deal more damage/take more damage while doing less/Being vulnerable to other, there are several other cogs that make this game work that im not getting into, if you want a new-player guide/you are expecting a new player guide, this isn't it (i might do one if this review goes well)

[h1] Whats the Story of the game? [/h1]

(Without getting into spoiler territory) a basic intro into this game, you are the new manager of lobotomy corporation, a company that uses AIs and employees to farm Abnormalitys for their energy, your new job is to insure nothing goes to shit, i could explain more but this is a story that's better if you don't know anything going into it

[h1] Should i get it? (rating) [/h1]

Absolutely, although i ""complain"" in the beginning that the game is rage inducing, pretty much all of the time it was your fault, you didn't read something correctly, you didn't suppress that threat immediately, you were lazy and didn't check all the abnormalitys for danger and for that and

[*] Amazing visuals

[*] A good game play loop

[*] and unique remixes of already created Characters (fairy tales)

The more I play Lobotomy Corporation, the more I hate it. I don't think it's fun that the fanbase wants everyone to look up the wikipedia. That takes me out of the game. I like to [i]discover[/i] how things work, but everything here just feels cheap, unfinished, and full of padding.
Additionally, I feel like this game is wasting my time. You are encouraged to play perfectly, or reset days, and there are plenty of possibilities that you can get stuck rerolling the dice on whether something dangerous is going to break out and kill everyone, the further you go. If you don't play to an A or S rating, you WILL get stuck, eventually. Plus, the vague epitaphs of the SCPs you unlock are rarely clear on what danger grade they are. You can't even see it until you unlock enough information on them, which is only available after working with them, which is only available after many resets of trial and error. This is [i]why[/i] fans direct newcomers to the wiki, but it's just bad design.
I've seen a post in the forum complaining how the game is too easy, and they're on Day 19. 
First off, the more SCPs you get, the more likely you'll get harder ones.
Secondly, I got to Day 17, and have at least two world ending difficulty SCPs in my facility that make it nearly impossible to manage. At this point, I'd have an easier time if I restarted to Day 1, but again, that's just not fun. The story wouldn't change, considering that it's a visual novel narrative, unlocked by progressing missions for each department.
Yeah, definite thumbs down. As cool as the concept is, and as much as it hurts to say this, Lobotomy Corporation is just a bad game.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I'd give this a mixed button if it existed.
I want to give this game a thumbs up, but its ""Gotcha!"" mechanics piss me off. There'll be a lot of stuff you can only do through trial and error, and while some of that is fine, there's so much of the game that is pure trial and error. The problem is, when all is going well, the end of the day goes to hell, where you had no warning on what was about to happen. This forces you to restart entire game days, or lose your items and advantage for future runs. If employee deaths were less punishing, this wouldn't be so bad, and further encourage exploration without resetting the day. However, Lobotomy Corporation encourages resets. Lame.
Some elements of the UI are cumbersome. There's unnecessary headache.
All this said, the story is great so far. The concept is interesting. I just think the execution of gameplay is sub-par.
[strike]Additionally, this game does not save after every day, so you can't just play it in short sessions. You have to put an hour or two of your time in every game, or leave the game open.[/strike]
IMPORTANT: Sometimes the save system works, and sometimes it doesn't. It might be more consistent by going back to the menu at the beginning of a day. After you ""Begin Management"", Reset the Day, then Go Back to the Menu.",1697990328,1699473504,False,1,0,0.475606024265289307,0,True,False,False

The OST is genuinely one of the best I've ever heard, because the second and third warning OST can make you feel like you're going to need to restart your entire game, but genuinely all of the OST is really good.
The Abnormalites are all original and genuinely some of them are really concerning, and annoying. (MAGICAL GIRL FUCK OFF)
Despite only getting to day 19, the story is really good,
That's all I have to say about the story.
The gameplay can sometimes be like ""take all employee and supress abnormality."", but sometimes you have to put strategy into what E.G.O gifts some should have, the weapons, the suits, and the strength ening and promoting of employees.
Difficulty can vary to easy to restarting back to day 1, so overall it has a nice range of difficulty.

So... it turns out that the Koreans really love SCP stuff. Like, there's even a Korean comic about SCPs. It's all the rage around artist types, and thus this game came to be.

This game is a strategy game visual novel management sim.... a heck of a bunch of genres to deal with, and oh goodness does it do them right. At first, it seems to be a visual novel mixed with a type of management story and the sim gameplay to go along with that fictional setup, but as the game continues, it slowly evolves into a real time strategy game with RPG elements within the architecture of a simulation game and a visual novel. This is because you are dealing with more, things get tougher, and you learn to use strategy to balance your teams to deal with threats, which vary and can ruin your day.

I was suggested this game by a guy on the internet. In poor English described it as Korean Evangelion. If this sounds like the start of a good horror story, that is because it is, because this is actually inspired by SCP stuff rather than Evangelion, although they both use the same references to some awesome effect. This game is a messed up good time and partial bad time. It is actually far less horror than I thought, and am pleased to know such.

How it plays? It is a point and click sim game inspired by SCP stuff. You farm monsters and abominations for their energy and stuff. It is kinda crazy and I love it thus far. Very point and click, and the menus to a bit to get used to, but I love this game. However, as I said at the beginning, this is also much a strategy game with great complexity.

The big problem though is that it is tedious and it DRAGS. The random assortments of creatures you deal with, the grind of unlocking things, and the forced replays only to get the ending are painful, and getting the true ending is even more absurdly difficult, only for it to bait you with a sequel.",1607187518,1698902861,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm ashamed of what I became when I played this game, yet, never before have I gained such power. NO ONE is meant to play the game the way I played it. I should have reset to day one the moment I got D-01-106 at day 12, as noon or dusk events would inevitably kill clerks which would inevitably release the bitch who would then kill everyone. We were too weak then to fight back.

And, and yet, somehow, I persisted. I ascended. I rushed execution bullets. Starting waiting for clerks to overlap so I could take out 3 or so at once. Would spend the first few qliphoth levels spamming bullets just so I could clear out all the clerks. Once they were gone, then the true day could begin. By day 35 I had trauma-bonded with my nuggets and refused to let any of them die, and we were past fearing what a mere army could do. Memory reposited more times I could count in order to 100% the abno records without having to do a full reset, and to do the ""boss"" missions without losing an employee. It was madness. It was unhealthy. I should have just let them all die.

What did I do it for? What hollow satisfaction? When I spent two hours in the winning attempt battling T-03-46 with a single surviving employee I knew in my heart that once this challenge was conquered there was nothing left but to reposit one last time and then finally take on the end game. By god, I did it. But I was empty. What left did I have to live for?  My friend told me there was a sequel. With tears in my eyes, I realised maybe it didn't have to be the end.

But then, as I examined the steam store page, horror filled me, greater than hearing the popping buzz of a bee or the drop of second trumpet ever could, greater than hearing ""I love you"" repeating in an eerie childish timbre. 

The sequel is a card game.  :(

Lobotomy Corporation takes places in a parapsychology research company responsible for supplying energy to a metropolis called The City. You are the manager of the aforementioned facility and your responsibility is the training of your agents and ensuring the production of energy. The energy, denoted 'Enkephalin/PE boxes', results from the interaction between your agents and eldritch creatures called abnormalities. Each abnormality has a work preference, and it is your job to discover their preferences to facilitate the efficient energy flow.

[h2]Some may fall, but their knowledge lives on.[/h2]
One of the essential parts of the LobCorp is that your agents are disposable. Your main progression comes from the gear you acquire from the abnormalities you work with and the missions you complete that are given to you from your subordinates. Another part of the game comes from training your agents, your agents gains stats depending on the danger level of the abnormality, the damage they receive and how successful their work is(how many PE boxed they produce). You are going to be resetting a lot, which also resets the stats of your agents, so it takes less priority until you collect enough gear and complete the missions.

Lobotomy Corporation is a long-winded journey that rewards you with great lore that piques your interest, including very memorable characters that are sure to leave a mark on you. It took me about 143 hours to completely finish the game in a blind playthrough, and despite the hardships that I had to face I can say with the confidence that every single minute of my playtime was worth it.",1698252509,1698298808,True,54,0,0.779058158397674561,0,True,False,False

For me though, the grindiness just isn't to my taste. The game isn't mechanically diverse or complex enough to really differentiate days from each other in the same way that other roguelikes like Binding of Isaac do, and the management aspect of the game becomes very simple once you've trial and error'ed your way through the different monsters' traits.  

It ends up being very repetitive, especially given how long days end up getting near the end. There are various boss fights and random combat events to spice up each day, but the combat feels too clunky for those to be enjoyable, at least for me.

A lot of this is personal preference however, and ultimately I don't hate the game. If Steam had a better rating system, I would probably rate this game as mixed, or 3/5.",1698003704,1698003704,False,2,0,0.496876120567321777,0,True,False,False

Its very much about management but not just numbers, you have to memorize each abnormalities info to a T or else you're pretty much ****ed. And that's like, 50 at a time.

Its incredibly hard. But its also really rewarding once you know what you're doing.

The translation especially for the abnormality texts is really off. Its charming, but kind of hard to understand whats going on for quite a few of them, or maybe I'm just illiterate.

And once the energy cap required for day end increases into the hundreds it can get pretty boring, especially on repeat playthroughs which is needed for completion as its a soft-roguelike.

The art style is cute and simple but I kind of wish it was a bit more disturbing or less restrictive for the abnormalities in particular, cause the horror isn't really there for most of them, at least in my opinion.

The story is really interesting and engaging, but it being locked behind tons of incredibly hard challenges is a bit annoying, I can imagine its worse for people who aren't too used to management games or extreme difficulty in general.

Its good, especially for a studios first game. Im pretty excited to play the next installment in the universe. But its a bit exhausting to put dozens of hours into a game like this, but I realize that's my fault, lol.",1691214858,1697676945,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lobotomy Corp. and LoR both suffer from extreme mechanic bloat, poor pacing, frustrating mechanics, pointless grinding, and a complete lack of elegance. It really is a shame, because they're also some of the most interesting and creative games that I've ever played.

[h2]Bloated Mechanics[/h2]
There are so many different ideas, it feels like the game is going all over the place. Both games feel absolutely overwhelming when starting out, unless you spend the time to read everything. Usually, this isn't a problem, but both games introduce many mechanics, often without a proper tutorial. There are many mechanics that are one-offs, or entirely redundant. LoR is especially guilty of this, introducing a new Keyword almost every new invitation in the mid-game, and not adding any useful support pages for existing Keywords. Lobotomy Corp isn't free from this either, as the novelty of adding a new anomaly to your facility wears off after you collect enough boxes to fully understand how to manage them (usually before the day even ends).

[h1]Poor Pacing & Pointless Grinding[/h2]
It's no secret that Project Moon games have poor pacing, with sharp difficulty spikes. Again, this usually isn't an issue with most games. I spent 4 hours learning all of Margit's attack patterns in Elden Ring, because I decided to rush through the game as a low level wretch. Even if it was difficult, beating him was immensely rewarding because I could feel myself getting better as time passed. In both Lobotomy Corp. and LoR, most problems can be solved if you spend enough time on it. If you want to play efficiently, both games get boring very quickly. In Lobotomy Corp, there are multiple situations in which you can hard lock yourself into losing the game and you lose about 2 hours of progress because of it. Not only that, but you really have the option to grind for E.G.O gifts and boxes if you want to unlock everything by the next day. I want to be managing my anomalies, not waiting for drops when I know there's no risk involved. Still, this pales in comparison to LoR's book system. Even after multiple revisions, it's still incredibly grindy. The decision to not have all of the pages unlock once you beat an invitation is absolutely awful from a design perspective. The game is already quite long for an indie title, and adding in grinding heavily takes away from the experience. It only serves to slow the gameplay down, so you're not absolutely overwhelmed by the next new crazy mechanic that's just right around the corner. It gets even worse when we get to the bosses. Boss fights can take up to an hour, and you're rewarded with nowhere near the number of books that you need to actually get all of the useful cards that you want. It's a massive grindy time sink for literally no reason. The [spoiler]Purple Tear[/spoiler] pretty much made me quit LoR because of the amount of time I would need to spend grinding in order to beat the next invitations.

[h1]Frustrating Mechanics & Lack of Elegance[/h1]
This is probably my biggest issue with Project Moon's games. The amount of time you spend not playing the game usually exceeds the amount of time you're actually doing stuff. This is a shame, because the stuff that you would be doing if you were just playing the game is usually quite interesting. Having individual decks for all of the Librarians is interesting, until you realise how much time you just spent creating 15 decks so you can beat the next invitation in LoR (of which I can usually beat first try). To a lesser extent, this is also visible in Lobotomy Corp., as every single agent has their own resistances and you need to pay attention what goes where, depending on the abnormalities they're going to be working. If you want to win, it's a whole bunch of reading, and not a lot of playing.

I just want to say that I really love both games. I love the world, I love the music, I love the ideas in both games, but they have so many issues which make it impossible to recommend them. There are so many roadblocks put in place for you to just not enjoy the game, which wouldn't have a harmful effect on the game if they were removed. You're punished by playing optimally, because it just ends up in optimising all of the fun out of the game. It's a known meme that LoR players don't know how to read, but perhaps they're better off that way - they have less to think about, and would rather think it's all decided by dice rolls.

The game does a fantastic job of layering rule upon rule that you'll need to integrate into your workflow and it's a lot of fun to manage, but it requires 100% of your attention at all times.

There’s over a hundred funky little freaks each with harrowing backstories and super interesting designs. Each day you choose from 3 monsters to unlock, and you have to figure out how to extract their energy without dying in the process.

The gameplay loop is real good for sure, but I couldn’t actually beat the game. I put 20 hours in and saw that it would apparently take 100 hours to beat, and I’m not that strong-willed lol. I’m not a speedrunner and I’m not the kind of guy who looks at really complex puzzles (like the extra stuff in The Witness) and goes “oh yeah, I’ll make 100%-ing that game my life for the next 4+ months” 😂

Lobotomy Corporation is an incredible concept that is horribly horribly botched in execution. 

There are so many tiny things that pile up to make the experience worse. 
The performance is TERRIBLE
Tons of information is needlessly hidden, forcing you to either repeat the same operations over and over through trial and error or endlessly consult the wiki (I did the latter and am very glad I did)
The balance is all over the place, and is generally very unfair and hits you with a bevy of cheap tricks that aren't communicated to the player well

The good is there though. The story is excellent, the setting is fascinating, the characters are super interesting and get a ton of depth. The soundtrack while limited and repetitive over 100+ hours, is REALLY good, and the setup for the sequel is amazing. 

I can't in good faith recommend playing this game to anyone, but I am very glad that I played it if only because it'll make me enjoy playing Library of Ruina (a good game) a hundred times more

Before you send brave freedom fighters to glorious battle against the infidel (Before you start a bad ordeal or open up the cage of a funny Aleph, or worse)
Purge the infidel from your own land (Kill all clerks with execution bullets)
If thou does not have the righteous tool of allah, and the infidels gather strength from the blood, pray to him (If you don't have execution bullets and a abnormality that escapes after deaths, pray to god and hope you can take the domino flood like bigweld)
Send the weak and vulnerable to sanctum (Send all low level employees into a single elevator)
Gather the mighty and zealous (Gather all high level employees in a different elevator, maybe with one or two scattered around abnos that are at risk of breaking out and would lead to domino flood)
Ensure that the infidel does not grow more powerful as you strike them down (Make sure that they don't absorb/are immune to certain types of damage, split em up into either a seperate strike team or just condemn them to the crying corner where the low levels are)
Send forth the righteous call for Jihad (Send one employee to open the door/start the event)
Engage in prayer to Allah, and he shall grant his protection to smite the foul agents of Shaitan (Bullets pierce your employees, letting you grant a shield to all of them at once if they're stacked together in an elevator)
Ensue in glorious battle using all means for the glory of allah, he has granted us the mighty caverns and mountains as our shield (Use strike force as situation calls, whether that be just slowly clearing the facility department by department, hit and run, or some cheese, elevators let you move to dodge attacks the fastest)
The weak and fragile should not be forgotten, for they shall sow the seeds of allah for tomorrow (Keep an eye on the weak/crying corner if they are at risk, move up/down the elevator to dodge/run as needed)
Allah's mighty Malāk shall come to the aid of the faithful if they only call and serve Allah (Use mercenaries liberally, farming energy is usually rather simple and safe)
Allah shall grant victory to those that eternally fight for his glory (Lobotomy corp is a hard game, and even with a good strategy it could take some tweaking/retries, to get it all right. Patience is required for many of them, never fight face-face unless you have an overwhelming advantage)

*Do not let the infidel sneak and lurk where he shall sow his seed of heresy (If the ordeal/abno teleports around and causes meltdowns, you do have to split up and cast a wide net)

You may mistake this game by it's steam page with a visual novel, it's not. In the review section, players care so much about story and are ready to pick apart single dialogue for hours - but it's not because there's all there is to the game - story dialogues are just a reward, a few lines of story, for going through the daily grind and near impossible challenges. 

The game starts pretty slowly and controls might be awkward at first, but they're actually very, very simple. It's just there probably isn't a game you've played before that's similar to Lobotomy corp and therefore it doesn't feel intuitive, it's not something you've done before. But you get used to it.

Figuring out with abnormalities and meeting energy quota isn't all there is - you can actually continue the day after meeting energy quota and you absolutely should - because you can train your employees that way. You can use LOB points for that, but you will eventually run out of those that way. So, the grind is the optimal way. I'd complain if it weren't the part of the story.

The abnormalities themselves have each their own rules - some apply facility-wide, some apply during working with the abnormality and some - during suppression. Breaking them usually ends up in abnormality escaping or killing employees. Some abnormalities could look similar in behaviour, but there are ones that start breaking the 4th wall and ones that do something you would never expect. There's an abnormality that has a progress bar (it looks like a clock, you'll know when you see it) and it fills up each time an employee works with it. I decided that I don't want to see what happens when it fills up, so I started the day over to reset it. When you see that it did not reset after starting a day over, or starting a week or the game over, you will shit bricks. And you just wait until the clock goes to 12.

The music might sound odd, but Lobotomy Corp absolutely O W N S it (even though not in a legal sense).
There isn't a single time in the game where any other soundtrack would seem more appropriate. Everything just FITS

There are also Sephirot missions. They ARE the story, they unlock new upgrades that make the game easier and you should prioritise doing them first. 
Some missions might look truly (but not the grinding kind) impossible. You might even think that something isn't translated correctly or it's mistyped [spoiler]or the Sephira giving the mission has gone mad[/spoiler], but every mission requires of you exactly what it says. 
But when you actually manage to pull the stunts required of you, you will feel fucking invincible. 
It's as though you are able to do anything now... Until you see the next mission. 
And it goes like that until the very end. 
And it feels totally awesome.

There will be boss fights, too... Just not in a sense they usually are in other games. Let's say that there are gameplay features that you really shouldn't be taking for granted and it's those features that give you an edge against whatever comes your way. 
But could you manage without them?
Boss fights hold a lot of surprises and some really good design. [spoiler]For example you literally cannot win against Malkuth - girl with a notepad, without having a physical notepad yourself. mind == blown. [/spoiler]
They managed to surprise me EVERY TIME, right to the last day. 
And the plot did so even a bit after the last day. 

Speaking of plot, the game manages expectations very, very well. Expectations getting flipped upside down is the most satisfying part. Can't talk about it without getting into spoilers though. I warned you:

You might think that the game is about monsters and that it's the part we have to uncover. 
[spoiler]But it's actually everything else. The story, the characters, the city above and it's troubles.[/spoiler]

You probably think that abnormalities are some alien creatures that ended up here somehow and we need to contain them. 
[spoiler]They're actually more human than anybody in your facility. And we are MAKING them to exploit them later![/spoiler]

[spoiler]You probably think that Angela is plotting something against you or the corporation after playing a few days 
It's MUCH more complicated than that. I don't know what to tell you. Play the game.[/spoiler]

After playing for some time, you will start to think that restarting the day and the memory repository is an awkward implementation of a save game feature. 
[spoiler]You couldn't be more wrong. It's actually an essential part of both the gameplay and the story by design. It brings another layer to the gameplay and explains A LOT story wise when you find it out.[/spoiler]

You might think you're a manager, clueless and fresh to the company and you should do what Sephirot and Angela tell you, like what Malkuth instructs you to do on day 1. 
[spoiler]You're actually A, the founder of the company. And the Sephirot, including Angela, are here against against their will, just because you willed it. And they're waiting expectantly, for you to pull them out of their misery and lead them somewhere.
[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The facility literally turns upside down on day 50. It actually looks like a tree that way. Then it sprouts from the surface and emits light. 
It just ALL MAKES SENSE in the end - the tree of light, the seed, the goddamn cactus on a desk eventually bearing a flower. And it's only one example of many.[/spoiler]

General gameplay advice though, while you're learning the ropes, do NOT use the fast forward tool. It is not your friend.

You'll step forth with the hope that tomorrow will be better. You'll recognize the loyalty of the faithful. And you'll muster up the courage to protect those who follow you.

You'll stand strong, and embrace the past to build the future. You'll face your paralyzing fear, to break the cycle that shackles you.

A few things carry over each time: The names/details of abnormalities you've fully studied, and Core Suppressions.  Without spoilers, Core Suppressions are 1 of 9 boss fights that you will challenge on certain in-game days, and these will unlock permanent upgrades and protect a part of your facility from RNG.

Your strategy will be to, in each run, learn as much about different abnormalities as you can, challenge a core suppression, and restart.  The game will get easier and you'll get further into the story, because when you're provided with a list of abnormalities to add to your facility each day, you will know how to handle them and the lethal combinations the game will try to bait you into. 

Very good game and story, but will drive you crazy.  If you are a perfectionist, you will [b]suffer.[/b]  
There is no such thing as a perfect run.  The employees you come to care for and raise will be slaughtered by situations you can't foresee or control.   Like balancing a bunch of spinning dinner plates, once one falls, the rest can and will too. The game drills into you the sense of ""acceptable losses"", and how you can't save everyone, and doing so otherwise is completely mad.  You will waste senseless amounts of time if you try to save everyone, and you need to learn to swallow your pride and handle the losses you'll face, and recognize when the game is telling you to restart or try a different approach.",1691783024,1691783024,True,9,0,0.588893413543701172,0,True,False,False

On a serious note, I love this game through hell and back, this game has taught me how expendable your little nuggets are and not to be attached even if they were your first nuggets. I myself would reset if even a single agent died, but as days passed and time went on, I ignored their deaths, I did get very frustrated at myself, but in the end I simply moved on with the day and replaced them quite instantly. The more departments you open, you will inevitably gain more abnormalities and even more employees, that means more things to keep track of and even more of your nuggets will die eventually from either a higher class abnormality breaking out or even from your own fuck ups. In the end, everyone you see in the facility is expendable, able to be replaced easily, you may even find yourself in more frustration from losing the aleph gear the agent had. Obviously this doesn't apply to every manager here, including me, but just because I said all this won't stop me from making sure to ensure the safety and longevity of my little nuggets and I hope my fellow managers will do the same.

""Not just “Fans”. They are men who in a community called DC. They said: While the female character is unexposed, the male characters claimed to be fired, saying the illustrator was like a ^feminist^

But they found that the illustrator who drew the swimsuit in question, without the exposure of the female character, was male. They think 'male illustrators can't be feminists and other female illustrators will be the problem'

+)They think of feminism as a social evil.

They researched another illustrator and found a female illustrator who had nothing to do with this incident. She once posted on her own social media, five years ago, against 'illegal filming'. They claimed it was evidence of 'feminist'.

Can you believe it?😂

For your information, the hashtag of the anti-illegal filming movement was ""My life is not your pornography."" Of course, there was some mirroring in her post at the time that could be radical. They believe it's male hatred.

They say the game will normalize when the company fires her: 1. Lots of revealing female characters come out 2. The game gets faster and better. 3. All systems unrelated to illustrations are improved. And the company answered all the comments by firing her.

And the company answered all the comments by firing her.

Now, the DC community says let's manipulate foreign public opinion!

It will literally destroy your mental and physical health. I've left a positive review, however I really would not recommend playing this game unless you're an experienced gamer without AHDH who is good at optimization and willing to whip out the wiki after a couple days in.

If you're trying to play this game to prepare for Library of Ruina but you're a casual gamer, give it a whirl on sale for 10-20 in-game days but, for your sake, watch a story video on youtube for the rest, or just read a synopsis. The true ending/epilogue is Not possible to do for most gamers for these reasons:
[spoiler]
- There will be Bosses that hard punish you for Pausing the game, which is a fundamental mechanic for not losing your mind keeping track of all the abnormalities you need to keep in check
- You will randomly forget one of the 50 ""If you break this rule your Agent simply dies"" abnormalities in your massive base
- Each day will get exponentially longer as you have more Agents, more facility levels, more abnormalities, and higher quotas to fulfill, AND there is no save state/quick save for the game so you could for example lose 2+ hours of work for a single day (multiple times) because of one random screw up you forgot about and have to start it all over, with different RNG
- And all this aside, the game is simply just hard. You HAVE to optimize or else you will fall behind. You can start a new run with some things that you've earned but idk, who has that kind of time (a complete run will take you 70-100 hours allegedly)
[/spoiler]

tldr: Wait for sale, go in blind (but open up guides and wiki once you feel mentally stressed), and stop and watch youtube / read a synopsis after you hit a wall. Unless you're a pro gamer without ADHD with months to spare, in which case go nuts. Its a very interesting experience, it just comes at a mental and physical cost irl!",1690118818,1690123023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly the gameplay loop is barebones and punishes the player for playing the game without providing any significant decisions to make.

Losing high level characters is basically the fail state of the game, it slows down the progression to a halt and you have to start the day, or the last 5 days over again. 

This game has no such thing as ""playing well"". Doing everything right means that you don't die and there's no way to gain a sense of momentum. The rewards are passive equipment and stat upgrades. 
You gain nothing special, and when you lose what you have you won't even feel an ounce of regret or sadness, but the stifling obligation to start over.

The arbitrary stat types (Instinct, Sanity, Temperance, Justice) are obscure and have no effect on gameplay or your playing style other than dealing different colors of damage and taking care of different colors of monsters in a rock-paper-scissors way. Being better at something barely changes the way a character plays. The way you approach a creature is nearly always the same. This is a game of 4 categories and lacks any meaningful mechanics.

This is like a base management game without any base building. No planning involved at all.
The combat is as shallow as an idle game minus the fun skills and unique equipment.

The events that happen randomly have no relevance to the creatures you contain in your facility. The monsters that spawn during an event, unlike your monsters, won't give you any information about how you deal with them. So it is not even trial and error but pure luck and confusion at that point.

There isn't any real reason to have multiple monsters other than the fact that the game forces you to do so. Otherwise you can just generate energy from a single one, they're basically cows that you have to milk and all they give you is the same milk. Although each monster visually has very distinctive features, this doesn't reflect into the gameplay. Your characters don't recieve their powers, don't gain experience from taking care of a type of entity. They don't specialize, they mean nothing to the player.

There is really not much point exploring this game. I can't see why you wouldn't just open a wiki page and play it that way. Or you can just read the wiki and skip playing altogether.",1690117229,1690120614,False,4,1,0.442613810300827026,0,True,False,False

You've probably already learned this from the other reviews, but to reiterate: this game is [b][u]HARD[/u][/b]. While the first few days may seem like a cakewalk filled with repetitive gameplay, you will soon find yourself entangled in a double-layered web of a quickly thickening plot and an ever-expanding facility containing deadlier monsters. The challenges ramp up significantly as you encounter story-relevant ""boss battles"" that can push you to the limits of adaptability. This game will slap your carefully planned routine out of your hands and laugh as your employees die horrible deaths as they scramble to suppress monsters that you [u]SWEAR[/u] you were monitoring carefully, but weren't. You will even come to find that certain basic game mechanics that you absolutely took for granted have turned out not to be a right, but a [i]privilege[/i] (here's looking at you, Atziluth residents).

The experience can seem punishing and unforgiving. The roguelite mechanic is integral to progressing past seemingly impossible roadblocks. Whether you activate the ""memory repository"" and rewind to the beginning of a week, or restart completely from Day 1, your facility and employees will be reverted/wiped, but the gear you have bought and information you have learned will remain intact. Sometimes, the only way to overcome the game's challenges is to reset and return with more experience in mind and better armaments in hand.

Personally, what pushed me to power through all of the trials and tribulations the game has to offer was its intriguing story. With every cutscene, you are left to piece together the past and ruminate on the future lying ahead for everyone involved with the corporation. There is a glimmer of hope hidden underneath all of the chilling, depressing, and forlorn moments in the plot. The way it ties into the gameplay at times does make you feel that you are ""facing the fear"" to ""build the future"" (ha ha). Your own experiences managing the facility can also end up as entertaining anecdotes; you will certainly find several in other reviews.

Lobotomy Corporation is certainly not for everyone. It is a game of trial and error, of accepting your failure, and of persevering in search of the light at the end of the tunnel. Those who are not fans of management games may find the basic gameplay loop to be boring. Those who hate trial and error may find the virtually-necessary resetting to be tedious and overly grindy. Those who dislike stories that are vague and metaphorical may find the plot to be overly convoluted, drawn-out, or outright confusing. And anyone can be a victim of the game's programming, which can be... jank at times (memory leaks are a commonly reported issue). For what it's worth, I was able to complete the game with almost no issues, but your mileage may vary.

If you're someone who enjoys glory through struggle as well as management games, then give Lobotomy Corporation a whirl (I recommend going in blind). You will likely quickly come to learn whether you love it or hate it.",1689310351,1689310401,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To start, this game has multiple different layers of gameplay. At Lobotomy Corporation's core, it's a monster management type of game (I don't actually know of any other monster management types of games, but they probably exist?). The main gameplay experience is encountering new types of monsters or anomalous items (Abnormalities), working with them to find out their unique abilities and behaviors, and stopping them from slaughtering everything they come into contact with. 

As everyone has already said, think SCP management game. 

As the game progresses, you will encounter new abnormalities and have to respond to them accordingly while accounting for all of the ones you already have in your facility and any potential ways they can interact with each other. One abnormality may seem completely normal and passive, but then working with a different one may trigger something to happen with or because of the first abnormality for example. It can get complex and quite difficult with the correct collection of abnormalities. 

While dealing with the abnormalities themselves, you will also have to take care of Ordeals, which are scheduled events of enemies invading the facility in ascending difficulty; as well as complete bonus objectives relating to the story's NPCs (the Sephirot/Sephirah). Completing these bonus objectives unlocks optional [spoiler](but required for the true ending)[/spoiler]  challenges to complete as well which will reward you with minor and or major boons for the rest of the playthrough if they are overcome. Some of them are extremely difficult though, and will only get harder as you complete more. 

In summary, you have to research new abnormalities, deal with existing ones, overcome the ordeals, and complete the Sephirah challenges. Well to be fair, all you HAVE to do is generate enough energy each day by working with any and all non-tool abnormalities, but that's not the real experience of the game of course. 

That's putting it plainly though. You will be tested and challenged and quite possibly be put into situations where you cannot realistically win. Good thing though - you can restart from day one and keep most of your progress, including abnormality dissolution and E.G.O. equipment (weapons and armor). The game is hard, possibly the hardest I've played and 100% completed, taking me 171.5 hours and there's only 50 days/levels in the game. 

The abnormality design is really good. I simultaneously was excited for and dreaded each new one all the way until the last. There are sentient and non-sentient (tool) abnormalities, extremely dangerous and mostly passive abnormalities, as well as helpful ones too. 

The story was fine. I didn't pay close enough attention though because it took me 171.5 hours and about 3 and a half ""playthroughs"" (quotes because they were basically mandatory for 100% completion and not full playthroughs like most games), but from what I gathered it's about a nearly apocalyptic and chaotic world where power and influence seem to mean everything and no line is too far to be crossed. 

The game can get buggy at times and the UI can be difficult to work with but not to a point where it can make things too hard to deal with, just uncomfortable. The game will also get lower and lower FPS as the days go on which will make it harder to control things, but it wasn't unmanageable. 

Soundtrack was good, really good at times, but for the majority I had my own music playing (as you tend to do after so much time). 

Difficulty is optional if you don't really care about 100% completion or the story that much. If you don't care it's pretty normal. If you care about the story it can be QUITE difficult. If you want 100% completion be prepared to spend nearly an hour on each level near the end and have to retry a good amount of things dozens of times. I played pretty much completely blind and without guides so that was just my experience. I honestly wouldn't discredit people if they needed some help coming up with a strategy for some of the challenges in the game and looked some things up, though brute force actually came through for me some times.

Easily one of my favorite games, definitely top 10. Could never have imagined how long it would take or how difficult some of the challenges were going to be 171.5 hours ago.

Upon reading more reviews I should mention that the game's difficulty is not the typical blend of ""hard"". Some people are going to find that forgetting to press a button every 120 seconds and multiple people dying because of that is not hard but tediously mundane and that's okay. If mechanics such as those turns someone away from the game then it's no one's fault, it's just not something they want to deal with. This game is much more unique than others and not meant for the majority of people and is not relaxing at all, which is the point of reviews and gameplay videos.

it is meant for a pretty specific kind of person, one who likes probing around in the dark with a flimsy stick while if you fuck up that stick bites your hand off, crashes your game, only doesn't bite when you stare directly at it, makes you draw straws to see who gets sacrificed, installs a waiting land mine *somewhere* that you have to shoot at, or sometimes the easy answer of ""everyone dies""
and learning what is biting you doesn't make it better when your interests sometimes make you have to risk a chomp
also the writing / story is great and the art for some of the monsters is downright ghoulish and terrifying, with others being Just A Puppy :)
this game definitely needs mods to a degree, namely Detailed Info, Optimization, as well as No Annoying Deaths if you're a coward like me (with a bunch of others that make it a bit less annoying) but it is truly an experience i've never seen in anything else

He was right, I did like IP a lot better after this game, but I will say full stop that if someone got you into this game cause the PM lore is amazing and you should get into it, get off this steam page and go watch a story recap. This game is not worth only the story if you can't get through the gameplay.

The game is a management sim, and some give it the title of roguelike because of the mechanic to restart to checkpoints or the whole game with your acquired information. You manage monsters with 4 types of work and occasionally they break out. This work is required because the game is divided into days that need an energy quota from that same work each day. Progressively, the quota and the risk of the monsters you handle increases. There's a small equipment system, and that's it. That's the whole game.

This game at face value is all about information. If you look things up, the experience will be spoiled drastically, as the mystery of figuring out what you have to deal with be it monster or otherwise is an exhilarating feeling. However, playing blind is also grueling because you end up throwing bodies to figure out exactly what you have to deal with, or you get blindsided midday and have to reset 30 minutes of progress. People that moan about the difficulty of Project Moon games are exaggerating, but this game isn't easy. The last few hurdles the game puts you through are challenging, and many people get stumped at the last stretch. If you know everything that is contained in your facility, by all means you have every right to handle anything that the game throws at you.

If you don't enjoy RTS games or at least the kind of gameplay that comes with them, don't play this game.
If you don't want to spend hours upon hours retreading days of progress, don't play this game.
If you don't like problem solving or strategizing with the bullshit this game sends your way, don't play this game.
This game is only worth it if you want to personally earn and learn the lore of Lobotomy Corporation.

For that specific reason, this game is definitely worth it, or maybe consider it on sale.
The few gripes I do have:
Replaying days is boring and a waste of time once you get far enough and reset, it's just speedrunning to the end of each day without the action to action planning you might have done the first time around.
The game isn't designed to be beaten in one go, and you should know that before you play.
Things like [spoiler] WhiteNight and Apocalypse Bird [/spoiler] are completely optional and can be missed if a player is ignorant or simply skilled/lucky enough. No clue if there should have been things hinting at them or their consequences.

Is this game hard? Yes. It is a game about trying, essentially, to trip up the player. It's a rube-goldberg machine of carefully calculated dick moves. There's an evergrowing list of rules with each abnormality you get: some very simple, others frustratingly complicated, but there is a list for each. For any rule, there is an abnormality with the exact opposite rule: some will punish you on Bad results, others on Bad or Neutral. Some will punish you on [i]only[/i] Neutral, some on Good or Bad results. The game will generously keep track of these rules as you discover them, but you are drawn endlessly into the web. You will get comfortable with these rules in time, but just as you get comfortable the game will begin to alter the deal, and your prayers that it not be altered further will fall on deaf ears. ""Is it hard?"" You know in being a Korean game it reminds me a lot of Starcraft and the Korean fascination with that: Starcraft is desperately hard, but if you know what to do, and can perfectly execute it, it's easy. If you can't, well, you'll endure. Restarting and Resetting are major game mechanics without which the game cannot actually be completed (literally it is not possible to complete the game in one run without at least one memory reset).

Is it interesting? [i]Desperately.[/i] The story told by Lobotomy Corporation is one I very much enjoy and one that draws you, the player, in as the participate. There aren't choices to make though; rather, the only choices are the ones you come up with to meet the challenges. For the game weaves the story and the difficulty together, as you, the Manager of this strange facility, desperately try to comprehend what it is that you are doing here and why.

You will come to love your agents, you will suit them up in a variety of colorful equipment, and you will send them to their horrible deaths over and over and over. Decapitated, eaten alive, flattened like a pancake, ripping off their own head, dragged to hell, digested by spiders, turned *into* an interdimensional spider, turning into a giant mushroom, turned into a small slime, turned into a large slime, vaporized, pulverized, incinerated, frozen, ground into meat chunks, killed by their fellow agents after they lost their minds and had to be put down, executed with impunity by the manager... and this is not even nearly close to the many deaths you will see them suffer. You will reset and do it again. The charmingly horrible deaths are a balm of sorts: I remember a desperately frustrating death, but watching the individual in question lower themselves into a bath full of blood and grimly deciding I needed to keep going with the day is part of the experience.

This game can be clunky, it's not exceptionally polished, there are infrequent graphical glitches and a few bugs that I had to go and install mods for (it's not necessary to do so, but I wanted to). This game will not be an easy experience, but if you are willing to Face the Fear, and Build the Future, you will enjoy it. I think that this game is [u]unrelenting[/u], and absolutely uncompromising, but slowly bending it to your will until you stand at the end over a pile of corpses and regrets in bloody triumph is one hell of an experience and one I am so glad I decided to play.

Lobotomy Corp. also builds the foundation and atmosphere for ProjectMoon's other titles, Library of Ruina and Limbus Company. ProjectMoon goes HAM on the lore aspects and soundtrack of the game.

Content advisory. This game touches on many dark themes and topics such as suicide/murder/drug use.

Pros : 

The world ProjectMoon has created with it's 3 games is nothing short of incredible. Multiple story arcs and endings give Lobotomy Corporation good replay value. Well worth the $8.50 USD sale price.

The OST for this game is an absolute banger. Whether or not your little homies are getting eviscerated or you're watching a dialogue intermission about how one of your empathetic decisions caused the massacre of everyone in an entire sector, the music does an amazing job at setting the tone.

Create your little guys and try to keep them alive... I promise you, you wont. But then again, you can always restart the day... Or turn back time... In a world where nothing is seemingly impossible due to monsters(Abnormalities) born from the sins of mankind, you're always within arm's length of a different possible outcome. However, the price is almost always too great.

The monster management is fun and pretty unique. Every abnormality has it's do's and don't's. One of them likes peeking out from a keyhole and is a little shy. If you watch him, he'll breach and turn your employees into a bloody mist with his sawblades. But if you pan the camera away so he's off-screen he's completely docile. Each new subject is rather fascinating in it's own unique way.

Strategy is key with management and suppression tactics. The E.G.O equipment researched from abnormalities acts as sort-of a rock-paper-scissors mechanic to exploit weaknesses as well as protecting your ""little guys."" More sectors opens up more perks for employees and containment cells for abnormalities. After later sectors open you'll have access to direct intervention via ""bullets"" you can shoot employees and abnormalities with which can buff, heal, or kill. Then there's the Rabbit Protocol... for when the big F-U is neccesary.

Check out the Manga, Wonder Lab, which ties into the lore of Lob Corp. Trust me they go hard on the lore and this manga is pretty damn good.

Also check out the [ Limbus Company ] Official Promotion Video. The OST track from Mili - In Hell we Live, Lament Feat. Kihow from Myth and Roid goes hard.

568220,140649877,76561198844645186,75,4,325,0,325,1673150528,"	I find it pretty difficult to recommend this game to people because of a few main reasons. One, the sound design is poorly balanced and sounds really really bad in a few key areas (looking at you red dawn). Two, the gameplay is very repetitive and also has a very bad case of savescumitis, which only worsens as the game progresses to the point that I really don't recommend to anyone to commit to finishing it. And finally, a lot of aspects of the gameplay, in particular the difficulty are quite CBT and not in the fun ‘throw yourself against a problem until you figure it out’ way.

	On the other hand, the game is incredibly creative, interesting and above all UNIQUE. In my opinion video games are at their best when they do things that other games dont do, and to do that one must take risks and potentially fail. Lobotomy corporation took a risk and for the most part didn’t quite stick the landing. It still made something memorable and hopefully the concept of an esoteric monster facility management sim can be taken and iterated upon by another developer with more technical skill and time.

	Let me go over the flaws again before I dig into some particularly interesting concepts and design decisions I like. The sound is atrociously balanced. Some sounds are too quiet or nonexistent (there should be audible feedback for employee deaths besides the sounds of their various kills, like how Frostpunk has a church bell that rings once for every death. If you’re not focused directly on an employee when they die, there is no way to tell besides the toast on the left hand side of the screen, and if they’re a clerk you get no notification at all!), and some sounds are way too loud! The sounds for the different fixed events, that being the dawns, noons, dusks, and midnights are much too loud and earrapey. Some idle sounds of monsters are also too loud, namely Nothing There (which like, I understand being that Nothing There is supposed to be very threatening, but they dont need to be that loud to do that!) but also a few others. That said the sounds themselves are usually just… fine. Some stand out goods, some stand out bads, but mostly everything is just how it should sound and nothing more. 
	I dont really need to go too far into the game’s bad case of savescumitis, just that its there and it is a lethal case. Thankfully the game does give you quite a few ways to save over and reset from your mistakes, but I feel this is more of a bandage for a wider problem of unforgiving gameplay rather than a positive. 
	And as for that difficulty, oh god. Losing anyone is a HUGE negative due to the time cost involved in getting each employee even up to snuff. This really overlaps with darkest dungeon where employees are supposed to be disposable and you’re not supposed to get attatched, but conversely to that goal, employees are very very expensive to train. Even with all of the bonuses you can unlock to improve employee training speed (one of which requires a quite difficult boss!) it can still take a good 30 or so REAL TIME MINUTES at max speed to fully train ONE employee in ONE in game day. And that entire time you are generating risk of death, and micromanaging to avert the risk of that employee dying, or worse. You can multitask and train more than one employee at once, but there aren't that many abnormalities in the game that are good for training employees, and no gym or equivalent slow training. All employees MUST be live trained at ALL times. You can spend your employee points to strengthen the employee's stats but it's very expensive and really not worth it. So you spend a ton of time on each employee so that you can have a base of workers and warriors that isn't muppets… and then you get blue midnight or some shit and they all die instantly because you didn't pause the game the instant that you sent Urist McUseless to go train on One Sin. And then you reset the day. Hence the bad case of savescumitis. 

	But what’s really good about this game? Well, its fucking cool. All of the monsters feel esoteric, weird and interesting and it's super fun to learn how they tick and how you can incorporate what they do into your gameplay loop. I’d go into examples but that kinda takes away from the fun of it all, and plus I’d be restating what you could easily read on the wiki if you actually care.
	The story is also a highlight, being a pretty interesting concept although not the best written. The characters are fun and interesting, there’s an element of mystery and also quite a bit of that sweet sweet ludonarrative harmony (*gags*). Lots of the themes in the game and how frustrating it can feel is mirrored in the gameplay, and vice versa. Elements of the gameplay are integrated well into the story, such as the cognition filter explaining why the game looks the way it does. (Which also is incorporated into a cool abnormality! If you know, you know.)
	The old testament theming of the game is also quite interesting and unexpected for a game like this. The first abnormality you get in the game kicks off this theme, and is iterated upon by the most threatening one. The characters are themed after biblical (angels? I don’t know much about this. Might be more jewish rather than christian as well.) and it's well implemented. The story also goes into this in interesting directions, in particular the themes of suffering and original sin being mirrored in gameplay somewhat. The theming of this game is original, intentional, and tightly woven into the experience. Very well done.

	Speaking of, by far my favorite part of the game is the warning level. If you fuck up in some way, either by letting an abnormality loose or having employees die, the warning level increases which plays BANGER MUSIC and also has some minor gameplay effects. For the most part, the warning level is a gameplay way to signal to the player how messed up the facility is and also cause a snowball effect of failure. I don’t like the snowball factor that much, but it is in the end interesting which is the end goal of any game. 

	
	So yeah, kind of a messy review. I really can’t say I recommend picking up this game off of steam. If it was free, I’d say it has interesting ideas that are worth experiencing, but if you want a game from this company of a similar or higher quality level that's actually worth your time and money, I’d more recommend Library of Ruina… even though I despise it and everything it stands for due to it being a Turn-based RPG card game deck builder. 

	Overall, here are my generalized scores that arent really relevant to anything but my own general thoughts on the game. Don’t compare these to scores from other people or even myself on other games. 

	Personal scores: (Overall about a 7-8.5 that fluctuates depending on how cool i think nothing there is that day)
		Fun: 6/10 dwarf fortress does CBT better
		Autism-ility: 8.5/10 was my hyperfixation for a while 
		Aesthetics: 7.5/10 accurate corporate hellscape 

	Somewhat objective scores: (Worse than the sum of its parts due to its overall low budget and poor usage of that budget. About a 4 overall)
		Sound design: 4/10 red dawn.
		Game Feel: 5.5/10 aggressively mediocre but buggy. Commanding an army of goobers is never not satisfying but it toes the line in this game due to how janky combat is.
		Game performance: 3/10 holy fuck how do you fuck this up that bad
		Writing: 8/10 story stuff is fine but the stuff that's hidden in flavor text is great
		Horror score: 8/10 can be actually spooky at times
		Art: 7/10 has a style and is just… fine. Game looks bad. 
		The grind: 2/10 is real. And bad. 
		Theming: 8.5/10 Goes for something particular and nails it even though it's not that fun of an idea.",1687661210,1687661210,False,1,1,0.484614074230194092,7,True,False,False

If you want a casual game to play without too much worry, this is definitely not it. This is one of those games where you get better at the game from failing over and over again and learning from the failures.

The best way I can describe this game is... do you remember that laboratory from Stranger Things? Where they discover monsters, ghosts, and supernatural beings and then they experiment on them? Yeah, this is that. You play as a manager and you manage your employees by placing them in a cell with a supernatural being called ""Anomalies"". You place them in a cell and pray to god that the monster is in a good enough mood so they don't either rip your employees head from their shoulders, make your employee kill themselves, or make your employee kill others. 

Every monster has a ""catch"" or gimmick that you have to discover and then follow in order to keep your employees safe and make it to the next day (level). Every day you get a new monster, so the real trick is to juggle as many gimmicks as you can so you can make it to the next day without any casualties. 

There is definitely a learning curve and it is true that the game gets easier the more runs you do. Definitely pick it up if you like puzzles and don't mind a little cartoon horror",1687541622,1687541622,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think that there should be more monsters so it would give you more challenge because after a certain amount time you just know each and every one of them by heart which annoy's me because I don't feel any amount of challenge anymore. The one thing that would've helped with this would have been a steam workshop integration so moddind would be more accessible although you can still find mods that add abnormalities on Nexusmod or certain discord servers such as the Wonderlab mod server.

You play as The Manager, that bizarre mythological figure always invoked by angry customers, despite never being summoned. You have been tasked with running the eponymous Lobotomy Corporation, an ever-expanding underground power plant that harnesses energy from a collection of objects and entities, known collectively as Abnormalities, in order to feed the world's insatiable need for power. In the meantime you discover that the dangers of managing these unstable Abnormalities is only slightly less than the real existential danger that is our current crippling dependence on fossil fuels.

Confusion can be said to be LC's primary gameplay mechanic. Nothing in the game is ever truly explained to you, and what you don't know can very much hurt you. What [i]are[/i] the Abnormalities? What do each of the four kinds of ""work"" you can do with them actually entail? How does this generate electricity? Why does electricity come in boxes? What is a Qliphoth Generator, and why does nobody seem at all concerned about the fact that it seems to melt down every single day? What was it, exactly, that killed literally every employee in my base at the exact same time?

Making matters worse is that the writing deliberately goes out of its way to make this more difficult. Unlike, say, the SCP foundation (who uses clear, unambiguous language and hides information with trade talk and redaction), LC filters everything through the sort of floaty, high-minded, not-at-all-how-normal-people-talk sort of speech that you tend to find in works whose authors [i]really[/i] want you to know that they read books, sometimes. My AI director, who's supposed to be answering my questions, can't even give me directions to the bathroom without launching into a 40 minute tirade about the philosophy of striving for the future, interspersing a dozen pell-mell references to Judeo-Christian mysticism, and asking me for the hundredth time if I believe I have somehow grown, spiritually, from taking on this job.

The result of all of this is an environment that is 100% hostile to you, as a player. It's designed to make you fail repeatedly, until you finally manage to piece together what the hell your job even [i]is[/i] and whether or not you should make friends with the spooky audio recording you keep locked in a cell. Make no mistake: I mean that last sentence in possibly the most positive way. The penalties for failure aren't really that severe; you just get sent back to the start of the next day with your own personal knowledge of the situation more or less intact. Once you manage to piece together the lingo, you can start to get a sense of how the game wants you to proceed. Every new piece of info you unlock reinforces or refutes guesses you were already forming through trial and error. And every new Abnormality under your care becomes a new knife to juggle, increasing the danger while also making the resulting ballet of agent actions all the more impressive to behold.

In short, LC is a good game with a competent premise, encouraging experimentation and discovery and being just the right amount of tense. I would definitely recommend avoiding wikis and walkthroughs, wherever possible, and really enjoy the sense of desperate helplessness the game seeks to instill in you. I give this game an ""Ergo Proxy is my favorite anime you guys let me tell you all about it"" out of 10.",1667093277,1687055283,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keeping containments under control is a bit nebulous, sometimes I feel like I've gotten a breach without really understanding what or how it broke out, but for the most part as long as you've got enough invested in its research you can suppress a breach without too much issue. But where the game really falls apart in my opinion is the ordeals. Every day for the most part at a random point, some kind of monster will spawn in multiple places throughout your base. There's no information on what kind of damage they do or how they attack or really anything at all as far as I can tell, and since they're completely random there's no real way to prepare for them at all. I've had multiple days where some new ordeal just shows up and the monsters murder a bunch of agents before I have any idea what they even do.

Instead, I couldn't get past some of the more questionable design choices. It has haphazard UI scaling and font sizes, and there's an overuse of SCP-like jargon that only made things more confusing and harder to keep track of since it's not using actual SCP terminology.

However, what I didn't realize was that the first out of THREE tutorials would be filled with at least 7 different gauges and weird-worded things to keep up with.  This isn't a game.  It's an exercise in reading.  And trying to keep up with at least 7 made-up terms that make no sense whatsoever.  I own over 400 games on this platform, and none of them are as convoluted and ridiculous to try to understand as this is.  It is totally absurd.  I didn't want to buy a book on fantasy.  I wanted to buy a fun game that I could play and try to get better at.  This is an exercise in like college-level memorization.  Idk that I've ever had as much information thrown at me hapharzardly as this game.  And that's saying a lot, since I've played a lot of early access titles.  I cannot begin to explain how confusing and absurd this game is right out the gate.  I'm sure if I spent like 5 hours learning it, maybe I could make some kind of sense of it.  But that's not at all what I thought this was, or what was displayed on the store page.  

This is not fun.  It's not a good game.  It's just an absurd amount of things to try to keep up with for no apparent reason than to make it difficult.  Like there's no story at all.  There's no reasoning behind anything.  It's just ""interact with this anomaly to earn points but also unique anomaly points and qhipholphy points to unlock information about it which gives you fortitude points for your agent but watch out for doomagoodness points because then your anomalies might escape where you need gmod weapons and suits to bring it under control which you get from spending qhilophinous points on the anomaly after you have your agent interact with it in one of the four possible ways that they can interact.  Also there are points on your agent and the anomaly to say what will work and what won't work for this specific anomaly.""  It's completely ridiculous.  I'd rather read an encyclopedia than ""play"" this ""game.""

Though here instead of escaping a compromised facility we're playing the manager and command agents around to perform work (end result being energy production for which we have meet the quota every day). As you can imagine this kind of operation can go horribly wrong in many ways...and oh boy it sure does. Every single Abnormality is dangerous in some way and it gets ever crazier with each new day as our department expands getting new additions. We can either go through trial end error to get necessary research on each ""subject"" to manage them properly or try to check the wiki online, although that doesn't guarantee escaping dire consequences of sometimes merely having some Abnormalities in the facility. To make things more tense we will be attacked by random Abnormalities just entering the facility on daily basis so we will have to focus on more than our own containment chambers.
I presume it's part of the appeal that we will face a lot of failure, will have to restart a day or whole 5-day period to perhaps select more manageable Abnormalities. I can tell we can either focus on our agents to keep them high level and well equipped or just keep hiring new lambs to slaughter in containment chamber as, in the end, produced energy is all that matters (or does it?). Even though things roll out very slowly and consistently it will become overwhelming for someone not very into this idea of Management Sim and certainly feel grindy given we are always doing the same thing but more with extra strings and chances of things going apocalyptic attached each time. 

I haven't made it that far myself given as it turned it's a bit too much for me but there is some truly deep lore in here. Story is certainly a great focus in here and upon looking it up I have no doubts about it. Between each day we have visual-novel style of dialogue with various AI's helping in the facility, always keeping the creepy and uncertain tone of this entire operation. It sure is to keep the player on their toes at all times.

Sadly I can't say more given it's not as for me as I thought but if it seems it might be for you I say go try it. I can totally see what it's going for and it's very much well done - a beautiful, apocalyptic mess for a gameplay and grant mystery to unravel for a story.

PART 2: ive tried it out again, and its still ass. Good news: you dont have to beat every quest in a row. another good news: even after resetting to day 1, your research doesnt reset. Bad news, the games even more of a slog than i first thought. ive bashed my head for 2 more hours and made barely any progress. whenever an employee starts panicking, i just restart the day, since its virtually impossible to stop them sometimes, since every employee has the same movement speed. bashing my head against every scp to find out how to treat them without loosing half my staff is repetitive and boring. one of the only redeeming qualities is the art and character design in this game, but i dont enjoy the characters themselves, since they act like feelingless bastards that care only about the company(ik ""that they are AI"", but still, wtf).

Conclusion: there are a lot of games where the fans say ""this game makes you feel horrible, but we love it"". the difference here is that this game has no redeeming qualities.

Exposure to this game will corrode your very mind.

Lobotomy Corporation is a cute little management simulation made by a handful of students, spare change, and a dream. As it says on the tin you manage monsters, keep them happy*, and stop them from breaching. With every passing day you learn a little more about the world that Project Moon has beautifully expanded and its denizens, every character and abnormality has a story to tell. Just as you think you have it all figured out, boom, more story and possibly murder**

!!!  Just a little warning to all future lob corp players  !!!
1. You cannot complete everything in your first run of the game, but worry not, resetting to day one keeps all your mission progress and collected items and research, it took me many a day 1 reset to get what I needed done
2. Daily resets are your best friend when it comes to learning with how to handle a new dangerous creature, you sacrifice some people, acquire knowledge, scribble it down or commit it to memory, and restart the day. You will lose research progress but you get your little lambs back and you have your actual knowledge to fill in those gaps. There are a LOT of factors that can be taken into account with handling abnormalities so there is no shame in restarting the day
3. READ, project moon fans are well known for their inability to read, I can confirm that this is true for I am illiterate. This game has a massive story*** and it's all very charming, but reading the information presented to you will help you fulfill your duties as a manager. Better get to exercising that brain of yours my friend, it's your greatest weapon in this game.

This game is cool. It is not good. I enjoyed my time with it, but I would never ever recommend it to anyone I didn't hate.

The aesthetic the game is going for is SCP. The reason SCP functions as it does, with as little faults as it has, all without breaking the veil, is because the Site Directors are able to delegate tasks. If the site director had to direct each and every researcher to *perform research* on a given SCP they are assigned to, via some kind of PDA, the Foundation would never have gotten more than one Site.

That is to say, a Chain of Command is NECESSARY for the proper and smooth operation of ANY operation, especially one that deals with anomalies, or ""abnormalities"" as this game calls it.

You play as a Site Director who has never heard of delegation, or is otherwise not allowed to engage with the concept by your AI boss. In the beginning, when you only have one sector to oversee, it seems fine! its just 3 or 4 abnormalities to look over. It might even be a little fun, researching each abnormality as they get dropped into your sector. Like unboxing some weird, supernatural lootbox. You live and learn, sacrifice a few employees in the name of the greater good, but at the end of the day you're a net positive for humanity. You get the personal satisfaction of laying the anomalies bare, knowing all that they are, and how best to suck them dry so Joe Shit the Ragman can watch TV in the gutter.

Then you get another sector to watch over, with the same nitpicky oversight that one would expect of an overseer of a single sector of XK-class anomalies.
""Well,"" you think, ""it's only another sector! It's a single player game! Surely it is balanced around one person playing it!"" 
So you endure the more difficult, but still manageable workload.

Then there is another sector. With the same amount of abormalities.

""Okay, this is kinda a lot for one person to handle."" you think.

So you endure, mostly crutching on your fully researched clutch of anomalies to meet your energy quota for the day, while still trying to do what you can to research this new and infinitely more volatile class of anomaly. 

Then you get another one.
And another one.

And another entire floor after that, a clone of what you started with, with twice the amount of anomalies dropped per day, while youre still desperately trying to milk your original MAYBE 6 or 7 that you're confident enough with to milk dry (STILL manually milking btw, 3 clicks per ~20s, PER ANOMALY, (4 per sector, and you have 18 anomalies total at the point that you get a new floor, including the 2 it gives you when the new floor is forced on you) while remembering they exist, while also trying to manage deaths on the newer sectors, and managing escapes from anomalies you haven't had the chance to research yet). 

If this is hard to follow, its because it FUCKING IS HARD TO FOLLOW. It's not hard in a fun ""oooh, okay so I have to do this to get this to do that"" way, its hard in a ""ok so i have to trial and error every anomaly that's dropped into this place, restarting 10-25 times per anomaly, if I want to not replay the story sections 800 times each attempt by playing until you literally dont have the manpower to play anymore then restarting from day 0, doing EVERYTHING again with the same research levels, arms, and armor, I got from losing the war of attrition with the game last run"" way.

From what I hear, Library of Ruina is pretty good. If you're playing this game to understand that game, do yourself a favor and just watch a youtube playthrough. This shit is NOT worth it, I've been trying to play this game on and off since June 22, 2018, because every time I look at it I think ""Surely it wasn't as bad as I remember!"" and every single time, it is, if not worse.

I have a lot of experience with this game. More so than the (at the time of writing) 41 hours of playtime displayed. Project Moon seems to have created a unique management simulator, which I will not deny them so, but this game has had increasingly negative effects on my mental and physical health. At this moment, I type these words with half of my thumb and my chin. That is just about all that is left of my body.
The title ""Lobotomy Corporation"" is only a guise to hide the damaging effects it has on your neurons and muscles as you play, almost as if you were the one working with The Little Prince. Something has taken root inside of my body. It has eaten me from the inside out. It began with my head, taking all I had and leaving me with apathy, traumatic memories of the ""game"", and vivid hallucinations of all the five senses. I have witnessed things no one else has seen. 

Would you like to personally know how CENSORED appears without the managerial filter? 

Exactly.

I have sustained chronic damage in every way possible due to this horrific nightmare of a digital experience. Please, for the love of God, or WhiteNight, or Flesh Idol, or whatever in this world you pray to, do NOT buy this game. It will take everything you love and turn you into me- There's nothing there.

Stay safe,
Nick

TLDR: Game is fun for certain kinds of ""people,"" but its design flaws are glaring, and you have to have a lot of patience to see the good parts that make those flaws worth it. Get it on sale, though. 4/10 for the average person, 10/10 if you're genuinely unhinged like me.

This game, simply put, is not designed well. It has mechanics that, in a vacuum, seem interesting and have potential, but the way this game is put together becomes frustrating rather than challenging. There are plenty of examples of this happening, but I think the most blatant is the Abnormality Managerial Tips, which I'll focus on in this review to avoid spoiling any story stuff.

Abnormalities (the monsters you're containing in this game) all possess some form of ""special ability"" that will activate when certain conditions are met. These range from harmless things like escaping containment and killing some nameless clerks, to instantly killing the employee you've spent three hours grinding up to max stats, to just outright slaughtering a whole department, if you're not far enough into the game to receive tools to deal with them. The intended way to get around this is that there isn't one. Whenever you gain a new abnormality, you chuck your strongest goon into the meat grinder (sometimes literally) and see what happens, until you have all the information necessary or everyone is dead. Once this happens, you promptly restart the day if the losses are worth more than the time you've spent, now armed with the knowledge you've gained.

That sounds fine when put in this way, but the real issue comes from the more esoteric abnormalities. Sometimes, you will receive an abnormality that has abilities so esoteric, annoying, and unmanageable that you will elect to simply ""leave it alone"" and pray qliphoth meltdown (another game mechanic, but honestly this one I like) doesn't hit that containment unit. In fact, there is a... certain abnormality that everyone just simply knows not to take after their first experience with it. It sucks to manage, has many elements of random chance, frequently causes unpreventable deaths, and if I didn't also add that it was very, VERY loud I'm pretty sure all those characteristics could be applied to quite a few of the abnormalities, by most people.

Mind you, these complaints about the manageability of abnormalities are coming from me, someone who has memorized every single preference, ability, drop, and piece of equipment of every single abnormality, has put over a thousand hours into a game with very little replay value, and knows everything well enough to fully expect anything the game can throw at me. These complaints are not for me, they're for jonathan.coolguy.2007, the average joe that got lured into playing this games by one of my fellow basement nerds, because this game is, as I said, poorly designed. If you're not willing to put up with that design, don't buy this game. Watch someone play it (even badger content creators to play it PLAESE PLEASE PLEASE PELAE ELASE LEASEPL-) because that's much funnier. If, however, you are willing to put up with bad translation, random bullshit beyond your control, hot koreans, and reading the entire Torah to understand the references this game makes, then I really do recommend giving it a try, though you should wait until it goes on sale to buy. Even I know $25 is too much, iirc the price is because the original translators totally ripped off the devs.

Manifestation of gameplay spoilers due to this being a retelling of the story, from my experience.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

Lobotomy Corporation is a game that puts up a heavy facade. You take the role of X, the newly appointed manager of the titular company, Lobotomy Corporation. Your role and goal is to extract energy from ""abnormalities,"" which are monsters that range from sweet old ladies, to skin stealers. To help you with this, you're given an android assistant named Angela.

The game goes along smoothly, you meet department heads known as ""sephirot,"" and by this point they all should seem decently friendly, besides Yesod. That is, until the cognition filter breaks down, giving you a small peek in to the true nature of the facility. Right after that, you get a call from a mysterious man named B, who tells you that the company is not even half of what it seems, sowing seeds of distrust in you, and growing weeds of doubt, weeds that Angela wants to pluck. 

Now with your new sense of doubt, you progress more through the game. By this point you should now see ""core suppression requirements"" on a bunch of the sephirot's mission pages. Unless you know what you're doing, you most likely will not see any core suppression until 60-100 hour in. I got lucky and realized dusk ordeals weren't nearly as much as they were made out to be. Core suppressions are the boss fights of this game, adding a new layer of difficulty on an otherwise normal day. And the more you beat, the more you learn. 

Soon you learn about the man named A, and the more you learn about him, the more heartless he seems. You also learn of a woman named Carmen, who seemed to be the opposite of A in every way besides intelligence. You learn that Carmen died somehow, how she wanted to change the world for the better, and how she wished to help every person in the city. You learn the sad tale of Elijah, a girl who died out of desperation for attention, Gabriel who was driven mad, Giovanni who was deceived, Michelle who was overwhelmed, Enoch and Lisa who were taken in, only for Enoch to die at the well-meaning hands of Carmen, Kali who died defending in vain, Daniel who betrayed, Garion who was just doing her job, and Benjamin, who left A after Carmen's death.

After learning all of this, you begin thinking that A is the villain of the game. But he's the protagonist, as Angela finally reveals who A truly is, and who she truly is. A is you, and Angela is an imperfect copy of Carmen. A has put himself in to a time loop to get the perfect scenario for the ""seed of light,"" a strange object which holds the power to accomplish Carmen's dream, and bring a ""well"" to everybody. 

Day 46-47, X meets Abel, another version of him representing a part of his mind that thinks nothing will ever change. Abel tells A to either overcome what he has not, or to stay with Abel and accept defeat. X, of course, does not, and perseveres through the day, all 4 upper layer sephirot going in to meltdowns. 

Day 48, X meets his second counterpart, Abram, who represents his guilt and grief for Carmen. Abram tells X that Carmen is dead and gone, to stop carrying on her legacy, and to just let the facility crumble, with his last moments being with Carmen's extracted nervous system. X ignores him, defeating the red mist a second time, and advancing on, almost ready to finish the seed of light.

Day 49, X meets Adam, the version of himself that represents his god complex. Adam is tired, and wants to finish the seed of light project early. This wouldn't accomplish Carmen's goal, and instead would create an imperfect seed of light, turning every single person in to abnormalities, instead of allowing them to manifest their true selves. X goes through his hardest trial yet to deny Adam, but does succeed.

Day 50, X meets Ayin, the true, original A. Ayin has a short conversation with X, and then sends him off to finish the seed of light. After the day has passed, the facility flips over to get the sephirot in their proper positions (Keter being at the top, and Malkuth at the bottom), and a beam of light shoots from the facility after it breaks through the ground. This beam is the tree of light, sprinkling it's seeds across the city, bringing the perfect ending to the game, which honestly made me cry. However, Angela has a different plan. (I won't say any more, as it will spoil certain elements of the sequel, Library of Ruina. I will say what's said in lobotomy corporation, though.) Angela, filled with anger from the torment she's been put through due to the time loop, wants to live a normal human life. She turns off the tree of light, taking the light for herself and using it construct a library, where she may accumulate knowledge of the world, the city, everything.

I think this is important to mention since after finishing LoR as one of my favourite games, I was coming into this one hella biased and you'll get bit of that in this review. I should also mention that in the time of writing this review, I did not finish this game yet, however after 90 hours I feel qualified to share my thoughts. 

You play as a power plant manager. You probably heard about solar powerplants, hydroelectric power plants, nuclear power plants... Well, here you make power from monsters called abnormalities. You also get few very friendly and not weird at all AIs to help you with your task.
It's hard to not compare the story to LoR so I'll compae it. I think I have issue here because I played LoR 1st. I find it very sad that you only get a very little about anything that is happening outside the facility. I beleive this is only because I already knew how amazing the outside word is and maybe it wouldn't even cross my mind without that knowledge. While youi dont get much about the world, you get to know all the AIs working in lob corp quite well. All of them are very, VERY lovable (especially my boy Netzach, I love him so much). I was already familiar all of them before playing this game, however seeing ther story here brought them much more depth.

The gameplay is simple yet complacated. Simple becuase all you do is pick an employee and assign them work. The complicated part comes from managing a large number of abnormalities at the tame time. It's easy to remember that you can't send employee to work with a specific abnormality since they don't have effectiove armor againts it's attacks, however you might just overlook it if at the same time you must,... oh I don't know, pick up tickets every 2 minutes, be carefull to not send this guy to work since he is sparkling a bit, not hold that item for over 30 seconds, find and shoot different abnormality since the work you assigned few minutes ago did not end up well, checking how many of the random-ass NPCs died so you can prepare for a meatball to murder your entire department and do all that while LISTENING TO THAT FUCKING FETUS CRY... ugh, sorry got carried away a bit there. Fortunetly the game does not throw all that at you at the same time, your day norrmally starts with you choosing a new abnormality. This means the game gives you day to learn the quirks of the new abnormality so you are used to it the next day where you are learning about the new abnormality for that day. What I can complain about a bit is the tool days. The days where you find tool abnormality are basically just like the day before except you'll send one person to use do tool, most likely die, reset the day and do the same thing, just without dying. After that, I ended up not using 90% of the tools after getting the max research on them. but there is a thing that is more boring that tool days, those are the days where you... don't get anything. You play the last day again without even the minimum of researching the tool you got. Hoever you can normally do this quite fast and get back to researching new fun abnormalities.
Once in a while the game will throw some challenges called core supression at you and man... those are dufficult. I'm writing this after attempting Binah core supression for a while and well, it was so hard I decided to restart from day one. However, even restarting from day 1 won't fully reset your progress since you keep all the ego (weapons and armor) as well as permanent upgrades and abnormality research. This means that even if you get stuck, you don't have to feel bad if you need to reset to try and get to the same point with better gear (and knowledge).

In the end I don't think I can do anything else but reccomend this game. If you don't enjoy the managing simulatro gameplay you probably won't like it but if you do, this is the peak.

(;  However, I encourage those who have friends who have played the game before teach them the basics outside of the tutorial levels. I have taught some new players over Discord, it's time efficient, and less confusing.

The story is, in my opinion, the best part of this game. They have explanations for nearly everything, including why everything looks cute and cartoony. The characters and their development is fantastic and satisfying as they talk about their backstory and you learn about their personalities. The fact that most of the Abnormalities and the story itself is based off of various books and literature.

Unbeknownst to many, this game is for those who enjoy improvement through failure, and the roller coaster of emotions that comes with. And trust me, I mean it when I say that. One day in the game will be peaceful, no Abnormality breaches, no Agent deaths, and man, you got all the easy Ordeals! Then the next day you get a funny looking thing you can have your Agents work with. It hasn't done anything all day, and you decide, ""Well, seems harmless. There's only 86 seconds left to fill out it's log, so let's just get that out of the way while I train my Agents."" Then your AI's are spamming you with reports, all you can hear is wind and static, and as you sit in your silly little manager's room, everything on fire around you, you check the last bit of the log that was just filled out... ""Past 90 seconds of work the employee dies and all breach counters are reduced to 0."" It is at this point, you close the window, and sit there as everything burns. An occasional ""Hello?"" is heard in the vast reaches of your facility as you smile and sit in silence. The lights go out, frames drop to 0, and your hot AI Secretary comes in to tell you, once again, that you're a failure of a manager. Yet for some, ungodly reason, you manage the strength to hit ESC and then slap the 'Retry Day' button once again. 

It is at this moment, you will realize you love this game. All of it's horrible auto pathing, the micromanaging of your Agents in a fight, the neutral music, and gloriously anticipated moment second trumpet drops. You'll smile, laugh, cry, and feel like you're having a heart attack on day 49 like all the other fans of the game. And maybe you'll find yourself repeating the process over and over again like me.

Abnormality gifts add some priority to try and get your workers interacting with more than just whoever's easy to access and deal with, and the ability to train a worker's stats by using the related work method means there's incentive to have workers do things you know another would already be good at.

It's not a perfect game, or the most optimized game ever, but lobcorp is a game that delivers an amazing story with a lot of charm and fun.

The game is hard but it doesn't manage to drive me away since the payoff is immaculate in the story telling and you just can't bring yourself to drop it if you're invested. The later days have super tough bosses and abnormalities but you'll be rewarded with one of the best end sequences I've experienced in a video game.

it's a management game unlike Ruina and Limbus and although a lot harder for newcomers to grasp and understand it's a super fun and charming experience. The characters are amazing, you'll see them in Ruina too obviously but to really understand them you have to play this game. They're super lovable and have very realistic and relatable problems. the game just has an immense amount of charm with the death animations for employees or the animations on all the abnormalities that'll make you really happy to see even though they're all pretty messed up. The amount of charm on each abnormality is insane, there isn't a single abnormality I hate (but there are some abnormalities added by backers which aren't the best I'll say). It's got a super isolated feeling Ruina and Limbus can't replicate but it make sense since it's a prequel to both games. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not listen to people who tell you to skip it, it's basically the most important game to understand the lore of the universe and the story is just amazingly enjoyable on its own. ruina is a great game to understand the world, but you won't understand the role of abnormalities and distortions all to well without it.

The bad:
RNG

[b]Story[/b]

Without the story, this game wouldn't be nearly as good as it is. But puzzling together what happened in a lab in the Outskirts, and why that relates to gaining energy from monstrous creatures called abnormalities, while assisted by humanlike AI called Sephirot (all with their own personality and problems) is very enjoyable. The story is given in bits and pieces, out of chronological order and altogether vaguely, which leads to a rather intriguing task of figuring out what went/is going on.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay sounds rather simple. You have employees who you can send to work with abnormalities to obtain energy to fill the daily quota. Depending on the employee, the abnormality, the type of work and RNG you will produce more or less energy and the abnormality will or will not get more unhappy. If an abnormality is fully unhappy, bad things happen ranging from employee deaths due to abnormality breakout to... more deaths usually.
The interesting part is that after working with a number of abnormalities, a meltdown occurs. Either, it puts a qliphot meltdown on some random abnormalities which can be removed by working with them, but makes them unhappy if left unattended, or it spawns an ordeal in your facility, forcing combat.
Combat, due to ordeals or escaped abnormalities, can go from simply sending in a blob of high-level employees to micromanaging to avoid attacks, depending on the threat you're up against. All in all, the gameplay loop is nicely put together.

[b]Boss fights[/b]

There are no story spoilers here, but I wanted to tag it anyways.
[spoiler]Boss fights, also known as Sephirot meltdowns, introduce a gimmick for a day and reward you with a buff if you beat them. They are varied and a nice breakup of the regular gameplay loop, and several of them are quite challenging (especially the final boss gauntlet).[/spoiler]


[b]Music[/b]

Although it's nothing special, the music is fitting and doesn't disturb the other elements of the game.

[b]Grind[/b]

Yes, it's one of those. You level up employees by working with abnormalities, and in principle days are infinite. You almost have to level agents further than you would just by reaching the quota, since later boss fights require a bunch of high level employees to deal with everything going on at the same time. Furthermore, to get true ending, you need to have seen every abnormality and filled out their entire bio. This'll take at least two full runs, likely three since RNG isn't in your favour and your first run isn't likely to get all the way to the end if you're unprepared.

[b]RNG[/b]

Oh boy, RNG. The energy you get from working, which abnormalities you get, which ordeal you get, where the ordeals spawn, what abnormalities get a qliphot meltdown, this game is jam-packed with RNG and at several occasions good or bad RNG is the difference between succeeding and having to retry the day (I'm looking at you, Queen of Hatred!). Especially bosses can be highly dependant on a role of the dice, with a wrong role almost forfeiting the attempt.

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Story is good, gameplay is good, until you get to the third run and start to prepare/(grind) for the final boss gauntlet. It's rewarding to complete though, and the story makes most of it worth it.",1683472296,1683478642,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This game is truly an ""experience"". Before I say anything else, I just want to say this was a wild ride, and I'm impressed with what I got vs. what I expected.

So this was my first ""micromanagement"" game, and I really didn't know the suffering I was in for. This game really packs a punch with it's difficulty, especially towards the end of the game. That being said, the game simply presents itself as is, and the player is left to adapt to it, and by the time I had played the game a couple dozen hours, I truly felt much more competent at the game.

I also really liked the idea of resetting being integral to gameplay, because it really teaches you to appreciate the overall picture more. I wish that the game urged players to do this more, because this is not a common feature amongst games. One of friends actually quit after getting all the way to day 47 because he had never really known why using the memory repostiroy feature was useful, choosing to instead start from day 1 any time he wasn't satisfied with where he game was going.

That being saidI have a few qualms about gameplay, with the main one being that 2x speed is the maximum setting for core gameplay. Around 20hrs in I gave in to just getting a 5x speed mod so I could avoid grindy parts, such as using the memory repository feature to discover new abnormalities. There are also some things in the game that irk me someone, like a certain minion of an abnormality that likes to grab you and one-shot your employees when it revives every once in a while (you'll know it when you see it). Or enemies having ridiculous attacks that are near-unavoidable. Or a certain someone limiting your use of the speedup button.. 

Regardless, once you tough through it all, you feel that much better about winning, and that's what counts.

I can not and will not recommend this title or any from Project Moon when they will willfully and knowingly place mechanics within their game/s with potential of clearing save data, specifically the abnormality:

[spoiler](O-05-47)  //  a.k.a Don't touch me  //  a.k.a. The Big Red Button[/spoiler]

This specific encounter when activated kills every member of your staff, so okay no big deal you can restart. However for those who are inquisitive ""which is what this kind of game should encourage"" you're met with it crashing your game causing a save state of the game there by deleting all your EGO items ""employee equipment which you can earn from the abnormalities"". The common solution among users and people who do support this ""mechanic"" is don't pick the abnormality, to which I pose the question. 
Why does it even exist if that is the intended action in a game based around exploration and experimentation?

The simplest answer I have came to, is it's lazy at best, at worst it's designed purely with malicious intent to punish people who are unfamiliar with this specific scenario in a way that is by no means fair in any context of gaming. At either case it's shoddy work on part of the developer to consider this a feature. Through the beginning of the game your fed the concept of ""memory repositories"" basically save states you can roll back to in case you screw up etc. Then later in the game ""Depending on when you get this specific abnormality, all the pushing of this save state mechanic means nothing as when you first click it, ""as stated earlier will kill all employees followed by releasing all other entities that are capable of escaping from their containment rooms."" Now this in itself as I said isn't so bad, you can reload, but with the new player having had this idea / design pushed at them will undoubtedly ""as many did"" keep clicking on it to see if they can get any more information from it before reloading, this in turn crashes the client and saves your current EGO gear ""which if you weren't following along to this point is actually ZERO at this specific moment in time since all your employees just died before crashing."" This could equate to merely a few hours of lost progress, or on a more sever scope, many many days of progress ""double so if you are on one of your *NG+* play throughs as it will delete ALL equipment your employees were using when they died.""

I discovered this ""feature"" when I was only a couple hours into the game when it first released, and encountered this information on a post elsewhere and in the fact of not losing progress decided to shelve it to wait to see if it might just be a bug"". Fast forward 2 years after launch, still a concept / feature within the game, this of course led me to shelve it practically permanently. Fast forward to now FIVE years after it was launched and they ""the devs project moon"" after even going on to make another title, with talks of yet another one, still think this is an acceptable feature. Suffice it to say, I will not support any future work by them, if they wish to troll a player base perhaps they should go to making mobile games instead or something, cause they have definitely missed the mark with this gamer with such trollish design.


Now that my bit is aside, the game itself ""with that caveat aside"" least from my 2 hours, wasn't bad, the main themes / music can get a bit drab and repetitive after a short time however that is easily fixed for anyone on a PC. The toon styled characters and entities are quite sharp and well done, and the basic mechanics weren't to terrible to get through to get started. 

Unfortunately I really was looking forward to this game when I first saw teasers and screen shots, for anyone who likes SCP inspired works, a management sim sounded like a great game concept, only to be ruined by poor choice during it's development..

Gameplay:
Playing the game blind involves an extremely unpleasant amount of trial and error. Each anomaly has its own quirks and will kill your agents if they are handled properly. The only way to find this information in the game is to guess blindly. If you guess wrong, your agent probably dies and you probably have to start the day over. If you guess right, you can potentially unlock some information about how to properly handle the anomaly after a few more attempts. Sometimes, what seems like a correct guess is in fact an incorrect guess, which you can't know until unlocking more information, and will likely result in the death of several agents.

Some anomalies deal sanity damage in addition to/instead of physical damage. This sounds great, because it means that your agents won't necessarily be dying left and right, but depending on your agent's stats, it can be worse. Particularly, this can cause them to sprint randomly across your facility, making your other agents insane if they stick around too long. With early game equipment, it is technically possible to bring someone back to sanity, but it's impossible if they're moving too quickly to hit, as is the case with any agent running around.

The game has a research system. Each day you can pick a different upgrade. Notably, the ability to see your agents' HP and sanity on the main UI has been locked behind an upgrade which at the earlist can be gotten at day 8 - meaning, before day 8, the only way you can see your agents stats is to open one of the anomaly work menus. This is fucking annoying, and slows the already boring pace of the game down even further as you obsessively pause and open the menu to make sure one of your agents doesn't get stabbed to death.

Every time one of your dudes goes into a cell to perform work, they get a stat boost. Grinding these out is a mostly risk free way of leveling up all of your guys, but it just takes way too long and isn't fun or interesting. I get to pick options on menus and wait for 30 seconds. Thrilling. I hope no weird robots show up and stab your newbies.

Story:
At the time of the review, I haven't played for too long, so I can't speak much to the story. My impression thus far has been pretty underwhelming. The story exists in two parts: each anomaly has its own little block of lore, and you get to chat with some of your coworkers between work days.

The lore for each anomaly is entirely self contained, and I think (?) is the main draw of the game. This game was made for people that think SCP is really cool. I think it's kinda cringey; oh, what's that? This is a floating skull that likes it when you confess your sins to it? Cool. Oh, this epic bloody bird doesn't sing and has teeth? Epic. This cringe deviantart OC does something or other? I don't care. Amazing storytelling.

The actual continuous story between days is equally dry. You get to have a little chat with the main AI lady, she asks you a question and the only answers you can pick from are the wrong ones, and none of them really change how she responds. After that, you get to chat with the department heads, who don't seem particularly bothered about their subordinates dying or going insane. Maybe the story is about spending time with them and turning them into loving caring people (or AIs, I forget), but I find it more likely that actually we were the bad guys the whole time.

The whole premise of the game is that you're the new manager of some facility that generates energy (???) from working with the anomalies. Why this is necessary or a good idea is entirely unclear. The nature of the gameplay mechanics in an in-universe sense is entirely unexplained. Why does entering a certain number of cells to perform work cause random other cells to maybe have bad things happen to them (e.g. escape) if they're not entered within 60 seconds? Why does it also sometimes cause weird robots to show up and start stabbing people? IDK. Completely unexplained. It's a gameplay feature, I guess.

Summary:
I don't like the game. The gameplay is slow, it either wants you to just read the wiki, trial and error until you kill your agents, or restart the day until you figure out the particular preferences of each new creature. The story is weak and uncompelling, the music is repetitive, the art is ok, I guess, and customizing your dudes costs more of your bonus points which are the only way to upgrade your agents other than just grinding. Ugh. If you really like management games and you're big into SCP, this game might be for you. Otherwise, probably not.",1683011524,1683011524,False,1,0,0.478087633848190308,0,True,False,False

One of the best universes I dived into. Gameplay, though, is extremely hard, grindy, controls and UI are also pretty bad. The overall expreience is weird, since it's pretty unique and absolutely fantastic if you'll get engaged with the story, but otherwise - is utterly terrible and seems like a torture. But for me, as I've said before - it's one of the best universes I dived into.

Now for the long story:
As a person, who likes story-rich games with lots of lore to get into, this is one of the best games (series of games) I ever played. I love the story and characters a lot. You can even dive into philosophy and think about life, society and developing as a person.

Gameplay-wise it is pretty bad, honestly. UI is pretty convoluted while game mechanics are very simple, yet they require you to memorize a lot of stuff. Control over the characters is disasterously inconvenient - you quite often need them to stay at an exact place, but you can only tell them to go to the specific room, not place. In some(many) cases this micro-control is very needed, but unavailable. Also, the game is very-very grindy and no matter how much you grind it is still extremely difficult. Like, really over the top difficult. You will save-scam A LOT and it is designed this way by the devs.

Surprisingly though, if you will manage to overcome all those difficulties and will do it all by yourself (I, honestly, didn't have the nerve), you will feel SO much in character with the story and this is one of the coolest feelings I had with any game. This experience is very unique and makes you so engaged with the story. Once you get past that point - you are a most likely a fan of the Project Moon universe.

The game is not for everyone though. The story is very difficult to understand and leaves you deep in thoughts a lot by the end of the game. If you like this type of experience: when you have to deserve your happy-ending and especially, if you like to think about the story, philosophy and lore a lot - you will like the game, just give it some time to tell you major stuff. Because at the start, you don't really get much important info (You don't know enough to understand it in the beginning). If you just can't stand the gameplay, you can drop the gameplay and just watch story videos on YT. I don't recommend doing it though, because you will lose that specific and unique feeling of deserving you victory and being in-sync with the main protagonist.
Otherwise, if you expect engaging gameplay with lots of action, well-though strategy, or a simple story - this game is not for you at all, you will get disappointed.

P.S. If you liked this one, you should look for it's sequel - Library of Ruina. There is also some small nice videos on PM official youtube channel and you can also find some official comics somewhere else.",1682975714,1682975714,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a manager of an anomalies (monsters) containment site, it is your job (actually, your agents, you command them) to study, understand, contain and... use them. If everything goes well, you will complete your day with no worries...
But things never go as smoothly as you expect.

Sometimes, those anomalies produce effects that you weren't expecting for... A safe anomaly suddenly had a darker side that just killed some of your best agents... Or maybe, that city-eating monster just escaped its chambers. It is your job to find ways to contain them, manager!

Story-wise, the game is pretty good too. It is engaging enough so you keep going back for more about the Corporation and the world it exists in.

If you want to play something different, I strongly recommend it. Just remember, it is not easy! This game hates you and you will hate it too. But you will love it in the end.

Whether that is a positive or negative really depends on your personal preference - it can be quite stressful, especially when you have a lot of needy anomalies in your facility. 
But since the game is a roguelite, killing a run because you aren't having fun is a completely valid choice and is even rewarded, since you retain all of the equipment you have earned so far, as well as the information on anomalies you've already researched. You are also able to just rewind to the beginning of the day, so that you can retry a section if you had too many losses, or to the last ""checkpoint"", which you get every five days and let you keep all the research and new equipment that you earned.

despite the constant complaints of (albeit justified) difficulty and jank levied against it, lobotomy corporation was one of those very few titles that reminded me that video games can be more than derivative formula garbage. ironic, because it runs like ass despite its looks even on the latest hardware, a lot of the core mechanics are only sort of obliquely elaborated upon in the manager's manual, and the spikes in difficulty are extremely sudden and seemingly impossibly vertical.

however, if you man up and stick it through the rough spots you'll be rewarded with a genuinely unique and memorable experience. this game is the ultimate manifestation of the expression ""trial and error"", and as such if you're capable of inner monologue it'll lead you into a deep rabbit hole of experimentation laced with equal amounts of frustration balanced out by the inevitable elation you experience when you finally get a bead on keeping an aleph-level abormality content. it's invoked and kindled a sense of wonderment and curiosity that I genuinely haven't felt for a game since I was a child.

if you actually manage to make it through all the way 'til the end, you'll also probably unironically have developed an increased sense of situational awareness, multi-tasking, and a renewed triumphant spirit to replace the despair-ridden husk that once inhabited your soul. the lessons learned from this unhinged and debauched journey will stick with you long after you've closed the game, leaving you with a newfound appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. it's a testament to the power of perseverance and the beauty of breaking through barriers, despite the chaotic cacophony of suffering that might surround you. also A did nothing wrong.",1682431664,1682431786,True,65,3,0.842640995979309082,0,True,False,False

Many of the gameplay features are explained in-world over time, and there's very few glaring issues with the plot (though you might need to do a little bit of digging to really piece it all together.)

Unfortunately, the gameplay is not very polished. The game is difficult, but often this difficulty is through tedium and pestering rather than actual challenge, which takes away from the experience. There are a lot of very poor design decisions, interesting and neat concepts that were not refined into good gameplay, and the nature of the game means that the majority of them will continue to be a problem throughout the very lengthy playtime.

Regardless, the story is good enough that I would recommend consuming it however you can stand.

You have to micro manage so much to the point the game will crush yours balls and turn it into a smoothie if you forget about one thing. It's also incredibly repetitive to where it will get slightly harder and slightly more difficult each day out of the several you are forced to endure. I also kinda dropped playing it cause it requires a lot of time and it isn't summer yet.

Okay so like why is this recommended? Cause every other element of this game is amazing. Above is the negative aspects of it. For some of the positive aspects:

+ Story and Lore is Easy Highlight- you will find yourself enjoying reading a lot of it. Along with that, ProjectMoon (people who made the game) have two other games that expand on this.
+ You will find yourself eager to actually learn more about what everything does. More in the start of the game you will find yourself forced to learn the traits of each anomaly you hold but then you will find yourself wanting to instead of feeling forced
+ Music is PEAK. Even though you will 90% hear the same two tracks, all the others are amazing such as the warnings. Hell, buy the soundtrack if you don't have a method of listening to them
+ Art is pretty good and really goes over the top with the crazy shit that happens to your agents. Don't be fooled by the fact the people you see in the screenshots above look like gacha characters. 
+ This game is incredibly unique, taking inspiration (or i think so) from SCP but takes a different approach to how it's world is built and how the mysterious creatures/objects are conjured origin wise

If you want to know if you should buy this, I would say it's a game that takes a LOT of dedication for it to shines it's best aspects. If you want a game that you can really get invested into story wise and have the time to do so (check other steam reviews of this game and gauge their amount of hours spent on the game, I barely mid way into game), then this is an amazing game for you.

You play as the Manager of this godforsaken company where, with the help of anime waifus/husbandos with various interesting personalities (such as hyperactive tomboy, clinically depressed drug addict, and oddly feminine man [all of them]) you must harvest energy from Lovecraftian Abominations, normal furniture, and children. 

With the divine power granted to you by an AI literally designed to cause neuron activation, you must task your 'willing' employees to perform well-informed and ethical experiments on 'Abnormalities' in order to reach the daily quota of energy boxes. 

Employees are squishy, adorable, completely mentally stable nuggets whose lives should be valued and cherished, which is why there is a designated button for killing them. Feel free to murder them lest they contract eldritch Herpes, become possessed by shoe demons, go insane, or just for because you feel like it.

Abnormalities require experimentation to gain any information about them whatsoever, including which works will cause immediate death or breach. Their names range from utterly incomprehensible to suspiciously literal to outright lies, which is why you should treat 'Nothing There' with utmost caution.

If that wasn't enough, each experiment you perform will add one to the 'Qliphoth Counter', which will eventually result in a 'Qliphoth Meltdown', which causes a set number of random Abnormalities to gain a 60-second timer that will result in immediate breach if you don't work on them before the timer is up.

Sprinkled throughout these Meltdown levels are 'Ordeals' which come in four varieties: Dawn, Noon, Dusk, and Instant Death (Midnight). Depending on what colour and variety you get, citizens of Detroit, meatballs, or irradiated maggots will spawn all over your facility. This is completely unavoidable, and your only option is to try to kill all of them before they explode or eat your employees.

Finally, there are boss fights scattered throughout the game that I can't tell you about, rest assured you get spoiled. However, I can say that I wholeheartedly enjoyed getting eye cancer and watching every one of my employees become subject to Set's Stand Ability from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, and only lost a small piece of my soul.

Overall, this game is very fun and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games made for people who desire suffering, like anime girls, or have heard of SCP in any way. 10/10, would watch helplessly as my resident waifus attempt drug overdose while God's aborted fetus destroys my facility again.",1652929363,1681030456,True,69,23,0.847698867321014404,2,True,False,False

There are few games that properly evoke a variety of emotions of me, and even fewer than can engross me so deeply that I start to obsess over the next session of play I so desperately wish to do. Let me preface this by saying that this game is far from perfect, and it has a lot of things that people will find annoying or downright frustrating. But for me, that was part of the package of experience it offered and it all fit into place so damn well. For me, this is a perfect game suited to my preferences. I was compelled to write this after having spent 142 hours to 100% the game and attain its true ending.

[b]Gameplay[/b]: It's a management game, but also much more than that. The game punishes tiny mistakes and poor choices of judgement in brutal fashion. The grind in the later parts of the game becomes arduous, making each day feel like a marathon. Those mishaps suddenly feel like soul-crushing events that make you feel either you have to make an immense sacrifice to proceed, or restart the day and accept that you just wasted a bunch of your time. Sometimes, even RNG factors in and decides that your destiny is to fail and there's little you can do but watch on as things spiral out of control. Things like this break the will to play for many people, and I wholly understand this. It's an unforgiving game. In terms of combat, you literally are just a commander that sends units from point A to B. They handle everything else, including any special abilities they may possess. You must simply guide them in the direction they need to go. It's a lot more work than it sounds like, and at some points, the game becomes heavily micro-intensive. RTS players will feel at home.

However, what this game does is reward you in dividends for keen observation, patience, and over-preparation. In strategy games, I'm the turtle player. I overcompensate my lack of tactical finesse by developing a powerful base and producing a bunch of high quality units. This is what I did in this game. And this strategy was time-consuming, and at times, it was tedious. But it pays off. Oh boy, does it pay off. I went into this game 95% blind. I learned things through trial and error. This game, while it does have a manual, doesn't have an in-depth guide to every other intricacy it possesses. For some people, the best option is to browse the web for guides and tips. This is perfectly valid, considering the nature of this game. But I think part of what made the experience so memorable and important to me was being constantly beaten down by unknowns in the game, only to rise up and conquer them after observing and learning from my mistakes. Maybe I'm a bit of a masochist, but the feeling of satisfaction you receive when the things you learn help prevail over a trial you struggled to bypass, the euphoria is exquisite.

[b]Narrative[/b]: This game has an interesting story that is provided through visual novel cutscenes between the days of play. You unlock new cutscenes via simple progression of days, and also completing missions assigned to you. For people that dislike reading visual novels or reading in general, the narrative will probably be a miss for you. There's a lot of reading to do. Even for those that do enjoy those genres, the story is a meticulously crafted one where everyone speaks in a certain way that feels like you're always on the verge of philosophising about existence itself. And most of the time, that ends up being the case.

Personally, as a fan of other series that have similarly overtly complicated storytelling (such as Girls Frontline), this game felt like a natural fit for me. I became so engrossed with the world that they built through the dialogues, and the story of the corporation you worked in. They drip-feed you these details that make you crave for more knowledge, and some characters become unforgettable with the way they poetically speak about their story and how they are now. Lobotomy Corporation is very much a story of facing one's fears to build a future that you can walk into. Yes, the game's slogan is truly relevant at all times. Amazing.

And when it all culminated into the ending sequence, and the true ending... I shed tears. It was full of surprises. I was shocked, but I was also relieved. I was given a victory lap. I was given a sheer spectacle that unfolded before my eyes in a way I didn't know the game was capable of presenting, and I was in awe. A truly beautiful way to conclude a game. I pass my thanks onto the CURRENT english translators (I'm aware of the horror stories of the initial translators) for allowing me to experience this wonderful tale. And let's not get into the chills I got from those final lines...

[b]Design[/b]: This game has a simple style that works pretty well, and it even has an in-universe reason for the way it all looks. At first, you will be overwhelmed by the UI and wondering what everything does. You slowly start to learn how everything works, however, and the important things the game will guide you through via the tutorial. You will likely discover new things about the UI as you proceed through the game, and it can only help you. It is very much a game that, once you become adjusted to the interface, everything then becomes second nature to you.

Mechanically, the game doesn't have many complex base mechanics. You primarily manipulate time, and you manipulate your agents. You order your agents to do work, fight escaping monsters, move to locations, etc. This is the majority of your gameplay loop. The variables which change how these function are the Abnormalities. Every Abnormality is unique, and has its own set of conditions to take care of it. This changes what work you do, when you do it, who works on it, etc. It's here that the game truly shines in how varied it can become and how many decisions you end up making. The game will tell you most things about the Abnormalities as you work on them, so you can trial and error before figuring out the correct method of caring for them.

As for the thematic design, the game stands out. It has a unique artstyle that differentiates it from other games, and every single of the Abnormalities are carefully crafted to be exceptionally unique and interesting. Every time I grabbed a new one, I truly wondered what kind of atrocities it was capable of committing. Some designs are unnervingly cute. Some are absolute nightmare fuel. Some are bizarre beyond our wildest dreams. It's a truly colorful roster of entities, and that's not even speaking about the character cast itself. The Sephirah each have their own distinct silhouettes and characters. Many things in the game take heavy influences from cultures and mythologies, such as fairy tales and Kabbalah. Those that enjoy seeing creative ideas and inspirations flourish, eat your heart out.

[b]Conclusion[/b]: I don't usually write reviews. I don't consider myself much of a critic (even though I'm probably qualified for it in some ways). Everything I wrote here, take it as a different perspective when approaching this game. Keep it in mind and develop your own impressions. This is a game that resonates with a certain type of person heavily. It isn't for everyone, but you can only really determine this by trying it out. And I truly believe the experience everyone else will have will be unique to them, depending on their approach.

I felt compelled to write a review for this because it became one of my all-time favorite games. From start to finish, and even beyond finishing, it has captivated me and captured my heart. To the extent that I know that there will never ever be another Lobotomy Corporation. Never another game that will be perfectly suited to my desires and that would deliver this amazing experience onto me. And that's perfectly fine, because I already have it right here.

Now, time to hope Library of Ruina will also capture me so deeply.",1680356838,1680356838,True,4,0,0.539622604846954346,0,True,False,False

it's hard and will definitely test your patience, but when you finally get it down you become efficient at it and you will be able to overcome basically everything else the game throws at you, especially since majority of it is just building upon what you learned earlier.

it's definitely daunting at first and even at times i felt like i wanted to give up or that i wanted to take a break from it, but the difficulty slowly trains you to watch out for specific things and it's so good at doing that, so if you feel like giving up i would just suggest push on for a little longer.

story wise, it's really good and has such a good message and the cast is really good, and it definitely ties into the main gameplay in a thematic way really well. I also don't think any other project moon game was able to capture the feeling of loneliness that this games story has (which is fair as I think it's the only game by them where that feeling would make sense) and that feeling really heightens the experience.

i feel like one of the best attributes the game has however is that it's obvious that project moon had a really fun time making it, stuff like the really charming sound design & abnormality encyclopedia portraits along with the crudely drawn abnormalities makes it obvious they just wanted to make a game that they wanted to make and not what others wanted from them.

at most the negatives would be obviously the jank (the bullet upgrades from chesed don't function at all), the memory leak (probably the biggest issue, it can cause drastic fps drops and possibly crashing depending on the scale), along with the encyclopedia making some abnormalities unclear on how they work at first, but there's no negative in the game that actively ruins the gameplay, and the latter negative applies to a very small few.

overall lobotomy corporation is just a really charming & special game with a really good story that i recommend, definitely in my top 3 games

You're expected to die to something you couldn't have possibly known beforehand, restart, and try again. It sounds bad, but it's actually satisfying.

""Oh, this guy does a ton of black damage, I better have black resistant armor on whoever is working with him. Oh, this guy breaks out if I do X, but calms down if I do Y."" That sort of thing.

The story is great, I haven't come across anything like it before. I can't really explain any of it without spoiling, but I'll just say that it's a wild ride. Each of the horror creatures that you manage has their own backstory that slowly unlocks as you learn more about them.

A lot of the UI elements are clunky, but you get used to it. You don't have control groups, you can't easily see an overview of all of your agents & their status, you can't chain commands like telling an agent to move somewhere then work on an abno, etc. In order to customize your agent's name and appearance you have to spend an in-game resource (unless you mod that out).

Cheat Engine for Speed Hacks.

Basemod (Prerequisite for the other mods)
https://www.nexusmods.com/lobotomycorporation/mods/2
More Detailed Info
https://www.nexusmods.com/lobotomycorporation/mods/47
Permanent Agents
https://www.nexusmods.com/lobotomycorporation/mods/79

Cheat Engine is a must due to the amount of absolute grind there is in this game on subsequent playthroughs, it's not hard, it's tedious, it's awful and it can take you hours if you're not using cheat engine. 
Permanent Agents I recommend for a similar reason, however, if you rush the missions you should be fine without it. I specifically recommend doing the Dusk ordeal mission as soon as you get it if you choose to go without permanent agents. There is an entire other progression system unlocked by that mission that the game just doesn't tell you about.

Lobotomy Corporation is a fantastic game until it isn't. Once you discover all the mysteries all that's left it to do the missions and progress days which will look like clicking between a few safe anomalies to grind power for 10-30 minutes. Which is why you should do your best to progress mission objectives as fast as possible alongside your anomalies since not only do they give you story, they give you buffs, and once the anomalies are all studied there's not much fun to be found.

Back to cheat engine, look at my hours, look at my hours. Probably 20-30 hours of that have been without cheat engine. The rest you can multiply by 5-10. Get cheat engine.

EDIT:

Finally some in game help, you can complete missions and anomalies and rewind time before it ever happened maintaining progress. Meaning if for whatever reason you lost a bunch of people studying something or completing a mission you can rewind time to before it happened, keep that progress, and get back all those lost troops. The only cost being any stat increases on your guys along with new people you recruited.


The gameplay is needlessly time wasting as I've pointed out before. Controlling characters is something you can adjust to but there's no denying it's god awful. Likewise combat is terrible.
Story is great, lore is great. Can't get much further into it because this game could be ruined by spoilers since mystery is a central point (there is one exception).

A related issue is you could get so hard screwed by the game for just not knowing. To various degrees it's layers of BS to it. The lowest layer being that someone dies to anomaly and you get research, this is a central gameplay mechanics you have to send sacrificial pawns. Middle layer is someone dies to an anomaly and you get no research/not enough research. There's a couple I give a pass to because their clever but besides that that's just so uninteractive since a lot of the time these kinds of anomalies just insta wipe you. 

Top BS is the purple noon ordeal instantly killing characters in main rooms and you've been warned. How are you supposed to counter an instant kill for any non-endgame armored, max health characters for this one specific event? The answer is you don't, it happens to you once, you restart the day, and you never leave your characters in the main rooms when you see that ordeal coming up ever again.

Now I may have been going on the negatives for awhile but that's because they're pretty bad and also specific.

Otherwise the story is great. I love the writing for ""most"" of the lore in game. I think the progression system is extremely unique and good once you understand how it works. 
The artwork is great and most the anomalies feel unique. 
A lot of anomalies also have their own unique mechanics which makes the research side of the game really interesting and fun. Every anomaly is its own puzzle. 
The difficulty of the game mostly comes from the lack of understanding so once you've researched every it's naturally easier to progress even if you day 1 because you know what anomalies serve you best. 
The biggest down there is how vague the game is with outcomes and RNG which is part of why I recommend More Detailed Info. Knowing the levels of your characters is also vital for stat farming and even some later objectives, not base game, you need More Detailed Info for that.


Together I think Lobotomy Corporation is a very good but incredibly flawed game. For me I think it's worth it but for others maybe not. It's a cautious recommendation.

EDIT EDIT:
I'm mad, I was mostly positive about this game until day 46. All you need to know is due to in game mechanics I need to replay 45 days to get the true ending because Rewind to the Memory Repository is an awful mechanic, you should just be able to select previous days. I'd like to stress again this isn't a hard game it's a tedious one. So I've given up (again this isn't even taking into account my 5-10x speed multiplier).

If you want the game for the gameplay I can recommend it, it should last a solid 20-30 hours.

If you want the game for its story, look up the game's story on YouTube, I'd go as far as to say this game is openly disrespectful of your time spent with it.
If you want to read up on the lore of the anomalies look at the wiki.

I mean this wholeheartedly that you should never play this game if you want any of the writing you shouldn't touch this game, just view the writing. The only reason I've not changed to a negative review is because I recognize that the game is super fun before you learn every single anomaly.",1679092457,1679340747,True,95,6,0.73661959171295166,0,True,False,False

Other notes:
Even after 400 hours I still absolutely love this game, but it pretty much requires mods for major QoL improvements (do a web search for ""Lobotomy Corporation Streamer Mod Pack""). For a first time playthrough, if you want to experience it vanilla then I would recommend playing up to ~Day 26 to experience most of how the game will play out, but then install mods to make the experience MUCH more enjoyable.",1679269087,1679269087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have beaten it 3 times with my 1st run needing to retry at Day 1 twice and the rest only using memory repository for farming or when needed. At the beginning, the game can be very difficult as you won't know what Abnos gimmicks are, as such you can make a very hellish facility that with one bad result would spiral out of control. However, you do have the ability to rewind back to days ending in 1s or 6s which can allow you to reverse your decision, though any Abno you picked on those specific days are not reversible outside of a day 1 restart. 

The main gameplay loop is learning the Abno's mechanics, getting it's gear, completing any assigned mission and training your employees. Some of the days can be quite calming with the song Neutral becoming engraved into your brain while, others can be a challenge that test's your understand of the mechanics and allowing you to hear it's good OST. There's also combat which essential ends with you sending all of your employees with good gear to beat down any enemy outside of their chamber. Other factors can be considered like the Abno's attack range and their animation which you can use to help make your employees doge attacks. Though this also requires constant micro management but, once you start pilling up with good weapons you can kill things very quickly so this might not become too tedious for some.

I won't talk about the story aside from it being in my opinion, Project's Moon best narrative though there other products have better character writing. The story creates a good mystery for the company Lobotomy Corporation and unravels it quite nicely, and it's writing for the setting is quite good and leaves it open ended enough that you can fill in the blanks with your imagination. 

Now before you start playing the game I strongly recommend getting the game's modding tool Basemod and install the following mods, Optimisation Mod and Gift Effects Fix at the very least. The game is very unstable and some days can go for a very long time, as such you don't want the game to crash and have you lose all your progress for factors outside of your control. Also some things don't work properly which both Basemod and Gift Fix help fix to a certain extent.

In the end, this game is not for everyone and several parts of it can create genuine frustration however, I hold it in a special place and in my opinion is Project Moon best work so far.

1. The game is time consuming. Most of that time is spent watching meters fill up. It's monotonous and dull.
2. The controls are a bit wonky. You can just tell this was not quality development, because it really doesn't handle well. Nothing feels fluid. You have to clunkily select and hand out orders. So much of the time you'll find yourself frustrated that you can't see various UI elements during combat, or the ability to view your own units' stats in various parts is kinda crappy, or the way you can't select multiple units with shift clicking how you'd want to. No hotkeys for almost anything. It's just very clunky and slow You can't move your agents to specific spots in a room, you have to repeatedly tell them to move back and forth to get them to stand where you want them to. It's annoying and just badly designed.
3. This game loves wasting your time with random events(doing the wrong thing with a monster/abnormality, a semi-random Ordeal event) that obliterate the majority of your agents and usually force you to start over. You'll know what not to do next time you play the level, but this game has the formula of forcing you to die basically and then just expecting you to avoid it next time. Rarely does it telegraph these things so the player can avoid it with skill. Just trial and error game overs.
4. UI text is tiny and there's no real option to make it bigger. It's fine during story segments, but it's downright unreadable during status screens or gameplay portions.
5. Game is just littered with poor design choices. The equipment screen is clunky. UI is clunky. Some abnormalities really feel badly designed. The combat is clunky and more difficult to control than it should be.

People insist that the story is incredible, and perhaps it will end up that way. I'm on I think Day 30, and there's nothing all that interesting so far. The writing for the abnormalities themselves are pretty basic and unless you're a really big occult fan or something, they don't really do anything for me.

So in short, I can't really recommend this game because I don't think the average person would actually like it. It seems to be intended for a weird niche of gamers who want a challenge, but one that isn't particularly rooted in skill-based gameplay with good controls, but rather just trial and error, sucking up a ton of time watching meters fill, and remembering what things not to do and not doing them through a clunky interface. I want to like this game more, but it's really not that good.

Edit: To add onto this, I also have to note that this game has a gamebreaking memory leak. The longer you play, the closer you get to a crash. Part of why I stopped playing this game is that I was mostly through a very difficult Midnight ordeal that I had carefully played through only to have the game just crash on me and completely wipe out an hour long session. Then I went to do it again and...it happened again. Absolutely unacceptable for a game that asks for this much meticulous play and time from you for a level to have a crashing problem like this if a level takes 45m-1h for you to finish.",1676631158,1678105495,False,2,2,0.483829230070114136,0,True,False,False

It's a setting where energy cannot meet the needs of the world anymore and they needed to find other ways. Unique monsters (abnormalities or if you like SCP, anomalies) create energy based on how well the human you sent in works with them. There are different strength/danger categories just like SCP. All the monsters have their own backstories, and art made by different artist which is insanely respectable. I love seeing all the effort and love that was put into this game. There is a requirement for time travel in this game, and the boss battles are sooooo difficult. It's my favorite management simulator I have ever played and the story between the days you do your work is so intriguing. I wish I could have more and more of this game, so I started at the very beginning again just so I could experience it again.

It hates your very being. Everything about you. It will beat you bloody. It will anger and frustrate you beyond what you think your limits are. You quit. You return to try again. You repeat the process.

It starts to change your perspective. You realize your employees are disposable to an extent. You lost half the department recontaining that abnormality, but that's fine. You recontained it. You can continue. You hire new ones. You train them up. You lose them.
You repeat the process.

You stop seeing the abnormalities as monsters. They're generators. You prioritize working the ones that give the most power. It's risky, the higher the risk level the more power it gives. You work on the alephs, they're the highest risk, they'll end the day faster. If that aleph gets out, you can't recontain it. It'll wipe your facility.

It does.
Everyone dies.

You repeat the process.


You aren't playing as a manager of this God-forsaken facility.
You [i]are[/i] the manager.


...but, to be less eloquent and more succinct, Lobotomy Corporation is the type of game where it not only expects you to fail (constantly), but weaves that failure to be part of the narrative it tells. It is a hard game, it knows it's a hard game, and it will force you to know it's a hard game. And that's the point! If it wasn't as hard as it is, the narrative wouldn't hit as well as it does!

This does, however, introduce a problem; hard games can often become unfun games, especially if you don't have the time for them. I do not fault anyone who can't put up with Lobotomy Corporation, but I strongly recommend people at least try to.

Don't be afraid of replaying/restarting, even from Day 1.
The games expects you to use memory repository, and the only thing you will lose from going back, even to day 1, are the employees that you hired, and the abnormalities you obtained.
However any items and/or information you obtained from those abnormalities is kept.
Mission progress/completion is also kept, even from Day 1 resets, this makes replaying the game significantly easier, so do not be afraid of this, or losing employees.

With that said, I actually have a fair amount of nice things to say about the game, so let's start off with the

+++Positives+++

The thematics of the game are great!
I thought the general aesthetic worked really well, both for budget reasons and as an intentional style.
But beyond graphics, there's a lot of horror vibes, the store description doesn't lie with what it's inspired by, I really liked the SCP vibes throughout.

Speaking of SCP's, the Abnormalities are numerous and varied, I loved how different a lot of them were, and it was surprisingly satisfying figuring out how to manage them all and in the end, profit off them.

The story was also pretty neat, though I can't go into depth about it.
I found my eyes glazing over it a smidge with how it was worded at points, but overall I liked how dark it was throughout and how things played out with all of the characters.

Lastly, the music was also pretty cool at points.
For the most part it was kinda samey unless things were going wrong, but when things WERE going wrong, it got pretty good.

Now onto the 

---Negatives---

The games performance is terrible, specifically as you progress.
What started out perfectly smooth devolved into low framerates as the facility expanded, to the point where even loading screens came close to crashing the game if I clicked or alt tabbed.
This is a problem when you're faced with combat, because when particle effects happen, the game practically freezes momentarily, but everything is combat has particle effects.
Damage prompts, insanity prompts, blood splatters, everything will cause lag if you use large groups.
Now while small groups have their benefits, being discouraged from using a large group because the games performance will just die along with all my lower level employees, feels terrible.
But even outside of combat, scrolling across the facility is laggy, animations get less smooth and for the late game objectives specifically, it just feels awful.

To go more in-depth on combat, it's really simple. You select employees and you can tell them to either go to a location, or attack something, and later on in the game you get bullets, which let you manually target people to give them shields, health, sanity or just kill them if they start to become troublesome.
But my problem with combat is that it's too simple, I cannot tell an employee where specifically I want them in a room, I can only tell them I want them in that room. So when I'm fighting an enemy and I want to move them to the other side of said enemy, I have to select the employee, tell them to go into a room on the other side of the enemy (assuming there even is one, otherwise their only option is to either get hit or leave the room entirely), wait for the employee to move, select them again and tell them to attack the enemy.
It's tedious, it's clunky and it's one of the reasons I disliked when the game decided to delve more into combat specifically.

Speaking of those objectives from earlier, throughout the entire game you're given missions from different people in the facility, culminating in a final objective from them. These started off perfectly fine, but the last few in particular were just awful.
I will spoil three of these in particular but these are not major plot spoilers, just gameplay ones.
[spoiler]Starting with the Disciplinary Team, I don't understand why they had boss fights be the days objective instead of just collecting energy, the game is not built for boss fights as it just devolves into kiting attacks over and over, even with your best units. But for your units which aren't the best, you just kinda have them on the side, lest they die and ruin everyone elses sanity.
It's a boring fight which you cheese either via kiting, or through some other method, such as unleashing Abnormalities to the work for you, which sounds like a smart use of mechanics but it's pretty dull [/spoiler]

[spoiler]Next is the Record Team, this one is just dull. It takes away your ability to pause and manage things (to an extent), but it also removes your ability to speed things up, opting to speed things up gradually as the day goes along. I find this extremely boring, as most abnormalities don't use time as a mechanic, so it just makes the day go extremely slowly, and if you need to restart, you'll feel every second crawl on by. [/spoiler]

[spoiler]Finally we have the Extraction Team, another mission that requires you to finish a boss fight instead of getting enough energy, so what this means is more kiting to avoid attacks. The gimmick with this boss is cool, you cannot hurt the boss until you deal with specific Abnormalities that get put into a meltdown state.
Once they're vulnerable, you have a good chunk of time to wail on them. There are several problems here. She can place her meltdown effect on abnormalities which are already on cooldown, meaning you need to wait unnecessarily before you can send someone to deal with it, and when the boss becomes vulnerable, they stop for a long while, even if they're in a doorway transition where you cannot reach their model. If you do not deal with them in this state, there is a good chance they'll throw out more meltdowns again, all because you literally could not reach them because the game didn't allow you to.[/spoiler]

And going back to general gameplay, I really wish the game had more automation.
A lot of days, I was just going through the motions, it would've been nice if there was some way I could just automatically send people to go do the jobs I would like them to do. Replaying days felt boring, because very little changed, and as the facility expanded, the fatigue really set in.

And speaking of the facility, I mentioned how I loved the variety of abnormalities earlier, but sometimes the game can give you some abnormalities you're just not able to deal with at points.
Some will get out because you have too many clerk casualties, one will get out because you don't have enough clerk casualties, some will get out because your employees are too underleveled or undergeared and in the worst case scenario, you're getting them on days where a checkpoint is set and going back to said checkpoint fixes nothing. Going back isn't bad, but the reason for it can definitely feel bad.

>>Conclusion<<
Overall, there was a lot I like about the game, and it started off real strong, but it just became so tedious and annoying with what I wanted from me later on.
It's not devoid of quality, and it definitely appeals to some people, but I find that it was more annoying than anything else in the later game for me to recommend this personally.",1677196806,1677196806,False,156,3,0.85990375280380249,10,True,False,False

Great visuals, great soundtrack, great concept. Game is simple to understand mechanically but becomes ridiculously, punishingly hard to the point where you will likely not complete it unless you both know the game inside out and also get fairly lucky with the RNG; speaking of, Lobotomy corporation gives you a choice of three options every handful of days or so which slowly become more and more ""pick the least miserable one."" the longer the game goes on. as a plus it is also fairly easy to mod and it's super easy to customize your in-game agents with your own assets you drew yourself by simply dragging the images into your game files; agents only have one skin tone, however, which may pose challenges for certain types of custom made agents if that's a concern you have.

one thing I will say is that if you are into the game series for the story you will fucking struggle. Lobotomy corporation will dump huge cut-scenes full of text dialogue in-between days (that are about 5 hours of footage all together! holy shit!) that in the moment you want to skip to immediately get to the game play, and/or may not even unlock all of because the games so damn hard you never get to the text dumps at around day 40ish. Made even worse by the fact that Lobotomy corporation is /essential/ to understanding the plot of the two other games in the series (Library of Runia and Limbus [?] company) so you have to either watch 5 hours of just text dump dialogue in a youtube comp or struggle through lobcorp in order to play runia and limbus.

great concept and great game on its own, it just suffers from the fact that its sequel is much more lax; meaning people who play lobotomy corporation because they want to understand runia may walk away frustrated because the grueling rouge-like punishment is nothing like the other two games in the series.",1675771672,1675771672,True,5,0,0.56619715690612793,0,True,False,False

They're rarely far off the mark relative to the game's actual quality. Which is what makes Lobotomy Corporation so interesting; it holds a 94% positive ratio and yet I cannot for the life of me understand why. There is nothing about the game that is at all conducive to a fun experience; if anything, it is explicitly, PAINSTAKINGLY designed to waste your fucking time. Made it through this agonizingly long day after tinkering around with that innocuous new thing you got and learned some of the rules of? Oh wait, after the end of the day, it just fucking kills your mook. Whoopsie! Better restart if you don't wanna make what's yet to come even more painful! Oops, forgot one obscure rule of how a baddie works and now your team that otherwise passes the gear check gets wiped out? Restart!

And that's the entire loop. There's no relief to any of it. You play the same days over and over again so as not to trip over the tiny roots that made you fall neck-first last time and all that awaits is more of the same except there's now even more esoteric rules piled on top that you haven't deciphered yet without restarting the cycle of endless save scumming. It's a dreadful, unforgivable lack of respect for the player's time. And being a roguelite (i.e an almost universally terrible genre), you're expected to repeat this fucking torture multiple times. Where is the fun in any of that? Suffering is fun when you know there's a light at the end of that tunnel. Lobotomy Corp doesn't have a light at the end of that tunnel, it's just an endless fucking tunnel.

During the ""discovery"" phase of playing the game, each new abnormality, mission, and even new day is able to be approached with an abundance of caution and curiosity. You are, after all, still figuring out How Stuff Works™ and the game is willing to allow you to fumble through messily enough with a bit of sass and a knowing grin - just don't mind the knife being held behind their back, it's probably nothing. Even when ultimately you come into a predicament that necessitates use of a Day 1 reset: the seed of discovery keeps the player engaged and curious as to just what might come next. A good thing, then, that the answers can be more delightfully twisted than expectation may lead one to believe. It's compelling in a way that genuinely kept me playing long hours into the night past when I should've gone to bed.

The same cannot be said of the second stage: completion. This will come at different points for different folks in their own games - when the veil of mystery has been pulled back enough that all that remains is an intricate puzzle to be placed together over the course of an hours-long grind of known figures and punishing setbacks. Here, where the nervous tension of not knowing if your favorite Agent might be speeding towards an early retirement is replaced with the dull monotony of watching progress bars fill and hoping that (maybe this time around) circumstances won't end up in disaster, is where LobCorp truly becomes a test of will (and navigating sometimes-fiddly controls). Maybe, perhaps, you'll eek out a win and then rewind the ol' Repository so as to not lose quite so much progress as the End of Day screen dutifully reports. By the fourth or fifth time you're doing this: the aforementioned possibility of just looking up the damned story becomes that much more enticing.

I enjoyed LobCorp, but it's definitely not a game I would be surprised to hear someone tell me that they gave up on mid-way through. My own file ended up utilizing a few quality-of-life mods to make the tedious climb back to the final chapter something that I could complete before my interest in the game truly snuffed out from sheer burnout. At time of completion, I was happy to resign the game to fond memories and hope that the sequel has a bit less tedium and just as much unique creativity.

To end this review, I'll share with you what originally sold me on giving this game a chance: there is boss fights. How the hell do you do that in a management sim game? The answer may surprise you! (It sure as hell surprised me.)",1675578354,1675578354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: One thing that needs to be mentioned is that there's a bug that will cause the game to crash after about 1 hour of playing the same level. It gives an 'Access Violation' in memory, which is caused by a programming error that makes the game use up more and more resources until your RAM is all filled up, which crashes the game. To fix this, I installed the 'Optimization Mod' from nexusmods.com. 

In terms of gameplay, I absolutely recommend buying this game. In terms of the overall product, it irritates me that this bug (which actually prevents you from finishing the campaign, since the levels get longer as you go) has been around for years and the devs have refused to fix it despite numerous reports.

[b]2. This is a Korean game.[/b]
If you don't have experience to know what this means, it is incredibly difficult and you will grind it a lot.  You'll spend a lot of the time doing the same thing over and over hoping for improvement and defeat will be brutal.  Go in expecting the worst and have fun with it.

This is something I didn't really consider at first.  Roguelites require you to fail fail fail and, as you progress, you'll get to keep a little bit of something for the next try.  Don't be afraid to rewind back.  Yeah, it sucks having to grind through the same stuff again, but you'll have more stuff, a better idea of the game, and the opportunity to make new choices.

This cell must contain access to a controlled network with strict whitelist protocols. WatchMojo domains are not to be included in the whitelist under any circumstance.

[b]Description:[/b] SCP-8008 is a humanoid creature with little muscle mass, suggesting a sedentary lifestyle. Security personnel describe the aroma of SCP-8008's containment cell as ""Anime Cons before the girls started showing up.""

SCP-8008 is normally docile and mutters to itself without need for sleep or sustenance. These mutters are incomprehensible without high frequency audio recordings, which decipher them to be endless ""Top 10"" lists. Interactions with Class-D personnel reveal that SCP-8008 will provide coherent statements when asked its opinion on games, during which its normally humanoid face will grotesquely twist into exaggerated expressions resembling emoji pictographs.

[b]Class D#******[/b]: So it says here I'm supposed to ask you what do you think of [DATA REDACTED]
[b]SCP-8008[/b]: I think it's wonderfully creative with its varied Abnormalities, quirky art style and off-kilter narrative, but it's held back by a clunky UI and monotonous gameplay once the mystery behind it has been solved. I recommend it to anyone who gets the meta of this review, or anyone fascinated by creepypastas in general, but for the money, I'd sooner pitch Don't Starve, Cultist Simulator or any of the Sunless game.

This description is incredibly misleading. When you think of a ""simulation"", one would assume that there would be different aspects you control in the game, but those mechanics are completely shallow. And the ""roguelike"" aspect only comes from the selection of artifacts or monsters you choose from when given the opportunity to do so.

As far as the whole simulation aspect is concerned, there's very little of it. You can ""hire"" employees, change their equipment and decide what they do, based on the department they work in. That's it. There's really no management of resources, or selections of departments or tools or anything like that.

As far as the game goes, it's very simple, each successful day completed you choose from a new ""abnormality"" (which is labeled under a serial number). Then you spend the day trying to understand it by studying it while maintaining and containing all of your other abnormalities.

Studying a abnormality is completely a game of guess work and can completely ruin a game until you know what's going on with it. Unless you've watched play throughs and understand what they do and what they need, all you can do is blindly click.

After you complete research of a abnormality, it's just a matter of grinding energy and packages from them. That's it. The first couple of day(s) can be fun, but the longer you play, the longer you realize that's there's actually very little gameplay holding this game together. And it gets boring very quickly.

For almost $25.00 for a ""indie"" game, I would have really expected a lot more based on what they actually advertise. In some instances I would actually argue their STEAM store page may be misleading and possibly false advertising.

If you can get this game for $5.00 then fine, take a chance. But at full price this game is a full blown rip off.",1673873696,1673873696,False,2,1,0.485349416732788086,0,True,False,False

It's one of those games like papers please where the game tells you to do something then keeps adding new instructions to remember. Except instead of just GIVING you new instructions you have to learn them through experimentation and trial and error.

You unlock the instructions by interacting with an abnormality long enough to be able to buy small chunks of information about it. The game forces you to interact with randomly chosen abnormalities in the facility, meaning if you don't guess new abnormalities' gimmicks in time you could easily end up with a containment breach [strike]or worse[/strike]

When an abnormality escapes containment, the gameplay style shifts from a papers please memory game to permadeath RTS until you recontain or figure out how to reliably plan around the abnormality. Some of the REALLY messed up abnormalities will willingly recontain themselves after they finish their objective. Oftentimes the wrong abnormality escaping can turn a normal day into a bum rush for meeting the quota to finish the day as the state of the facility gradually escalates in danger.

Unfortunately sometimes the transition between music is jarring, especially during boss fights which use the same over the top actiony theme only for the first phase of every boss, when the first phase usually includes 3 minutes of careful setup while the game is paused.

The visual novel story is also very good, but there are a few times where a good story beat is ruined by the translation being a little crusty, even after the retranslation. Without spoiling anything, a lot of the characters have developed some of their more wacky personality traits as a reponse to the ""high employee turnover rate"" or from negative experiences with other members of the company.

Lob Corp is a roguelike Monsters Inc SCP RTS Windows 12 on DVD toaster management game. 
You play as the manager of a perfectly normal and humane power company and your goal is to manage the facility to make sure your workers are able to efficiently meet the energy quota each day. At the end of each day, you get to choose a Friendly Creature to put in your facility, which You Cannot Ignore :] and have to work with and discover more by spending points that you get by working with it. What's that? You don't want to touch the weird slime creature after discovering it will infect your entire facility with Love and Kindness after working with it? Too bad! After certain amount of works, some containments will get a ticking time bomb to force you to work with them, lest you wish for the Friend to escape and turn the clerks and agents into raspberry jelly across the halls of the facility. 

The game also has a really good story, which slowly reveals to you what is actually going on in this corp and the backstories of each character you meet. 
In the beginning and right at the end, the game is definitely tough and you will encounter situations that you are unprepared for very often, so RESET DAY is a button you will get acquainted with very well. Also don't play this without optimisation mod, that's one of the flaws this game has with a few more but I don't think it's a good enough reason to just say it makes the game not worth playing.
It's definitely a niche game and it's not for everyone but I recommend at least giving it a shot. Story itself is worth reading so.. and it has a very good soundtrack, which is also different than your normal OST.",1597169099,1673463330,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After reading some of the almost comical requirements to actually 100% the game (e.g. to get the ""true"" ending), I've decided to call it here. If I could give a ""meh"" review I would, but a negative review better conveys my current stance on the game better than a positive one.

My honest recommendation to people considering LC is to please THOROUGHLY research the game (possibly including a bit of spoiler material!) before deciding to play it till the ""end"". I will try to avoid spoilers below.

PROS:
- The lore/story (as badly conveyed as it is, in my personal opinion) is fairly interesting. This is a very lively world and everything is not at all as it seems when you first start playing. Also, the reset mechanics are tied into the story itself.
- The ideas/characters put into this game are very creative. What you do see of the AIs is somewhat endearing
- The management is initially quite engaging. You have to keep track of a lot, but it is rewarding to clear days with no deaths and well trained agents.
- The research/upgrades in the game make a big difference and are quite distinct from one another, unlike in some other games where its just a ""+5% damage"" type of system
- The Boss fights are mostly quite varied and challenging, mostly in a good way though this breaks down a bit at the end.
- Some of the music tracks are quite good, others get repetitive quickly.
- The four damage types + weapon/armor variety helps to diversify combat.

NEUTRAL POINTS:
- Music can get very grating after long sessions. This can be turned off, obviously.
- This game would massively benefit from the workshop, but no such allowance was made. Fortunately other modding is possible.
- Sound effects are meh.
- Graphics/artstyle choices are... meh. They don't endear me or push me away from the game. Up to personal preference whether you like or don't like the cartoony aesthetic.
- Some players have reported very serious issues with the possesion mechanic not working properly (e.g. some people that should be able to be un-possesed cant be, and so you have to reset). I have not encountered this so far, but be wary.


=== NOTE ===
Thankfully, some of the issues that will be outlined in the CONS section can be fixed with mods. In fact, issues that can be fixed, or at least ameliorated with mods will be marked with a ""[Mod full fix]"" or ""[Mod partial fix]"" tag for your convenience in the CONS section below. However, I am judging the game on its own merits, and not on the those of the modders that gave their time & effort to fix its many problems.
===========

CONS:
- surprisingly Sub-standard controls. The game has the manager exert very indirect control of agents, and No control of clerks whatsoever. This will often lead to completely unnecessary damage/breaches/deaths that are frustrating setbacks or outright resets. As an example, a major strategy in the game is to put agents into elevators so they can be grouped up and thus fight anomalies in clumps of melees & ranged squads... Instead of just letting the player group them in some custom arrangement.

[Mod partial fix] - You can speed up time in this game, but not nearly enough. Eventually even 2x/2.5x is wildly insufficient for how tedious much of the management phase becomes. 

[Mod full fix] - Very poor conveying of (VERY important) statistical information to the player. Part of the game is, obviously, to let the player become a manager of a huge, byzantine facility and make the best of it. LC, however, takes this to excessive lengths. The game plays around with giving the player access to information as part of research/story progression (HP/SP of agents/abnormalities as part of a research from one of the AIs). LC, however, does NOT give info on Shield HP/SP, NUMERICAL HP/SP of agents/abnormalities, NUMERICAL Use-Speed/Range of weapons, NUMERICAL success probability with fully understood abnormalities... This is extremely important information to properly manage the facility!

- Very poor conveying of spatially-related information. The game will not notify you if someone in the facility is taking damage / in combat, nor will it tell you how they died. I suppose this could be a deliberate design decision, but it is one that is hugely irritating to me personally. I much prefer the Rimworld method of alerting you to threats. ALSO, agents can Stack on top of one another, and then you cant easily see their HP/SP

[Mod partial fix] - Many models do not display the correct weapon your agent is holding, which can cause confusion in the middle of an important suppression.

- Again, personal opinion, but the way the story is conveyed is very, very poor. Others might not mind this more ""scattershot"" type of storytelling.

[Mod partial fix] - Unacceptable performance issues that can cause memory leaks. I was shocked to see >95% RAM utilization (out of 32gb DDR5) by this game one night. Be aware you will probably have to limit your play time to a few hours to avoid this. There is also generally poor optimization.

- No spoilers, but a good number of the ordeals/bosses in this game are simply boring timesinks that are occasionally frustrating and generally tedious exercises in kiting for minutes on end. Late game can be pretty egregious in this regard

- No spoilers, but some abnormalities are genuinely run-enders if you are unlucky with their placement, or just rely on frustrating mechanics to not cause immense damage (Like getting ""Normal"" results only). Getting enough abnormalities that care about agent/clerk deaths can cause spirals that go on to cause resets as well, though this is eventually mitigated with execution bullets.

- Eventually ~75% of your abnormalities will be completely ignored in favor of more dangerous (more energy producing / more efficient training) abnormalities. I feel this is a missed opportunity wherein we the player have no reason whatsoever to interact with the vast majority of the facility. 

[Mod full fix] - This game is already painfully tedious and (imo) pointlessly time consuming after enough time has gone on that the players has a good grasp of the game. Why can't I queue actions? Some consider this part of the management process, I consider this forced, boring busywork.

- You have no idea how long an agent has been using a tool abnormality and so have to: 1. guess or 2. using a separate abnormality as a makeshift timer or 3. use a real world timer (hope you are not at 1.5/2.5x speed 
 in game!). This has genuinely been a huge headache on every run.

[Mod full fix] - Training employees is a near complete guessing game. Perhaps I missed something, but until I read the wiki outside the game itself, I had not idea how my agents stats were being changed as a result of work/suppression/gifts. This is, again, very important information that the game doesn't tell you. I feel like Im seeing a rather unfortunate trend for a MANAGEMENT game.

- This one is subjective, but I feel the way clerks are handled is very strange and could have done with a some overhauling. Essentially clerks provide you with buffs, some of which are fairly important. But eventually you will probably have to cull very large portions of them (usually with execution bullets) to prevent abnormalities from breaching as a response to too many clerk deaths from abnormalities or other events. So you can:
1. Not cull employees, and so risk breaches, which will probably kill clerks and reduce/lose buffs.
2. cull employees, and so diminish breach risk, but also reduce/lose buffs.
The player is put in a situation where they have buffs when they LEAST need them (start of day), and dont have them when they MOST need them. (middle/late into day).",1673408653,1673408922,False,2,0,0.530176281929016113,0,True,False,False

It's a good game to play if you enjoy challenge and have the time to sink into it. 
It's also good for those who enjoy fantasy, management, SCP, as well as watching your little nuggets grow and become the ugliest and strongest possible <3
There is no more joy than watching them grow extra eyes on their cheek, maybe where a literal face mask... yuck! But aw!

The game play is engaging and feels rewarding.
While it definitely has a bit of a problem where if you don't know what you're doing the first time around you may have to restart the whole cycle (which can take a while depending on how you play, and it often requires a bit of grinding), it has the tools to let you explore, try again, and slowly figure out what each abnormality can do.
As you figure out what each one does, you're rewarded with an increases in stats, information, story, and even weapons/accessories depending on the abnormality.
When I see the little ugly nuggets smack their silly pink goo and feather bullets(?!) at each abnormality and destroy them you can't help but feel a bit of pride.

As a reward for progressing and surviving you get to learn the stories of each character, and if you play your cards right, you can learn so much more about them.

Just to explain the game, the game is about harnessing energy from monsters. The more dangerous the monster is, the more energy produced. The monsters can escape and kill your employees either by escaping and attacking them or using special abilities they have. They escape if the little number located out their containment cell goes to 0. Some monsters have no number and just has a cross. 

Enough of the explanation, several factors make this game really hard. 
First reason: The gameplay is original so you can't use knowledge or skills from other games. This means that even a heavy gamer's skill in this game will be as close to a light gamer. 
Second reason: RNG. I just hate RNG. No. Just no. All games do have a bit of RNG no matter what, but this game, oh this game. I fucking hate this game's RNG. There are things called, ""Ordeals"" and these things are based off of RNG. The midnight Ordeals will make you suffer and cry if you are a little noob like me and if you played this game, it probably is safe to say that the green one is the easiest Ordeal.

Lobotomy Corp's ordeals and abnormalities (and when you have to deal with so much at once) really feel both overwhelming and unfun. I do not shy away from a difficult game but it does not really become that much more manageable the further you go, and eventually you will hit a wall where you have to redo more than you are willing to do anyway.

You have an Agent who needs to gather energy from it. You chose what type of work to perform, and that's it. You watch the little guy go and hope for the best. If you're a good manager, this game will become routine, almost tedious in its design. If everything is performing as intended, all you do is schedule your little guys to do their little works and once you've got enough energy you move on to the next day to continue the story. But not everything goes as you want it to.

Every single Abnormality has its own list of rules that must be obeyed. This Abnormality kills you if your work time takes too long. This one gives you a gift, but if you work on another Abnormality while carrying its gift you die and turn into a horrible monster. This one doesn't like Repression work. That one hates employees with high Temperance. These are all rules you'll have to tuck away into your subconscious as you play the game. Forget any one rule, and you're likely to have an employee die. I once had spent a few hours on a single day trying to grind my employee's stats to maximum for upcoming challenges. I had one employee work with a safe abnormality who gives a little healing orb for doing work. It's not an abnormality that's good at training stats however, so I sent that employee to work with another to finish off her stats. To my dismay I forgot that anyone carrying the orb is likely to die if they work on any other Abnormality. Not only that, but any employees who got the orb throughout the day ALSO die when that happens, causing 5 deaths in my facility of 20 employees.

But this is where the game really starts to shine in my opinion. You can Retry at almost any time. Those 5 employees are back under my care, as though nothing had ever happened. I was a bit aggravated to lose my employees, but it was my fault. Fundamentally, Lobotomy Corp does not present the player with impossible tasks. There is never a case where an employees death is a requirement to progress. Some challenges can be made easier by throwing a few corpses at it. One of the hardest challenges in the entire game can be made trivial if you're willing to commit to sacrificing a single employee, but it's never a requirement to progress. A deathless run is more than doable. Everything comes down to player knowledge. In that way this game is a little bit like Outer Wilds. Your own knowledge is one of the strongest weapons at your disposal.

But then it gets even better. Every 5 days the game saves to something called the Memory Repository. Any gear you've unlocked, quests completed, research gained, and upgrades acquired persist when returning to the Memory Repository. That one sacrifice to cheese one of the hardest encounters in the game? That employee too can come back. The challenge will still be cleared. And you will have new resources available further challenges even easier. You can go through a week, farm a bunch of high level gear, and return to the start of the week with everyone alive and now decked out in the high level gear you just earned.

And so eventually we return to the status quo. My entire facility is now flooded with Level V Agents with maxed out stats and EGO Gifts. My facility is so powerful we can set dangerous ALEPH class Abnormalities free for fun and easily suppress them without a single lost employee. And so the game has returned to that tedium I mentioned before. If you're a good manager, nothing will go wrong. If nothing is going wrong, then all you're really doing is farming energy and moving along. The game has two ways of co this fatigue. Ordeals, and Missions.

Missions are challenges set forth by the other characters in the game. Most of these are pretty easy, but some can be quite challenging. One of them is Suppress 3 different ALEPH Class Abnormalities in a single day. For someone like me with a small army of super units decked out in the best gear thanks to judicious use of time travel, this is fairly trivial. But for most players this is a wall that will be nearly insurmountable. They also reward you with permanent upgrades.

The second mechanic is Ordeals. These are essentially uncontained Abnormalities that appear randomly throughout the day. The game gives you a warning before they spawn, and the player themselves must trigger the event by performing work. The first time you encounter an Ordeal it will likely be a nightmare. You won't understand what these clowns are. you won't be in position to stop them, and you won't understand why Der Freishutz just shot a bullet down a hallway and killed half your employees. Eventually you'll learn that the clowns spawn in random hallways, but only one per department. You'll learn that their goal is to either breach or trigger the special ability of an abnormality in their hallway, and you'll learn that you can easily hard counter them by placing one employee per hallway ahead of time. And that's only  Crimson Dawn, one of the easiest Ordeals to handle. Thankfully though every single Ordeal save one is just like this. They have a very obvious counterplay, and once you understand it you won't lose an Employee to it ever again. Except for Violet Midnight. If you see Violet Midnight just hit that Retry button I guess. It ain't worth it.

And thus we once again return to the norm. You've completed the missions, you know how to handle Ordeals, your abnormalities are safe. And then the game starts throwing something else at you that pushes you to the brink. Suddenly you get a challenge where all your work Orders are scrambled. Your employee stats are lowered. Healing is disabled. A skilled player will not be used to putting out fires. They'll prevent the fires from happening in the first place through diligent management. And then the game sets off an inferno, and tells you ""Adapt or die."" These are some of the most fun challenges the game has to offer, but also the most difficult. These moments are stressful, tense, and you'll probably have to retry some of them several times before you clear the challenge, but at the same time the catharsis once you do is one of the best. And remember, all of the above is still in play during these challenges. Abnormalities still need work.

I could honestly say as much about the story as I've said about the gameplay. I found the characters endearing and charming. The abnormalities are as much a character as anything else in this game, and most of them are lovely. My personal favorite is probably CENSORED. An abnormality that pokes fun at all those childishly written SCP Articles where they try to add mystique and danger by just spamming [REDACTED] all over the page. The abnormality itself is a giant censor bar because it's so horrifying to look at that even you, the manager, would die just seeing it. Top class stuff. Despite its arguably horror roots and shocking, violent content, the game isn't afraid to be a bit cheeky and playful with it all. The game's setting is one that will sneak up on you. The true nature of the City, and the world they all live in is fairly compelling anti-capitalist stuff. One of my favorite Abnormalities is a blind birth with a crooked Scales of Justice hanging on its neck. The bird cannot tell that the scales are crooked because it is blind. Absolutely flawless symbolism.

The music is also great. There's only like 10 tracks total, but they're all wonderful and never get grating despite looping constantly. The graphics are clumsy, and the game is a bit poorly programmed and janky in spots, but everything else fantastic.

TLDR: Lobotomy Corporation is a tough, but ultimately fair game with lots of replay value wrapped in a great story with sometimes tedious gameplay. Surprisingly well balanced in spite of what others have said about vertical difficulty spikes or impossible challenges. 9/10, I could have gone on, but I ran out of space.

A challenging game is not a bad game but it needs too much of luck sometime to break through the ordeals.
Also without mods, the game was frequently laggy. It might be my system but the lag added another problem on the top of uncomfortable control. It is a definitely forcing to  use a micro-control to avoid certain enemies, but it does not even have a basic functions, such as a group set for specific agents (like an attack team for monsters or something).
The art style and atmosphere of the game is excellent. The story was hard to digest for me though. I understood the storyline but some details are a bit obscure.

In many ways, it reminds me of Darkest Dungeon - while gameplay bears very little resemblance to that game (seeing as DD is a roguelike dungeon-crawler and Lobotomy Corp is a management simulator with heavy SCP influence), it has several similar concepts. Death is simply inevitable for your characters, even your favorites, and many circumstances may simply have no good outcome. Randomness is a huge factor, both in what you'll face and in your ability to deal with it. And of course, monsters are always, always, always dangerous.
Unfortunately...that's where the similarities end.
Darkest Dungeon, while it certainly isn't for everyone, is very carefully balanced. Once you understand the strategy, and perhaps progress through the game a bit, the game becomes at least manageable, if not easy. Randomness can be planned for. Death can be avoided. It takes thought and care, but it is feasible. And more importantly, neither death nor random chance can permanently screw over a run. Even if things go horribly, horribly wrong and you lose a great deal of progress, it's always possible to get back on your feet and keep going.
Lobotomy Corporation, on the other hand, is far less balanced. Randomness is inherent in everything - from what Abnormalities you'll get to how they're managed. You have very little information on an abnormality you've just got, and trying to learn about it is often very dangerous. Methods of taking care around it, of having sacrificial meeples to feed to it while you figure out what's up with it - nothing like that is present. You simply have to hope for the best.
But, you might think, at least once you HAVE learned about an Abnormality, interacting with it won't be much trouble. And you'd be right. However, the game's method of counteracting this is...interesting, at best. As the game progresses, combat events called Ordeals - which rapidly become unavoidable - plague your facility. These Ordeals are equivalent to an Abnormality escaping - something which the game insists, quite rightly, that you avoid at all costs - and are also entirely random. Some are easy. Some are all but unbeatable. And there's nothing you can do to affect which you'll get.
In addition to all of this, the game forces you along at a breakneck pace. Every day, you get a new Abnormality, which must be studied and worked with before the next day. Every day, you have no choice but to expand your facility, requiring resources to be stretched as thin as possible to keep it fully staffed, much less capable of dealing with Ordeals. You're frantically playing catch-up the entire time, trying to have even the slightest balance as obstacle after brutal obstacle is thrown your way.
And meeple death? Death is, in many situations, unavoidable, but always UTTERLY crippling. Hiring a new employee requires the use of currency, called LOB. This currency is also used to upgrade existing employees. But - in addition to the loss of a crucial worker - the penalty for employee death is that the already very limited LOB you're awarded at the end of the day is reduced. Meaning that having a meeple die makes it even harder to get another. May I remind you of the unavoidable, highly lethal combat events that occur daily. Not to mention that witnessing an employee die makes other, nearby employees go insane - something which often leads to more death, starting a cascade which can't be stopped.
The game does make some attempt to address this. At any time, you can restart the current day from scratch, or restart from a set checkpoint (which occurs every five days or so). However, much like the Ordeal events, this solution feels clunky and is rarely enjoyable - the only way to avoid character death is to reset over and over until all the numbers roll just right? Really? It quickly sucks any soul out of the game, transforming it from a management simulator into a game of balancing numbers, trying to keep ahead and fulfill the goals you've been given while constantly being provided with more and more blocks to progression and occasional victories that will disappear with the next reset.
Overall, I'd give Lobotomy Corporation a 5/10. It has a fun art style, interesting creatures, and an intriguing story and world. But the gameplay, which always has player enjoyment be its last priority, makes all of those features pale by comparison.",1670242842,1670242842,False,18,0,0.539897143840789795,3,True,False,False

A superb blend of the visual novel, management, and roguelelike genres!

[h1]Story[/h1]
I loved the story setup and gradual unraveling alongside the events happening in the factory itself. The characters, lore, and general worldbuilding were all intriguing and left many open questions that I hope are even further explored in the sequel (Library of Ruina). That is not to say the story was completely open-ended. I thought there was a concrete conclusion to this game itself which I thoroughly enjoyed even as it set up the sequel in the epilogue.

The story is short relative to the amount of gameplay time necessary to get the true ending. So, if you discover you do not enjoy the gameplay it is absolutely not worth the amount of gameplay required to see the full story unfold.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
I thought the combination of management with roguelike mechanics and some permanence (you keep a few things such as abnormality information and equipment across resets) made for a really fun experience. The retry/reset mechanisms also provided a ton of room for freely experimenting. The ""boss"" and ""mini-boss"" fights were all unique and provided some clever uses of all the game mechanics which could really require you to change up your strategy and adapt.

I do not typically play management games. I actually discovered this one due to finding out it was the prequel to Ruina. I have not yet played Ruina since I decided to play them in order. However, I do at least know the gameplay is completely different (card-based vs. management). 

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The OST seemed quite small, but it blended really well into the ambiance considering it is on loop throughout most of the playthrough as you navigate each day. I never felt distracted or annoyed by any song despite hearing them countless times.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics can look outright silly and goofy at times, especially considering the dark events going on. There is an in-story explanation for why things look the way they do and you even get glimpses of what things really look like as you progress.

That said, I thought the general graphics and designs were fine in the grand scheme of things. The more ""artistic"" pieces littered throughout which depicted the true gritty reality looked phenomenal!

[h1]Cons[/h1]
There was one big con which I thought was worth mentioning: some of the UI can be [i]too[/i] vague or lacking in certain information. Here is a non-exhaustive list of examples off the top of my head: 

1. The success percentage for each type of work does not show up anywhere in the in-game UI. I had to always look it up on the wiki if I wanted to know.

2. The game gives no indication of how many hits a weapon does per attack. A seemingly weak weapon might actually be really strong despite it showing low damage values because of a high number of hits per attack. The game only shows ""attack speed"" which is separate from number of hits per attack. I only discovered this one late into the game when I started checking the wiki.

3. There is no dashboard to easily check each agent's status, including shields. You can partially work around this one by selecting any unit and shuffling through the departments that way, although that view is lacking shield info or the ability to select an agent (as in the view you get when you click them).

I know some of the information limitations (especially agent statuses) may have been intentional and are part of the handicaps you get at times. Still, I wish they were more clearly visible when they were not intentionally being hidden as part of a challenge since information is a core part of the gameplay. The bright side is that the wiki is rich in information and makes it possible to get a lot of the missing in-game information easily.",1670149965,1670150024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is generally fine but there are some rooms that do not have an adjacent room to the left which makes things kinda annoying.",1669959695,1669959695,True,2,0,0.501229703426361084,0,True,False,False

With that being said, one of my favorite games. The feeling of overcoming a challenge like this, the knowledge that you did it, knowing that you are better then the game, on that day, in that situation, is an amazing feeling.

Here you manage your team. generate energy for the world. Simple.
Things can go wrong will go wrong but nothing is too difficult for you to handle.
Remember your ultimate goal is to reach energy quota. Employee are expendable.

It is true this game suffer a case of micromanagement especially the difficult combat sequence.
""Employee are expendable"" holds true except the contradiction here is that you need a high level employee to get the job done wether its for combat or day to day work. Which led to a grind that most managers will catch on quickly. 

Art direction is superb, everything goes together. I absolutely love this and the game itself isn't afraid showing the gruesome part of it. Sound is also great it complements the art style. Music ... oh boy another contradictory its like the game wants you, the manager to mess up and get the situation under control instead of taking an easy way out.

Gameplay has some learning curve but once understand it turns into a fight against the User Interface.
Micromanagement is there but macro is also present as some combat scenario discourage the use of big angry agent mob.
Feeling left out? The game will give you a tool to directly interact on your employee later as the game progress.

Minor spoiler tips. It is unrealistic to go through the whole game on the first playthrough. Holds very true on day 46-50. 
The game gives 4 ways for the manager to reset their progress 3 of which continue your progression.

A daily reset.
After everyday 5 reset.
All the way back to Day 1.
Use these to your advantage.

Last but not least the forsaken reset. Back to square one everything you've done, gone.

Edit: Okay, real thoughts this time
I can't stress this enough but this game WILL beat your ass until it is nothing but dust, even if you're not aiming for 100% completion. I was foolish enough to think ""well this game is rough but i think i can brute force through all the bs and bad optimization"" 

almost 200 hours in, i still haven't gotten all the possible endings and don't think i will until the optimization has been improved. The final days will be so rough on lower end pc's that the game constantly tries to shit itself after anything significant, for example after completing the hellish day known as 47 and treated to interesting lore, the game froze and tried to close itself several times. My pc was barely holding on. I can stand the poor combat, i can stand the brutal difficulty, but i can't stand it with 8fps. 

Reason why i recommend it is because i still hold hope for the game, if you don't like it, thats fine.",1662825202,1669513010,True,4,5,0.490346074104309082,0,True,False,False

The overall theme is a depressing, unforgiving and lethal world but it does try to be a bit hopeful.
Pretty much you have to manage your facility as you gain more and more creatures to contain and you will need to trial by fire each one and you will 100% take casualties and later your entire facility will more often than not be in peril and RNG of which ones you get, with what, where and when can determine just how bad things really can get and let me tell you if your unlucky and still lacking strong E.G.O.(its the name of the gear, the name makes sense later) it can get BAD. Like my current facility is filled with things that can and will breach off each-other. 

Its actually has a big rouge-like element where you can reset to certain imprints or even the first day and keep your gear and research/upgrades (employees however are reverted/lost so screenshot the ones you like so you can recreate them)

From a few waifus to mostly freaks of nature, this game probably has quite a few of anomalies that may catch your eye in interest.
Certain combinations of abnormalities can fuck you really hard your 'first play-through' forcing you to reset early but i'm in my 1st 'reset to first day' play-through while running a ""no death"" policy where I will reset no matter who/how my agents (The controllable ones) die (This is way harder and way longer than just letting them die tbh) and I currently have a pretty freaking difficult facility and i'm still doing ""just fine"" so with a will there is a way but don't be afraid to reset it back to the first day(try to get as much gear as you can before that) as it can and WILL get much harder.

You will get pretty funny and unique EGOs like a powerful WAW sniper rifle that the agent wielding should be alone 24/7(kinda fitting) as he will shoot through everything in the room including the red paste across the floor of the poor squad that you accidentally grouped him with.(also fitting)

It does have some mods on the nexus and are pretty easy to install, and you can create your own character features like hair for example though a little annoying it seems.
Biggest complaint probably is performance as it.. runs really weird is the best way to describe it even with a performance mod.

So I think it personally sits at a 8.4/10


One last thing future run saving tip regarding the functions of a certain anomaly:
You may get an anomaly that is a red button DO NOT press it out the gate, don't think about it instead make sure to get its 'observation' via clicking on its 'details' tab a lot in 'deployment' first, but if you plan to see what it does face first I recommend taking all your gear off as that thing saves the game after you spam press it(not sure if its intentional either) as it grants its 'observation' which forces a save meaning all that gear your employees were wearing? Gone, no reset will fix it(It might be ""safe"" to press after getting its observation?). Spoiler you say? Very small but you would thank me for saving your gear. It does have cool effcts though and technically you can use its ""save feature"" beneficially.
Yea I spammed clicked it my first time I regret it, wasn't the worst problem(I didn't have hard to get event gear at the time) but holy fuck it was annoying

It is a tad time consuming to get 100% Upgrades and research.
Additionally this game has a sequel.

originally I wrote that the translation was.. eh not the greatest but now its pretty good, and I have even increased the rating by .4 although a little of the charm is gone due to the removal of the alien but poetic like writing but it still a good story.
I also did other rewording and adding stuff

The story is super interesting, the abnormalities are all unique and fun to learn about, and the cute art style finally mixes it all together to make something super special. It is definitely worth the price tag.

The story and writing is great. Lots of abnormalities, each with their own little stories. The sound design and music is good too.

Gameplay is terrible, though.

You will need to restart in-game days and even entire playthroughs a lot, especially if going in blind. In the first few runs, you will not have much information to work with, and will have to resort to trial, error, and lots of failure to figure out the best way to manage what you've got. Restarting is major part of the core gameplay loop and is encouraged; it's even relevant to the plot. Rewinding to a recent checkpoint or even the start of a playthrough lets you keep the equipment, upgrades, and most importantly, the information gained from the previous runs.

The pacing is quite slow. Most of the game is spent sending your agents to work with abnormalities, waiting for them to reach the containment unit, waiting for them to finish their work, waiting for them to return back to their department's main room, and then waiting for them to heal before sending them out to work again. Even with 2x speed, this feels like a drag.

The worst part is that the optimal strategy involves grinding, by having your agents continue to work long after the workday is over to farm experience or gifts. This is further exacerbated by the fact that agents are not permanent (they can die and be lost forever, or lost when you start a new playthrough), and the fact that you can't check your leveling progress (only by ending the day can you see the stat increases). All that grinding, for a run that may or may not end in utter failure, does get tedious.

The game isn't very accessible either. Much of the text containing important information, like the stat requirements to equip an item or the notifications that inform you that yet another employee has died, are too small to read comfortably, with no option to change the font size.

There's also quite a few bugs caused by simple typo errors in the code, which to this day, have yet to be officially fixed, and need to be fixed by unofficial mods.

The only reason I still think this game is worth playing despite all its flaws, apart from the story, is the mods. While the game does not have Steam workshop support, there are numerous mods from various other sites, adding quite a bit of content and quality of life features.

Honestly though, their next game, Library of Ruina, is much, much better, and I recommend playing that instead before deciding if you want to get this. If you still want to play this though, for the sake of your IRL Sanity Points, I suggest at least getting a few QoL/bugfix mods, such as the automatic work macro mod, and once you're familiar enough with the game, a game speed increasing mod.",1668527571,1668527571,True,3,0,0.460530340671539307,0,True,False,False

Your task is to train your employees and use them to study and extract energy from a bunch of monsters. Each monster has its own particularities about how it should be handled, that, if not respected, will lead to a bunch of also particular penalties. This complexity is, I think, the point that makes this game stand out from others in its genre the most.
Apart from this, the setting and characters are quite exceptional, and the story is pretty good.
While most of the game is actually rather easy, it also provides some very hard challenges here and there, so overall I'd say the difficulty is satisfying.

In terms of defaults, I guess the worst point is how it doesn't manage to fully use its mechanical complexity. Ok, every monster is very particular. But in truth, most of the time, the game will allow you to ignore nearly all monsters to focus on the few most convenient ones, which, in my opinion, kind of defeats the point of implementing all those monsters and behaviors in the first place. I also can't help but wonder if being able to easily unlock the full explanation of how individual monsters work was a good idea or not. Perhaps letting the player study them themselves would have been a better idea? Maybe not. I don't know.
It is also somewhat buggy, though not overly so. In my entire playtime I had a single crash, and a few other minor problems.
Throughout the game, there are lots of downtime between the actual challenges, meant purely for grinding. This time investment is meant to make you more engaged and tense during difficulties, as every mistake will come with the risk of permanently losing the resources you've grinded for. I'll admit this might be a necessary evil when done in moderation, but I honestly think this game goes a bit too far into wasting your time.

Thankfully, there are a few mods out there that can help you tailor the experience to your liking. I would definitely recommend checking them out 10~20 hours into the game, to see if there are any that could fix whatever problem you might have with the game at that point.

Difficulty: Gets increasingly difficult as you progress.
Length: It took me 130+ hours to get the true ending + secret ending.
Enjoyable?: Lobotomy Corporation isn't just a game about managing monsters, it's a story of redemption, a tale of overcoming the [i]samsara[/i]. My frustrations with the game mechanics became somewhat alleviated upon realizing how greatly intertwined they are with the story. I won't spoil too much.

The premise is basically this:
>On the surface, Lobotomy Corporation an energy producing company
>Energy is extracted from working with ""abnormalities"". 
>Many abnormalities are harmful.
>Some can breach containment if mishandled or right conditions are met.

Depending on which abnormalities you select, you can make the game exponentially harder for yourself. Thankfully, the game gives you options to make it easier for yourself:
    1. Unlimited day resets. 
    2. Roll back to a checkpoint day. 
    3. If things are [i]really bad[/i], you could always roll back to day 1. 
For the last two options, any abnormality information, department upgrades, and EGO equipment you have at the time will be saved. 

You will start off with one department and will unlock more departments as you progress through the game. Each department has missions. Completing these missions gives you permanent upgrades and pieces of the story. If you're aiming for the true ending + secret ending, it requires completing all missions + 100% abnormality dissolution (full observation level of all abnormalities, exception of a few).

Sometimes an interaction with a new monster kills someone unexpectedly, so I re-do the day and have no fatalities the second time around, probably completing a research project while I'm at it. Employees level up slowly, but if I'm wise about it I can keep my top brass alive and productive. Challenging at times, surely, but I'm looking forward to seeing the story unfold. This game is pretty all right.

DAY TWENTY-ONE: I have spent hours in real time replaying one day in the hopes that even a single employee lives, though I know if I lose one of my senior hires I'm not sure what kind of hope I have to contain many of my research subjects. By the time I've met half of my energy quota I have a maneating mecha-dog, white noise that makes you insane, a bunch of buzzsaw robots, some kind of opium poppy pleasure god, a bulletproof shapeshifting meat golem, and some psycho with a hand cannon and a scythe loose in the hallways. People are screaming and being blown to bloody pulps by the dozens. A magical girl teleports into a hallway full of fleeing employees to help, killing many instantly before becoming a hysterical snake chimera as a giant aggressive swan-man materializes on the floor below. The company hasn't even opened all of its wings yet, undoubtedly full of further horrors. There are four unfinished research projects I can't hope to complete a single one of today without great luck, let alone two. Only the dead can know peace from this evil. This game rules.

In all seriousness:
>>>If there were translation issues, they have since been resolved- beyond the occasional weird grammar choice, the English language version is very comprehensible.
>>>There is the occasional visual glitch. Masks slide a bit off of a character's model, people listed as dead in the UI are just standing in the cell where they supposedly expired. The numerical level of the ""temperance"" stat is cut off in the weapon/armor selection menus, so I'll have to back up to identify that bit. It's not really an issue- but what is is the glitch that seems to make moving and zooming into the map impossible if you open the manager's guide from the pause menu, which pretty much forces you to restart the day. Other than that, I haven't run into anything egregious bug-wise yet.
>>>Sound and most of the art design is great in this. Every anomaly has its own encyclopedia portrait, character model (sometimes multiple...) and  suite of sound effects/ambient noise that will become louder or more distant depending on your proximity to the cell and if it is contained or not. There's a musical track for every situation, from choosing your next monster to watching everything go up in flames in various increments.
>>>UI does leave something to be desired. When a lot of stuff is happening in a hallway, it can be hard to select or even identify individual employees since they're all often stacked on top of each other during combat. It's easier to get the hang of the clunky selection situation when everything isn't going wrong, but obviously things go wrong. A lot. All at once. I end up using the click-and-drag mass selection to just move entire departments to handle stuff a lot, which probably isn't a sound strat by now, but I don't enjoy fiddling with finding and selecting individual employees. They're basically all just the same silhouette with different hair, expressions, and outfits, unable to be distinguished by department unless you select them or can see the tiny colored armband, which can get even more confusing when the random npc drones (same character silhouette) milling about get mixed up in the crowd and start littering the halls as corpses.

This game is HARD. It has a surprising amount of depth, but there is also an element of randomness that can make or break the periods between ""memory repository"" saves that happen every week or so. Whenever you acquire new research subjects you pick from three mystery choices identified only by some cryptic phrase and a number, and frequently end up accidentally killing people or setting monsters loose as you attempt to research how to handle them properly. The discovery of new details for every unique anomaly is part of the fun, but you will fucking suffer for it by the time you've fully expanded the first of the facility's three levels. It's similar to Darkest Dungeon in that you will hire a lot of cannon fodder and hope to Christ that your favorite senior hires make it through the grinder, but EVEN MORE punishing. The importance of having experienced people to handle the more dangerous stuff and the steep price of new hires, paid from the same pool of points that will improve your extant employees' training, makes losing someone a tragedy despite how inevitable it is.

[TL;DR]
This isn't so much a management simulator as it is an exercise in disaster mitigation framed by an explorative story and roguelite gameplay. It'll stress you out and stretch your brain thinner and thinner as the departments start piling on, though the goals of your daily routine don't change much. Still, the depth of story is as weirdly entrancing as the SCP Foundation content that inspired it. Haven't even finished it yet, but I'm prepared to keep smashing my head against this wall until I uncover the full narrative behind the drywall. If that's up your alley, LobCorp is worth the price of admission, especially for the hours of horrible, terrible, no-good fun you'll get out of it for 25 bucks.

The story/ art is compelling, but the gameplay is just not fun. I love difficult games, but this goes beyond that to be intentionally tedious. Sometimes it's downright unbalanced and unfair (i.e. the Queen of Hatred).

Also, it's hard to select your 'agents' when they are standing near each other or an enemy, but the developers seem to want you to micro them like it's WC3 to combat certain enemies. You can't even directly click to move them, but rather need to try to select them via a *menu* and then move them to a room, but not even a specific part of a given room. So, say, if you have an enemy that 1-shot kills literally everything on a floor based on it's direction, then it might make you close the game, stand up, and ask why the hell you've been wasting time playing this game.

[b]This game is tedious and annoying on purpose[/b]. You can derive enjoyment from it, but please understand what you are getting into. Expect pain and misery.

The many purposefully frustrating mechanics would not fly with me if I were to play this game just for the gameplay. It takes quite a long time to figure out how to play properly, and eventually beat this game. I would not say it's worth it if you don't enjoy ""lore discussions"" on the level of defining light and darkness in Kingdom Hearts 2.

If you don't know what that last sentence means, I would probably avoid this game. If you feel *special*, I'd say go for it. You deserve it, after all.

[h1]----Summary[/h1]
Lobotomy Corporation is a game about creating energy from otherworldly beings. If you've seen games like Fallout Shelter, it has a similar aesthetic, but with a slightly RTS feel. If that sounds confusing, that's because it is, and the controls take quite a bit of getting used to because of that.

Every day in game, you need to gather energy from ""Abnormalities"" in order to fill a quota, in which case the day can end. Every so often you will get another Abnormality and a higher quota, adding to the complexity of the game. Other mechanics are drip-fed to you periodically as well. There are certain roguelike elements in terms of the Abnormalities you get, and some retained knowledge when you reset to the beginning once you figure out how things work, but the process is tedious and annoying; intentionally so.

[h1]----Positives[/h1]
[h3]Nice Art[/h3]
I wouldn't call it amazing, but I think it's very beautiful in its simplicity. A charming chibi art style that is somewhat angular and stylistic. I like it.

[h3]Music is Amazing[/h3]
You won't hear enough of the music because you will almost never trigger the conditions to hear them, but when you do it sounds very nice. Probably the best thing about the game if you don't care for the lore.

[h3]Lore[/h3]
If you love jackin' it over Undertale and/or Dark Souls lore, this game has quite a bit of that kind of thing, as well as a sequel game, and some other media stuff. I don't want to get into it, as it's probably the best part of the game. The lore is the only reason I bothered to beat it. If you don't mind a lot of reading, it's rather great.

It's clear these guys were inspired by SCP, if you know what that is.

[h3]It Ends[/h3]
[u]Eventually...[/u]


[h1]----Negatives[/h1]
[h3]Clunky Controls, Lots of Menus[/h3]
Much of this game involves messing with menus, and it would have been a lot easier to adopt a more RTS style button scheme, considering that's what they were going for. Towards the end of the game, when you have so much to manage it becomes very tedious and annoying very quickly when multiple things require your attention. If there is an easy way to do something, Lobotomy Corporation will likely stick it in a menu that only shows up in specific contexts. 

Tedious and Annoying.

[h3]Very Punishing For Any Mistakes[/h3]
I might have mentioned a few times that this game is very tedious. You see, after you get over the initial difficulty curve (which is really just not knowing how to play), you need to decided if you want to beat the game. Well that's easy; press all the buttons correctly, in order as per the threat level. If you slip up, maybe you forget to do something, maybe the entire labyrinth of monsters is so large maybe you forgot exactly where an Abnormality you need to manage is, or maybe you picked the wrong work type by mistake. Well now you have a knock-on effect that means that, if you don't (or more likely can't) handle it, you need to start the day all over again, which could be 20 or more minutes of work invalidated. You do this every day, 50x in a row plus all of your re-tries, because why the fuck would you know what a ROOM WITH A DATE ON IT DOES?

Tedious and Annoying
 
[h3]Tedious and Annoying[/h3]
[i]You WILL press EVERY BUTTON, IN ORDER, EVERY DAY. you WILL remember EVERY, SINGLE, EMPLOYEE, their STATS, and WHERE THEY NEED TO BE, DESPITE THE FACT they are supposed to be DISPOSABLE.[/i]

The cancerous growth of your containment facility only piles on more and more busy work, while increasing the likelihood that it will all be erased and you will need to start over. The buttons you press don't change, you just have to do it more. What's worse is that this is intentional from the developers because it ties into the lore. Unfortunately for Type Moon, I got the message after my first reset, and the unfun game design wore out its welcome 4 hours in. Thankfully, if you know what you are doing, you don't have to put up with things ""the developer intended"". However, not even that extended the fun for me for very long. ""Fun and rewarding"" isn't something I would call Lobotomy Corporation, when most of the fun I got was reading about (some of) the abnormalities and the story which can be done for free (on the wiki and on youtube respectively). If you, like me, enjoy having fun, you really only need to hit the wall once to get the message the devs wanted you to feel.

DO YOU GET IT YET, IT'S SUPPOSED TO FEEL SHITTY!

[h1]----Conclusion[/h1]
There was a small amount of enjoyment I gained from figuring things out, and reading the story, but as a game, Lobotomy Corporation leaves a lot to be desired (mostly the fun). My enjoyment lasted about 4 hours, the last hour of which I spent trying to justify that I wasn't good enough yet. I am genuinely captivated by this game's lore, and might go out of my way to expand my understanding, especially because [i]reading a novel[/i] is far less tedious and annoying than playing Lobotomy Corporation.

In most of the hard games I've played, getting good made the game better. I'm not going to say that gitting gud didn't improve my time with this game, but only a little bit more. This game is masochistic enough to make seeing health bars an upgrade, juxtaposed to a more useful gameplay benefit. Why?

Let me shatter the illusion for you. The people who have hundreds of hours in this game aren't smart or cool. They wasted their time. I do genuinely believe they are proud of it, but that is the pride of a person with no real perspective on reality or their own life. [u]You can get all of the positives of this game with none of the negatives, faster and for free.[/u] That is the ultimate failing of this game. ""Game"" being the operative word. As a story, Lobotomy Corporation is extremely fascinating, but the pain and suffering it causes isn't something that should be celebrated.

Can I recommend this to someone who wants to play a game? No. Can I recommend this to someone who wants to read and piece together an interesting story? No. I can only recommend this to someone who is willing to suffer a lot to get very little. Unlike the last modern game I've played, however, you can get something from the ending, it's just not worth it unless you have a debilitating mental disorder (See the Steam accounts with 100s of hours on this game).

If you think you are ok with the pain this game will give you, I'd say it's worth a purchase. But you shouldn't be ok with it; seek help if you think you are. You could spend the same amount of time playing Factorio, and get much more out of the experience. For the price I paid, It's hard to say the 4 hours of enjoyment I got were a waste, but the rest of the time was miserable for very little benefit.

If you decide to buy this game, promise me this: once you stop having fun, just stop. Don't waste your time like those other people.",1667075243,1667106463,False,3,3,0.453840166330337524,7,True,False,False

Because that is the name of the game, In Lobotomy Corporation you manage monsters of increasing difficulty and if you manage to mess up and not guess the cod zombies easter egg level of specific actions to work on the monster then you gotta restart the possibly 30 minute long day because that's the gameplay loop.

Alternatively you could use the wiki which trivializes the game and makes it a damn snoozefest of minmanaging the absolute best abnormalities and gear with quite possibly no challenge. Much like it's little brother Library of Ruina, Lob Corp suffers from extreme artificial difficulty near the end where you can mess up super bad and softlock yourself making you go back and redo nearly a dozen hours of progress just to inflate the gametime.

Lots of western occult stuff in it. Plays like Oxygen Not Included but not as sim/survival. Content is like Neon Genesis Evangelion but instead of kaiju battles it's SCP foundation stuff. 

So far, I've gotten to day 4, enjoy looking at the flavor text of the stuff I'm studying, and feeling dread every step of the way of something terrible happening. 

You can repeat days if you like. I am not sure of the implications of doing so. There are choices to be made and I'm not sure how that affects the story but it feels enjoyable to explore it.

Some things that need fixing:
-Sound Effect Slider: Hell there's space right there for it! Sometimes the screaming can be a bit grating so being able to turn that down would be nice.
-Some of the songs hit a limiter or something and crackles, whatever.
-Feels very Indie and a little rough around the edges. Worth it at a lower price than normal I feel though.
-Beginning is front heavy and odd how much the girl character talks about how cute she looks and how much you might think so too. Not too bad though
-Slow down the flavor text! I wanna read some of it! The ""working"" flavor text also covers too much of what's going on and is a little distracting.

Good things:
-Some of the music really slaps
-Basically play your way through a custom themed SCP foundation database while playing a simpler version of Oxygen Not Included (like an ant farm!)
-Inventory system based on research points so anomalies have a function to keep around and continue researching
-Mix of chibi/cute style anime with the occult is oddly foreboding
-If you know occult stuff it's real fun, although may or may not be accurate in it (like they'll have the sephirot and talk about it, but it ain't gonna be like a wikipedia page on the actual subject or accurate lore surrounding it). We'll see though, i'll have to play more.

The combat and UI is a mess, it's effectively an RTS with pause where the majority of the time you can't see units health bars as they get covered up by flavor text or other characters health bars, you have no way of telling who's actually selected in a group since the only indicator is a minor change to the color of the health bars that you can't see and even that glitches out a lot, you have barely any control over what exactly your units do beyond ""move somewhere in this large room"" and ""try to attack this enemy"", and the punishment for not having perfect micromanagement of all your units is redoing hours of boring grinding training and equipping replacement units.

The progression system is also tediously unenjoyable due to bad checkpointing, you get one checkpoint every 5 in-game days and one at the start of whatever day you're on and the checkpoint is set after you make a potentially run-ruining decision, meaning if you make a bad choice on day 4 you have to undo 4 whole days of play and if you make a bad choice on day 5 you have to restart the entire playthrough.

Depending on who that is its a restart and another 30 mins...... Lets just say the highest length day I have had was a hour and 30 minutes so imagine messing up on that day.

One: the game doesn't really respect your time as a player. It has this combination of XP-growth for your agents, perma-death for your agents, and a system where discoveries back-propagate to reloaded save games when you jump to the start of the week. This means it is often optimal to run the same day multiple times experimentally to learn about your specimens, and then do one 'for-real' run where you take the careful, conservative options. Replaying the same work over and over again saps a lot of fun for me, and it's so painful to lose high level agents that it's also not fun for me to run things iron-man style.

Two: The game only has two background music tracks that basically run on a loop forever and ever. By itself it's not too back, but represents a general feel I have for the game where it has a lot of cool ideas, a lot of creativity, and then a fairly shallow execution.

-In theory you're supposed to learn the gimmicks of each anomaly to manage/fight them, but the game engine is so shallow that there are hardly any surprising ways to interact with it. In any given run maybe 10% of the anomalies need any real ""management"", the rest are trivial statchecks and/or EXP farms. The roguelike aspect locks you into randomized sets of anomalies for *extremely long* runs and has no way to make sure they work together in an interesting way. I can see some puzzle pieces that could provide interesting strategies if the stars aligned, but they'll never come together in a RNG format.
-The equipment system has an interesting damage type setup... which you'll promptly ignore because the equipment tiers trivialise everything else. Combined with a poor combat UI, there isn't much to do other than find a spot for most of your staff to hide while the A-team statchecks the N level enemy with their N+1 level gear. For stronger enemies this is more like ""cheeses their absurd health pools with the same tactic for 20 minutes"". The pacing is also all over the place (due to RNG anomaly drafts) so there isn't much of a natural progression through the tiers.
-Speaking of UI, it's atrocious (and intentionally made worse via interface screws in 3/4 of the first bossfights). Some basic features are hidden behind unlocks (ie healthbars), and while writing this I hopped on the wiki to see if some other basic features were hidden that way too. There's no convenient list of staff, so you have to try to order a work and then scroll through the different departments (the scroll declines to work half the time) to check who's alive/busy/sane, and then there's no way to locate them except looking around manually. In combat the healthbars don't stack or anything sensible like that, so when the agents get stacked up you can only see one of their healthbars without using the aforementioned method. There's no notification when agents enter combat, and the game is happy to withhold what notifications it does give during its many ""interface screw"" sequences (read here: fake difficulty). While a couple of the interface screws were interesting, most just highlight the fact that interface screws only really work if the interface wasn't absolutely awful to begin with.
-All this might make it sound like the game is unfairly hard, but it's honestly just the opposite. A magic reset button fixes any mistake with zero consequences (apparently during development the game was a more traditional roguelike/roguelite but settled on this once it was clear it couldn't pull that off) so you can't really lose. It's generally also possible to play cautiously enough that you won't have to save-scum much either. It makes up for this by being incredibly repetitive and then giving missions that make it even more needlessly repetitive, in the hopes that you get distracted for 10 seconds over the course of an hour and make some critical mistake.

I could go on, but the point is I tried to like this game, tried to almost the tune of almost 70 hours. It could have been good, I hope someone does the concept justice someday, but this is an unfortunate failed experiment.",1664252109,1664252109,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, it's the best 'bad' game I've ever played. I say it's 'bad' in more of an objective sense, with questionable design choices, bugs, and that famous memory leak making the end of the game a struggle against the game's performance. But it's the best one I've played due to everything else.
The main gameplay loop of 'pick up new eldritch horror, find out what it does, use it as another cog in your endless production cycle' doesn't tend to feel stale outside of really long days, and learning about each different abnormality is a very interesting experience. The game's 'event' beats also work very well, from the higher level of ordeals to the Aleph-level threats, and the special department events that I won't go into detail with due to spoilers. Disciplinary overall was my favourite, but each was individual and unique enough that I enjoyed them all (except probably central command's). 
The story and writing of this game are also, of course, phenomenal. Each abnormality has its story, some better than others, and they're a bit less SCP than they are just general stories. But they're beautifully written, and each feel distinct. The main plot and Sephirah stories were also incredible, but even better is the game's worldbuilding. The nests, the outskirts, the backstreets, the ruins - all of these locations are brought up and all of them sound enticing. The ruins in particular are never elaborated on, adding to this.
I feel like this is already long and rambling, so I want to cut it short. Lobotomy Corporation is a very particular game, and you'll either enjoy it or not. I can't really say what it is that decides where you fall into, though I found my biggest player motivations in the story and the mystery/adaptation elements of working out how to handle each abnormality. This game is incredible, and I legitimately can't wait to start playing the sequel - I just hope it can give me as much fun as Lob did.

I get all the way through the day with no hiccups, even got a few rare items for my employees... feeling pretty good. 

I get to the point where the boss enemies spawn and I start dealing with them, surprisingly efficiently. Game is going wonderfully right now. I notice one of my best employees is a little low on health, and I decide to have them drink a special healing juice SCP to restore their health for the rest of the fight. She drinks it, we kill the bosses, we're about to be in the clear and- she fucking explodes. 

I check the Wiki to see why she exploded because I was so angry and completely befuddled at the sight of her dying from an item anomaly I'd used a hundred times before with no bad things happening. Turns out, because I had exactly one completely different person drink the healing juice halfway through the day, she had a 15% chance to explode. FIFTEEN. PERCENT. And of course, out of all of my employees that could have died from it, it was one of my best ones with a really good armor set I couldn't reacquire and a good weapon I also couldn't reacquire because of how the game's roguelite system works. The amount of bad luck that had to have accrued to reach those tremendously unlikely odds is astounding. I am livid.

This game is a cute but sometimes scary base management game but you're managing SCP like monsters. The game UI evolved tremendously than the last time I played it much awhile ago. And the story of the game seems to be have endings now. But if you come from oxygen not included or sheltered like game, maybe you found some inconveniences or lack of mechanics that can be fixed by mods. Well mods isnt that many lol.
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- The graphics now chibi like characters compared to older that like doodle lol
- We can customize our agent but with LOB points (I thinks its annoying we must pay for it lol)
- Every anomalies is uniques and we must using try and fail methods to understand how to handle one anomalies
- The story seems clearer than past updates, now we maybe can get some fanart/fanfictions here lol
- The gameplay is simple but solid, upgrades can be obtained if you complete the side missions in each days
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Well this game lacks many 2d base management have such as easier to choose which characters you want to focus with, autonomy, anomaly room/lobby/corridor placement (This one is annoying since i liked everything next to each other to make it easier to manage but the game place it randomly and scrolling up and down is tiring especially there is huge breakout)
- If you face the chicken cloud anomaly, there is a chance agent inside other anomalies room sleeping there and theres no way to wake them up, if you not wake them up they counted as death. Unfair i think
- Also same anomalies as above, the game not telling you you can wake some agents with rapid click around their feet, lacks of informations popup to what we can do or not.
- The selecting certain agents rts style sometimes good but sometimes bad, agent move too often to pick the right one we want to move and one to stay.
- The RMD of moving agents to room sometimes hit and miss especially to opress one anomaly
- Theres no indicator of who is opressing who. Sometimes get you feel annoyed to supress two anomaly in one division. Making harder to split team to opress
- The clerk (uncontrolled npc agent) sometimes can help fights or just being feeder dirtying the rooms. Annoying.
- Lack of other things to do, there should be barracks, where weapons to agents to supress anomalies, theraphy room to make agents calmer, medic to heal agents, Pantry to feed agents small healing and stamina recovery, toilets/wc to reduce stress and recover stamina for agent, turrets or automated locking wall protocol to prevent anomalies going further to surface, etc. This game just repetitive after 3 hours of playing. Almost no variant
- The upgrades above is there in game but came as ""SOP"" that you must choose between days.
- Days in game should progressive not we need to end it things. Anomalies also added if we added room for anomalies thing, also more deep about making room for anomalies that if suitable to them they less likely to breach adn easier to cooperate. Add maintenance to room also.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Yes as I mention above, the game is really simple and hard lol. So quickly finish gathering anomalies energy and end the day is the best way to play the game, we can't really enjoy seeing the anomalies and managing agents and how the facility works. The game felt like tower defense than base management honestly. If the dev still want to add new mechanics, considering adding those I mentioned above. It could make the facility management more fun and not felt like rushing.",1663763371,1663763371,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game, as with many games that are extremely difficult, is naturally not for everyone.

If you don't cope well with multitasking, at times being on a pretty hardcore timer where the punishment is instant loss for falling behind, along with no checkpoints in levels, meaning a failure is potentially 40 minutes to an hour of wasted effort, you likely will stop enjoying the game about halfway - endgame.

The first 25-34 or so days are comparable to the ""calm"" and then it rapidly ramps up in difficulty from there.


The gameplay loop is relatively straightforward, there are 50 days, each day you get a new thing to manage, all of the abnormalities as they're called have a different gimmick, and a different threat level based off of how destructive they are when something goes wrong.
You gradually uncover more of the build and learn more to its purpose with the help of the ai assistant angela, and meet what amounts to the departmental leaders of each portion of the building as you go. The main progression (restarting only loses days.) is by completing tasks set out by each department, which can range from ""you will end up completing this on your own"" to ""hell on earth.""
The tasks culminate in this games version of bossfights, which, slight spoiler: Despite technically being optional in that you can opt not to do them, it is impossible to complete the game without finishing them, and you do have a limit to how long you can wait before completing them, and otherwise have to reset back to day 1 if you dont finish them.
The endgame is brutal, more so than the rest of the game.

Along the way, a very intricate plot gets unwraveled as you play, and you can pick up more clues to it by reading the stories of the abnormalities.

While the game technically has 4 main endings and 1 ""true"" ending, the first 3 endings are more the failure screens, as they are only unlocked after A. beating the game. B. Failing at certain portions of the last 3 or so days.
The character writing in the game is astounding, especially given that i personally wasnt expecting it. And the plot can get very emotional (and also very fucking dark, be warned.) at points, and will make you feel a fair amount of genuine sympathy for most of the characters.

For the true ending, without spoiling it, you may also have already guessed this: the true ending is unlocked by 100%ing the game.
Sits firmly in the echelon of best games ive ever played, as it sits in the echelon of hardest games ive ever played. If you can get past the difficulty, the game is absolutely beautiful in its storytelling, has some of the more creative enemy designs ive seen in a game, and in general is fucking great. The game has a sequel, library of ruina.
Its important to note that the ""true"" ending of this game does make the plot for ruina make more sense.

I rate the game, as is obvious, a 10/10.

One of my friends decided to try the game out for themselves however and watching them play through it on stream made me want to get the game for myself. Now, I have went through 3 runs and beat the game with every abnormality dissolved.

This game is great if your into management types of games, albeit it can get frustrating at times. There is quite a lot of stuff based on RNG and there is multiple parts (notably day 49) that are not explained well enough in game for them to be fair, however I had scoured the wiki a ton so I didn't have as much of an issue. Another thing is I already had a vague concept of what each abnormality did going in and I thought it would ruin the experience for me, but I soon noticed that it really didn't matter as it doesn't take long to unlock all of an abnormalities info.

Overall, this was a great game and worth the money for me. I can see how it wouldn't be a game for everyone however, as a lot of the stuff can feel like bullshit and in some cases it's honestly better to scour the wiki for information on how stuff works. Stuff like Day 49 can be quite frustrating too, so if you get frustrated easily, this game isn't for you.

Yes adding more and more causes the puzzle to become a bit of a frustrating reset spiral, but thats the beauty, if things are not going your way you can go back a few days.

This is a good game. It's story is wonderful, the art is so nice, its very fun to play. *However*, getting the true ending of the game, is not fun. At first it will start out pretty fun, the loop of researching abnormalities, getting new gear, resetting with that stronger gear and upgrades you've gotten is fun.

The first few of the required missions, as i'll call them for lack of spoilers, are actually very fun, and provide some unique challenge to management. But then, the difficulty of them will just skyrocket. Expect to spend upwards of a day just to finish one of these missions, if that. 

I Highly recommend the game, but... just be aware you are getting into a major difficulty spike towards the late game and it will be punishing and infuriating.

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
Welcome to Lobotomy Corporation, the leading company in the production of energy through the innovative process of containment and observation of beings known as Anomalies, creatures that appear in this world with the most varied forms and powers, and we would like to congratulate you for being accepted in our staff as the new manager responsible for taking care of the team that will have to come into direct contact with these Anomalies to obtain energy, we expect great results from you new manager. Note, the company is not responsible for any bad decision made by the manager that may result in the employees in things such as, but not limited to, injuries, madness, phobias, deaths of the most varied forms, end of the world, among many others. ^^

And so begins the work of our protagonist, the newest manager of the Lobotomy Corporation, with the arduous and, as will soon discover, not an easy task of having every day without a single day off, fullfil an ever-increasing quota of energy requested, while trying to keep employees safe from the Anomalies, which are both an excellent source of energy, but also overwhelmingly capable of killing anyone who comes into contact with them, or at least leaving really unpleasant memories. And as a ""bonus"", every day a new Anomaly arrives at the facility, and it's up to the manager to find out information about they, before they gets angry, manages to break free and real chaos ensues. But don't worry, because in your new role you will have the help of the peculiar if I may call it that, managers of each of the departments, in addition to your assistant, the always well informed and cold AI Angela. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ A game with a very different and interesting story, where from our first day of work we are presented not only with the most diverse and deadly Anomalies, but also with other company employees responsible for managing their departments, each with their own personality, quirks and secrets, which little by little reveal more about the present and the very dark past of the company.
+ Huge cast of Anomalies, with a little more than eighty with the most varied appearances, powers that they used if they free themselves, some even don't even need to free themselves to bring chaos, rules of what they like and don't like, history and equipment that can be produced from knowledge about them.
+ The first game that takes place in the dark and sinister universe created by the studio, with the other games taking place in the same universe. It's not mandatory to play this one to play the others, but it's interesting to know how it all started.
+ Very unique art style, combining the cute with the dark in a well balanced way, but be careful, because sooner or later you will discover, that not everything is what it seems to be in this universe.
+ Soundtrack with songs that match very well with the game and its universe, in addition to great sound effects, especially for Anomalies, after all, some even use sounds.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Prepare your patience, because many and many times your patience will be tested, as it will take a long time to learn all the rules of the anomalies, and for that it is necessary that the employees have contact with them without knowing the rules in the first times, so mistakes will be made a considerable number of times, but nothing that patience cannot solve.

[h1] Game mechanics[/h1]
Thus begins the journey of our protagonist a new manager, where we have every day that manages a group of employees with up to five members for each of the departments, sending them to the dangerous task of contacting the Anomalies and making them happy , thus producing energy. Each of the employees has four attributes, Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice, these attributes can be improved with points between days or by repeating jobs that have the same color as the attribute you want to improve. These attributes are vital as many Anomalies need a minimum value to accept the employee's presence without killing them outright. ^^

Which brings us to one of the main points, the Anomalies, beings or objects that present one or several powers of supernatural origin, being classified in five levels according to the risk, being them from the safest to the most dangerous, Zayin, Teth, He , Waw and Aleph, with the first level being the easiest, but as the level progresses they start to have more complicated rules, requiring for example, minimum levels or in some cases even that a certain attribute is not above a certain value, if no, the Anomaly becomes very interested in the employee's life for reasons that are nothing pleasant. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
At this point I must start by congratulating the people responsible for the art of the south korean studio ProjectMoon, for having made an art that I think perfectly matched the theme of the game, as it is an art that combines the cute and the shady, and at the same time it's interesting and well made, whether it's the different departments, the equipment made from the anomalies, the Anomalies themselves, and the many unique ways that each Anomaly can kill. Another congratulations to the soundtrack part, I liked it and I think the songs are very pleasant, as well as I think they made good choices regarding the sound effects. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Lobotomy Corporation was a surprise to me when I saw it for the first time, I remember that it was at a very early stage of development, and that I bought it when it was more advanced, and I was really satisfied with what I saw still in development until the completion of the process creating the game we have today. Undoubtedly, it is a game that I strongly recommend for anyone looking for a very different management experience, with a dark and at the same time very interesting story, very charismatic characters with their quirks, beautiful arts and the large cast of Anomalies created by the studio, no It's an easy game and patience will be tested, but I guarantee the final experience will pay off. ^^

 Lobotomy Corporation sees the combination of three genres: Visual Novel (which is kept minimal), Management and Strategy. The three genres in this game mix very well, with the general experience ranging from fun to stressful depending on what happens.

 The game is difficult. You have to manage creatures that all differ in design and type, with some preferring to have different types of work to be done on them. This culminated in the collection of boxes that allow you to unlock information and tools to further the work done on them. It's a simple gameplay loop made effective by the random results from each work completed.

First things first, I should mention that I really really love this game, but I'm giving it a ""Not Recommend"" since there isn't a mixed option available. I'll break it down into a simple pros and cons list to help any curious buyers.

[i]Pros:[/i]
- Well-written story and characters
- Lots of abnormalities to discover, making every playthrough unique
- Many new mechanics, challenges, and upgrades are introduced throughout the course of the game, keeping the gameplay overall fresh and rewarding
- Hod my beloved

[i]Cons:[/i]
- Gameplay success can rely on a heavy amount of RNG, this is not a glaring issue until the much-later levels
- Lack of balancing between abnormalities of the same difficulty, especially Alephs. Due to the random nature of unlocking new abnormalities, this can cause some runs to be insufferable if you have some unlucky picks
- Managing your agents can be frustrating at times. You can only see the HP and SP of your agents by viewing the bars above their head or using the work menu. This can be problematic in the heat of combat, as their bars stack on top of one another, making it hard to tell if any of your employees are taking heavy damage
- Problems listed above began to create problems for the story's pacing. While one may argue the random, chaotic nature of this game fits with its narrative, I feel it started to drag out the story longer than necessary
- 100% completion is not made to be convenient. This wouldn't be problematic if the true ending wasn't locked behind additionally researching all of the abnormalities fully. This gripe isn't too big since I just download mods to keep your employees on reset and re-extract abnormalities infinitely
- Some vital information is withheld from the player. Exact work success percentages are not given to you. Some abnormalities have special properties and attacks when they escape that you cannot learn without experiencing it yourself. Ordeals and boss fights can have unpredictable elements that can ruin a day without any prior knowledge

Overall, I really did enjoy this game and I don't regret playing it. Just that the random factors caused me immense amounts of agony at times. I think the game is worth a shot if you're persistent, don't get frustrated very easily, and have a lot of time on your hands. I think Project Moon is a great team, and I'm looking very forward to playing Library of Ruina!!",1660175558,1660176579,False,27,0,0.643033921718597412,0,True,False,False

There's many, many things I could say about Lobotomy Corporation. As is obvious, Lobotomy Corporation is a monster management game, similar to a ""tycoon"" game. At the start of each day, you're given three serial numbers, all of which also have a quote attached to them, which you will have to choose from. Those numbers and quotes refer to one of the many unique ""Abnormalities"" the game has to offer, which are the main mechanic the game is centered around. Your objective as the manager will be to do work with those abnormalities, and it's through correctly doing work with them that you'll gather energy, which you need a certain ammount of to complete the day and move on to the next one. Simple enough, right? Well, if you're familiar with SCP- And yes, I know some people frown upon comparing the two, but it's easiest to explain with a comparison such as this- You'll know that each of these ""Abnormalities"" will have their own set of needs that they need to have met in order to produce energy. If said needs aren't met, they could bring harm to the employee that's currently assigned to harvest energy from them, or potentially much, much worse things. 

This game, unlike some people may want to believe, is a roguelike. You are going to fail a lot, and when that happens, you usually restart the day and try again with the knowledge from your previous attempt. However, should you find yourself with an abnormality that you simply cannot handle or maybe a handful of different abnormalities that, paired together, leave you in an extremely difficult situation, like for example one that despises being looked at next to another that demands you to look at it, the game gives you several options to fix this issue. For example, every day that ends with the number ""1"" or ""6"" will be a hard-save state, which you can return to from any other day. If you do this, you'll keep all of the gear and information that you acquired on the days ahead of time, but all progress made levelling up and training your employees will be lost. So, if you got an abnormality that was way too much to handle, but still managed to get some information or maybe even gear about it, you'll keep all of that information if you are to ever choose that abnormality again, as well as keep any of the gear that you may have harvested from it. Of course, replacing that gear if lost is an entirely different story.

And if, for some reason, that isn't enough.. Restarting from the very first day of the game is completely okay, and honestly intended. I had to do this three or four times before beating the game entirely, and that's okay. Just like with the save-states I mentioned, you'll keep all of the gear and information you learned about the monsters. If you happened to get the ""basic information"" of one of them, their name will even replace the serial code they get when they show up as an option for a new monster when the day starts, allowing you to choose between a familiar face or a new, scary but potentially valuable new abnormality. 

There's many different levels of abnormality, and generally, the more dangerous it is, the more powerful it's obtainable gear will be and the more energy it will prudce. While having a safe facility can be nice, it'll also make your days take much longer. And as the game progresses, it will start to punish you for taking too long in each day, through a mechanic called ""Ordeals"". You'll learn more about them by playing yourself, but all I will say is that generally.. once you reach a ""Midnight"" ordeal, it's considered a game-over unless you're already prepared for what's to come.

Completing missions and progressing days will reward you with progressing the story. Missions will continue a character's individual story, while ending a day will progress the overall plot. You need to do both of these to get to the finale, but doing so isn't really that difficult. While individual missions are difficult at certain points (Looking at you, disciplinary team..), but every mission you complete and the ""upgrade"" you'll get from it will be permanent, even if you restart the game from day 1. So, you have as long as you need to get all of the missions done.

Take your time with this game. It's okay to try over and over again, and sometimes this will be the case. This game isn't for everyone, and quite frankly, there's a bit of jank with the UI in some situations, and it becomes apparent after awhile. But it's all worth it, in my opinion, because of the absolute gem of a story that's hidden behind this game. Everything in the game, and I mean, *everything* is a part of the story. Every game mechanic, every seemingly one-off dialogue line, the ""filler"", it's all building upon a beautiful story that you simply don't expect from a game like this, at least not from the first impressions. If you're willing to put up with the many, many hours you'll spend retrying (it took me roughly 90 to 100 hours to clear the game for the first time), I think this game is more than worth the time investment. I won't go any deeper into any of the characters or story, because I think those are best experienced for yourself.

Also, the game is particularly good at making you attached to your employees, so if you're someone who likes writing Original Characters.. well, this game will give you lot of ammunition for getting attached to your random little employee ""Mason"" and you may just find it that the game wrote a character arc for him purely through it's gameplay. But if that's not your kind of thing, then this point is pretty null.",1613430849,1658706340,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, the art style is GORGEOUS. To those people calling the game or devs as cheap or overall cartoony - shut up. It is n art style and it fits the game perfectly. The soundtrack and ambient noises are fitting and enjoyable if grating after a while.

That's it. That's the two good things about the game. The story is needlessly convoluted and pointless at the end of the day. The UI is utter GARBAGE! Seriously, whoever came up with it was drunk and high when they made it because it's infuriating how stupid it is. Mainly speaking the sanity system.

And speaking of sanity, say goodbye to your sanity if you don't hardcore micromanage every last and single aspect of the game. I'm not joking. You have to remember, make freaking charts, and coordinate everything without the game helping you at all except reminding you that you suck and that you better accomplish the increasingly ridiculous goals. Forgot to check on guys while they examine an anomaly? Dead or insane. Trying to calm down a guy that moves twice as fast as your sane guys? They go insane soon after. Sent the same dude to some anomaly because you have 30 guys running around? Dead or a breach occurs.

Dear lord, the breaches. A mid to late game one means half the base is gone along with your entire personnel no matter what they are using, even if they counter anomalies. Why you ask? Because at those levels, you gotta deal with breaches of up to five or more anomalies running around killing everything that dares to breathe in their general direction.

Calling this game a SCP Foundation knockoff is an insult to the SCP-verse.

Do not waste your money on this dang thing unless you're a masochist. I'm mainly a strategy games player, and I'm used to heavy micromanaging, but this is ridiculous, tedius, and unfun. You know what other game does a similar thing but slightly worse? Fallout Shelter.

Although the gameplay may seem like a basic management simulation on the surface, it gets quite deep and challenging having to control and maintain the facility. Every new abnormality you obtain is an experience, as you won't know what it'll do, how deadly it is, or even how dangerous it is until you work with it at least once. The game is best experienced blind because of this and I would advise against using a guide or wiki unless necessary (don't feel bad looking up strategies for some of the end days). On top of the deep and enjoyable gameplay, this game has a fantastic plot to unravel and understand. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and would put it up there with some of the best.

Now why do I say it's a hard game to recommend? The game has a very steep difficulty curve. The tutorial gives you just enough to get started and you will fail and lose your employees many times. Thankfully, you can restart the day as many times as you want and the game even has a separate checkpoint system on every 5 days that you can rewind to at any time. Rewinding to these checkpoints or restarting the game from day 1 keeps all your upgrades, research, and equipment, and you are encouraged to restart in the game if things get too difficult to manage. I know this would be a big turnoff to some people but the game has enough variety and it makes sense in a story context that I think it's both a good thing and done well, regardless of my opinion on it I do think it makes the game quite difficult to recommend. If you enjoy or don't mind a difficult experience I would absolutely implore you to play this game. It is too good to be passed on.

The managing aspect can be fun and it has some story which as you complete missions/objectives with the respective department you get story and upgrades. However this is where i have my biggest grip with this: while having upgrades tied to the missions it provides incentives sure, thats great, but among the few first, you get very basic stuff which should already be a feature inside the game from the day 1. Specially considering that some are as basic as being able to see the health and sanity bars of your agents, increase the passage of time up to x2 and recall the entire department to the staff room so they recover. At first i didnt know about that, i was searching like crazy a way to get the bars on top of the agents cause i could never know when they were about to die or their state when an emergency happened, the game tells you nothing about this and is very frustrating. Once you are past the first few missions it seems that it focuses on providing actual value with the researches, stuff like; rooms heal much faster/better, or they dont stop when an anomaly steps inside, so your agents get healed while fighting. All is good and dandy with these ones, but to ""hide"" away HUD features that are needed is not a good idea. The other thing i have a big grip about it is that the font is soooo f*cking small, like legit, it has me getting closer to the monitor every now and then to read stuff, or whats worse, sometimes even when they are already small, the space any words were given is tiny, so most of the time you will not know what level you agent has a certain skill (each one has 4, they can be up to level 5, these play an important role in the game), the game is from south korea, so i can only imagine that with much fewer signs they convey words much more easily, hence they dont need so much space. Coupling with this, the options menu is very, very lacking, is almost sad, audio is only ""master volume"" and ""music volume"", and sometimes i feel some noises are too loud but it doesnt help much. One of the pros is that it has a big vareity of languages, so likely you find yours.

Again, great game, is pretty nice and has some very clever jokes, but at times some of these things coupled with a challenging gameplay can at times cut my time with it a bit short, even when i would love to keep playing it for longer",1657244890,1657244890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Serious review section;[/h1] Listen I adore this game and its story but I'm gonna be completely upfront and say that the gameplay is kind of a nightmare (coming from someone who otherwise loves management and sim games). I cannot sing enough praises to the narrative and characters, but unless you're a masochist and enjoy being forced to cheese entire sections for utter lack of any other viable strategy then you probably won't like this game. It is [i]incredibly[/i] difficult, sometimes unfairly so with it's reliance on sheer RNG for some abnormalities, and the micromanagement can become absolute hell later in the game. I've beaten the game twice (once without mods and once with) and I can't say I'd ever want to do it again. You [i]will[/i] be forced to restart this game from day one at least once, likely several times to actually get anywhere to the point where it is really going to test your patience and drain your stamina like you're trying to slog through all one-thousand-something episodes of a shit anime in one sitting. Yes, this is by design and part of the narrative, but it begs the question of how much is too much when it comes to torturing the player at the cost of overall enjoyment. Those are just my thoughts on it at least- I'm not really much of a video game critic so just take my words with a grain of salt.
Overall, what saves this from being a hard pass from me would be the writing. Seriously. It's [i]really[/i] good at what it sets out to do narrative-wise. I'd be hesitant to say it's one of the best stories I've come across in gaming, but I think describing it in any other way would be a disservice. As much as I despise the later gameplay, it was worth the suffering to see the story and characters unfold. It's [i]really fucking good[/i].",1604626024,1657036932,True,3,1,0.551724135875701904,0,True,False,False

So far the story and the multiple Sephiraph you meet are great. However what this game really needs is an auto-save.

That's not a bad thing, given that the game also gives you the tools to fight against it; is this abno breaching due to clerk deaths racking up during ordeals? Then, pre-emptively kill your clerks with the funny body disposal bullets. This ordeal keeps flattening your employees in one hit upon spawn? Just move them out of the main rooms. That one super-cute abnormality keeps breaching after every 3 other breaches and slaughters everything in her path before your ace agents can get to her? Cull her when you see her qlip is at 1 by forcing a different non-threatening abno to breach, then get your highest red-damage resist agent to tank her on one end of the room while all your other ones attack her from behind.

You're not really supposed to know these things the first time around, and that's part of the fun of it. Like real research, sometimes getting the full info on some of the abnormalities will involve several instances of trial and error, and sometimes the managerial notes will make you slam your head into your palms because it makes you realise things such as ""what the hell do you mean, I can't work this thing with an agent with temperance higher than 1 or else it'll breach? that's bullshit"" (it is)

The most important thing is the atmosphere and story, the feel and question of what the hell is going on, and this game nails that side really well. The atmosphere is great, the music is limited but good for what it needs to convey and feel like. The entities you'll be trying to contain and work with are highly varied and some are things you can basically ignore or easily work with not risks... while others threaten to tear their way out and devour all the staff in your entire base if you don't carefully manage them constantly. The game starts simple and fairly easy... but as time goes on will get really hard as many of these entities might start stacking onto others in some really dangerous ways. Overall, an excelent and unique type of game that I can highly recommend.

The art is pretty good, the aesthetic and atmosphere are great.
The audio is also pretty good, once again on the atmosphere it works especially great.
The gameplay is interesting, varied, and different from almost any other games you'll have played.
The story is very much worth playing for, and I say that not having even finished it yet, but it hits harder than many so far, and leaves a lasting memory.

Overall, I can solidly recommend this one. Do note it does take some time to finish though, and if you just want an idle clicker base management game... this wont be for you.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely not.

Lobotomy Corporation can be incredibly frustrating, vague, sometimes unfair, and overall a clunky experience. If you want a game that has consistently good design (or that doesn't have memory leaks- fun!) I would implore you to look elsewhere.

That's not to say the game is just bad and I like it as a guilty pleasure, because again, there's interesting ideas, mechanics that work very well, but it's all kind of ramshackle and for every interesting abnormality you get or research you obtain there's another that's ridiculously asinine or outright unfun. If you don't mind incredible amounts of trial and error, if you enjoy suffering, and if you like elevators, I can recommend this game wholeheartedly despite its issues. It has a very intriguing setting, an amazing set of characters, and cohesive themes along with a slew of fun little ideas or monsters to work with. But at the end of the day, the sequel (Library of Ruina) manages to give enough background on this game and provide even more of the other positives well enough that you could be forgiven for entirely skipping Lobotomy Corporation.

Now, the monsters are well done, and that's a big plus. They all have intriguing backstories and abilities that you slowly coax out of them. But from a gameplay standpoint the game is not good at all. The UI is kinda terrible and while there's thankfully a tutorial, nothing about how the game is controlled is intuitive. The biggest sin in the gameplay department however is that monsters will kill your employees seemingly at random until you learn their patterns, and even when fully researched they might still require you to figure those behaviors out by yourself. And if enough of your guys die in a day you don't get paid, and thus can't replenish your ranks even a little bit basically forcing you to restart.

The management of the Abnormalities (SCP's with a different name) is fun and keeps you on your toes as to not send employees to their deaths. The story (from where I am in the game) is pretty cool so far, if initially a bit bizarrely presented. The basic gameplay loop consists of choosing an Abnormality to add to your facility, watching two visual-novel-like cutscenes, preparing your workers by upgrading their stats and equipping them with weapons and armor, and then managing the facility for the Day while trying to get enough energy points to complete the level. 

If anything, I'd say the game is as much of a roguelike as a management game. When you begin a Day, you are given a choice between three Abnormalities to add to the facility, but their names, effects, and appearance are completely obscured, with the only information given being a vague quote from their backstory. BUT if you uncover knowledge about them during the levels, the information gained is now locked in forever. So when you need to use the five day checkpoint system (and trust me, you will), or even start from Day 1 again, you can now see the specific Abnormality's name if it shows up in the choices. This allows a pretty interesting dynamic where you can plan which Abnormalities to choose as to not have conflicting requirements with other Abnormalities. PLUS all equipment and upgrades gained when resetting to the checkpoint or Day 1 also stays.

The only real complaints I have are that the text in the UI is way too small, the tutorial is pretty terrible at teaching you how to actually play the game, and that the game can get a bit grindy when trying to increase employee's stats.

The game is FAR too hard. Like honestly, way too much. Dependant on way too much RNG too.
Examples:
 
- You have the Red Shoes anomaly yet you only have 2 agents, both are female. Sucks to be you.
- You have the Woman against the Wall anomaly and both agents are optimists. Same deal.
- I have 3 employees, one panics, I use the other 2 to suppress them, however their panic response is murder. They kill one employee, and now I have 1 less employee to suppress the murderous employee. So I lose.
- Reaching a new department just to save your progress is tough work. I had a hard time getting to level 3 no less, got to level 4, new anomaly comes about and everyone dies. Back to level 1. Why?
- I'm trying to calm down an anomaly so I send someone in to calm it down, they screw up a few times and get some psychological or physical damage. Now they're hurt and they have to wait before going in again, so I send someone else in, but then they're hurt and the other hasn't recovered yet. Nor can they work on a different anomaly for fear of sending them insane or killing them. Eventually I have 4 employees resting up to tackle their job again while the anomalies become stressed and escape. I can't contain them with weakened employees, so I lose. And that's on 2/3 recovery researched.

I really really like the game, and the premise is excellent, but the difficult needs heavy work. It's a shame, and as soon as it's fixed I'll swap my recommendation but till then...No.

----------------------------------------------------------------

So - it's been quite a while since I played this last. I finally gave it another go and you know what? It's good! It can be a challenge at times but my concerns have been addressed.

- If you get an anomaly that is difficult, you can restart. And all the research you have done on an anomaly remains, as well as any items you got from them. This means over time, you can develop your knowledge and items to make things more manageable.
- Now it saves after each day so if you get fucked over by something you couldn't foresee, then you can try again.
- Improving employees isn't as tiresome anymore. LOB is a shortcut but you can simply train employees with risk on anomalies, which is perfectly fine.

My only point would be that the game seems a little shallow. For example, while there are random events through the ordeals, there isn't that many really, and the thing you have to do is the same. Just beat the crap out of them mostly. While there are many many anomalies, once you have them the game becomes a little routine. You just make sure not to do the thing that sets them off and make sure to do the thing that's good. 

Also, LOB could have more uses.

However, this being said, there are many unique anomalies. And some certainly are interesting. Over time things do become complex - and it's an fun challenge making sure to remember all the things you have to do. One anomaly you have to make sure not to look at while it's being worked, another wants to be best buds with just one employee, and so on.

So in a nutshell, if you like management games with a twist and challenge, I'd recommend this. I'm thankful that my concerns were addressed.",1498787005,1656117289,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,34,True,False,False

Because this game is a seed; seed of absolute, divine potential. A seed that will never germinate and bloom due to the complete disregard towards what makes games fun, or even playable. A seed that will forever languish in a forgotten chamber of your brain, teasing you with occasional thoughts: what if?

Okay, enough purple prose. Let's get down to business. 

[h1]The Wonderful Aesthetic of a Broken Mind[/h1]
First things first: the game's general sense of direction is *sublime*. You think that the simple graphics are there because the dev lacks artistic ability? Not at all. It's like this for a reason; and often you're treated to much more refined artwork. 

The abnormalities also look fantastic, especially the more involved ones. Even with the simplicity, almost all of them have unique looks for when they breach, unique killing animation and effects; everything is just so bespoke. It's a wonder to look at.

Every abnormality has a little tale associated with them, which you unlock as you learn more about it. The writing quality is perhaps not as good as over at SCP wiki, but then again, what is? Many of them are at least somewhat interesting and shed light on the strange beings that you have to manage. 

And then there's the music. For the most part you'll just hear the same tune (with minor variations) over, and over, and over, and over MAKE IT STOP and over and over. I have no idea what it is with East Asian indie games and excruciatingly repetitive music/10 second loops. But of course when the music stops looping and you get treated to some special tunes, they're incredible bangers, so you can't even turn the music off.

[h1]Genius or Fool; They Both Find Madness[/h1]
Now let's get to the main part. The gameplay. It starts out very engaging. You send your guys to an anomaly, sometimes stuff happens, sometimes people get hurt; you gain P-Boxes and unlock new info about the anomaly, or perhaps its associated weapons. You upgrade your guys, you get new anomalies. You do the quests given to you by the Sephirot (NPC managers). Everything's fine.

Until slowly but surely anomalies become harder and harder to manage. People die, and you don't know why, because you need P-Boxes to figure it out, but you need successful work in order to get P-Boxes. What a conundrum. Then suddenly a new ordeal shows up, and KILLS your entire department, because you didn't know what it was and wasn't prepared. This causes this strange new anomaly to breach containment and you have to redo the day.

This game is a paragon of Anti-Quality-of-Life. Many higher threat anomalies require conscious action from you, the player, to be managed correctly/to avoid breaching. You forgot to look at this thing and click here in the last 60 seconds? Here is a train that kills half of your facility. You worked with this anomaly too many times with this person? Dead. You used a person with the wrong stats? Dead. Or worse. Breach. Or both.

After a while, your brain gets torn into pieces, trying to balance your attention between the myriad of threats. And since later on there are anomalies that breach when people die (anywhere, anyone), it's entirely possible for a simple mistake to snowball into total annihilation. So you have to redo. Redo, redo, redo. 40 minutes of gameplay down the drain. And again, again, again.

You could say that this is actually genius. Managing dangerous anomalies is supposed to be difficult. But no. The problem here is that you can't delegate, can't automate; everything has to be done meticulously by hand, day after day. And each mistake is more costly than the last. And the days get longer and longer; easier and easier to slip up...

[h1]Deeper Circle of Sheol[/h1]
At this point I should note that this game has a story. It's a ridiculously grimdark story about human folly; but it's good. It's so good. You want to see it, you want to know. You want to understand the mystery. But in order to do that, you have to not only progress with the days - all 50 of them - but also complete Sephirot missions as you go. Those missions often require you to complete a day under extreme conditions, which make the already difficult game a true piece of hell. 

I tried. So, so many times. That's why I have those 134 hours. Because I actually wanted to see what this is about, perhaps to get good at the game. But no. Maybe it's me. Maybe my brain is just to distracted to play this game. And I tried. Keeping notes, developing protocols; it felt way more like work than my actual work. No. No more.

I implore you: do NOT play this. Or else you'll be trapped in the same loop of despair as me. I managed to break out, but I'll always carry that seed with me, seed of the ultimate sin of game design: a game with so much unfulfilled potential. Let this review be an attempt at redemption, and perhaps and act of deliverance from this torment for someone else.",1655711830,1655711830,False,106,71,0.700411558151245117,0,True,False,False

The gameplay style doesn't mesh with everyone. It's stressful like a horror game, which I do like, just this is way more tedious for how ""enjoyable"" the base gameplay is. It's very cool to find new things, but when the new things are extremely few and far between (like when resetting to Day 1), the game sucks.
A large chunk of my hours is AFK, but I've still spent quite a lot of time on this game.

I'm giving a thumbs down because after all the time it took to beat the game, the proper ending is locked behind having 100% abnormality research. I decided to try and grind it out, and after quite a few hours I got only 1 of the 2 abnormalities I was missing.

Lobotomy Corp is an SCP-esque management, where you manage and learn various abnormalities and inevitably fail and get your loved employees murdered by them when you make the wrong call. Entangled in this chaos is a rather fascinating little story that plays between each day, where you learn just what is the purpose of the facility you manage instead of what you are told at the beginning. It has this very uncanny feeling to it.

But let's not spoil the story, first thing first, gameplay, this game has a very steep difficulty curve. I would say it's not even a curve, it's more of a cliff and even after you master it, its endgame is in the words of the game itself ""absolutely brutal."" The biggest part of your time will be spent trying to make it through each respective day, managing monsters, each with their little quirks, some simple, some difficult, some... well apocalyptic let's just say that. Most days you will have to add at least one more to your collection and eventually each day will turn into this grand puzzle where you have to keep 80,000,000 things on your mind in order for everything not to go to hell... and even then it still might, because of various ordeals you will have to deal with, which are essentially events that happen as you work your way through the day that introduce yet another element of chaos and in essence to keep the cycle from becoming stale as every day will be slightly different and keep you in this wonderful state of constant stress where you are never sure if you make it through the day without getting half of your department turned into red jelly.

The art style is fairly simple, the story even clarifies that what you see are not in fact what your employees look like, rather it is a filter that makes them look like dolls to prevent you, the manager, from losing your marbles. And still it manages to be extremely grim and filled with gore, your employees can get their heads bitten off, they can be possessed and have to be subsequently murdered, they can be charmed, cocooned, eaten, mauled, frozen, burnt, shot(by you mostly), turned into trees, turned into apostles, axed, melted, go insane, explode, commit suicide... you get the point. It's great.

I won't spoil the story, because I believe it should be experienced first hand if you are the slightest bit interested, but what I will say is that it tackles several of very serious topics such as depression, PTSD and suicide and delivers a very strong message on the matter if you choose to go for the true ending.

I've owned this little gem since around 2019 and just now decided to give it a shot and after 90ish hours and 100% completion I can say I was blown away and I tip my proverbial hat to Project Moon for this wonderful game.

568220,116947846,76561198097021785,0,5,6214,0,6201,1705061118,"This game and I have a funky relationship. The exploratory components of the gameplay, the writing, the music, it is all absolutely stellar. There is so much to rave about it. The thing which irks me the most about this game, however, is probably the user-hostile experience. I have not had such a user-hostile experience playing a video game before. Insufficient tutorial aside, there are a lot of weird aspects to the game which seem needlessly punishing. For example, E.G.O. loss upon employee death is quite brutal on your second+ playthrough, and it adds a needless amount of risk to giving out your most powerful E.G.O. to employees when the criteria for equipping high-level E.G.O. is already so high. In addition, the consequences of Return to Memory Repository are quite hard to read into at first. While employees who died after Memory Imprint come back to life, E.G.O. is still lost.

The most punishing aspect of the game is easily the grindy aspect. To end most days, you need to reach a certain power output level, and this makes replays incredibly tedious. What's more, without spoiling, some special days instead require you to play through days up to a certain point. Some of these days get incredibly long, and having someone in your team die with good weaponry/armor during the end of one of these long days is incredibly brutal and demoralizing.

Some of the abnormalities seem to be implemented specifically to make you vigilant (or suffer) as opposed to giving you a fun time. Of course, I can't get into these without spoiling the game, but some abnormalities are incredibly high-maintenance, high-risk for sometimes little to no reward. The only reason I managed to play this game well was because I had watched streams beforehand and knew about some of the worst abnormalities and how to deal with them as minimally as possible.

There is a modding community for this game, and near the end of my playthrough I had to download a few mods because the gameplay was becoming exceedingly, disproportionately punishing. I would heavily recommend downloading mods for this game because it is, to be frank, unfair. There is one abnormality which, if you encounter it on a run that isn't your first, will potentially wipe E.G.O. from other runs. There is a special day which require you to work for 30 minutes before doing something incredibly challenging, and losing on that day requires you to redo those 30 minutes. This game asks for a tremendous amount of patience from players, and I do not blame anyone for saying ""no"" to that demand via mods.

However, the incredible amount of charm and the overall experience was something truly magical. The story made me feel an array of emotions, several upon several unscripted moments in the gameplay were fun and memorable, and oh my god the music. I cannot speak for whether or not the variable difficulty spikes and punishments are going to be worth it at all to you, but if you think you have the patience for this game, I would say that I would recommend this game.",1655164391,1655164391,True,34,0,0.75831073522567749,0,True,False,False

No, really. It hates you. It hates your guts, it hates your attempts, it will chew you up because you decided to take in a new Abnormality (Totally Not SCP), send one of your agents in, and 30 seconds later, wonder why it mutated into a middle-tier slime that's currently infecting others and cascading into your 5th reset of the hour.

And when the hooks are in deep enough? You shrug it off. You reset. You start seeing your agents as disposable beings that are just there to survive until the next bit. You get to the next day with 3 dead. This is a good thing. 3 dead is easily replaceable. Dead people are replacable.

You watch someone grow for 10 days. Level 4. Researching the higher tier monsters. You screw up. You see them immediately die because the roulette hated them enough that they were chosen for a sacrifice to an Abnormality that hits way above your paygrade. You wonder if you can save them. You decide not to. You hit a wall. No matter what, this next part is impossible. Reset upon reset. A Memory Imprint a few days back; something's stopping, you're not lucky enough the list goes on.

That's fine. Day 1 reset. You keep the knowledge of the Abnormalities you researched. Certain meta tidbits are preserved. You go again. Try a few new ones. Fall back on the ones that you know won't screw you over. Repeat. And again. 

The game is jank. The game has questionable elements. The game has a few Missing Staircase things and Abnormalities that deliberately kick you in the nuts while you're down. The game's translation could stand to have stronger character voices, a clearer emphasis on how you're supposed to take this game, a combat system micro that isn't so finicky, on and on and on. It's the product of a failed kickstarter that somehow made it to the light of day in all its flawed glory.

And it works. The brainworms hit me. Even when every later day ended with a sense of dread at what's coming next, what the plot wishes to give, what the characters want to do, even when it'd be better to close it and relax...The agents get prepped. The Abnormalities are extracted. And the days go on.

What it gets right is the feeling. It has an atmosphere in mind, something intertwining directly back to the setting, the plot, the reason you're in L Corp in the first place, doing all this while an AI directs you again and again and again. It's the ludonarrative aspect that's the true king here, and your enjoyment of this is entirely predicated on understanding what the game wants you to feel and how much you buy into it. The gameplay and stress work so well with the plot that leaving it out for a plot video is a disservice. 

It's hard to emphasize how much this game gets right in terms of gameplay and plot working together without spoiling stuff. The barest knowledge is that you're there for a reason. There's a reason why the protagonist doesn't up and quit.

If it's too hard, mod it. Zero shame. The game is tough as nails. Get stuff from Nexus Mods. Super Agents (It will not save you). Infinite Points. Learn when your own wellbeing is better than cracking against this wall of a game and break it down with the mods to experience the gameplay interplay with the story at hand. The mods will not make this a 100% cakewalk, but it'll lessen some of the more demanding aspects...and not all of it. 

tldr Drakengard of Management Sims, mod it once you've hit your own personal wall, and get the true ending
watch the 100% True Ending on youtube afterwards, unless you want to go and roll for every Abnormality and learn about them all

The game has a lot of interesting anomalies and others that are just annoying and ruin your playthrough if you get them without knowing about them beforehand.
First 4 hours of the game is fun until you uncover the loop or instakill anomalies and ordeals.
The LOB point system should not be in place based on the way lobotomy corp wants you to handle your employees. And the fact that if you have several employees die you get a bad grade and cant hire new employees of the required caliber.

This would be fine, if the game TOLD you why you were killed instead of requiring you to get instantly killed first, before using the points you get to find out why you died.

Fortitude too low? You just lost someone.
Unlucky? You just lost someone.
Mercury in retrograde? Your entire force dies because of an event.

Do not purchase. I am serious.

Get the game if you:
-Like a solid management-sim game with an SCP-like theme.
-Simple but stylized art that sets the game apart from others.
-A soundtrack that highlights a working day's progress (including horrible mistakes).
-A story that has a cast of really memorable characters, actually explains several core gameplay mechanics, and continually gut-punches your emotions as the plot develops.

Don't get the game if you:
-Are easily stressed in sim games and are not looking to change that; the game can feel [b]very[/b] overwhelming to 1st timers in management sims by the halfway point.
-Are turned-off by unorthodox art and UI styles; the visuals and menu systems are far from perfect, so I can see how some people can get frustrated from just looking at the game.

The story, its characters and the world they live in, its an amazing experience exploring aspects of humanity as honest as it can be. This is the harder aspect to recommend avoiding spoilers, but also the most satisfying in my experience. The game builds up slowly, and gives no sign of being anything out of the ordinary for a good bunch of scenes, and suddenly it just all connects and there is no stop to wanting to know what is going on and how it will end.

(If its any clue that the writers are into something, day 1, [spoiler] they throw at you the terms Sephira and Malkuth and there is an obvious graph resembling an inverted tree of life on the department. [/spoiler])

The world building within itself is great, and its later further developed by the direct sequel Library of Ruina and the side story comics released. 

Its genre is very niche, a facility management game as the core gameplay. Depending on experience and certain abnormalities currently on the facility this aspect of the game can be overwhelming or very simple. 

A big challenge from this game is figuring out how abnormalities work, derived from how they look, the obscure lore they come with or other strange patterns they might show. As many would claim that the abnormalities are what make the game reach ridiculous levels of difficulty, its not a reason to fear picking it up due to the Memory Repository system, which lets you weed out abnormalities you do not wish to work on your current run, serving also as check point every 5 days ingame, reducing the difficulty by a whole lot if handled properly.

The game rewards restarting from day 1, you keep research levels, observations on abnormalities and certain events that happen during the story.

Lobotomy corporation is one of my favourite games of all time.

everything about this game keeps me wanting to know more about (insert character) or what is the story for (insert abnormality). it keeps my tiny attention span fixed on the game and the incentive to keep playing, which i find difficult for some games to do. Just overall big fan of the lore 

The music throughout the whole game is SO GOOD. From the menu music and when the worst thing ever happens and trumpet 2 goes off. MMMMMMMMMMMM ear blessing

I could go on for days but for now im just gonna say i love this game SO MUCH. chefs kiss",1634534093,1652316314,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

A non spoilery example of this would be that the game frequently brings up how employees are constantly being killed in the facility, and as the game progresses you will pretty much inevitably become more and more comfortable sacrificing your employees lives for minimal gain. This type of stuff about the game really helps add weight to the story in a way only games can, and I wish more games made this part of the core of their design philosophy.


However, I find it hard to recommend this game in general due to the fact that this game is not only incredibly long but also in my experience the first ~10 hours or so of the game were not all that engaging. The game can be very slow and the appeal of the gameplay (which is essentially figuring out the rules of how to contain/deal with these spooky/funny monsters) is not immediately obvious. My best shot at explaining why I and so many people like the gameplay comes down to the really creative designs of the abnormalities (in terms of not only gameplay but visuals and lore) which can make obtaining information about them quite fun, and also once you start getting to the mid game you will have abnormalities that can interact with each other in interesting (or infuriating) ways which really forces you to evolve your strategies as the game progresses. 

Another interesting point about this is game is that while the early game is easy and peaceful, this game quickly starts putting larger and larger obstacles in front of the player to the point where it can feel daunting or even overwhelming. I actually really love this about this game because the difficulty is so unique, these obstacles are less often a numbers or rng contest and more so a change in how you have to play the game, and its so incredibly refreshing. This makes the obstacles all feel fair and unique not to mention super satisfying to overcome.

It perfectly scratches that itch in my brain - the one that loves management simulators, and the one that loves brutal difficulty. I've spent countless hours perfecting facilities, getting equipment, and crashing and burning horribly due to my own inadequacy. I hate this game. I love this game. Tales of woe paint the walls of this place.

If you love learning by bashing your skull against the wall, this game will capture your heart. It will capture it too hard. It will crush you in its iron jaws, and you will smile.

I had recently acquired a new Beast, whom I quickly was able to deduce became irritated as the overload counter increased. It inevitably escaped, and though quite tough, I could recontain it with my well-equipped staff. She, however, on her way out, did kill several lackeys, and thus irritated another entity, and it breached as well. This one, harder to deal with, but not insurmountable. Once the first was dealt with, the second was dispatched as well. Alas! The third act of this story led with it another abnormality, who raised hell when things escaped. This one, not so quickly dispatched. It was a beautiful falling domino of my own creation.

On the other end of the spectrum, however, was Frank. Frank was a boring, low-grade agent, whom I hired for the fate of certain death against something I didn't understand. Frank, however, did not die. He lived against that thing through luck. And through madness, through nightmarish events, through it all, Frank lived on, wearing nothing but a suit and wielding nothing but a baton. He got himself a nice promotion, fantastic gear, and retired to the upper levels for an easy career beating down weak anomalies.

Fortune favors the bold and the foolhardy alike. If you don't know anything about this game, and you've played management simulators and gotten bored from the ease of it, or if maybe you like Darkest Dungeon, give this a try. It might stick. It might not. Either way, Project Moon is a very interesting studio that I'm happy to follow in their future endeavors.",1651561290,1651561290,True,16,3,0.656458139419555664,0,True,False,False

THE TRUE REVIEW OF THE GAME:

After 184 hours of playing this game, it has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. The above was just a joke review for my entertainment but I think this game deserves something heartfelt. There are three things that I think this game does a great job at and that make it worthwhile.

SYMBOLISM: This game is so much more than it is at a surface level. The story is quite understandable, I'm sure if you went back and watched every cutscene you could put two and two together. But take a step back and try searching up the etymology of some of the words, the Sefirot, the names of the Sefirot, the Seed of Life, the names of A, the names of the abnormalities, what do they actually mean? This game is very symbolic and the message it delivers is so much more profound when you know where its inspirations come from.

MECHANICS DON'T GROW OLD: If there's one thing to complain about in games with many mechanics is that the way you play the game becomes obsolete once reaching the endgame. Mechanics that you would once use in the beginning of the game are replaced by overpowered endgame gear or abilities that leave those tutorial mechanics without purpose. This game does it different, if anything, it makes you consider more mechanics and expands on mechanics the more you play the game. Things like the stat level of your employees when working on certain abnormalities, the time it takes, if they're hurt or not, how many employees die in the facility, I mean, what do you think the point of the Sephirah meltdowns were? Completing each one added onto your mechanics, and benefited you. I mean, control team's mission reward literally establishes the mechanics you use to play the game for the REST of the game. That is, being able to see your employee HP/SP, speeding up the game, and having the ability to send employees to work in other departments.

THE GAMEPLAY COMPLIMENTS THE STORY: This one is awesome. I can't say if Project Moon made the gameplay compliment the story, or the story compliment the gameplay, but it goes both ways. The cognition filter gives the developers to make the game look cartoony and friendly, and it misleads you, you later grow to understand that this is a very fucked place. Even abnormalities like CENSORED take the cognition filter to a next level. The reason you're able to retry days and go back to a memory repository is all a part of the lore as well, it's very interesting when a game does that.

Ultimately, hats off to Project Moon, my journey with this game was a fun one, and I recommend it to anyone. Though, this is just one chapter of my journey, not the end of my story. So I must turn to the next title, Library of Ruina; this was one hell of a game.",1647637457,1650849496,True,2,0,0.503472208976745605,0,True,False,False

The game's story is phenomenal, and truly builds up incredibly to it's sucessor, Library of Ruina.
However, the game itself is *very* rough around the edges. It is poorly optimized, and does have a few glitches here and there. The gameplay loop is also definitely not for everyone, but that couldn't be more false for the bossfights; as tension builds up and you're in a mad scramble trying to get everything together, until finally, the ""day finished"" window pops up, and you take a sigh of relief, as you take the next few days to collect some more E.G.O. before the next bossfight.

I recommend this games mostly for it's highs, as it is a game of incredible highs and pitiful lows, unfortunately. If you're not much into story and moreso like braindead gameplay, you should try Ruina instead then. But this game, has quite a bit to offer. I'd recommend modding it with BaseMod and getting Optimization Mod and whatever quality of life mods you may prefer after playing it a bit, since apparently there's an on-going trend of amazing Unity games being horribly optimized. (looking at you, Valheim)

Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8.8; The story is fantastically jaw-dropping, and had me going ""what the f*ck"" and ""holy sh*t"" at least 17 times with it's several twists and turns, and I personally enjoyed the gameplay, even if it's not for everyone, but the downsides of poor optimization and lack of polish at times is a bit too detrimental to the game itself at times.

If you think this game seems like your type, don't be too bothered by my warnings, and definitely go for it. It's quite an experience. But if it doesn't look like it, then try picking it up on a sale.",1649602688,1649602790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack is nice and I never found myself getting annoyed by it for the entire time I was playing the game. The tutorial at least for my explained everything I needed to know nicely so when I was in the game nothing was too confusing. Some of the abnormalities have quite interesting mechanics and trying to see what works and what doesn't is part of the fun of the game! 
Secondly the cons this type of game certainly isn't for everyone, it can be quite grindy at times and in some cases you may even have to restart all over to day 1 because certain challenges are exponentially harder in certain conditions. In my run of the game I've also experienced a few bugs, such as an abnormality going invisible, an abnormality deciding to up and teleport when they should have no ability to do so, and an abnormality not going back into its containment after killing it and just staying there to list a few. Another thing to note is that this game tends to lag when certain events occur, my computer rarely ever lags for anything even games like valorant, apex, and overwatch on high fps yet this game dropped frames quite quickly, but asking some people there is supposedly a mod to assist in dealing with the lag.  The game can also be quite repetitive at times. 
Whether this game is for you or not leads to one major question: How much are you willing to fail, redoing things countless times to the point of lunacy, do you enjoy a type of game where all your progress can simply be gone by a fingers snap?

The gameplay is unique and unlike anything i have played before. You need to command employees to work with monsters to produce a certain amount of energy each day. Every monster, dubbed Abnormalities, will do horrible things if you mess up.

The importance of trial and error rings true within this game. You won't understand these abnormalities at first, toiling around as you either get dealt a wave of destruction or minor annoyance to your facility. Managing these abnormalities to just pass another day. The gameplay of each day can range from 10 - 20 minutes to an hour or so of managing abnormalities, making sure nobody explodes into gorefests or the facility getting completely destroyed. Your employees (besides the clerks), items you acquire, and power you gained can be completely lost if you don't suppress and manage the problems that occur throughout your sessions. 

Each and every day ending and beginning with a new set of challenges and a story being told overtime of your past with the department heads around you. Uncovering a dark but hopeful story underneath it all for an epic climax and ending near the final days of the game. There will be hard obstacles in the way though, world-ending scenarios impeding your progress,  and large scale events that could ruin everything; However, in the essence of it all you need to overcome them.

I loved it and had a lot of fun, but the game is hard and unforgiving. You need good gear to manage strong abnormalities (the SCPs), but to do so you need good gear. You retry the day a lot and even restart the entire run (You keep infos about the abnos, gear and quests progression).

Then there is the fighting. At the beginning you either ignore it or restart the day if something terrible escapes because its you need to micromanage you little agents, dodging attacks or you die.
At the end of the game, the combat is mandatory, meaning you have to manage things on timers, monsters with unique mechanics and needs while fighting oneshot Killerrobots, god delusions and whatever an Arbiter is. Gets very stressful and a slight mistake means having to restart 30 minutes of gameplay because everything spiraled out of control.

Then again, same with Spelunky, and here you keep progress at least.

---> Many negative reviews concerning the game's translations should be disregarded, that issue has been looong gone. I do agree that this game will not be kind with your time though, which makes the game difficult to recommend to others

The game's nature of constant trial and error (which can be very time consuming) may make this game frustrating for some. The lengthy tutorial does offer a LOT of information for you to digest and I understood most of the game's mechanics by experiencing it, but I'd still argue that going through the tutorial is absolutely vital. If anyone's worried about the game eating up a lot of your time, there are a few quality of life mods on nexus that can be installed including macros and boosted chances of obtaining gifts, which I highly urge you to use in late game.

Restarting/resetting the game seems to be encouraged, and will make each run easier because of the accumulated gear and rewards from missions you've completed. The fact that you are able to pick which abnormalities you can introduce into your facility solely from a quote in their origin is a big part of the fun, or your demise....... The story (which is really great, by the way) is slowly unfolded through each day you complete and you are expected to piece it together. Please play Lobotomy Corporation before Ruina

For someone who has not played any games of that type, this was definitely a rough start, but I was drawn to this game by the SCP-like entities that you have to learn about through trial and error and dying (lots of dying). I am currently on my third restart because if you get unlucky this game will absolutely screw you over and spit you out. If you can handle the brutality that it can hand you and enjoy the reward of making discoveries and progressing, this game is for you.

in a basic form this game is has pretty complicated lore and difficult gameplay (if you arent really into trial and error and arent very patient), you get to manage abnormalities with your employees and collect energy from the monsters as you work with them, and most of them (if not all) have some sort of adverse effect behind them. the game gives you information on the the more you work, and if you dont unlock that information and mess up with an abnormality, youll risk something in some way. every abnormality is unique and has varying threats, from no risk at all to lovecraftian horror. you also have an advanced artificial intelligence guiding you named angela, and you get to meet other people along your journey as a manager. you expand on your department and unlock new skills, this game really encourages progress and its really worth it if you push through. its really unmotivating if you fail, but extremely relieving and rewarding when you succeed. 
unfortunately this game is quite buggy at times and laggy, sometimes an employee will die for no reason whatsoever and can only leave you to assume said employee simply spited the world and leave you hanging. this game isnt originally english either, sometimes the translation can be quite confusing and theres gonna be some tidbits of korean left over in the game. theres also depictions of gore and some horror, but everything is in a cartoonish style so its not too horrible, you are dealing with the unknown after all. the soundtrack is absolute FIRE, love when the facility is falling apart and a dj party is going on

A fantastic game I don't regret a single hour spent on, the main flaws being that once you 100% know what you're doing and don't have an immediate progression goal to work toward, the gameplay loop gets boring (meaning that it, in my opinion, has little replay value once you've 100%ed it), and the game is HORRIBLY optimized; once you get your middle layer departments, the game starts lagging like hell even on a machine that was high-end when it came out, which is mostly just annoying, although it becomes a serious issue near the endgame, particularly during [spoiler]a ""boss fight"" that involves a LOT of multitasking on a VERY tight timer, while unable to pause.[/spoiler]

There is also a comic that released after it taking place during the events of the game— Wonderlab, which I recommend reading! (although it's not required by any means.)

Having said that, the game is so compelling that it is easy to look past all of these issues.

The SCP Foundation is one of the most interesting creative writing projects on the internet, so playing a game where you're effectively managing a SCP Foundation facility and trying to discover how to exploit and contain dangerous objects and entities is very interesting. From what I can tell, these are all original entities, not copies from the SCP Foundation, though they are just as interesting. This is great if you've read tonnes of SCP write ups already and are worried you'll have an 'unfair advantage' going in.

The game describes itself as a Roguelite, and while that's sort-of true, in reality you can play it how you like. You can play until you accidentally choose an entity you cannot handle or figure out or which kills all your staff, and start over, where you retain the gear you manufactured and the entity information you uncovered, allowing you to more quickly catch up to where you were. If you don't want to go back to the beginning, you can rewind to before you selected an entity, or simply retry the level. This flexibility makes it easier the play the game the way you want without being tempted to look up spoilers, which you really shouldn't do.

As you get further into the game, it gets increasingly complicated, with you needing to handle more and more entities at the same time. You'll need to take notes and pause regularly to handle it.

Everything involving the story is great, but gameplay has two flaws which not everyone will experience equally. The first is that the game provides little to no advice on when or even why to restart, which left me and likely many other players futilely trying to progress when we should have cut our losses. In roguelites, which is what Lob Corp advertises itself as, you are forced to restart (by dying) after a relatively short amount of time due to a lack of skill/upgrades. But in this game, you get no clear indication on when to restart or how it will even benefit you. It's more akin to an idle game where you intentionally trade in your whole run for special upgrades, but in those cases it's very clear what benefit you receive and when progress has slowed down. You also invest a lot of time in your first few runs in Lob Corp which makes it doubly difficult to throw it all away. The end of my first run around day 37 was definitely the most frustrating and terrible experience I had with the game which I wouldn't have eventually resolved if I wasn't interested in the story. If loading the game or starting a new day fills you with a combination of apathy, dread, anxiety, or stress to the point which playing becomes unenjoyable, just restart or rewind. Pushing forward will not help you, and upgrades will eventually come which drastically speed up the early game for future runs. The game should have better emphasized the importance of restarting and completing missions by actually showing to you what it is you stand to gain, or at the very least not locking it behind a difficulty spike. After I came to this realization, the rest of the game was substantially more enjoyable and progress felt satisfying.

The second flaw is that combat is wonky and information within the game is sparse on how certain things work. This can be seen as a good thing because it somewhat simplifies combat and emphasizes broad decision making over precise strategy, but the system is very finicky and feels very unnatural when facing tougher foes. It can feel like you're trying to grapple with the game and even cheese it, but it's truly the intended way for it to work. Sometimes the game expects certain specific responses from the player which are not easily supported by the movement system, which can lead to irritating struggles that only feel difficult because you can't move agents precisely. Admittedly, this problem is much less severe and can be circumvented with proper preparation or luck, but this preparation can be deceptively difficult due to the other information that the game hides such as the mechanics behind work success rate and work xp. I suggest that toward the end of your playtime that you consult a wiki or guide for info or even use an info mod like I did, but this is quite late into the game and you can probably decide for yourself. It's definitely possible to enjoy most of the game blind, which I recommend. No matter what, the game is repetitive and rewards grinding, but the atmosphere keeps it from feeling monotonous.",1643068832,1643068832,True,1,0,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

The game is brutally difficult but it is designed with that in mind. Don't worry too much about losing, when you hit a wall you can rewind back to a previous day but you keep all your progress (abno research/missions/core supression bonusses) so when things get too tough you can essentially redo while keeping your progess. 
In essence losing and rewinding is part of the progression, don't spend an eternity banging your head against the wall retrying the day and roll with the losses if they aren't too severe and rewind when you hit a wall 
My biggest gripe with it however is that it's pretty rough around the edges when it comes to micro managing your agents. 
Especially so when you are blobbing and can't see health bars underneath eachother, makes it difficult deciding when to fire health/shield bullets. 
A lot of mechanics later in the game punish you for blobbing like this but that isn't until later, a lot of problems in the mid game can be solved by bumrushing it with pointy sticks and guns",1642715442,1642715442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because there’s some joy to be found in Lobotomy Corporation: catchy music, fun lore, a great sense of mystery in the core plot, gameplay that encourages experimentation. And, most importantly, all these elements mesh to create a darkly whimsical tone befitting the SCP nature of the game.

But the gameplay is so. incredibly. repetitive. You click an anomaly cell, you click one of four mechanically identical options, you click an employee, you wait for the results. Rinse, repeat x 100000. That’s the gameplay loop, occasionally broken up by some gear, stat optimization and by an escaping anomaly (which, for me, were either ‘super easy to contain’ or ‘all my employees die’ with no middle ground). I just couldn’t escape how much playing this game felt like wasting time. Which, yeah, video games. But usually it’s not so nakedly obvious, y’know?

But in this game, oh yeah, it is. In this game, for example, if you have the train anomaly and forget to send an employee there every 2 minutes, the train will kill all of your employees and you’ll have to restart the day (which can be a 20 minute endeavor). And in that restarted day, you’ll do the exact same things you did the first time - which is mostly the same stuff you did on the previous day and the day before that and the day before that. Or you’ll have the magical girl anomaly, which takes some finessing to keep contained. And you’ll inevitably mess it up, so she’ll escape and kill most of your employees, and you’ll restart the day and do the same exact stuff you did the previous day (minus your one mistake, you hope).

And after this occurs enough times, you start to think, Why am I playing this game? Really, why? Because you’re too tired to do something more productive, and you want to relax and you have free time to burn.

But Lobotomy Corporation is not a particularly relaxing game because there’s too many anomalies that require micro-management (which can quickly add up if you get many of these). Nor is it very rewarding. It doesn’t provide any aesthetic reward - no beautiful imagery or soundscapes. Its lore and story has some plusses, yeah, but they’re nothing compared to story-heavy AAA games or even most story-heavy indies. And its challenge isn’t a test of intellect so much as perseverance, meaning solving the mysteries of an anomaly generally requires brute force and repetition, rather than careful thought or puzzle solving.

Which, again, maybe all these complaints are purely subjective? Maybe they’re all features of the manager sim, and I just don’t like them?

So I think that’s what it comes down to. I wouldn’t recommend this to someone else unless they *REALLY* like either SCP stuff or manager sims. Or, ideally, both. For everyone else, there’s just so many other better games out there.",1642628245,1642628245,False,5,0,0.541916072368621826,0,True,False,False

I like this game and the setting it has, but this kind of shit is unacceptable. I have been stuck on Day 23 for weeks now because the game refuses to make me move forward when things go right. Oh, but get one of my workers slaughtered or mass release abnos? Yeah, you may go on. Enjoy your forced save and subpar rank :^)

I would forgive the gameplay if not for the fact that the game literally cheats on you by crashing or glitching out SOMEHOW when you finish a day or are about to. The fact that it forces me to waste valuable time just to do everything over and over and over and over and over and over and over to infinity and beyond until the RNG is right only for everything to crash is just exhausting.

I give up on this game, not because of the difficulty and micromanagement, but because of the engine crashing after such a rough, calculated day hoping that Alriune doesn't escape when one of my workers ekes out 16 points on it or the Scarecrow doesn't drive my agents mad, Or worse, get a bad RNG on an abno that reads high only for it to somehow kill my agent. It's like the game is actively mocking me, and I will not accept it at all. It's like the whole progress on a day feels like building a sand castle, only for the game to bulldoze it at the end and telling you to start over because ""fuck you, that's why"".

A+ on setting, B for gameplay, F for the game cheating you out of a hard-earned victory with a crash.

The story is apparently quite good and the theme is great so I'm trying to get through it to then try the sequel which originally got my attention, I can't say I'm enjoying the journey though and I worry this might tint my appreciation of library of runia.

Continued playing of the has improved my opinion of the game somewhat, specifically that using a wiki, to whatever degree is applicable to you, greatly improved the experience.

It is important to personally manage the amount of trial and error discovery that is enjoyable vs aggravating for you. Going into it you can make blind choices which will effectively kill a run but you won't know that right away. It can be helpful to think of the reset to day x button, not retry day, as a ""start a new run"" rather than thinking of your entire progression as a single run. If you can get through 5 days in good shape you've ""won"" a run.

The story has grown evocative and I appreciate how it is told. I don't think it would land as well if you just watched all the cut scenes.

I still can't say I strictly recommend the game. It's not something that can be picked up and enjoyed out of the box and it doesn't tell you what you need to do to enjoy it but it can be enjoyed.

Final verdict. I think the time management and figuring out anomalies aspects of the game are good but the combat aspect is bad which brings the final opinion down on bad if you want to finish the game, if your fine with just playing around with the first 70% of the game it's pretty good.",1640933258,1642140465,False,17,0,0.605622529983520508,0,True,False,False

Ok, that's all well and good, I love a good bit of worldbuilding and lore. 

However, from what I have played of LC so far I can tell it is not the game for me and that it is going to be a huge time investment, time I do not have to play a game I am not fully enjoying. It's not the difficulty, I love difficult games. It's not the management genre, I play my fair share and I love games like Crusader Kings and the old Tycoon games and have nothing but respect for the greats of the genre (which many of them, like this game, aren't my thing). 

If you love management games and you love challenging games, this is worth your time to at least look into. The story and the gameplay mechanics unfold beautifully like a flower, each day more difficult than the last. I can't tell yet if the game is satirical or self-serious regarding management and the corporate mindset. The decisions you make are cartoonishly sociopathic but it's also totally in line with how a powerful large corporation operates. Either way I was able to set aside my contempt for this mindset IRL and laugh at this goofy power fantasy video game. As you progress each day, more characters are introduced and management gets more complicated as you have to hire more employees, train them, delegate tasks, and deal with new abnormalities and their weird behaviors. It gets real sweaty.

The abnormalities (monsters you harvest energy from) are varied and interesting, and sometimes funny. The ones you get are picked from 3 random boxes at the end of the day with cryptic flavor text that hints at what is inside. Death is inevitable, replaying days is inevitable. If you love fiddly little numbers and boxes and systems in your games this is gonna give you the biggest hard-on. The soundtrack is nothing but BANGERS, which is great because you're going to be staring at this thing for 100 hours at least from what I hear. 

So do I recommend it? Yes, but with the caveat that you really look into it and see if it is for you first because this is about as niche as it gets. I'll end this by saying I have nothing but respect for ProjectMoon and what they have done here. I feel like I gave Lobotomy Corporation a good old fashioned try but I'm going to set it aside.

For context, most of the games bought and played on Steam aren't actually finished, as a matter of fact, I can tell just by looking at the review playtimes that the vast majority of people haven't finished the game. If Lobotomy Corporation had achievements to track how many people actually finished the game I would not be surprised if the completion rate was less then 3%.

Why is this relevant? Because if you want a fun and kind of addicting simulation/management game for the first 10-30 hours, then this game is good! You definitely get value out of it for the 10 or so dollars it goes on sale for. The story is amazing, I almost cried several times throughout the game, the music is great as well, but...

If you want to actually FINISH the game, then be prepared for agony, it takes around 100-130+ hours to actually finish it, and that's not because the story is that long, as a matter of fact, all of the dialogue can be read back to back in around 30 minutes or less. The reason the game takes so long to beat is that the endgame is absolutely BRUTAL and will require AT LEAST 2-3 repeat runs and by the time you're on the third one the game definitely becomes a slog. I was going mad, I thought several times about quitting the game and leaving a bad review because it was getting really hard and I couldn't stand the thought of resetting it again or trying for another day. Nevertheless with some help I pulled through.

And it's worth it. The pay off is worth it, not gonna say much obviously but do not be afraid to get help or tips during the last ordeals if you're at your limit because you should see this game to the end if you've made to that far anyways. 

So yes, if you do want to get this game, just understand that the late game  is absolutely brutal and will require at minimum 100 hours to finish. 

It's not for everyone, but in order to build the future, you have to face the fear and the ordeals that come with it, and only then will your core meltdowns be suppressed with enough time.",1641603329,1641603386,True,4,0,0.575055181980133057,2,True,False,False

In short: This game is well worth the base price and has a long runtime, especially worth the asking price if you have a thing for management sims or RTS games.

The game seems deceptively simple at first and builds upon itself in clever ways. Many times the game has made me smile thinking, ""I didn't think the game was capable of this"". Very good game if you have a soft spot for games that defy expectations.

Cons:
-Very long runtime (200+ hours if not looking up wiki information)
-Faux-deep/profound writing on most characters that was personally quite grating after a while
-Gameplay can be considered ""trial and error"" in many instances.
-Somewhat outdated micromanagement control scheme (have to send units to different rooms/abnormalities to get them to move, cannot select individual units when stacked on top of eachother via HUD, etc.)
-There is tons of stuff to remember as you get to later days. Your ability to multi task and your memorization ability will surely be tested as you progress. It is possible to be forced to retry days in this manner as one minor thing can set an abnormality off, causing a chain reaction.

Pros:
-Very good writing, adequate reward for passing challenges and unlocking parts of the story
-Money spent to time played ratio is off the charts, very good value if on a budget as the game frequently goes on sale
-As mentioned before, the game is very good at surprising you or making you think ""just what is this game?""
-Gameplay is relatively simple and easy to get into.

These abnormalities start out relatively harmless and simple, but as the game progresses and you expand deeper into the facility, more dangerous and complicated beings inhabit the halls. Truly enjoyable experience experimenting on each abnormality and watching my workers die as I inevitably send them to their deaths.

""I wonder if I do this he'll get eaten?"" ""Yup, he got eaten.""

A word of warning, however- this game, if you wish to complete it, is mercilessly grindy. You'll be restarting your run often as you as a manager obtain new skills and abilities after certain points, and each time, it'll be a long journey back to where you came from. Near the end, after defeating a certain black haired boss, I had to convince myself to play through the multiple weeks to get back towards the end, replaying content with the now-familiar abnormalities. As a first time player, you're not going to know which box contains which horror, meaning that you can just get screwed from the outset if you're unfortunate enough. Watching friends play and seeing they got some particularly tough combinations from the start sucked.

Still, if you're up to the challenge, I'd recommend Lobotomy Corporation. I had a genuine good time feverishly scrambling and being surprised whenever something escaped containment and turned my people into bees or whatever. The story is told at a slow drip pace, but is intriguing enough to keep you coming back until the very end.

Trying to learn which method to interact with a new anomaly can be really punishing(potentially resulting in the death of whomever you used or the anomaly escaping which may get even more people killed), but then you rewind and just try something else which makes the punishing part irrelevant.

Besides that the game is very stressful until you get into the mojo and its a game that highly encourages you to restart or to retry but you only gain knowledge and what ever you had before the rewind retry or restart which is nice and all but you do not really gain any more bonuses.

The P.E boxes for some anomalies reach 999 to fast and you cannot really spend much of the P.E boxes and thats annoying wish I could spend the extra ones on something besides that this game at least for me has a lack of filling like you got over a challenge theres no real triumph because its the same thing day in and day out wish there were achievements to give me something to really show that yeah I did this.

So yeah I touched upon how there should be achievements so people like me get more of a dopamine rush but also I think it might be good to show statistics for other players to show how hard the game can truly be and I think just in general statistics would be nice like how tf2 has a class statistic chart thing on the steam profile I wan't that but amounts of resets, retries, day usually reset on, and highest day that someone like me has gotten to and also if you do all of these things add cards and badges just so your game has some bonus value to it and to maybe look a little more professional for some simple folk like me",1637780417,1639522138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, Lobotomy Corporation is an absolutely fascinating game! A management/roguelike(lite)/horror game that consistently manages to stress and astonish. A cute and somewhat basic art style for the grunts, clerks, and agents at your disposal, and hundreds of intricate well-made portraits and designed ""Abnormalities"" causes a delightful contrast for the mediocre and macabre.
Every time something goes right in this game, you are wrong. Look elsewhere in your facility.

No annoying notification noises for when something bad is happening, a bona-fide S-tier soundtrack, and many distinct sound cues between the abnormalities give massive credit to the team for their sound design.
Surprisingly deep customization for those same previously mentioned grunts, and only hints and a choice to decide what abnormality is coming soon to your facility not only keep you yourself as the manager on your toes, but provide many options to pick and choose favorites, both normalities and abnormals alike.
Along with a surprisingly lenient learning curve, a handful of RNG elements, a challenge mode, and the ability to skip dialogue lends an intense amount of replayability between saves and accepted defeats.

The game has also received many an update, from the ""Legacy"" version to the more updated and refined version that is defaulted when you purchase the game.

This game is a 10/10 at its best, and at its unfathomable worst, it is only an 8/10, perhaps 7/10 if management sims or roguelikes(lites) aren't your thing.

A genuine steal on sale, but still worth a purchase if any of the above interests you.
(no this is not an SCP game, but it's in a similar vein.)
Also the default language is South Korean, and I must recommend changing it from the settings. There is also a wikia for general tips or outright strategy.",1639512994,1639512994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a hard game. I still haven't beaten it. But doing my best to get through the later days and the challenges is such a thrill and incredibly rewarding. The soundtrack is wonderful (if drum and base is something you enjoy, although there are some very nice piano and jazzy tracks). There are subtle details that really add to the tone of the game (the shift in ""oh no things are going wrong"" in the 2nd warning theme versus the ""its all over now"" 3rd warning theme? masterful.) 

The story is a lot more than I expected. I was anticipating SCP clone ""just do it because we can."" Instead it's this story about grief, regret, and what does it take to forgive someone, if you even can? All wrapped up in a cute exterior (which has a lore explanation too!!! Get to day 10.) I love SCP, but I feel I actually care about the world this game is set in. And so much of the lore is hidden in dialogue or monster files (as you learn more about a creature, you can access it's story files. They are just as fun to read as playing the game!) It took putting the pieces together from multiple character dialogues to finally learn what a Sweeper is in the lore. Everything has a reason here. 

Watching the gameplay does not help to get a sense of the enjoyment, it really is one of those games you have to physically try and feel the stress for yourself. Although that one video on youtube of the ""full qligoth meltdown"" does give a taste of the monsters ahead, the number of deaths expected, and the three theme songs you will likely hear many, many times.

I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed this game. No, it is not for everyone. It's a strange style of game that does have it's hiccups (and certain very detested monsters. Fuck you, Plague Tree.) However, it is a rich, interesting world with fun mechanics, great soundtrack, and hours of enjoyable stress. You will love your employees and try to keep your faves alive. Additionally, there is a sequel game (Library of Ruina), a webcomic (Wonderlab by Project Moon. It can be read standalone, but many concepts will make more sense playing the game), Light novels (Distortion Detective) and soon an app game (Limbus Company.)

Gameplay: Constantly grinding your Agents' XP so that they don't suck is very tedious; if you use mods to try to eliminate this problem, you'll quickly realize that the majority of the gameplay revolves around incrementing your employees' levels by clicking boxes that hover over bootleg SCPs. 

Additionally, many Abnormalities are not viable gameplay choices because they are poor at leveling the Agents' skills: for example, I wanted to pick Warm-hearted Woodsman, but I already had an Abnormality of the same class that trained my Agents' Temperance skill, so there was no point in choosing it, and I had to settle for a boring one.

Also, like most management games, the goal is to 'do everything right' and successfully end the day with as few casualties as possible. It turns out that 'doing everything right' is extremely easy to figure out and do, and what ends up happening is... well, nothing. Nothing happens. You click on boxes for the entire day, and since you avoided the obvious pitfalls and ridiculous insta-kill conditions, nothing happens. It's extremely dull, and avoiding that blandness requires: A.) the player to intentionally make mistakes during gameplay, or B.) the Abnormalities chosen having unfair or ridiculous abilities that allow them to force a mistake to occur (i.e., Queen of Hatred becoming harder to contain because the player is playing too well; Singing Machine instantly killing an Agent that is too fortuitous, etc.)

In short: 
- The most fundamental gameplay concept is grinding. If you do not find grinding fun, then avoid this game.
- Accessing much of the game's content is discouraged, because it doesn't aid the grinding process.
- If you play the game competently, nothing of note will occur; nothing special will happen outside of grinding.

Yawn-inducing.

Lobotomy corporation is a tough as nails management game, but has an extremely satisfying feeling of progression. You start off with relatively harmless abnormalities to contain, but over time you'll find yourself dealing with objects with terrifying god like powers. 

You'll find yourself failing again and again as you learn the ins and outs of each abnormality in your facility. Abnormalities that may have seemed impossible to deal with first will eventually just become a simple part of your daily managerial routine, as they go from overrunning your entire facility, to eventually just becoming a minor bother. Nothing really beats that feeling of overcoming the creature that wiped your strongest units 10 times over. 

Do be warned though, Lobotomy Corp will still continue to throw everything at you as you develop your facility even further. You will fail, a lot, often by things you couldn't even foresee. If trial and error isn't your cup of tea you may want to give this game a pass.

The caveats:
1) The end of the game ramps up the difficulty by magnitudes. If you're not prepared for the grind or for all the attempts lost to rng or looking away from a critical portion of the facility for a second, this may not be the game for you. There are guides for the harder bosses out there on the internet, but it can take some searching to find them (I recommend the game reddit for strategies if you need them). And if you're stuck on Binah's fight for two months like I was: [spoiler] Use the Backwards Clock once her Phase 2 starts. [/spoiler]

2) The translation is rough. The gist of it is there, and sometimes there's some clever plays on words, but the translator is obviously not a native English speaker. It's better than Google translate but be prepared for odd phrasing and typos. For the most part I had no problems, but the more surreal the plot and the more metaphysical the topic of discussion, the harder the script is to parse.

3) It's LONG, mostly as a result of the difficulty. I got through it by pecking at it slowly over a long period of time, but if you want to just play the game and move on to the next one in your library, I can't recommend it.

But if those caveats don't deter you and you stick through to the end, the emotional payoff is worth it. It's just not a game for everyone.

Edit 9/16/2020: The English translation has been entirely reworked since I posted this review originally and is much, much better. It is no longer an issue with the game.",1576483277,1638101085,True,6,0,0.595877766609191895,0,True,False,False

The interface is hard to wrap your head around initially but you get how to play surprisingly quickly, so after initial frustration it works pretty well.

The anomalies is my favorite part of the game. Some people cheat by reading wiki, but I personally enjoy uncovering features of every anomaly on my own. It's really nice and interesting, there are a lot of passion and unique ideas in every anomaly and you never know when you're going to pick one that will genocide your entire staff. It's even quite scary at times, despite graphics being so cute, because you never know what to expect and sometimes everything can be destroyed and get really bloody and gruesome from a single wrong decision.

Things that feel like basic gameplay mechanics (like being able to see character health, without which your agents appear to die at random) are gated behind unlocks that can take hours to reach. Learning more about the abominations is interesting and presumably the story was going somewhere, but the basic gameplay loop just isn't fun. Its attempt to include roguelite permadeath mechanics is so un-fun that it seems to recognize this and defaults to giving you the option to restart days or revert to a save point... but doing that is almost more punishment than trying to limp along with nearly no agents left, because the only real point of interest in a day is learning more about the abominations, which you've already done if you're repeating a day.

You take command as the leader of a research facility that's here to extract energy, and apparently to learn about these monsters. There's a lot of fun to be found when reading the descriptions of these Abnormalities (as the game calls them), and the story sections slowly clue you in very well on how things are going, [spoiler] unless you skip them for some reason >:( [/spoiler]

The game has been said to be frustratingly hard, and this is especially off putting (other than it being a different genre of game) to folks who were told to play this game first, then Library of Ruina simply because of the lore and story impacts. Personally, barely a few hours into my playthrough, I realised that I would definitely quit if I kept going for a 100% blind playthrough, so I just looked up not-plot relevant spoilers on how to deal with (some of) the Abnormalities when I became hardstuck. Now that I'm currently 70% into my playthrough, I feel like this is the right decision, however the game is still really hard asf lmao, as in you WILL be retrying multiple times, and this is by design. You're supposed to be discouraged and frustrated, but that makes success all the more sweeter.

Some people say discovering the quirks of each monster is part of the fun, but I can't really relate when it takes so long and there's so many monsters to figure out, and time is precious to me. Of course, some other folks don't like the minefield-esque system of discovery while also not liking having to look things up when they hit a wall because people say blind playthroughs are more ""fun"". That aside, there's also people who recommend you to simply just look up the story on Youtube. Personally I still find the management and expanding the facility addicting even though I ruin the ""fun"" part for myself, and the story bits still feel deserved and more enjoyable when I ""worked"" for it.

Overall I recommend the game part of this game for people who like management games, and completionists who want to experience this (soon to be trilogy) series by the books instead of just watching the story on Youtube (which is also fine. People have different amounts of free time available to invest in things they're not 100% sure are worth it). Might edit this review later once I'm done with the game or leave it as is.

p.s: [spoiler] child of the galaxy is the best abnormality, also don't hesitate to sacrifice your employees, despite how cutesy the game makes them look. [/spoiler]

-------------------------
After a few more hours
-------------------------

I'd like to admit to being an absolute coward. [spoiler] Gebura [/spoiler] made me a little too frustrated and [spoiler] Binah [/spoiler] finally really broke me. I read that the later days are EVEN WORSE, so I simply just gave up and watched the rest of the story on Youtube. Seeing how insane they got made me a little regretful but at the same time glad that I didn't have to deal with that shit lmao. That said...

I'd like to preface by saying that when people say the artstyle/music is good, they're obviously being subjective and there's no need to say that its their own opinion. But it is amazing, and I enjoyed enough of the soundtrack organically that I can appreciate a lot of the music tracks outside the game way more (even though on Youtube/Soundcloud you'll find that there's literal tens of them, there's a lot). The characters are very stylish and the whole Hebrew naming scheme in a lot of the game's lore is something I've never seen before, so it was a very fresh and cool experience to the usual anime stuff I've consumed lately.

I can't wait to hop on to Library of Ruina now, which I hear is ""easier"", needing less reaction time and management skills (which isn't my forte). It being a card game is a big bonus since I like theorycrafting in those. Knowing nothing about LoR, I still think I enjoyed a majority of my time spent with this game. If you like a well written story and expansive lore world building (both distinct things), you'll have a good time.",1636203152,1636331609,True,25,0,0.732659876346588135,0,True,False,False

[strike]The developers' primary language isn't English, this game was originally demo'd in Korean so there are going to be some slight grammatical errors here and there. They aren't severe enough to really detract from the game though.[/strike]

As of May 4, 2020 this no longer applies. The game received a high quality overhaul of the English translation, and the game reads much better now.

[h1]Welcome to Lobotomy Corporation, Administrator[/h1]

Lobotomy Corp is best described as a management / simulation game with perma-death. You're assigned as the administrator of a facility hosting [strike]SCPs[/strike] Abnormalities. Lobotomy Corp has developed technology to harvest ""energy"" from these Abnormalities as a saving grace for humanity. Sounds easy right? Well, not really.

Every Abnormality is unique and has its own fully fleshed out character. But, just like SCPs, Abnormalities can wreak havoc given the chance. As the administrator, not only is it your job to keep these Abnormalities happy, but it's also your job to keep your employees safe. Easier said than done, every employee comes with an array of stats that will detail how effectively and efficiently they can perform their job; whether their job be feeding an Abnormality or caving the head in of one of their fellow employees.

The game itself doesn't give you much to go on in determining exactly how to handle Abnormalities which does make the game a tad more difficult (i.e. what exactly having an employee perform a ""consesus"" with an Abnormality actually does). There's also several mechanics in the game that are left unexplained and up to the player to figure out. It's a bit intuitive and there's a bit of a learning curve.

Progression for story mode is divided into ""days"" with each day becoming progressively harder as new challenges continue to be added for the administrator to handle. At the start of each day you're allotted a number of employees who you can assign to each section of the facility to perform tasks for the abnormalities in that area. This adds an element of strategy to the game as the player is forced to divvy up exactly who he wants where to match the preferences of the Abnormalities, etc.

To actually complete a day, players are required to (at least in the early days) harvest a specific amount of energy from the Abnormalities in the facility. This is done by keeping all of the abnormalities in a good mood. Likewise, abnormalities in a terrible mood will also detract energy from the gauge, along with going berserk on the employees.

The game is fairly straightforward with a slight undertone of complexity which makes for a very interesting game overall. To add, the story also presents itself through the administrator's accompanying AI who drafts notes and details logs about ongoing events throughout the facility.

[h1]Tl;dr[/h1]

I'd definitely recommend buying this game if you're interested in management / simulation games. I haven't had any performance issues though that's likely because the game is a smaller management game produced in Unity.

Around Day 21 is where it starts to get good and hectic, especially when you complete the requirements for the mysterious ""core suppression"" you keep seeing. Monsters that were once harmless suddenly release other, deadlier monsters. And you might accidentally teach some of your employees that letting monsters out of their enclosures is noble. And you start to figure out each tiny monster type (""ordeals"") needs to be dealt with in a specific way - some of the weakest ""dawn"" class ordeals become serious threats if you don't place kill teams in anticipation of them, and the second threat level - ""noon"" - can outright wipe entire departments in under three seconds even if all your dudes have max stats. I am not exaggerating, it will happen in less than three seconds even against those weaklings.

Other than that, it's got the usual relaxing and addictive management sim vibes. But also the heart-pounding nature of roguelikes and RTSs.

-The UI is a combination of uninformative and unintuitive. 
The only way to see your health and sanity of a worker is to click on a room that isn't being worked on.
If they are in a fight, you can't see anything. You can't even move them away because they will run back into battle. 
The dialog during the game can be several paragraphs but it only stays on the screen for 3-4 seconds. 
Because it's a 2d game your workers often stack on each other, making it frustrating to locate people and give them orders.

-Music
There is ONE song the entire game. Just one. And it plays on about 2 minute loop. It's a cute lofi beat at first but after the first 30 minutes you're going to want to just turn off the music completely. 

-Story
The main story is full of lengthy ambiguous dialog that doesn't seem to go anywhere and the vast majority of the time it has zero impact. I'll choose one option, restart, choose the other option and the NPC's say the same things. It's not interesting either. A lot of it is just filler talking about someone's nickname or berating another employee for asking for paper. 

-Gameplay
The strategy in this game is to just throw people at the entities and watch them die until you get enough 'energy' to unlock hidden information text then restart the day and try again. I don't like that type of gameplay. I want to lose because I did something wrong, not from 100% rng. The entire game is playable with just your mouse. There's no control setting because there's barely any controls.

-Conclusion
It's too bad because I really like base building games and colony sims. I hate this game though. I refunded it after 2 hours but I purchased it on sale a couple years later to try it again and I regret it. There was no point in this game that I thought it was fun. Out of the 300+ games in my library, this is the only game I hate with a passion.

Here is the list of things which annoy me too much to prevent me from enjoying the game further and deeper:
- It sometimes crashes to Win10
- You cannot see HP and SP (hit points and sanity points) of your employees unless you're assigning them to work from room menu
- visual novel style between days/missions - to my taste they talk too much about nothing - could be good for those with same taste as authors, for me it was neither interesting, nor funny
- too much text anywhere on screen which quickly pops up and some of it dissapears too quickly to dissapear - it's more confusing than interesting or fun to read
- weird and very long tutorial - reading manual (F1) was quicker and more informative, that one was good
- day time not limited - it feels weird that you can complete a day within a minute or grind for hours in one day..
- weird music which wore me down, I had to mute it
- when zoomeed out, names and quotes from employees are so small that you cannot read them
- also font size being scaled differently in different rooms screens and zooms is weird and hurts the readability more than it helps it..
- weird UI, unintuitive, but possibly you can get used to it
- bad overview of your employees, as zoomed out you cannot read their names well, or see them well.. You also cannot see their list to have good overview who's hurt or so..

These things can be okay to people with different taste than I do, so I am not saying it is a bad game. I just strongly do not recommend it to those with similar taste I have.",1635533914,1635533914,False,5,1,0.463099032640457153,0,True,False,False

...Seriously, though, I genuinely adore this game, if the time I've spent playing it hasn't made that clear enough. Even though there are improvements that could be made, I overall find it charming and intriguing.

The gameplay is difficult and stressful. It's also punishing for careless mistakes and not paying attention to what specific Abnormalities mean. However,  the mechanics are rather easy to learn and understand, and you are rewarded for making the most of situations and planning accordingly. Knowing when to restart, how to effectively use your employees, and the gimmicks of Abnormalities will be your key to victory.

The main draw for me personally is the story. The store page doesn't really delve into the characters you meet and the lore of the world, but trust me when I say that it's deeper and more interesting than it seems. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, so all I will say is that the backstory for the corporation, as well as the gameplay itself, make it clear that a player character isn't necessarily a good person just because they're the protagonist.

Of course, the game could be improved. By mid to late-game, restarting runs began to feel tedious since there isn't much to do in early sections, and some parts literally don't work (that one welfare research...). While these weren't enough to dissuade me from liking this game, they still stuck out to me. 

Overall, though, I love this game a lot. Recommended for people who are into stressing themselves out over nuggets.

There is little derision in this sentiment, I truly think this game is creative enough to be worth a persons time. But compromises are going to need to be made to run the final gauntlet and reach the ending of this expansive and mystifying odyssey through a unique take on the dystopia genre. 

I don't want to say too much about the game, as its best to go in blind (although there is an issue with this in that the tutorial is godawful, Ill expand on this later), but the gist is that you are the new manager of an underground megacorp who extracts energy by sending in employees to interact with a variety of monsters, most of which fit into the ""new weird"" classification rather than your frankensteins and draculas of old. This is purely a management game, which is not a genre I am well versed in at all, but despite this I found myself falling into the groove of things fairly easily. Most of your time will be spent trying to mitigate complete disaster, usually at the cost of your miserable employees lives, who only put up with the grueling task of being thrown into rooms with nightmare machines  because its somehow even worse on the surface.. This might sound stressful, and in a way it is, but whats compelling is learning more about the monsters themselves, as the more you learn, the easier they become to manage, and each monster also provides unique armor and weapons to give to your employees if you work with them enough (there's also upwards of 80 of them)

Despite being fresh and unique down to its bones, I do not consider Lobotomy Corp to be a timeless game. The hope is that someone will one day take the ideas in this game and present it in a format that both respects the players time and has a better player onboarding process. THAT game would be timeless. My 175 hours of playtime spanned the course of 3 years, which included completely walking away from the game several times over. By the end of my final run, getting 100% and seeing the epilogue, I felt satisfied, emotional, and wanting to see more of this world. But every time I think of that number, 175 hours, I think about how the bulk of that time was spent grinding my employees, resetting the week; resetting the entire game, and I cant help but feel that there is a way to deliver the meat of what makes this game special in less than half of the time it currently demands.

I'd like to add here that not all people will take this long to beat the game, but I trudged through without the use of guides or wikis, and I honestly believe that's the best way to compliment the games mechanics. Going into every day having to manage  a new monster you know nothing about, one that could potentially throw your ever growing ecosystem of monsters into a cascading nightmare of violence and horror, is at the core of ""Facing the Fear"" so to speak. The highs are extremely high in this game, and its slow and creeping dread cultivates some of the most organic ""Holy s***, oh god no"" moments I've ever seen in the medium. 

The other issue (that unfortunately this game's also fantastic sequel suffers from) is its absolutely abysmal learning curve right out the gate. ""Just read the damn Manual!"" withstanding,  a bunch of still shot images hamfistedly explaining the myriad of this games systems is worsened by using an esoteric vocabulary for pretty much everything. Within the first 10 minutes, mechanics with monikers such as E.G.O, Enkaphlanktyn, Quiploth Counter and P.E boxes are thrown at you as if you are already extremely well versed in Jewish Mysticism. I imagine more than 70% of the people willing to try this game will be put off by how overwhelming this all is. Combine that with the fact that its best to look up as little as possible to truly immerse yourself in the game's mystery, and you've got yourself a deadly dichotomy, at least as far as player retention goes.

This issue comes back to that phrase I used earlier, ""jank"". There's more than a handful of places where the mechanical flow and quality of life of this game could be greatly improved upon. Even down to just naming conventions, for example, the 4 employee stats are named Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice, which are all improved by doing the equivalent work types on monsters: Instinct, Insight, Attachment, and Repression.  There's no reason for these stats and works to have different names besides flavor. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about going to flavor town, but not when it comes at the cost of unnecessary obfuscation. Some things also just straight out aren't explained, and I didn't even find out until over 100 hours in that you could highlight an employee and then right click on a monster to send just that employee to go work on it despite that employee not being in the same department. Its also never explained that the more damage from a monsters matching attack type the more you will gain exp of that specific stat. 

In the end it comes down to what you're willing to put up with for the payoff. This game is HARD, and attempts to put you in the fetal position every chance it gets. There's a few things you can do to help iron out the kinks, such as the ""more information mod"", which gives you actual percentage values for everything in the game instead of  generalized phrases suggesting your work chance success. And while I didn't use it myself (and now wish I had) there's a mod that increases your chance of getting ego gifts (unique cosmetic perks given at extremely low odds, like 1%), which I think would balance out the games absolutely brutal difficulty for a lot of people. 

This game will probably always be niche, all of Project Moons games might be unless they figure out how to teach their players their games. But if you can trudge through it all and take the time to learn the game inside and out, upon reaching the end you'll look back upon one of the most unique and memorable experiences the medium currently offers. 

Its a weird position for me to be in, because on paper I would never just recommend this game to anyone casually. But if you're the kind of person willing to make the dive, face the fear, and build the future, then definitely try it out. I think you'll know in the first 2 hours if its something you'll enjoy.",1632980653,1632980941,True,62,2,0.840763390064239502,1,True,False,False

Interesting SCP Foundation management game that will absolutely kick you in the nads with difficulty, especially once you get towards the end. The game fully expects you to fail, carry knowledge on, and even reset the whole thing back to a checkpoint or even Day 1 with the new knowledge.

""Start from Day 1"" is a NewGame+ which will maintain (almost) all the research you've gained, any equipment, and even any upgrades and unlocks you've gained in previous runs. Failure is almost a guarantee and it will take some getting used to

I wrote the Jeff Bezos joke 164 hours ago, just when I was starting Lobotomy Corp. After finally finishing the game and thinking about the experience, I feel the best way to describe Lobotomy Corp is a ""blood diamond."" 

Overall, I disliked most of the time I spent playing the game.

The game itself isn't very fun, it's a very micro-managing heavy game with not a lot of options to actually make the game entertaining; you unlock some options thought the game, but most of them are options that you should've had from the very start. 

The difficulty ramps up constantly, and the random anomalies make your choice almost worthless since when you first start the game you won't know the monster that gives you a nice HP boost from the one that fucks everyone and everything up, and you have no way to appease it because you need an Aleph(highest level) armor to even TRY to without your employee ripping his eyes out. So yeah, go back to your last checkpoint- Oh, that was today? Too bad, don't pick a fucking Aleph next time dipshit.

As I said, there's a lot of blood covering up this diamond. But underneath all this gunk, the diamond shines like a sun.

The story is captivating and is the main reason you're going to want to finish the day, for those sweet, sweet 30 seconds of juicy L O R E. Every new concept that is introduced is more interesting and intriguing than the last, some revelations can sound very abstract at first, but as the story goes on they become more concrete. The characters are also a huge highlight as they are all an absolute delight, even minor ones that don't show up very often(looking at you Myo). The world Project Moon has created is fascinating, and it's no wonder the sequel takes place in this same derelict wonderland.

Which makes it even more tragic that the game that accompanies this world is not as grand. At the end of the day I wholeheartedly recommend Lobotomy Corp, but only up to day 45(do the core supressions if you want) or hell, until you get tired of it; then go watch all the endings in Youtube. With Lobotomy Corp I feel I experienced a 12 hour game in 170 hours. I'm glad I played it though",1627073527,1631332600,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

No one has yet seemed to figure out that combining this with RPG mechanics means no one will be stupid enough to choose to lose their upgraded agents when the quickload button is right there.

The unfun lethality is further exacerbated by the fact that your initial interactions with all anomalies will be ENTIRELY a random gamble since there won't even be HINTS about what's effective or what makes them kill people. So every time you fire up a day, the first thing you'll probably do is bounce everyone off the new anomaly until they die, to unlock some info about it. Then reload the day and use the OOC knowledge from the day before to perfectly exploit said anomaly.

On top of that, the UI is kind of a cluttered mess, and some extremely basic shit, like being able to see your agents' health bars or accelerating time, are unlocked abilities. I have no idea what that's supposed to contribute to the game except annoying me, the player.

I would possibly also be more invested if the between-missions writing wasn't... I don't think I can even call it bad, it's just really generic, motivates me not at all.

The writing for the individual anomalies is nice, though, generally the art works well, and the soundtrack is really atmospheric.

First off, let me prefice this by saying I hate horror games. And my biggest fear was that this was, in fact, a horror game. So I told myself that, after seeing some videos, to give it a try but if it played the jumpscare deal, I would refund it. End result??? Look at the amount of time played.

I love the game, and I hear allot of talk about how the game is comparible to SCP Containment Breach, but I never played that. But the premise is as follows:  You are the new manager in Lobotomy Corp, and you job is to manage your employees and collect positive energy from monster, creatures and other abnormalities. But these abnormalities can kill your employees, and hell, even escape and murder a whole department.

Now, this game is build on the idea of save-scumming. Allot of people dont like that, but to me,every abnormality is a new puzzle to solve. Plus, the backstories on some of these abnormalities is absolutely fantastic. As a bit of a hobby writer myself, I love the amount of detail some of these stories have, and its a big reason I have been playing this game for so long.

All in all, this game isn't easy. But the challenge, the stories and the main storyline is what keeps me coming back. Especially now that the bad translation is fixed. Its worth every cent!!",1542918176,1630581599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fans of thinking about the moral implications of authority, technology, and servitude (as well as people that like SCP) need look no farther.

DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIAL.  The tutorial has three parts before referring you to an ""optional but highly recommended manual"".  DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT READING THE MANUAL.  It will probably take you about half an hour to work through the tutorials and manuals, but if you are anything like me you will burn out long before you learn the game through osmosis otherwise.  If you get to the point where you understand how to manage the gameplay, this game has magical things to show you.

EDITED AFTER I FINISHED THE GAME:

A hundred hours later, I still love this game.   I'd never played a management game before, but I enjoyed myself and eagerly await the upcoming sequels.

That said, the gameplay in particular has some imperfections that lead to tedium and unnecessary player punishment (days take a long time to complete even at 2x speed, and starting from day 1 [which you'll do at least once to finish the game] takes away all of your employees you've spent literal days training).  FREE MODS FIX THESE PROBLEMS.  They don't even have to make the game easier or harm the vanilla experience.  Take a look at the popular ones and give this amazing game a go.

Aesthetic and story wise I absolutely love the game but everything else about the game is incredibly taxing to do. If you are a perfectionist like me you will have to restart every day several times to have the perfect outcome you want. 

The game even though is great is concept really lacks mechanics wise, so many things you should be able to easily do is provided to you in extremely runabout ways, for example your employees are subjugating an anomaly, they will just stand inside one another with no way of being able to see their health or sanity so you cannot pull them back, the only way to do this is to click on an anomaly and open up a sub menu that can only display around 5 employee's status at once, if you have employees from different departments fighting one anomaly you will constantly need to pause the game scroll in the sub menu to different departments and view their stats individually. This game could be so much more but feels very unpolished due to inconveniences like this that make the gameplay extremely taxing to do, at middle stages of the game depending on your luck the game turns into a micro management simulation that will absolutely suck the fun out of it.

The game is so simple but barely provides you the tools to deal with most of the inconveniences that should be fixed in a single click. Due to the unpolished gameplay that you can't really even fix with mods I cannot recommend you this game, it is very taxing and depleting to play and essentially turns into a ""Monitor X anomaly every Y second to make sure they don't do Z.""",1630324051,1630324051,False,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

If you're still reading, then what's in store for you is to have your legs blown off over and over by threats you cannot foresee, cannot avoid, and very probably, will force you to reset your runs at the drop of a hat.  And it is by design.

That is, unless you cheat.  You can look up the Abnormalities (monsters) on the Wiki page, revealing all of their information with zero in-game effort.  Then, you can save scum to restart the current day, apply the perfect solution to beat them, and carry on unimpeded.  You can walk through the minefield without a scratch.  No skill, no talent, just blithely applying someone else's information in order to win.

This approach removes all of the frustration, but it also removes all of the fun.  If you know all the solutions without having to work for them, then why are you even playing in the first place?  What fun is a game about mysterious monsters, when the monsters are no longer mysterious?  By design, the game is equal parts maddening frustration and captivating horror.  If you remove the frustration, the horror stops being captivating.  You either swallow the pill whole, or not at all.

10 hours in, and this reality has finally sunk in for me.  I've been liberally reloading and reading Wiki pages so far, and I'm breezing through the game.  Until I hit the Singing Machine.  Even armed with the Wiki page, it kept killing my guys over and over.  I kept reloading and re-reading.  I thought the game was bugged at first, until I realized I was reading the rules wrong, and figured out how to overcome it.  I had one - ONE - dude in my entire base who could beat this thing, and even then, it would've been a coin flip's chance of success when his turn came.

Had I been playing truly blind, the Singing Machine would have ended my run.  Honestly it probably would have ended my next one too, that's how arcane its ruleset is.  It would have gobbled up all 15 of my dudes, no explanation, no apology, no remorse, and spit me out without any idea what had happened.

But that experience *IS* the game.  It's the whole point.  Being unfairly roflstomped by sentient woodchippers is the game.  Losing is the point.  If that doesn't appeal to you, then don't play this.

Anyways despite my own advice, I'm going to keep trying.  And no more cheating.  If it turns out to be fun, I'll change my review to reflect that.  If it makes me want to lobotomize myself with a spork, I'll reflect that too.  

For now though, I would not recommend this to anyone except people with infinite patience.

(EDIT: I put 20 more hours into the game, thoughts below)

I love the style, art, and theme of the game, but even after tripling my time played, I am even more convinced now that I would not recommend it to my friends.  That being said though, I can absolutely see how this game would appeal to a certain type of person.  I'm just not that type.

My biggest beef with Lobotomy Corporation is that it's a game that's based on knowledge, and not on skill.  You can't infer the stats or approach of a new abnormality based on past work with other creatures.

I quit at 30 hours, because the thought of putting in another 50, 100, 150 hours or whatever of stabbing in the dark and resetting days over and over after repeated failures didn't seem fun.

[b]Pros - SUFFERING[/b]
[b]The concept itself is really neat.[/b] 
Several of the anomalies have unique gameplay gimmicks, and every anomaly is also accompanied by a cool information page with their own artwork, their stats, special abilities and effects they have, and a story and threat level classification akin to an SCP page. Not all of them are random either and seldom have something that ties into the bigger story and setting of the game. The setting itself is a bit non-standard. On the other hand the story doesn't really focus on the anomalies themselves that much, more on the people working there, which might or might not be to your liking depending on how much you enjoy watching overpowered anime-people duke it out.

[b]The music is great.[/b] 
Hot damn the music is good. It’s a shame most of the game you only get to hear the basic management track, as the game has many real bangers, especially all the alert and the boss fight tracks.

[b]Cons - SUFFERING[/b]
[b]Positive feedback loop on steroids, which clashes with the narrative.[/b] 
The story constantly goes out of its way to show how every employee is supposedly expendable to the point characters simply decide to not even bother remembering their coworkers due to absurd casualty rates. However, gameplay wise it’s the exact opposite: employees aren't expendable, because the game requires you to have max level super-units with the best gear available to deal with high rank anomalies. This doesn’t simply mean “the newbies are less effective” and that you could substitute quality with quantity, it means they will instantly die if they work on an anomaly that’s out of their league, and if you have no units that are able to work with your current line-up the game’s pretty much over. 

This extends to combat as well, because un-upgraded units will instantly splat or soil themselves in fear and can’t use high level gear. To make matters worse, death not only means you lose units, all the gear they were carrying (until a VERY late-game upgrade) and RNG-traits, the game penalizes you even further by reducing post-mission LOB reward – resource required for hiring and upgrading units – making your new units even weaker and prone to dying, perpetuating the cycle. Which doesn’t even make sense plot wise because [spoiler]one of the later revelations is that the anomalies release MORE energy if they kill humans[/spoiler], which is your goal throughout the entire game. This is the one part where the game had an actual story reason to throw the player a bone, but no.

[b]You know what’s better than a positive feedback loop? Positive feedback loop with the most trial-and-error gameplay in the entire medium.[/b]
Stat too low when working on an anomaly? Insta-gib. Stat too high? Insta-gib. Your unit got a trait which disallows them from certain work types or working on other anomalies? Insta-gib. Worked on the same anomaly too often? Gib. Working on an anomaly deals one of the four possible damage types which the unit has no defenses against? Gib. Escaped anomaly or boss fight has a surprise AoE attack with one second wind-up that gibs your entire crew unless you manually order your units out of the way? Gib. An anomaly that spawns in random area when it escapes and attacks the entire facility every few seconds without any safe spots, with damage numbers that instantly make all but the best agents die on first shot? Gib-gib-gib. 

There's no way to know any of these rules before you [i]successfully[/i] research and fight an anomaly multiple times. This isn’t like XCOM, Invisible Inc. or many other roguelites / permadeath games that do often throw curveballs for players to manage. “Manage” being the keyword, as in you can figure out a counter through skillful play or ample preparation. Lobotomy Corp’s most used curveball is an insta-gib with no recovery other than save-scumming. These kind of brutal surprise mechanics in themselves would be fully congruent with the themes of the game and the supposed expendability of your crew – not to mention you get to hear the great alert tracks when things start going bottoms up – but combined with the aforementioned extreme positive feedback loop it means there’s no way you aren’t going to be constantly save-scumming to hell and back.

[b]You know what’s also fun in management sims? Functionally horrid UI? Shoddy controls? Combat that requires precision perfect positioning? How about all of them at once?[/b]
Units standing in the same spot have their sprites and HP bars cover each other and there's no quick way to find out their current status at a glance – a simple list with filters and “jump camera to unit” command would’ve been enough, or having the overlapping units’ HP bars stack on top of each other. There’s no control groups either, no order queuing and worst of all, units automatically unselect after you give them any order. 

This is especially bad if you send your units to fight enemies with attacks that affect the entire room, or when you get one of the events that spawn enemies in all parts of your base and requires you to spread out. It’s a visual clusterchuck that requires precise micro-management. The way you issue move commands is also not ideal since you can only designate rooms and not the exact spot where you want units to stand, which is paramount of importance when some late game threats unleash the aforementioned 1-hit kill AoE attacks that require your units to be out of way when it happens.

[b]Several bosses and threats end up turning into silly elevator shaft-pause boogaloos.[/b]
To elaborate, some enemies either only spawn in hallways and deal humongous damage or instagib your units if you’re trying to fight them from the front, or they have a massive AoE with a second or two of wind-up that hits your *entire base* horizontally at the boss’ current floor and kills all but the highest level and best equipped agents in one shot. The solution? Get everyone into an elevator and only fight near them so you can instantly teleport to another floor when the inevitable death wave hits.

[b]Few bugs.[/b]
I had one particularly infuriating one where after several retries and finally achieving two difficult side quests, one low tier anomaly's status effect couldn't be removed as it usually should ([spoiler]Void Dream’s sleep attack which you can remove by clicking on units[/spoiler]), resulting the game considering half my crew dead by the end of the day. To the retry screen it is.

[b]Iffy soundtrack placement.[/b]
Like I mentioned, the game has some real bangers and plenty of tracks, but most of them are used only for story scenes that last a minute or so, or boss fights that get not one, but several tracks. However, well over 90% of the playtime you’re going to be hearing the one exact same “everything is running smooth” track through actual gameplay assuming you’re doing well. They could’ve spiced it up a bit and have the later days have new tracks play during regular management, both to make the soundtrack less repetitive and to signify the increasing complexity you get with juggling lots of dangerous anomalies at once. A real missed opportunity.

[b]The game gets a tad bit grindy, especially on subsequent playthroughs.[/b] 
Especially if you’ve already fully researched your current line-up of abnos and just need to generate enough energy for day completion, all the while having fully memorized how all your abnos respond to different work types and other hijinks that require micro-management. When Lobotomy Corporation isn’t an infuriating save-scum fest it’s instead a numbing busywork galore.",1628946289,1628947418,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This does not mean it is a bad game and that is why despise me disliking the game personally, I still recommend it.

For those looking for an SCP style game, this isn't it. It comes close, though. Allow me to explain a bit.

You start off as a manager of Lobotomy Corporation; a company trying to solve the world's energy crisis by utilizing abnormalities. In order to collect energy, you must study the abnormalities, collect information, personalize each one's containment cell, and so on. You collect abnormalities by selecting from 3 unknown (boxes? Look like movie projectors but I'll keep going) each one with a clue or a quote to hint towards the abnormalities nature. 

I personally dislike picking from a set of boxes and would prefer to actually try to contain the abnormalities firsthand, but this is a minor gripe and nothing not easily overlooked. Besides; it must not be your department to try to contain them but another department entirely. 

And then that brings up the biggest issue, one that started small but slowly grew; you are a company first. Containment is merely the byproduct of needing the energy from the abnormalities. Enforcing quotas over study and research and so on. This slowly irked me until I could no longer enjoy the game itself as the company aspect and feel grew only stronger from there. 

If you want to play a soulless company that happens to study abnormalities, contain them, but whose primary focus is draining them of all their juice, this game will be for you and worth the price. 

One note I will add here is that you don't get to decide how your base is laid out. I feel like this was a massive wasted opportunity as deciding where rooms are, what corridors go where, and so on would play a wonderful strategic role when focusing on containment and defense against breaches and other Groups of Interest.

<Excerpt from Audio Record>
""Randy: It's a shame that we have to send such a capable employee like you to its Containment Unit. Do you have any last words before proceeding? Of course, when I say last words, it’s just a precautionary thing.

(CENSORED): It can't be helped. I'm the employee with the highest resistance against cognitive breakdown. I’ve been apathetic towards everything since I was a kid. People often said I lacked empathy and wasn’t normal. However, when I got to work here, my abnormal ability became the key to save everyone. This is something that can never be experienced anywhere else.

Randy: Let me say this again. While it is true that you have the highest resistance among employees, that's only based on human standards. If you begin to suffer from a surge of intrusive thoughts, or you decide to count down from ten but fail to remember what ten even is, or feel an uncontrollable regurgitation of vomit or saliva, or if this place starts to feel like somewhere else other than the company, or you suddenly feel insignificant and think that suffocating is your only hope… you need to leave the Containment Unit immediately.

(CENSORED): If you tell me that one more time, that'll make it thirteen times you've said that now.

Randy: We cannot monitor you in real time. All cameras are off, and your audio record will only be updated after the work is finished. Needless to say, I'm worried about you. Why don't you repeat the instructions I gave you a bit ago?

(CENSORED): Go in, don't do the work myself, accompany employee (CENSORED) and observe the work progress. And record everything that happens; even if (CENSORED) is in danger, do not attempt to rescue unless ordered otherwise. Right?

Randy: Exactly. Now, our contact will be cut off in ten seconds. Good luck and godspeed to your record.

(CENSORED): I have no regrets. I’d say I’m pretty lucky compared to the others; at the very least I get to leave my last voice record. Well, I say “last” only as a precaution but…

Randy: All right, your record will be eternally archived and all our fellow employees will remember you. 3... 2... 1... End audio receiving.

[b]Full Review[/b]

Lobotomy Corporation is a monster management game where you manage creatures called Abnormalities in a very SCP like fashion. You play as a manager overseeing Abnormalities by assigning your employees to work on the Abnormalities. Each of the Abnormalities has its own set of rules to determine how to best deal with it. These rules are hidden at first, so you must do a little experimentation before you can unlock them.

Each day that you complete a level, you have to pick one of three Abnormalities that are offered. As you progress more, the threat level for Abnormalities that you encounter will increase. You will also discover that not only you have to manage these Abnormalities on their own, some of them can also interact with other Abnormality. This is what I will call a ""combo"". Some combos can be helpful to you, but a lot of them are really deadly. This is where most of the difficulty comes in. 

As I mentioned earlier, the game can be really brutal and if you find yourself stuck on a day or level because you can't manage these Abnormalities, it will be better to use a feature called ""Memory Repository"" to go back in time. It will allow you to repick Abnormalities. Worst case scenario, you will have to reset to day 1, but don't worry as you will keep your Abnormalities informations and equipments. You will also find yourself progress the day a lot more quicker than before. The negative is the game can become a bit repetitive after a while, especially after you unlocked a lot of the informations and equipments, but the game will throw surprises at you and it was enough to keep me interested.

As for the story, I personally really like it. Without spoiling anything, the story takes place in a cyberpunk dystopian setting with a lot of fantasy elements thrown in, which I don't see that many of. It is presented in a style that is similar to a visual novel. This game also has a sequel called ""Library of Ruina"", so if you are interested in the story and world of Lobotomy Corporation, you might want to check that game out as well.",1627707025,1627708309,True,60,3,0.832904279232025146,0,True,False,False

Lobotomy Corporation is a ruthless, gruesome, yet cutesy SCP-inspired roguelite. Similar artstyle to that of the mobile Fallout Shelter game with a hint of anime. Your goal is to manage and generate power by working on ""abnormalities"" in your expanding facility. Abnormalities are essentially creatures/objects that all behave differently. They require you to figure out how to handle them effectively yourself by unlocking information on it, this is done by completing work with them usually with trial and error. The game progressively gets more interesting and difficult when you're managing more complicated and dangerous abnormalities that can escape or cause absolute chaos in your facility.

Lobotomy Corporation is a fun and casual experience until late game, where the difficulty spikes up drastically. Late game you will run into some story-based objectives that feel borderline impossible at the start. This is when you realize where the rogue-lite aspect comes in, the game expects you to restart. Essentially a New Game+ where you keep things from your previous playthrough, to get more knowledge, more skill, and better equipment and unlocks to help you progress and beat the game. This adds a lot of replay value and since each playthrough you will be dealing with different abnormalities, it will keep the gameplay fresh.

The artstyle and soundtrack is very well made, even if at times it feels unpolished. The story is not terrible, it doesn't particularly grasp me personally but it's a nice touch to the game and adds some depth into the experience.

As far as complaints go with the game, the game can become annoying and unfair at times. I've gotten to a point I expect the worst possible scenario when I jump into new content in the game, because Lobotomy Corporation actually has zero chill and is willing to make your experience frustrating and ruthlessly difficult. This isn't a bad thing, but it can get very stressful and time consuming just to make progress. My second complaint is combat can occasionally get annoying when you want to manage multiple agents that are stacked on top of eachother, being unable to see their HP/SP bars without checking the suppression interface or knowing who has the shield you just gave.  My last complaint is the game does have some bugs, that will make you have to restart the day that you spent an hour on. As one can imagine that is very frustrating, but since I enjoy the game so much I still continue it anyway. The bugs are also not frequent enough to be a dealbreaker or gamebreaking, but they do appear occasionally and depending the scenario it can be extremely annoying.

TLDR; this game is fantastic and I highly recommend this game if you enjoy management games and/or if you like games that are willing to be gruesome and make you want to tear your hair out.

Essentially, you keep monsters in cages and send your ""agents"" to interact with them which produces energy for your company. Your agents take damage from this so you need to make sure you don't overload them or they can die very quickly. Each monster has their own likes and dislikes (e.g. one monster may dislike when you visit any monster other than him) and if you annoy them too much they will break out of their cage and start killing everyone. The point of the game is to manage the preferences of all of the monsters in your lab so they don't go crazy, while harvesting as much energy from them as possible. Then they also add in some random events where you get attacked by hordes of enemies.

[*] While the game is actually fairly straight-forward, it took me several hours to figure out the basic mechanics. Everything is described in a really confusing, convoluted way so it's hard to understand even the basic concepts. 

[*] Once I figured out how to play, I quickly realised that it still wasn't fun. A lot of the difficulty comes from the fact that you know literally nothing about a monster until you have spent a decent amount of time interacting with it (at which point the game simply tells you the monster's preferences). So you can very easily annoy the monster and end up with loads of dead agents without having a clue what you're doing wrong. You can try to figure it out via trial and error, but there is a fair amount of RNG (i.e. a behaviour MIGHT annoy the monster) which makes it very hard to track the consequences of your actions. Even when you know a lot about the monsters, you can still piss off a monster through simple RNG, or even get a set of monsters in your lab with conflicting preferences that make it virtually impossible to keep them all happy. Additionally even if you have ""unlocked"" the preferences of a monster, it seems that you can only view them in the menu in between games, so you're forced to literally memorise them.

[*] The difficulty is very unfair. As mentioned above, keeping monsters happy can be very difficult and any failure at all basically means you need to restart. If a monster gets upset and escapes their cage, everyone is going to die. An agent dies while working with a monster, you lose all your stats invested into them and any equipment they were wearing, might as well restart. Agent goes insane and starts killing other agents, restart. In a tough spot and a horde of enemies randomly spawns? You guessed it.

[*] The translation is not great. Apparently it was updated recently but I still found it to be quite off-putting. It's written in proper English but the dialogue still feels unnatural and it's hard to tell what emotion a character is supposed to be feeling when they're talking. The game tries to be quite philosophical which makes it even more important to understand the nuances of what is going on. This is also a big contributor to why it's so hard to understand how to play the game. 

[*] When I started the game I had a big game-breaking error where none of the text appeared properly and I couldn't start the game. It took me 30~ minutes to figure out how to fix it.

The gameplay might be frustrating or the design isn't fully coherent, but underneath all that grime and rough shell is an experience that is interesting, unique, or fascinating unto itself. I haven't played something like this in a while, but after almost reaching the end of [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i], I can firmly state it belongs in this category. 

The basic gameplay structure of [i]Lobotomy Corporation[/i] is simple. It's a management/RTS hybrid where you control a series of little doll-workers called ""agents"" in a massive underground laboratory. What's being researched here? All manner of eldritch abominations, godless horrors, screaming masses of flesh, and the odd ""what if this fairy tale was fucked up"" creature here and there, all collected under the umbrella term ""abnormality"". After selecting an abnormality for the day, you take your agents and select one of four ""works"" to perform on the abnormalities, such as Instinct work to feed them or Insight work to learn how they work, which produce ""E-Boxes"" that fill a daily quota that rises slowly with each new day. Once enough E-Boxes have been collected, the day ends, and you're granted a score that allows you to hire new employees or improve the stats of older ones. Following this, you're allowed to expand the departments where the abnormalities are kept and given research tasks by the A.I's who manage them to help gain an edge, and the next day begins.

However, working with the beasts and ghouls that are imprisoned within the facility is far from easy- If the monsters aren't trying to break free from their bondage, then they're doing some kind of horrible other thing to your workers. Each abnormality is completely unique in their containment measures, and much of the learning process of the game is figuring out how to keep each critter under lockdown lest they bust out. These containment procedures can be anything from ""don't do this specific type of work"" to ""don't work on this abnormality if you have an Agent Level lower than V"" to ""working with this abnormality after working with this specific other abnormality will cause the former to breach"", which makes each terror wonderfully unique and memorable. As you work on abnormalities more and more, you unlock greater details of their containment, from their true name, their disposition towards certain kinds of work, to hints on how to keep them contained. Even better, once you fill out the managerial guide for taking care of an abnormality, you can cash in the points you earn from working with them to craft E.G.O. armor sets and weapons, or receive powerful stat-boosting gifts. These look bad-ass, plain and simple, and it feels excellent to finally master an abnormality long enough to make a devastating new weapon or effective suit for your agents to wear. Watching your employee force go from barely-equipped bozos who can't even handle a single attack robot to a mob of freaks ripping apart anything that moves feels awesome and rewarding. The loop of getting a new abnormality, mastering its containment, and then reaping the rewards of keeping it in your facility feels very rewarding, though it does become very tedious after a while. 

You might be wondering, ""if the entire game is about learning how to manage the abnormalities, what happens when you learn how each one works""? The answer is that the game becomes rote and tiresome as you go through the motions of assigning work and watching a bar fill up with little in the way of stimulation. There's little risk for each abno breaking out if you're diligent with your work, which makes for a management experience that is pretty darn tedious. Combat fares no better- While your agents can fight against the escaping abnormalities and the occasional invading force, the microgame of controlling your units mostly consists of left-click dragging your entire force, right clicking on an enemy, and waiting until their HP drops to zero. If the enemy is particularly dangerous, then you have to learn to highlight said allied force, click a room away to force your guys to move out of the way while the enemy attacks, and then left click them all again and move them back into place. It's like playing [i]Dark Souls[/i] in the form of an RTS, and it sucks. Even worse are the lack of assisting features. There's no way to select your troops and create groups (which would be VERY USEFUL since MANY difficult lategame encounters involve splitting up your attacking force into different damage types), no way to automate the work process with each abnormality, and nothing to do but watch your employees hit stuff until it dies while ordering them out of the way if things get spicy. Combat thus becomes more tedious than fun, which means the management and the combat aspects of the gameplay are both pretty boring. Combine this with a game design that emphasises grinding for hours on end and a difficulty scale that could be charitably called ""schizophrenic"", and you have a recipe for a game that loses its luster very quickly. The sheer tediousness with which the basic gameplay of LobCorp conducts itself is a major turnoff for me, and makes it hard to play the game for long period of time when meaningful progress is my objective for the day. 

Speaking of difficulty, lets get back to that subject. LobCorp is hard. Like, ""a high-tier abnormality breached? Restart the day"" tier hard. I have no problem with a game being tough, but I do have a problem with how often LobCorp sets up undoing progress as a means to punish failure. There's nothing quite as soul-suckingly frustrating as completing a day, only for a single high-tier abnormality to breach and either wipe out half your facility trying to contain it or force you to sacrifice a huge chunk of your upgrade points in order to suppress it. A single mistake is often all it takes to either instantly end your day with a restart, which can be very disheartening when days last thirty minutes or more, and this problem is exacerbated when trying to learn how the abnormalities work. While the game is built with restarting from day one in mind (as you keep your E.G.O. and abnormality logs, and can thus avoid ones you don't want for your current facility), it is no less frustrating to go all the way back to day one after putting so much effort into making it further than you did before.

Tedious gameplay, a grindy design and all over the place difficulty that uses the erasure of progress as a means of punishing failure are the signs of an game that lacks polish. LobCorp is truly jank, but underneath that jank is an experience that is fascinating and engaging. Learning about abnormalities and then mastering their containment always feels great, while learning about the world and the story of the facility and the damned souls who run it make for a story that is nothing short of enthralling. I haven't even spoken about how the game integrates story elements into the gameplay, which are so absolutely genius that I cannot even speak about them here for fear of ruining their impact in-game. 

I've chosen to be very upfront with LobCorp's problems in this review because I feel that anyone who wants to get into this game should know about them, but I think it speaks volumes for how compelling the good elements of LobCorp are that I've sunken more than fourty hours into the damn thing despite my eminent bitching. Even with all it does wrong, you can just tell that this game was the work of a team that really wanted to make something [i]interesting[/i] despite their lack of game design skill, which shines through in the compelling elements it succeeds in.

Just one word of advice - get yourself Cheat Engine and speedhack this game. If you want to play it safely, it's not uncommon for a day to last around an hour. Speedhacking can make it more bearable if, like me, you don't have that much free time to play games.

If you are here because of Library of Ruina and played it before, imo skip it since the ending will be less of a twist. But if you want to try it out anyway, enjoy of the many torments you will suffer here.

It is a management sim that has horror and rougelike mix in together. Surprisingly, it works out just fine. 
It is one of those games where death is a common thing to expect so having a 0 death run is pretty much impossible on your first run without having to google who does what. So pray that your favorite employee comes out alive.

The best way to experience this game is to go 100% blind imo but there are certain abnormalities that can literally can end your run depending if you have the gear if for whatever reason if it escapes. Google will be your best friend. sure it will might ruin the surprise, but it will also save many head aces and potential run ender. Just remember to not chicken out and pick only the easy ones since they are usually tie to gear rank (i.e the harder they are, the better gear they will drop)

The story is okay and the casts are pretty good. Each being unique to their roles and how they view of their job, their co-workers, and their employees. It isn't amazing as LoR but it is decent.

The game does suffer frame issue in the late game unless you have some godlike processor because of how many things are on the screen at ones and movement may be clunky at times and could cause your group to get killed because of how targeting works.

Combat system can be hard and confusing at first but they are easy to understand and to master ones you get the hang of it.

But overall it is a great game and it will make you feel like you are the SCP director of the site. If you enjoy the story of LC and want more, then Library of Ruina will add more story into it.",1626511032,1626511766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Summary: you play as a manager of a laboratory facility that study monster. Initially you won't know anything about the monster that you gain each day; however, as you order your workers/employees/minions (whatever you wanna call it) to work with the monster, you gain resource to unlock knowledge about that monster. As the day goes on, the monster you unlock became harder to manage with the capabilities to wreck havoc on your facilities as well as killing your employees.

Pro:
     Simulation
     Hard
     Great Soundtrack
     Infinite Retry on day
     Interesting game mechanics for each monster and events
           Strategies?
     Employees gain exp and stat for working with monster, making it rewarding for you to keep them alive
     Mysteries... and mysteries
Con:
    Hard
    Require constant attentions on higher days
    Lack of resources usage once you unlock everything about that monster.

Thankfully, the game ended up being pretty good, and Project Moon is now one of my favorite developers, period, though I admit this has more to do with Library of Ruina, their recent release and direct chronological sequel to Lobotomy Corporation. But we're here to talk about Lobotomy Corporation, so let's do that for now.

Lobotomy Corporation describes itself as an SCP sim, and while that isn't a bad or unhelpful description, I think if you go into this game exclusively expecting SCP, you might end up a bit disappointed. Monsters ultimately are very simple (for the best), with all of them being able to be worked in one of four ways, Instinct, Insight, Attachment and Repression, with additional conditions being used to make them more or less difficult to manage. 

They additionally have a Qliploth counter, which reduces as you mess up or, occasionally, succeed; some monsters are prone to breaking out and managing the breakout is a part of managing the monster. Some common examples of wrinkles are having certain stat thresholds (employees must be below/above 3 of a particular stat, for instance), or wanting the work success to be good, neutral, or bad specifically. Some monsters cause radial effects after some trigger is set off, some monsters just break out, some monsters heal people when you do a good job, some monsters aren't monsters at all and are rather static artifacts that generally won't bug you if you don't bug them.

However, if you think you can avoid combat forever, you are sorely mistaken. There are also Ordeals, which pop up after a certain number of monster interactions, which create sort've combat trials for your employees through the day, and serve as a soft timer to how long a day can run in early game, and as a challenge to be overcome in late game. Additionally, the game has ways of forcing interactions with certain monsters tied into this mechanic, meaning that for a while, every monster is a risk, even if you never intend to touch them.

Employees are also a mechanic, and, to keep it short, they have four stats corresponding with the work types, and gear which you synthesize from monster energy, which you get from working monsters. Gear has four elements, also roughly corresponding with the work types, and armor as a result has four resistances. This part, at least, should be fairly simple to understand. Combat takes place in an almost sort've 2D RTS style, with you shuffling your little nuggets around the facility to engage, and pulling them back if the thing you're fighting is about to do something nasty. You are going to do a lot of room to room dances.

If all that sounds like a lot to take in mechanically, it is. It is a difficult game, and you will absolutely lose employees to forgetting to do a certain thing, or act a certain way around a certain monster, and it's a part of the design. At some point, you're just going to have too many plates to spin and too many variables to consider, and you're going to slip. Eventually these slips will overcome you, and you'll have to reset the timeline. Literally. There's a mechanic in the game where you start from the beginning of your run, with all the information that you've gathered on monsters up to that point recorded, and all the gear you have. Except you're back at day one, the plot has reset, you have no monsters, and one employee.

You will have to do this a lot. I think I reset too much on my first run, but you will absolutely have to reset at least a handful of times, and you shouldn't burn yourself trying to avoid it, because due to the plot and requirements that show up later in the game, you will have to. Your eventual goal is to fully record every abnormality, and get to the final day, day 50. Without spoiling the plot, which is excellent, presented in a visual novel format, and unfortunately only mostly starts making any sense in the latter half of the game, the final five days is... brutal. You don't have enough context to understand why. If you get that far, you will, and that will become a part of the difficulty. I have to admit, nobody makes a challenge that makes me feel like I am completely and totally overwhelmed and incapable of beating something like Project Moon, and Lobotomy Corp is no exception. I can't say I didn't enjoy the ride, though!

TL;DR: Very mechanically dense game due to sheer variety of variables, a game where perfect runs are very difficult, a very difficult game in general, some employee management and very light RTS elements, mostly in micro/macro being helpful terms to describe how you maneuver your employees. Don't buy this game for the RTS elements, I stress it's mostly a terminology thing. 50 days, gets brutally difficult near the end, you will have to soft reset the game using an in game mechanic for the plot, if you don't like playing similar content repeatedly I'd skip this one, you'll be doing a lot of it. I enjoyed the plot, it worked for what it was trying to do, though it kicks in too late for it to be something I'd suggest as a primarily purchase decision.

If you want a sort've rough around the edges resource management game, you could do much worse, and you'll get a nice plot and some good monster design to go with it.",1625666978,1625668110,True,8,0,0.601502776145935059,0,True,False,False

STEP 2: Send in one of your best employees to work with the abnormality until they are blessed. You'll know it worked when it shows a short cutscene of that employee's name appearing on a clock.

It shines an amazing light into a role many forget exists; the one that has to make the big calls around the facility.

What it did good:
+ Fun sweet cartoonistic designs keep the game lighthearted while still having the disturbance of SCP natures.
+ The soundtrack, although fairly repetitive, is fitting throughout the game and is well handled.
+ Rogue-like elements that encourage the user to adapt as they go along, while also taking risks.
+ Customization of agents that [strike] causes you to reset 200 times so your look-alike lives [/strike]
+ A balanced sense of resource management with risks/deaths

What it could do better:
- Weapon choices felt fairly lack-luster, certain types had only few notable and some types had no player usability at all
- small Aleph pool, [spoiler] some even fake being other risk levels [/spoiler]
- As stated earlier, depending on playstyles music could get very repetitive
- [spoiler] unavoidable deaths because the plague doctor thinks the 12th guy needed drowned [/spoiler]

LobCorp initially pulls you in with the opportunity to explore and learn about its abnormalities, but this curiosity evolves into sort of a responsibility to carry out and see the finale of a staged play. The world building, lore and motifs in this game are great. The art style is appealing. Music fits the setting in-game. The gameplay doesn't require you to be a good multitasker or RTS savant. The game can be completed by memorising all your failures and learned countermeasures(you are expected to fail, a lot). 
The game is unpolished in some areas, such as, bad performance on the later days, clerks bugging out, sometimes employee E.G.O. visuals defaulting, the savefile can have corruptions and the art can be not-so-HD under a magnifying lens. But that is really it for the flaws. Difficulty in LobCorp is justified, simple as.

I'm a definite fan of how some abnormalities places that classic Lobot brutal spin on fairytales and just how great some of the other lore is in general, the way in which it doesn't fully explain how some of these things came to be retains a sense of mystery around them.

Later on in the game, it still is able to retain a stressful, yet somewhat calm atmosphere (at least until people start dying). I love the idea of ordeals and their different tiers. 

There are only a few issues I'd be able to highlight with the game: The first is a lack of easy modding support, it'd be great to see what the community could come up with through steam workshop if given the chance, (which could also lengthen the life of the game as a whole). The second is simply the lack of replayability, with 216 hours in the game, I've seen and suffered at the hands of all the game's anomalies and, I would love to see some more anomalies be added into the game at some point (though, this is likely just wishful thinking as I know the devs are preoccupied with other games).

1. Story is awesome
2. Amazing soundtrack
3. Beautiful game
4. Hard

Bads;
1. Hard. Sometimes the game can feel unfairly hard

1. The monsters in this game act like puzzles that you will have to bang your head against the wall to solve
2. The ""restart day"" button is not a last resort in this game and is more like a 2nd or 3rd in line response
3. Did I mention this game can be hard? And I'm not talking ""yeah it can be hard for some people"", the game has a set difficulty and the game takes itself seriously, and expects you to pull yourself up to its level. I personally don't mind the challenge, I think it makes every encounter you overcome worth more, but some people might not like the difficulty.

After its re-translation in 2020, the game is a near-perfect state, I've heard some people have memory leaks but I have never had a problem with this. The game also now has a sequel that expands on the story but not the gameplay.

If you're on the fence I'd recommend that you just go for it and give yourself a bit of a new experience and challenge. It's seriously a great game.",1589773461,1622239410,True,1,0,0.510703384876251221,0,True,False,False

+++++ A game that actually deserves it's age rating, it's dark, no it's quite frankly fucked up. But it's not trying to be edgy for the sake of it or doing it merely for shock value. There's a deep and dark story here that is well worth the hundred+ hours you'll need to see it through.
++++ Complex and Unique gameplay, if I were to give it a genre I'd call it ""Anxiety Management""
+++ A wonderful blend of gameplay and narrative, your actions are informing your perspective on the game. The game wants you to become heartless, to let that one employee die so you can progress. And are you going to restart and try that boss again just for that one easily replaceable employee? I hope so, you monster.
+++/--- This game is long, you've been warned. This is either a good or bad thing depending on what you want from a game. But this game uses a time rollback mechanic that encourages you to restart the day/week/whole playthrough while retaining everything you learnt like a modern roguelike. Getting the true ending requires multiple rollbacks. You can do it in one playthrough but only if you consistently rollback every week in order to get access to all the encyclopedia.
++ This game is brutal and it doesn't care about your feelings on the matter. It consistently defines your limitations and then like a good game should pushes the goalpost a little past them and out of your reach.

------- Game has a memory leak, playing for long periods of time will consume memory until your PC crashes. Check task manager occasionally to see when it breaches 4gb and restart the game to surpress it's urge to take over your entire computer.
------ In my game I only encountered one bug... But that bug was nasty, undoing the win I made against one of the games hardest bosses and killing all of my team and losing me their gear. This would have been bearable but it was on day 43 on my final run to the end.

Project moon has a great talent for incorporating story concepts seamlessly through gameplay and lobotomy corporation is an experience I would recommend to anyone who can face the fear.

Preamble aside Lobotomy Corporation is a management game of sorts, the basic gist is that you are managing the day to day of a lobotomy corporation facility and that involves telling people how to make monsters produce green energy while also having those monster handling people sometimes survive this process.  A large draw to this game is the cadence you get while one learning what each monster does and simultaneously improving your own detective work for future monsters  so that you can more quickly figure out how to efficiently make batteries of them.  This cadence lasts for most of the game and is later overtaken by various side challenges that drive the main plot of the game.  

Once you reach that mid game and you'll know it, the game will slowly but steadily ramp up the challenge and the pressure until it culminates in one of the most satisfying endgames I've ever experienced, maybe even the most satisfying.  If this sounds like a fun time to you, then I recommend this game wholeheartedly.

But I do understand this isn't a game everyone would enjoy, but anyone who would enjoy this game will really enjoy this game.   So I do recommend this game, but I'll give a warning: this game is not easy, this game is long(~100 hours and then some) and some of the abnormalities are tedious and stressful to work with, and there are many easy ways to ruin minutes of effort in a few mistaken seconds, but even so I found it worthwhile as it is and would change nothing about it.  

Also includes character customization so that you can grow attached to your employees before the game makes you choose between their lives and your convenience.  At the very least you can make sure your employee will look cute before they are killed/lobotomized/sent to at least three different forms of hell/converted to watts/change careers to go to the fishing industry/or worse.  Also soundtrack is top tier.

Lobotomy Corp is a SCP management sim. With a heavy focus on the management part. The objective is to work on various monstrosities to meet a daily energy quota, through 4 different ""works"" your agents preform on SCPs. Working unlocks SCP specific equipment(needed for survival and ""suppression"") and also the guidelines and weaknesses for dealing with said SCP. After a successful day you can replace fallen agents, level-up, and generally prepare for whatever is added on the next day. 

And that’s essentially it. The actual playing of the game is pretty straightforward. It’s mostly pausing, assigning agents work, and then speeding up until they’re either done or dead. With some supression hear and there. A real less is more approach to its mechanics. 

Most of the fun comes from managing various murderous and unusual quirks. And by managing, I mean actual management. Who can do what, when, where, and with what equipment. Sometimes it’s as simple as a being stat is too high or low (or both). But often its hoping that the Claire assigned to the giant fetus doesn’t make it cry, because that causes the Meat Lantern to escape and you have to find that one manually to suppress, with ranged red damage of course, but then River in Safety just dropped dead for something you probably did and also someone else put on the red shoes while you weren’t paying attention. You'll be restarting a lot in this game. It’s fun, frustrating, and a bit tedious. 

There are other things like ordeals (enemy invasions), meltdown levels (SCPs require immediate care), ""optional"" objectives, grinding works to level agents, and other stuff I didn’t get to. These too, are all part of the managerial puzzle. I find it vaguely exhausting and but couldn’t stop thinking about it. It's a lot to keep track of and it doesn’t get easier. 

The UI exacerbates this. Keeping track of everything means frequent pausing and scrolling. Selecting agents stacked on top of each other is annoying. Text is sometimes too small or too quick. Little issues like these are sprinkled throughout this game. Easily ignorable if you like the game or gently grating, depending on how much you're enjoying yourself

Now the story and writing I like ,but the difficulty of the game made it feel almost tangential. The actual SCP writing didn't wow me but it’s fun to read when you have actual firsthand experience. The visual novel portion is interesting but, there is no way in hell I'm seeing the end of this. I only got to day 22 out of 50. And that’s probably the biggest shame about this game. Despite its cool premise and interesting story, it still wasn't enough for me to push through. Neat game though, recommend for people who like the dark, sorta cheesy, SCP horror stuff.

The video showcased is a little old though the most notable feature that has been changed is that the elevators are instant now and the game was retranslated recently.

If you like facility management games you'll like this one if you like a good story you'll like this one, or even if you like SCP-like games this is also good for that.

If you liked the story the most I would recommend their second game Library of Ruina which continues this one but it throws away the facility management also.

But this game gets really hard as you get into the further days. This isn't meant to be a shorter game this game wants you to restart to get an advantage, the early abnormalities are pretty easy but late game it gets to when a hard abnormality escapes you have to instantly restart the day. To combat this I recommend restarting to day 1 or restarting to a few days in the past. When you restart everything but your characters stay meaning you can keep all the info you gathered about abnormalities, items you've gained from them, and quests you might have done making it easier to focus on other abnormalities and quests to get them out of the way.

A lot of the older reviews about translation are not true to today where it was retranslated, there was also a big update regarding mechanics after it wasn't early access which divided the game between ""legacy"" and normal which changed art, UI, all kinds of stuff so watch out for those reviews too.

To sum it all up, this is a hard, facility management, SCP-like, story game that can get repetitive at times but you can always restart to make your run easier and better.

Lobotomy Corporation is a management sim/visual novel with an engaging story and somewhat addictive play loop. The game takes place over the course of a certain amount of days, during which you have to gather boxes from these things called abnormalities. If you've read anything on the SCP wiki, it's like that. Between each management day you get at least one cut-scene that gives the game the visual novel identity, with more cut-scenes happening the more objectives you complete. Before each day starts you get one new abnormality, the danger level of which ranges from literally harmless to ""just reset now it'll save you a half hour of anguish"". Lobotomy Corporation is best enjoyed completely blind. If you enjoy SCP, Management sims, and a sense of mystery throughout the entire game, I highly recommend. That being said, prepare for a bit of grinding. Stats are a very important aspect and grinding for high stats will always be a good idea. Also be prepared to reset; it's nearly impossible to get everything on your first run, in fact it's literally impossible to get everything on your first run. There's not enough days to get all the abnormalities fully understood. My advice is to reset whenever you start to feel stumped and take what you learned and apply it to your next run. This game is a rogue-lite after all, like Hades. 8/10 would recommend.

The following is a spoiler based review addition. Venture at your own risk:
[spoiler] There are five levels of danger in Lobotomy Corporation. Zayin: baby's first abnormality, Teth: friendly hello hi?, He: doable, but god am I scared, Waw: getting spicy, and Aleph: oh got why is everything on fire? Use this to gauge if you can handle an abnormality. The story is fantastic, and I haven't even finished it yet. So many twists and turns and mysteries to solve. On another topic, god does this game drag down sometimes. The first day you get a new Aleph or even a Waw, prepare to reset 3-4 times just to learn the basics about it and eventually get it right. Some abnormalities need specific levels to work and some are fucking bullshit like Alriune and the Silent Orchestra. Fuck those two in particular, I want to get good results not normal! Anyways, if you really need help with an abnormality, the wiki has everything you need and the Subreddit is always welcoming. Finally, let's talk about EGO. The weapons and armor you make from the boxes of the abnormalities are insanely useful. Just getting one of the higher rank means taking way less damage from everything below. A teth armor with 0.8 on white will take more damage than a waw with 1.2, despite 1.2 being weak to white and 0.8 being resistant. Weapons work the same way, but in reverse. You'll deal a lot more damage to breaching abnormalities of lower levels with a higher level weapon. The weapon's damage also matters, but you'll figure that out as you play... This was less a spoiler-y area and more of a ""here's some tips from a guy who's put in 50 hours to this game."" sort of thing. btw there's a sequel called library of ruina that you shouldn't play until getting the true ending here.

you get hella complicated, manual book that explain kinda everything but you understand basically nothing and you will forget everything and realized you fucked up stuff (kinda like paper please)
puzzle like strategy because containment placement do, in matter of fact, matter (a lot)
a rouge-lite element (because boi you gonna fail a lot, and need to grind the hell-out stuff to even stand a chance for endgame content)
RTS (because mid-to-endgame content actually need you to micro bunch of your unit going into battle)
and bunch of other stuff because each abnormalities give unique mechanic to manage properly.

proly you also need decent system to run the game, because boi, the insanity of endgame chaos is amazing, and fps drop right to the ground too, just like the facility i manage after bullshit abnormalities breka loose.

the story is pretty ok, enjoy the world building, but i mostly here for the anomalies, so i able to sit through most of the narrative stuff

the artstyle definitely not for everyone, but it not really distracting, and in my case, it actually grow on me slowly (or, you can push it by saying that the artstyle relate to the lore of the actual story)

though, i quite worry when you already experience most of the anomalies the game has to offers, becuase while it has quiite a lot, you will not able to re-experience the initial wonder that the game offer, and just became another ""pick your best gear for the run"" kind of game, while it still have a lot of replayability thank to it randomly picked anomalies to be able to choose each time, it can get old after many reset.

1. This is a very~ long~ game~
The game has 50 in-game days, but if you actually want to finish the game in the correct way (without bad endings), you will need to go through far more days. LC is one of the few games that by design encourages you to ""reset"" the game (probably for multiple times). (The ""reset"" here is different from what you may understand but digger deeper will spoil the game, so take your own risk.) This can be converted to at least 100 hrs (very bare minimum) real playtime. So only jump into it if you want to invest such long time here.

2. You'll need to do research
You know nothing about the abnormalities and the LC universe itself. When you start the game, a whole new world is open to you and this could quickly overwhelm you and worsen your game experience if you insist on trial-and-error. First piece of advice is to take your time and read carefully the manual the game throws at you at the start. You will refer to it constantly during the first few days anyway. Second piece of advice is to do research on wiki and guides and such for the immediately upcoming abnormalities and challenges, while trying not to spoil yourself further. Trust me. Doing research for this game won't ruin your game experience by making the game much easier. You will still fail a lot due to your carelessness and such.

3. You need strong skills of control and management
Into the late game, the game will put you through mountains of challenges, sometimes to the point that you will feel unfair. If you want to challenge your limit of concentration and management skills, this game is perfect. Otherwise, take your chance. (Of course you can choose to bypass some of the challenges, but you'll get bad endings which I consider not game completion.)

4. You're up for a brain exercise.
Let me try to talk about this without spoilers. As I said, you don't know anything about the abnormalities and LC universe at the start, and those sometimes depends on the things that the characters tell you. Talking to the characters is like playing a guessing game, since they can constantly confuse you in the early game (since you don't know anything) and further confuse you philosophically in the late game (since they think you can dig deeper into the universe by then). Even its appearance does not tell you, I assure you the story element in this game is heavy. Very heavy. Just a teaser, every abnormality has its own backstory, and there are eighty-sth abnormalities.

5. Bugs and dev support
This is not a new game. There are still bugs and optimization issues that remain unsolved to this date but I don't think the dev will solve them anymore. (For example, the game sometimes shuts itself down if you play for too long. This once made me so mad since I just finished doing a difficult task and the game didn't save before crashing.) Luckily there're some mods that can solve those problems and you can easily find these mods from Internet. Nonetheless, don't expect dev support since they may just only focus on LOR (the sequel to LC) by now. 

6. One thing that I hold a grudge
As I said, the game encourages you to ""reset"". In fact, it is still technically possible if you want to finish the game without bad endings in one go (without ""resets""). However, to do that you have to avoid doing a specific thing (I won't spoil it here) that the game never even tries to hint at. So, if you didn't spoil yourself about a specific thing about the endgame, you will probably get to a point where you soft-lock your game progress and have no way but to ""reset"". Personally, I feel that's a bad and unfair game design since it potentially gives you the freedom to finish the game in one go but screws it up afterwards (unintentionally?). I used multiple mods and commands to cheese that but that's still frustrating.

7. After all these... still a positive review
After all the technical problems, I still give a positive review because I believe the dev has put a lot of effort into this game. The stories of the abnormalities and the universe are rich and amazing. The challenges, though beyond tough, are well-thought and make you feel rewarding if you actually complete them. I can't ignore the effort and creativity here. To me, this is a game with excellent insight and idea, yet may be ""technically unsatisfying"" if you're unlucky or unprepared.

I'm writing this review two weeks after 100% completing the game so maybe I miss sth that I will add to this review in the future. But for now, I hope my review helps some newcomers who're considering buying this game.

Pros:
-The game plays very well, I have never experienced lag or a crash other than when the game closing out was scripted. I can have all of my employees doing things at once and it still runs smoothly
-Game play itself is very smooth, a little hard to get the trick of which can cause some frustration but when you do get it the game becomes much easier 
-All of the abnormalities are amazing and fun, even the ones based off existing stories like wizard of oz or fairy tales 
-The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. In the game you get warnings called trumpets to set the mood for when something goes wrong and you'd think that a blaring alarm would be horrible on the ears but I even listen to them outside of when I play the games 
-The translations are really good, I haven't really spotted any errors in the structure of the sentences or spelling errors 
 
Cons:
-This game is abysmally long. I've put over 64 hours into this as of this review and I haven't even gotten 10% of the story, not to mention the sheer amount of different abnormalities prevents me from being able to glide through different loops easily 
-Speaking of loops, this is a game where you'll have to start over constantly. When you start over you get to keep most of the objects and information you got from the previous time but you have to work your way back up and hope you don't end up with bad abnormalities that will seriously damage your run
-The difficulty curve is kind of confusing. I had to have other people explain to me that you have to start over every time things get difficult to get better gear so you can pass that bump, the game only explains the basics 
-Even if you do have what you need one little slip up can destroy an entire day, it's a game that requires a lot of attention and no errors",1616361018,1616361018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review time babiezzzzzzz
I’m going to try to avoid spoilers at all costs because I went into this thing completely blind & I think you should too! I have never experienced anything that is anywhere as ambitious, interesting or intense as this game is or can be at its peak difficulty levels. 
You are the manager of a grand facility in charge of producing energy. How? By performing what appears in the game to be benign research experiments on various types of monsters! Some v cute, some absolutely terrifying with each having its own unique backstory. Your research will unlock valuable information as to how to work with each individual monster for maximum :), :/, or :( results depending on their specific needs and Qliphoth counters as well as armour & weapons (EGO) to deal with the various Ordeals or emergency type situations that might arise amongst your staff and abnormalities should you not meet the specified stat requirements. The mechanical systems in this game go Bananas. Pay attention to everything. 

[b]Employee Assignment Needed:[/b]
You may think, “ah yes... rogue-lite, monsters, this will be a silly little procedurally generated game. SURELY I won’t become attached to these characters or care about their silly little tasks ^-^” Listen... the way in which you are completely wrong..... Oof. These tiny round-headed, bug-eyed, sad, sweet characters GOT to me. *you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand*
Don’t talk to me about Hod, don’t TALK to me about Netzach, DON’T even mention Tiphereth. Trust me the missions the department heads give you are worth it. Terrifying. But 100% worth it.
Regular hireable employees, v cute. Mostly v dopey. My partner calls them babies. Rest in peace to all the little ones you Will lose.

[b]End Management:[/b]
Persevere. 
This game will not hold your hand but it does give you exactly the tools you need to excel. Should you run into difficulty, lose extracted EGO that was especially hard to aquire, or simply have a monster that you don’t feel you can adequately handle, the game allows you to restart from a save state called the Memory Repository (every 5 days game time). This is a valuable tool if you extract a monster who only seeks to wreak havoc on your facility OR maybe you want to spend more time assigning your employees to specific work types to level up those specific stats before going further. 
Additionally, you are always able to restart from day one. In fact! Utilizing the Memory Repository or beginning anew from day one are quite encouraged! Should you choose to rewind or restart, you will keep all research done on the abnormalities you have worked with as well as unlocked EGO. This makes the beginning of the game much more manageable and (imho) more fun! My only advice would be, if you fail a day early on (with all employees dying) do NOT immediately rewind to Memory Repository as all of the gear that your employees had equipped at time of death is now gone with them. 
Lobotomy Corp does not WANT you to fail and thus there are no true fail states IF you use all of the tools provided.

* The interface is clunky and makes you go out of your way to access basic information about things like employee health or equipment. For a management game, that's *really* bad. See games like Oxygen Not Included or Rimworld or even Fallout Shelter, this isn't an unsolved problem. This also leads to using some of the UI being janky or difficulty keeping track/controlling your units.
* Games usually introduce RNGesus as a way of spicing things up now and again, making plays unique. This game is just chock full of it. Virtually everything that happens is random in this game and in a really frustrating way. You can do everything right and just... lose half of your employees. Not because you did anything wrong. Not because you didn't plan for it. Just because a qlipoth meltdown kept going off in a room that can kill an employee instantly. Admittedly, the game is liberal with letting you restart days that go wrong.
* I love the idea of an SCP-like world... But I didn't dig the world building and creatures in this. This may just be chance, but most of the creatures I saw were just obsessed with sins. Why are the AIs and abnormalities so preachy?
* And on that front, SCP has tons of harmless entries. But in this world you'll have lore saying ""this creature loves people"" and then it will escape it's room and slaughter everybody unprovoked. It contradicts itself several times in just the few hours I played. And not just with lore - actual manager tips conflicted with one another or outright lied about the mechanics of a creature.

10/10 would see my entire facility get massacred again.

In all seriousness, the game is a very interesting SCP-esque management sim that has a very solid narrative and method of storytelling that sort of reminds me of Nier/Drakengard. You will make progress, you will approach the end... you will fail. And then you will start from the beginning with more knowledge and tools at your disposal... you will approach the end and likely fail again, but this time you make more progress... and the cycle repeats until you are strong enough to overcome your next challenge, and it is so satisfying each time. All the while, you will unlock more of the story each time you do this. The characters will even mention this may not be your first time talking to them.

I will not lie, however, this is a tough game if you want to actually reach the end of it, even tougher if you want the true ending.

you keep doing the *same thing* over and over and over and over and over. I can't really elaborate without going into hardcore specifics of the gameplay, so let's take this hypothetical scenario as a replacement:


imagine you are the owner of a pet store. you get your first pet, a Siamese Fighting Fish who lives in a small jar. you don't have to do much but feed it, and eventually the day ends and you've beaten day 1

day 2 comes in - and now you have a hamster too
no big deal, its just a hamster. you give it food. the sun sets and you feel accomplished.

flash forward to day 5, you now have 3 hamsters, a fish, and a REALLY angry monkey. like he's EXTREMELY angry. if you don't go over to his cage and give him a high five every 5 minutes he'll start screaming in agony.
so you spend most of the day feeding your other furry companions, but now there's this constant, uncomfortable *buzzing* reminding you that this monkey NEEDS to be high fived. 

flash forward to day 10, you have gained 3 enraged, hollering chimps, another hamster, and a large animal of bovine descent
all the animals must be fed, all the monkeys must be high-fived, and that cow detonates random gas leaks if you ever look at it funny. so you pull your big boy pants up, and get to high fiving those monkeys, and after a while you forget why you even started a Littlest Pet Shop (Littlest Pet Shop is a toy franchise and cartoon series owned by Hasbro.) in the first place

This game is a lot of trial and error (mostly error), your workers (who, if we're still going with this SCP comparison serve as D class, scientists, and guards) are meant to be thrown into the lions den for the sake of progress. You're supposed to let them die for the greater good so don't be like me and accidentally get emotionally attached to a few of them (Yum-Yum, Miho I'll be taking you two to the end! Hopefully) it also doesn't help that a few AIs get passive aggressive flavor text when someone dies under their domain. [spoiler]Fuck of Yesod, I'm trying my best here![/spoiler]

A nice feature of this game is that every ""level"" you do counts as a day and every few days you get a checkpoint, if you progress a few days and really realize you are in a bad place with abnormalities you picked or how you built your employees you can rewind back to the last checkpoint (you can also retry your current day as well). The research you did on abnormalities will remain and you have any employee who died after the checkpoint return and lose any you added. There are missions in this and when you complete a mission and rewind the mission is still completed. Do not be afraid to do this, it's quite handy at least for me. Also try to do your missions as soon as you can because completing a mission provides you with a nice upgrade that you can choose.

Okay, this part is going to be entirely in spoiler tags because I am going to tell you about two abnormalities I would NOT recommend picking. One because it is something that you need to be later in game to handle and the other which is just tedious and I reset when I realized how it worked. Here's the one that I got way too early in game: [spoiler]There is an abnormality called Magical Girl or Queen of Hatred, she can actually be pretty helpful but if three employees or clerks (AI controlled employees) DON'T die within a certain amount of time she goes on a rampage and can decimate your entire facility. Eventually you can get an item called ""execution bullets"" so I would recommend avoiding getting her till then. Her teaser line is ""In the name of Love and Justice~ Here comes Magical Girl!"" so if you see that don't grab it till you're ready.[/spoiler] Here's the other that is just tedious IMO. [spoiler]It's called Express Train to Hell and is actually a ""tool"" type abnormality that when used can heal or buff your agents. The thing is every two minutes or so if you don't interact with it a train will run through your facility slaughtering everything in its path. It's easy to get focused on something else in the facility and only realize you forgot about the train until it's too late. Happened to me until I reset to a previous checkpoint. The teaser line for this one is ""When the time comes, the train will chug down the tracks and sound its mighty horn.""[/spoiler]

However, the gameplay is also bad. See, you study monsters. Not in a fun way, but by sending in interns to fill up a Monsters, Inc. scare-o-meter (not kidding). Unfortunately, these interns die all the time. This would be funny, except it causes the other interns to freak out and you have to put them all down. This wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't wearing valuable equipment and their training was very expensive. So, you feel like you're getting nowhere in the game. The only reason to keep going would be to collect more monsters, but most of them are poorly defined anyway like 'spooky radio static' WOW. How creepy. Sure glad a werewolf wasn't on the budget.

Even from the time I didn't have it, I would spend hours watching others playing through it, and reading up on the creatures that lurk inside the containment units. And yet, even after being spoiled most of the time from videos and researching, it never stopped me from actually playing the game. And I do not regret it.

If you're a person who loves in depth worlds with interesting characters and plenty of creativity to unpack, as well as stories that are rather grim and horror-based, than this is a perfect fit. The amount of detail put into every abnormality, the uniqueness they all have, each character being lovable in their own way, and the ability to customize your own employees to help shape your own idea of their story, it's very inspiring.

It's a challenging game, but extremely fun. However, it can be seen as a bit repetitive, but with new abnormalities to explore, and even if you have uncovered them all, it never ceases to be entertaining. It takes a lot of careful attention to details as you learn more about the creatures your employees are caring for to prevent them from escaping, and each little quirk they have to them. But the more you play the better you get at remembering. It is fairly slow paced though, so if you're someone who prefers fast combat or game play over story it might not be what you're looking for.

Overall, if you're an artist, writer, creative person, or anything really who loves unique otherworldly creatures and lots of lore, this is the right choice for you. I can't express enough how much inspiration this game has given me, and it saddens me that it isn't as popular as it should be.

These creatures have a similarity to that of the SCPs of the SCP Foundation. Care for them properly and they'll give you energy to run the facility and export power... treat them poorly however and watch as your facility is destroyed in less than a couple minutes if you piss off the right ones.

It is simple in nature, but please, PLEASE give it a try sometime. It's a game with fantastic gameplay and a really good story with little hints and pieces to put things together along the way. The English translation is still being updated, but for now it's sensible enough and makes for a good game.

EDIT: Okay so since my review I've doubled my time into the game and I have to say, please get it if you enjoy trial-and-error survival gameplay with a deep story to follow. Look at the screen shots, the video's, and consider all this.

-The Game since full release has full English translation completed.
-Is now mod compatible.
-Takes little space, and requires no internet to play.
-The game has a lot of replay-ability and several techniques to be learned that can help your management life easier. It's even made to be replayed a couple of times, you'll understand in time!
-The games difficulty is scale-able and controllable (to some extent), this won't make sense right away but you'll figure out eventually that you can use this to make the game easier OR harder for yourself!
-The soundtrack is amazing and the storytelling they make with the team and budget they had is beautiful.

Please, I encourage you give it a try if this sounds promising to you. Don't take just my word for it, make sure the game appeals to you in its imagery, themes, and in gameplay. Don't look in too much though!

Kill Clerks by the dozens so the corpse mountain can't smell them bleed. Augment your Agents until they're unstoppable forces of nature. Forget you left someone in a cursed bunker until half your facility has breached. Read the manual. Travel back in time to escape your mistakes. Confess your sins to a floating Jesus skull. Meet again as stars.

An amazing game with an excellent lineup of creatures to research and contain, a very strong sense of tone and atmosphere, enjoyable core gameplay, and a really intriguing story with a lot of deep lore to uncover. The early game is rather simple, but things quickly develop until you have a fascinating mishmash of monsters whose management conditions you all need to keep in mind, and challenges later on will really test your skill as a manager.

Now, the gameplay itself is fun, but where I think Lobotomy Corporation really shines is in its story - you wouldn't expect much of a narrative from most management/simulation games, and its slow start here might make you think LC is the same way, but the story is what takes what would otherwise be a neat SCP-esque monster containment game and turns it into a masterpiece. I don't want to spoil anything, but there's a lot more going on in L Corp than ""morally dubious energy corporation"", and there are a lot of mysteries and twists you'll uncover along the way. The worldbuilding is also quite intriguing - you may never leave the facility (not until the sequel, at any rate), but the writing does a really good job at painting a picture of the world outside and why things in the facility are the way they are.

The soundtrack also slaps. I don't have anything eloquent to say here, it's just some real bangers that are great fits for the scenes/days they play in.

Probably the best game I played in 2019, and the sequel has so far proven to be a worthy successor. Cannot recommend this highly enough if you're a fan of management games or story-driven RPGs. Goes on sale fairly often, if you're unsure about buying it full price. The early days are a sort of ""soft tutorial"", if you're not sure about the game at first I really advise trying to get to at least Day 21 or so, that's around when things really get going.

If you're thinking of picking this up, here's some spoiler-free advice:
- Read the manual! I'm not joking, it tells you almost everything you'll need.
- You don't have to end the day immediately as soon as it lets you, and it's often beneficial to continue working to train stats and get more gear. Just watch out for Ordeals.
- Buy the Managerial Tips first. Usually.
- Read everything! The floating white flavor text that appears above an abnormality during work can offer useful hints.
- Don't be afraid to retry the day if something goes wrong. 
- Try to avoid the wiki - learning things for yourself is part of the fun!

It is a grindy technical game about figuring out the quirks of the creatures you are trying to contain, in order to keep your team alive and extract energy / gear from them.

It starts off deceptively easy, but soon becomes hard as you start dealing with dangerous things you are not prepared for, then tapers off once you get the hang of that, before getting brutally hard for the end game content.

In truth, I liked the original form of this game more than the way it ended up.  It used to be more of a real-time juggling act than the present almost turn based style it has.  It used to have actions staff could take that were distinct and made sense (Cleaning, Consensus, Amusement, etc.) as opposed to the generic actions that are hard to keep track of in the present game, and have similar looking icons aside from their color.  

The things that abnormalities react to also became more generic with the redesign they did.  There used to be for example personality types and genders for the employees, and there were dramatic consequences when certain combinations happened.  The current game mostly just punishes you for sending someone in with low stats.  Occasionally it punishes you for sending someone in with high stats, which really sucks for the late game.  It just isn't as interesting as it was though.

Some of the abnormalities are not fun to deal with.  I hate things where I can make all the right decisions and still have there be a chance for my team members to die. 

I also wish they had mod support.

I also wish it allowed you to have multiple saves.

The worst thing though was that the game teaches you to play it slowly and strategically, making ample use of the pause button to micromanage for best effect during tough situations.  Then suddenly it will punish you for pausing.

Still, there is not a lot of that in the game now, and it also lets you choose which abnormalities you want to bring into your facility, so I find that I can still play this for enjoyment even if I find myself missing the way it played in the early builds and find myself frustrated with pause thing when it appears.

In the end, I have come around to a soft yes on the recommendation.  There are negatives, but the game itself is a lot of fun.  It's just B- fun right now.  

There are just a lot of missed opportunities and I wish I could still consider this an A+ game like I used to.  If they kept developing this and releasing new DLC monsters for instance, or open it up to the workshop, I think it would be a much better game.

The anomalies that you work with in the game are its best feature.  They are each creative and unique, and fit well into the setting and work well with the game mechanics.  The game is truly enjoyable when you are figuring out each new anomaly.  

Once an anomaly is figured out, however, the only gameplay left is to farm that anomaly for resources and keep it under control.  That means that the game has extremely poor replayability, which would be fine, except for a major problem with the gameplay.  The game will repeatedly force you to use the ""replay day"" button, which rolls back time and allows you to basically cheat by gaining foreknowledge of how your ""new"" anomalies will work.  The game does this in a few different ways.  The first is a grading system that you need to use to gain points to hire employees and upgrade them.  When an employee dies, you lose points in this system, which means that you not only lose the points you spent on them, but you lose points that you need to spend on the next day as well, which can lead to a failure spiral unless you use the replay day button to ensure that your losses are few to none.  The second is an event that kills every employee in your main room of each department.  Typically this will catch every employee not actively working with an anomaly.  It can only catch you by surprise once, and you can avoid it by moving your employees out of the main room before an event (these are the morning/noon/midnight events), but it is such bad gameplay design that I am putting it in the review.

The game also has a story, but it may as well have not been there and might even have been better without it.

The unexpected element is discovering new abnormalities and their quirks, most of which have lethal consequences. Since the price of failure is high, you will abuse ""Retry the day"" button a lot.
This removes the element of surprise. You just develop a routine of taking a new abnormality, unlocking its information, restarting the day knowing it all.
Some other emergent qualities of abnormalities can be approached similarly or require resetting to an earlier save checkpoint.

Still in the end, the game starts to feel repetitive and not that surprising after all.
To take the player out of their rut, there are story and challenges you need to complete to unlock the full story. It is totally not necessary to follow the story to play the game, but it exploits the completionist mind. You need to beat one-time challenges to unlock the story, and this makes the regular facility management much more challenging.

Still, in the end you will need to restart the game completely, since you will want to unlock all the abnormalities the game has to offer. Luckily, by that time the game has supplied you with a variety of permanent cross-save buffs to make the grind faster.

Very similar in spirit to Darkest Dungeon, but with much less unpleasant grind or moments when you feel like you are just getting farther away from your goal. Still probably too reliant on the restart aspect, to the point when you start to suspect play-time spoofing.

First of all, this game has a huge memory leak issue which means your computer will have a performance issue even after you turn off the game (you need a restart to fix it) and this issue persists for a long time which means fix will be an unrealistic expectation. Other than that, this game has a huge lore and abnormality variety with stories (see below). Gameplaywise, there isn’t much to do sadly. This game could have been a mobile game easily. There isn’t much to do as macro management while micro management is too limiting. Unfortunately, all of these abnormalities are random while they have different difficulty levels with a certain limitation and that limitation isn’t enough but apparently developers didn’t care; because you can’t finish the game with true ending in one playthrough (if you don’t save scum of course). You can see my playtime above for one playthrough; I had to start-over because of the two alephs I picked around twentieth day (same day). It was an instant game over. After that, I started to check the abnormalities before picking them but even with that, end game was too annoying and repetitive, especially with the leak. Lastly, AI is pretty dumb and unresponsive some times which can mean losing all of your agents. And this will be pretty annoying, because there is no save feature in days, even though they will get longer, more you progress.
At my last run, I was so annoyed of daily abnormality satisfaction pile, after dying to midnight waves. So, I uninstalled the game at day 42 and watch the end game. Definitely, it isn’t worth it, like the story of the game. Story is just a visual novel with fanfiction writing from a website, it seems. However, plot is like this: You are a manager and you produce energy from these dangerous abnormalities. While there is an AI which helps you (not a tiniest bit) to manage the facility, there are some floor managers. You talk to these managers and learn their stories and question some of the things but they are not relevant to gameplay at all. And at the same time, their stories are so abstract and short. [spoiler]At the start of the game, you think that you don’t know the background of your character, sadly your character doesn’t remember anything too. So, what does he do? Nothing, just nothing. You learn it from the AI, just terrific. [/spoiler] What about huge lore though, is it good? That is just mediocre with lots of holes, like it just happens logic.

I will just overlook any technical issue and focus on the gameplay on this review.

First problem is the game hardly give off any sense of accomplishment at all unless you are a closet M or have incredible will power. The game gonna punish you hard for any mistake you make. Mess up on a job? Retry the day. Mess up on an ordeal? Retry the day. Forgot about that one guy that will steal all your hard-work of the day once he got out? Retry the day. Oh right, here is a bird that will broke out when you let too many of your employee die and he will call out all his bird buddy too, better retry the day fast then. It's gonna get frustrate real fast if you can't keep your head cool, to the point that when you win the day the only feeling you gonna get is ""Thanks f*ck the sh*t show is over""

Second problem is the game give you a lots of ability that don't work or doesn't matter. Protection doesn't matter unless it's a 1vs1 fight.

And lastly, just a head up, always hit retry the day before rewind memories if you don't want to lose all your hard earned E.G.O (i learned this the hard way, if that was an intended feature i would say that one hell of a feature)

And lastly, could have at least put a ""point of no return"" sign at that day 46 because if you are like me: On your first playthrough, you are open minded, you willing to forgive all the flaw and just decide to have fun jumping in that end game sequence thinking what could go wrong at this point? Well congratulation, you just efficiently lose like 30~40 hours of your life because you are horribly underestimate the thing that lie ahead. Better... restart the game from day 1 then.

Well, apart from all that, this game is still a blast and the music is absolute banger. I had my fun with it and i believe many are/will too.

The core gameplay loop revolves around assigning a growing number of agents to a growing number of abnormalities to gather a growing amount of energy each day. Agents will level up from this work, but each abnormality has its own mini-game (of a sort) to learn. Sending the wrong agent in (wrong could be due to their stats, timing, or a variety of creative reasons) can get them killed. This could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

That's where the roguelite element comes in. You can always reset the day, or use a memory repository to revert back to the last fifth day. This usually means you can solve whatever problem, though it's possible for some very bad luck to put you in an unwinnable position. As you play through the game, the challenge becomes juggling a ton of things at once, and dropping the ball on one could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

But if you find something utterly impossible, you can restart from day 1, with almost everything you've earned except for the agents themselves. You'll use this knowledge to build a better laboratory next time, and progress a little faster. At key junctures, you'll face the equivalent of bosses. Saying much about their mechanics would spoil them, but suffice to say they're very creative. For me, they were the highlight of the gameplay. However, bear in mind during these fights that it's pretty easy to make a single mistake that could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

Luckily, there's a banging music track to maintain your interest during these ordeals (literally, ordeals are another mechanic, but they're worth discovering on your own). A good story, with fantastic lore on all of the abnormalities, rewards you for all of your trials and tribulations (though don't expect it to be clear cut, even by the end). Like the gameplay, the story is fairly unique, building on this truly unique experience. The atmosphere is wholly engrossing. Even the boss fights have a compelling and unique manner in which they pump atmosphere in the game. These elements help temper frustration from an accidental click which could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

Adding to that frustration in a less fun way is the element of grinding (and the awful UI, but we'll get to that. It just deserves to be mentioned in more than one paragraph). This comes in two forms. One is where players can continue gathering energy past the limit each day in order to enhance employees. This is the optimal strategy, but it's boring. Fortunately, it's not necessary to win. With careful management, I found going 1 cycle past the cap each day sufficient. The second issue is more bothersome: on subsequent replays (where you start from day 1), it's really tedious to return to where you were. There are some bright sides (like seeing new abnormalities and crafting a safer laboratory), but it's overall a chore, further worsened by that time you zone out, and make a mistake that could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

Finally, both last and least (in terms of what LC does well) is the UI. I can honestly say the UI is in contention for the worst ever in a game. You might think that's hyperbole, but I assure you it's not. The game constantly obfuscates information, forces you to click quadruple the necessary times, and stresses out the wheel of your mouse. You will absolutely lose agents because of things like a pop-up telling you the agent is calm, all the while hiding their health bar. Hotkeys are lulwut. At best, you can see a list of 5 of your agents simultaneously, out of a number that's eventually [spoiler]10x that size[/spoiler]. And missing one thing could potentially set off a chain reaction where you lose all of your beloved workers.

If you can handle losing all of your beloved workers over and over, sometimes due to ignorance, sometimes due to difficulty, and sometimes due to bad design decisions, then Lobotomy Corporation might just be for you.",1609970069,1610083857,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I feel like anything that I say will just give you pointless expectations. 
I am very biased because this is with no exaggeration one of the very best games I have ever experienced. To me this game is right at the peak of what video games as a story telling medium can accomplish, standing  next to titans like Planescape: Torment and Silent Hill 2.

Most reviews already describe the various aspects of the game so I'm not sure I can add much here.
You are the new manager of Lobotomy Corporation and it is your job to extract energy from abnormalities.
Read the manual(!), plan your workforce and meet your daily goals. Deceptively simple.
The game slowly reveals more of itself to you as you play. The longer you play the harder the game gets and the more you begin to understand the world, the purpose of Lobotomy Corporation and your place in it.
The game marries gameplay with story in such a natural and harmonious way that it can really only work as a video game, something that I have very rarely seen.

Don't read about the story, don't cheat by reading the wiki, just go in completely blind. I promise that if you put the effort it will be worth your time. Very few games left such a strong impression on me, and if I can get at least one more person interested in trying it out then this review is already worth it.

*One thing to note is that, as you can probably tell from the game time of most people, this game is long.

I should probably try that approach on my second playthrough before I inevitably come to master all the many weird and wonderful creatures the game has to offer.

You will lose everything you've worked hours on multiple times just to make a slight bit of progress.
But you will want to continue on just to see how much more this game is going to throw at you and when you think you've finally figured it out it will only get harder.

Lobotomy is a fun game that I can't recommend to everyone but if you're willing to go through an absolute hell to finish it then I highly recommend it.

And if you're interesting in the story and lore of the game there is an official comic that as of this review is still updating every now and then.

Combined with the intriguing plot, Lobotomy Corporation makes the process of ""trial and error"" a pleasant experience.

I haven’t played much like it, so there’s no easy comparison here. Anyhow, the gameplay revolves around understanding the quirks of each abnormality and being able to juggle more and more as the game progresses. Beyond that, the story is shown piece by piece as you clear days and objectives. While it’s rather long and can be difficult at times, I’ve been impressed with just about every aspect of this game. If you’ve got the time, it’s probably worth a try.

And with that out of the way, onto all of the details.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

Simply put: abnormalities are dangerous, but profitable. The more of a threat they pose, the more energy they’ll generate in interactions. Your job is to dictate who handles which abnormality and how they do it. The trouble is, you get these things in black boxes with nothing more than a brief sentence to suggest what it could be. While the text might motivate your choice of which one you get, it won’t tell you how to handle it safely, or even give you an accurate depiction of how dangerous it is. Figuring that out is a matter of trial and error on your part. In other words, send someone in there and see if you can learn anything valuable from it. There are fair odds that they’ll die in the process. Most abnormalities can be lethal if you don’t understand them, and that’s the crux of it all. Information is your greatest asset. Your job, at its core, is to find and apply it.

While Lobotomy Corp. is an RTS in the sense that stuff happens in real time, you’ve got a pause button and two fast forward settings. What this amounts to is that you need to pay attention to where people need to be and when they need to be there. The time for fast decision making will come when you’re more prepared for it. As you accumulate more abnormalities, the time settings help you to increase the scale of your orders without slowing the game down. Even if all hell breaks loose, you can always rewind to the start of the day, or to the most recent checkpoint. If you make a mistake, you can always try again.

While the game eases you in real nicely, don’t expect to see it through from start to finish in your first run. There will come a point where there are too many things that can go wrong, and progress will become infeasible. While it’s important to understand where to accept mistakes and push forward, it’s equally critical to know when to go back and take it from the top. Each run is easier than the last, though the final days will always be a trial.

Overall, the gameplay is built upon a simple system of interaction that introduces different rules for each abnormality. The game is paced in such a way that the player will always be handling something new, and will eventually be overwhelmed by the later game stages. Upon reaching these stages, the player is meant to restart with what resources they have, and make it further the next time. The core of the game is solid, and there’s easily enough content to fill multiple playthroughs with unique encounters.

Aside from all that, I really enjoyed the character customization in the game. While you are the manager known as “X”, you’ve got full control over who gets hired. In other words, you get to customize your employees to look like cartoonish versions of your friends, among other things. It’s the best kind of character customizer in my eyes, mainly in that it doesn’t influence the story. Especially because it doesn’t. Your characters are free to develop their own stories and traits without compromising the world they exist in. That’s the magic of it.

[b]Writing:[/b]

The story of this game is generally presented in the visual novel format at the end of each day. While I can’t say too much about it without spoiling anything, the story focuses on giving many trails for the player to follow. As mentioned earlier, you won’t see everything on your first attempt, but you’ll certainly tug on different threads with each playthrough. The story is well thought out, as the events all work in their own ways to paint a picture of the world, its people, and their dreams.

The character writing certainly holds its own too. Everyone’s lived a time in the world and has come to work in the facility in one way or another, “X” included. The present is founded upon the past, and it shows in every interaction you see. Everyone’s haunted by a shadow of sorts, and it hides in their words and actions. Beyond them, every abnormality has a story behind it too, some of which relating mechanically to others with similar backstories.

What really made this special in my eyes was the story’s willingness to get into grey and even dark areas. The road to hell was paved with good intentions, and we’re beyond the point of asking if the ends could ever justify the means. What counts is seeing it through to the end.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

Frank was somewhat of a shut in, he didn't prefer to talk to others and instead spent most of his time talking with a bird that was being contained within the corporation instead. It was named the punishing bird, but it never really tried to punish anyone from what he saw. They talked about many different subjects, including, but not limited to, philosphy, art, science, maths, and more, this inspired Frank to become a researcher, one day however, Frank was moved from the Control Team down to the Central Command Team 1, he was a bit sad to have to say goodbye to his bird friend, because he wouldn't really be able to visit, but there wasn't anything he could do.

Frank found solace in talking to an anamoly referred to as ""The Snow Queen"" there, their conversations  were also rather insightful, but Frank never felt like they quite lived up to the conversations he would have with his old fowl friend.

One day however, Frank was delighted by what he saw, Punishing Bird had escaped from it's containment unit and was down in Central Command, Frank tried to spark conversation, however the bird seemed to ignore him and instead pecked at him while yelling ""This is for never calling!"" It didn't really hurt that much, and after a few minutes the bird left, presumably to go back to containment.

It was a...strange experience to say the least, but Frank was still happy to see his old friend...little did he know it wouldn't be the last time.

Then I got distracted without closing the game out, putting my ""playtime"" past the point where I can count on a refund. In that case I think an explanation is in order.

What you've got here is really a mobile game. There are extremely few management elements, basically limited to four stats that each character has, and their equipment which alters their damage resistances, and the type that they deal. These can only be modified before each ""day"". The stats can also only be modified the first time, as retrying a day does not allow you to reallocate the ""points"" you spent before that day. So while you can mix-and-match equipment all you want, once you use a ""point"" to either hire someone or modify a stat, that change is permanent.

You are given a terribly laid-out base containing not!SCPs in designated rooms. You send an employee to work with the not!SCP, using one of their four stats which have varying success rates depending on their level and, the particular not!SCP, and potentially other factors. By working with them you gain ""boxes"" which you can spend to learn more about the not!SCP, and purchase equipment that can be equipped between days. If the work is unsuccessful, bad things happen. However if the work is successful bad things also happen. Given this setup you must meet a quota of total boxes produced each day.

Your development is completely railroaded. You see that nice image they've got there with what would appear to be a branching, research-like system? That is an outright lie. The truth is that only one of those ""research nodes"" is available at any given time, and at least thus far in my experience, they must be fully upgraded before another is available. It's a case of ""Choose which upgrade you will select from the single option available!"".

The Not!SCPs aren't very interesting at all. These are the sort of bad SCPs that wouldn't actually make it onto the wiki.

The gameplay is a slog of boring ""select a worker, then select a destination"", irritating music I just found myself muting, and unappealing visuals.

And as your characters die, the game doesn't give you any leeway. If your best guy dies you just need to retry the day, because you're fucked without them. But if anyone else dies you learn that you should just retry too, because you need as many characters as possible to deal with some challenges. It's very possible to lock your game in an essentially-unbeatable state. In this case you must restart the entire game from scratch, which means losing many hours of progress.

How very apropos that this game's punishment is more gameplay.

But while the gameplay is relatively simple and starts out easily enough, I can definitely say the end-game is unironically some of the most difficult and challenging gameplay you will experience. The best way I can describe it is: Each monster has their own unique mechanics, as to what they like/don't like and what happens when you finally make them mad enough to escape. Some don't like it when someone with a low stat does a work type. Some don't like it when someone with a high stat does a work type. Some don't like it when you get a bad work result. Some don't like it when you have a good work result. Some have a combination of the above. Some don't like it when employees die, while some don't like it when no employees die. Some have extremely specific triggers, and god help you if you set them off. The end-game monsters you'll face are especially specific and punishing. It's easy when you only have 5 to juggle, but by the end you're juggling ~60, all the while having to face 'mini-bosses' every once and a while, whose difficulty ranges from easy to 'just restart the day'. Then certain events that will deliberately screw with your core game mechanics, but give permanent rewards across your persistent save file if you finish them. The end-game cranks all this up to 11. 

I cannot stress how absolutely, ball-bustingly hard this game is.

I still cannot recommend it enough.


Some aside notes though.
The game does suffer from memory leaks. 8gb will save you for a little while, but generally the longer the days go the more likely you'll suffer worse and worse from them. One trick that does work a bit is to mute the game music.

[b][i]DO NOT USE A WIKI[/b][/i]
Half of the enjoyment of the game is blindly experiencing the chaos of a new monster. Spoil yourself at your own peril.

It's similar to Pokemon, I think, with the different types of attacks (special, physical, status) that utilize various stats to back them up (such as a higher special attack making a special type move stronger), but NOTHING in the game explains this.

[b]Lobotomy Corporation is a monster dating simulator game.[/b]

With almost every day, you can pick an additional monster's route to unlock. There are four options to do stuff with them but the only important one for waifu purposes is Attachment. There are so many different options to romance, from cute AIs and robots to slime girlfriend, the [CENSORED] which also features NSFW scenes (still have not figured out how to bypass this filter but I am sure this is an option somewhere), a tsundere Bloodborne girl, and also a bishonen sparkly enough to rival Edward Cullen, amongst many others. If you have a foot/leg fetish or hand fetish or happen to like dogs, that's also covered! Also birds. There are so many birds in this game it's untrue, I counted at least six.

Many monsters are a bit tsun-tsun and will try and smack you around little before admitting any kind of affection. However they may also like to give you presents as a token of affection. Just be warned that too much waifu will ruin your laifu, and if you try and pursue too many different routes at once, then they may follow you out of the containment and fight over you, and if there's one thing that nobody wants, it's multiple prospective monster gfs/bfs duking it out in the facility. Or maybe you do, it's kind of entertaining to watch. Also sometimes these random jackasses will show up out of nowhere and try to ruin everything, but you can ask Ms. Bloodborne to beat them all up so it's OK. 11/10 would date again.

(On a more serious note this game does have an excellent and meaningful story line and is a great monster management simulator. That being said, go into it fully accepting the facts that a) you are most likely going to have to restart from day 1 if you want to 100%, and b) a lot of stuff is going to blow up in your face the first time you deal with it so don't expect a oneshot run or anything. The translation errors have since been fixed thanks to the many efforts of the fanbase, too. Only remaining issue is the occasional tendency for memory leak to build up on long days; you can usually help avoid this by closing the game and booting it up again on failed attempts, and letting it run until it resolves the end-of-day section.

The gameplay is quite intense, despite being a management sim. As the game progresses, you will develop muscle memory and your own tactics in order to advance.

This is a management game. It basically (if you remember it) is a Monster Tamagochi. Work with your captive monsters, harvest energy. Easy enough. But there are four ways to work with them, and they don#t like some of them. They might escape. They might cause panic and madness. They WILL eat your workers alive. The game is very gruesome. But boy oh boy the monsters are very creative! And to keep in mind every single need in order to not get every employee killed, eaten or in a frenzy is HARD!
If you can play through this without a guide, you are good! 
It also has an intriguing story in between the slaughter, I mean, the levels.

It's a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game in which you study things called abnormality's, and as you study them you create power for the facility that you work for. I'm not going to lie this game is very hard at the beginning of the game and you will die a lot early on. After a while tho you do learn how to study things better and you learn where to send people,  and where to put them. Tho the difficulty of the game might make you reconsider rather if this game is for you or not. If you can't accept the fact that your going to need to restart runs because of certain abnormality's being together and just royally screwing you this game might not be for you. There are over 100 different abnormality's in the game and each are ranked in which how hard they are to keep locked up and the amount of death they can cause 

ZAYIN- The easiest to keep locked up and are most of the time nice to you but still are capable of death 

TETH- They can break out if your careless but still not to bad to deal with if you got gear and don't make to many mistakes 

HE- They are more then capable of killing so many people if not looked after,Might need to hire special people just to keep one of these in locked up. They will put up a fight so be careful 

WAW- The ones that can end your day in seconds if not looked after and are really hard to keep locked up. They are really hard to study sometimes and will will kill people as soon as they enter there box if there not up for the job and escape. And some are super strong ready up the group if one escapes if you don't have good gear from past runs.

ALEPH- and then there are these guys, if one gets out you might as well just cry and restart your day or even run depending on the one ALEPH you get, these guys are god like and are almost impossible to kill

So why would you pick ALEPH class abnormality's then? Because the stronger the abnormality the more energy it makes also you don't get to pick the abnormality you want because you won't even know what your picking. Yep at the start of each new day your given 3 options to pick one and all you get is the abnormality's tag number and a faint description of what it is. After when you learn about it tho you keep it's info for future runs so you will know it's name when you pick from your daily 3.

other then that your given the whole idea for the game there are some other things about the game that are best found by your self when you play like the characters and story also do note this game is not originally translated in English so there might be some mistakes when your reading stuff but it's mostly bin fixed out.Also people are saying there is a memory leak problem in the game,I haven't had any issues about game after 70+ hours but I could be wrong plus I have heard there are mods to fix that issue again idk if that's true or not heard it from a bud. Would honestly recommend this game if your a fan of the SCP Foundation and or like creepy creatures.Tho for the price I would wait for a sale if your hesitant of buying it. Tho this game does have a lot of replayability for the price since you need to study everything to get the best ending.

So to rap things up 

-Game is very hard in a lot of elements
- lots of replayability
-All of the abnormality's are unique and original in most ways 
-characters are cool and you learn to like them as the story goes on
-would wait for a sale if your hesitant of buying it but still not bad for the normal price if your looking for something new to play

also a huge tip for new players if they don't want to die rate away and this is spoilers for one SCP [spoiler] Do NOT trust the plague doctor if you run into him he is one of the few SCP'S that can and will ruin your whole run if you run into him trust me [/spoiler]",1607326122,1607326122,True,10,2,0.588988602161407471,0,True,False,False

However, now that all the text has been fixed to be clear and understandable, I gotta say that I really don't have that many issues with it anymore.

The gameplay is that of a management game where you control different characters to do different things, but it takes a whole new approach to this formula by adding in the ""monster management"" aspect. Your characters are tasked with working on different monsters, called abnormalities, and you need to figure out what you need to do in order to maximize the output, or just to prevent the character from dying.

The game starts out simple but over time you have to deal with more and more abnormalities of increasing difficulty that can be set off by the simplest mistake. Even some of the earlier abnormalities can cause significant trouble if you don't pay attention. This can also result in domino effects in which while trying to stop one abnormality another one escapes and so on, resulting in you being almost required to restart the day.

While talking about having to restart the game, this brings me to how these retry mechanics work. The game rewards you taking what you learned from a failed day and putting it to use when retrying it. The game also lets you load your save from a ""memory repository"", which happens every five days. These bring back all of the dead characters and resets the facility to what it had been on that memory repository day, with the only exception being that you keep the same gear and information on abnormalities that you had. If this still isn't enough, you can reset all the way to the first day but keeping all the gear and info.

Another feature carried over by the resets is the boss battles defeated. There is multiple boss battles throughout the game which I won't go into detail, but they add plenty of difficulty to your playthrough. And Lobotomy Corporation has a lot of difficulty. At points the game will just not hold back, throwing lots of increasingly hard stuff at you. It feels incredibly satisfying to beat this obstacles.

The story, on the other hand, is done in a way in which you gain more info about the world in between each day, and from completing quests you can get more story focused on specific characters. This helps break up the gameplay and allows you to slowly get more and more information. The world itself is also very interesting, but is more heavily built upon in the sequel game, Library of Ruina. Even without that, you can still be engrossed in the plot.

All in all, Lobotomy Corporation offers a new take on an old genre and is a very enjoyable experience. Definitely a favorite of mine at this point, even with the issues it can have.",1607311105,1607311105,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

You quickly go from a stable, small, and simple facility to a massive complex filled with employees specialized just for certain anomalies, some people hired just for suppression of breached entities, and a quadrillion things you must keep track of or else everything will come crashing down hard. Though said quadrillion things aren't too complex; it's not like you have to keep track of inventory (save for which ""boxes"" you got from certain anomalies which can make armour and weapons for your agents, and the number of these things you have on hand for them to use).

It well demonstrates the inspiration of the game, namely SCP, in terms of how it is represented. Though, unlike the Foundation, you don't have death row inmates doing the science, but rather your agents interacting right with the potentially game ending beings that may or may not take a few lives should things turn out for the worst.

It combines elements of horror quite well and each of the abnormalities are original in almost every aspect, save those inspired by something (which, even if they are, they always have an original twist to their stories, [spoiler]such as the Warm-Hearted Woodsman, who is a twisted, vile version of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz[/spoiler])! If you enjoy SCP, you will LOVE this game!

The only major critique I have for it is the English translation, seeing that Project Moon self-translates these instead of going through a professional translation team. However, as I have observed, the game's English translation is actually higher quality that other games and media that have been self-translated from Eastern Asian languages. The use of pseudoscience terms is also a bit difficult for newbies to get a grasp of, though it will click with the player at some point what these mean, if anything at all.

8.1/10!

Edit: Thanks to the work of Cool Kids Club, a translation team who is chill and good, I'm bumping my score up to a solid 9.6. Their translation is excellent and even makes a few callbacks to some mis-translations from the old version that have become beloved community memes, e.g. the bear-themed beer. While the pseudoscience terms may still throw new players in a loop, I feel they've justified it. I'm bumping up the score a little more as, after playing it, I did some research and discovered a lot of the symbolism that ties this game together, in both religion and philosophy. It's grown into a proper indie franchise given lots of care by a team with so much ambition that they released a webnovel, a comic series, a sequel, and even a restaurant around their game.",1525288399,1606955506,True,5,1,0.570873796939849854,0,True,False,False

With an underlying story that continues into the sequel Library of Runia I suggest Lobotomy Corporation if you want to test your management skills both micro and macro.

Also, the Sephirahs are some of the most interesting characters I've seen in a video game. Strong recommend.

Updating this review after (more or less) beating the game, I think I can be more specific. The act of discovering what an Abnormality does is extremely fun, and you shouldn't use a wiki if you can get away with it. On the other hand, some Abnormalities are extremely hard to deal with, with powers that are difficult to guess at just from what they do, so sometimes you'll *need* a wiki to progress.

Game's a pretty rough gem, but it's still a gem. As of this writing, the game's on sale, and it will be until December 1st 2020. It's safe to say it won't go on sale again anytime soon, and $10 is an incredibly generous price for it. If it's no longer on sale by the time you read this, it's still a pretty damn good game for the price, though unfortunately this is a game you have to play for more than 2 hours to appreciate so it's impossible to give it a fair shot and then refund it if you didn't like it. All I can say is that you should play until Day 20 or so to get a good idea of what the game's like.",1599255438,1606365039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game mechanics are solid, the soundtrack, characters and plot are much better than I had expected, and there's incredible creativity on display. Mechanically, the game is simple: you have these creatures called Abnormalities. You send in employees to interact with them in one of four ways and somehow, it generates energy. Your goal each day is to obtain a certain amount of energy. Sometimes. these abnormalities escape, so you send employees to beat them up to get them back in their cages.

This game falls into the management sim genre, so make sure you like these kind of games before buying. I very, very, very, very strongly recommend that you do NOT watch a play through of this game before buying. One of the main features of this game is that every abnormality is different and has certain quirks that you have to discover. The more you know about the game before you go in, the more you spoil it for yourself.

Lobotomy Corporation is IMO one of the best games I've played in the management sim genre.

But I can't recommend it.

Although the developers nailed the game aspects, they did a much poorer job on the technical part of the programming. This game is a ticking time bomb with huge memory leaks problem that will crash your game and your computer if you aren't careful. Worst of all, these bombs tend to go off during boss fights, days that go over an hour, or right before the game saves after completing special events. It is extremely frustrating to devote an hour to accomplish something just to watch the game crash and lose it all.

Because of this memory leak issue, even though I love the game I will not recommend it to anyone. If it ever gets fixed (unlikely due to the age of the game), I will happily turn this into a positive review.",1606359693,1606359767,False,636,18,0.882234275341033936,0,True,False,False

I do not personally believe the game is worth a 25 dollar price tag. I do not recommend paying full price for this game, nor did I pay full price for it myself. If you can get it on sale for under 15 dollars, like I did, than you can get your money's worth out of it. Otherwise just watch a let's play for the lore/story, which is the part about this game that is pretty cool.

The gameplay itself is extremely basic and virtually non-existent, and you don't have very fine control over your agents by any definition. There is also no difficulty settings so you can't just play it for the story, for those of us more interested in the story than the gameplay. You have to deal with what little mechanics there are if you want to explore more of the games lore/story and see more about all the characters (which is the really interesting part of the game), and spamming the restart button on a day because your agents are suicidal maniacs is just getting tedious.

Basically a case of ""The writers were A class but the programmers were C class"". The gameplay itself plays like an old flash game you'd see on Armor Games or something (the kind you'd play for free in your computer class in high school instead of doing the assignment... or was that just me?).

Overall, if you can get past the mediocre gameplay it's still very much worth it for the story and exploring the characters/anomalies and their lore; however, I bought the game on sale for like 10 dollars.

 Upon reflection I think Project Moon have made a game that scratches a lot of my particular itches. I've fallen in love with the artstyle, music, world, story and gameplay. It has very little to offer in the gameplay department of your typical conventional management game tropes. The dialogue and worldbuilding, after having been re-translated, of course, is actually quite well-written. It lends itself to crafting a world outside of the small one of that the player character sees, yet is still entirely believable and interesting. 
 
   Unfortunately, however, the game's control methods and odd quirks lend it to being unable to hook new players and keep it from gaining the mass-appeal that it more than certainly has the potential for. It's control methods for your agents themselves are odd at best and frustrating at worst and are more of a suggestion than order. It has a lot of things about it that one definitely needs to spend more than a few hours past steams refund limit of playing to really begin to get the full gist of or get used to as a player.

    I love this game through and through, but I don't think it's something that everyone will give a fair chance, but I can't really necessarily say that I could blame them given the above reasoning. If this game wasn't your thing but the characters and world still interest you, then please, by all means, give the sequel, Library of Ruina a shot. It's an entirely different genre of game while still making many callbacks to this game, and recounts the key plot elements from Lobotomy Corporation.",1593167315,1603587827,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game is good. Quality. It's not a legendary product, but it's enough for most people. However, what really carried me (and probably most people) forward was the amazing story. It's seriously well written, and such quality is taken over in the sequel Library of Ruina.

Oh yea, did I mention this game has a sequel? If you wanna see what they made from the funds of this game, go look at that game.
Anyways, regarding the gameplay- you take over as a Manager of L Corp, also known as Lobotomy Corporation. Your company is in charge of generating power in a very clean way- by interacting with special creatures known as abnormalities and making them happy. This happy energy they produce is then used to keep the city alive with power. The only problem is; most if not all abnormalities enjoy munching on your employees, splattering your clerks into paste, or just enjoy seeing your entire facility fall into ruin. I fully, 100% recommend playing this game with as little to no knowledge about the abnormalities as possible. The game shines best when you're playing it blind and are stumbling through the darkness.

The gameplay itself is fine. Initially, it's easy, but once you reach mid to late game, the difficulty starts rising sharply, showing itself as a well made management sim (especially if you picked the needy abnormalities). There are a few bugs here and there, but overall it works well. Just be warned though, endgame (the final 4 days) have a MASSIVE difficulty spike, and the game encourages you to reset until you make the game easier and easier to deal with. And by reset, I don't mean the day or the past five days, I mean back to square one. I understand that can be a turn off for some people, so I thought I'd say as much.

Music is all right, nothing too special besides the ones used for cutscenes and the last day. I recommend listening to Library of Ruina music to see what they're capable of in the future.

Visually, it's simplistic. 

Storywise, it's absolutely amazing, and you'll find there is a justification for damn near everything in the game. There are a few hints about it strewn inside abnormality lore as well, so it's really cleverly made.

All in all, I recommend this game. I'm not a fan of management games, but this one caught my attention.
8/10, would recommend beating the game just to play Library of Ruina, which is a masterpiece. (Of course, the story also makes sense for those who haven't beaten lobotomy corp, but it helps you appreciate it more).",1602910684,1602910684,True,38,1,0.762446105480194092,0,True,False,False

25% of the time it's not a chill management game because everything has immediately gone to heck due to having done The Wrong Thing with a given off-brand SCP because you didn't know any better.

these percentages change as you add more stuff.
~

Memery aside: It's a fairly straightforward concept. Game's divided up into days, days have an energy quota to meet, you get energy by poking things in a variety of manners (most of which will go wrong until you get more information on a given thing), bigger Things give more energy per go. You get some events that kick off to prevent you from just mashing the work button on the easiest abnomality, and so on. Later things are trickier to work with and will probably kill most of your employees outright.

Major Upgrades (and plot) are doled out via milestone objectives and typically add new mechanics or information to leverage, each new thing added to the facility has a set of equipment you can make for smaller, per-employee upgrades (or just outright is something you can use if you know how, though a lot of them have drawbacks)

There's some light RPG elements, people with the right stats generally makes work go better, and you can grind to raise them in a pinch though I'm not sure if that's actually worth it or not.

The plot goes places and some of the stuff that can happen is rather intense in all senses of the word. 

The soundtrack ranges from one of the most relaxing general themes I've ever heard to PTSD-inducing when some of the bigger stuff breaks out.

Overall: It's a good time, if a bit slow-burning until you get to the good stuff. Also it can get a bit rough if you're trying to keep all your guys alive.",1602383099,1602383099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

^^^^^ everytime I play this game and bad thing happen .

7/10 stress/micromanagement simulator.
8/10 cute.
8/10 I like the story.
9/10 the music is [b]fire[/b] when bad things happens.

the game do take some time to get into it but when you get the hang of things . you will enjoy it and appreciate all the thing surrounding it . 

If you fail . the game is all about retrying the day and using the knowledge you learned that day (PS: you got button to retry the day). so don't shy away from using it . knowing is power . if you faced some hard abnormalities you didn't know how to deal with . there is nothing wrong about checking the wiki . but I recommend doing that when you get stuck . a lot of fun when playing this game come out from the element of surprise and how you can put the puzzles pieces together to know the right way to handle abnormalities . 

the things I feel may need improving but not necessary :- 

Better micromanagement : 
-when your employees attacks , using melee . they normally stay stack up . what make it hard to move injured employees away and send them back to heal up .
-it will be useful if you can make group for employees .even if they are from different department so you can put your melee and range employees in different team . it will make handling and ""micromanagement""in different events and bosses easier . make different groups based on attack type what can be useful . instead of remembering who got which type of attack and gathering them manually. you will pick which employees go in which group you like . making thing more strategized . 

-Add 0.75 and 0.5 speed . it will be nice to have that .

[b]PS[/b]: the game may take 50-100h to complete . so if this not your type of game. of repeating things and having cycle of trial and error . you will not enjoy it .",1601814608,1601930063,True,13,0,0.616503477096557617,0,True,False,False

That is to say, there are essentially a lot of things going on with tight timers you need to watch, and sub rules that you need to learn (e.g. don't send this employee anywhere else after working with that anomaly because they will instantly die, don't send an employee with temperance under this level to work with that anomaly because they will instantly die.  Don't approach this anomaly from the front because... they will instantly die.  Do I detect a trend here?).  It reminds me of cultist simulator actually, but more chaotic and with much worse writing (it is translated from Korean though, and Alexis Kennedy is an amazing professional writer with English as a first language, so it is comparing apples to oranges.  No insult to this game).

There is a lot to like here, but ultimately this game is INCREDIBLY repetitive and grindy and pretty RNG till you have played it enough to know what is manageably bad and what isn't and even then to some degree.  It is so incredibly easy to end up with a cascade failure even with a dozen level 5 agents with good gear.  The whole game is just frustratingly over-whelming in the later stages with so much going on, and even a small mistake or bad dice roll means you need to restart the day or accept terrifying losses that means you are stuffed in the days ahead.  Of course if you know enough to pick the right mix of minor anomalies and waw/aleph ones to farm, while also dodging certain really 'orrible and annoying ones, then all good.  But that takes a lot of repeats and I just can't be bothered anymore.

In the end I just got sick of starting again and again and giving the same orders again and again, and then making a mistake or having a bad RNG ordeal trigger and having to start over again.

The game is on a slow boil and both the story and difficulty ramps up exponentially, people tend to say that the tutorial ends roughly at day 25, which is halfway through the game, so make of that what you will. It also isn't for everyone so pirating to try isn't a bad idea but remember that it's from a small Korean indie studio so they would probably be realy gratefull if you bought it, eventually.

LC is a game about managing monsters to produce energy. You produce this energy by sending agents with unique stats, equipment and accesories to interact with them in their containment cell. If you have ever been through the SCP wiki then the monsters (called abnormalities, or abnos) would feel at home with the better of them. These abnos can breach their containment cells and wreck all kinds of havoc or possibly help your facility, the abno called One sin and hundreds of good deeds can for instance instantly kill the most dangerous abno in the game for the small payment of one of your agents. You start the game on day 1 with just one abno (the afformentioned one sin) and a couple of agents all crammed into a single department and you get more of every one of these as the days pass. At the start everything is VEEEERRY slow but it picks up the pace as you get more abnos with different containment procedures to jugle, as well as ""boss battles"" that start to appear halfway through that can be realy hectic and fun.

The paragraph above is a lie. the game is actually about the story of X (you), Angela and the sephiroth (AI managers) of the different departments as well as the strange workings of the facility and titular Lobotomy Corporation and the motive of the absent founder of the corporation Ayin. The monster management turns into a break/challenge between story sections. Some readers might recognize some names there, namely sephiroth and maybe even Ayin. These are ideas from jewish mysticism, specifically the Kabbalah. While most games skim the top of weird concepts for a unique aesthetic, LC and the story (but not gameplay) sequel Library of Ruina unlike most games dives deep into their theme and it works oddly well. Characters, character relations, layout, names, symbols and so on all tie back to jewish mysticism and it is quite facinating. You don't need to know anything about the Kabbalah to enjoy the story but it is a rewarding deep-dive to read up on.

pro's;
- Complex but manageable.
- Loads of abnormalities.
- cute dog pictures are required.
- manageable difficulty curve.

con's
- Bad translation; originally Korean, English grammer is horrible, but haven't found anything to be wrong, in info, just misleading.
- No clear save time; while not always, i did lose a day for not quiting at the right time.
- repetitive music, first hour its good, but you easily spend several hours in the game with one sound track. (there more but you mostly hear one.)

on the fence;
- Art style, its for a specific group, i personally don't enjoy the flash style art, while there is an ingame reason why it's like this. It's still puts me off. not enough to make it a con though.
- instant kills, there several abnormalities with instant kill abilities that have no warning until you get the tips, or persist over a single play through, 
of the two i met one just completely removes a character from doing attachment, other just blocks them from working on him (but don't get 12 marked)",1541104096,1599923602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Start out pretty easy, game becomes significantly challenging towards the end 

The gameplay is simple has some stimulation. Where u try to keep abnormality happy to produce energy to finish the day. Other part when there escape and ordeal where is more like a action rpg. Where u can control employee to take care of it or leave it automatically. You can do more manuel to ensure survival of your employees. Over the game you become attach to your employees. As they will become stronger depending what kind of task you assign them. You will likely restart a lot as you learn of the abnormality and how to manage them. If at some point you find it too difficult you can restart or use memory repository to keep all your current equipment and encyclopedia but go back last check point. Something I recommend is to do the mission they will help you get buff to your facility that can make things easier later game. Even if they are challenging to do as you progress to the last.

Get comfortable, and prepare to face the fear and build the future [b]at great, great cost.[/b]

Lobotomy Corporation, also subtitled ""Monster Management Simulation,"" is a weird and wonderful roguelike strategy management simulator.
Drawing inspiration from the works of the SCP Foundation and numerous sources in scifi, sci-fantasy, folklore, horror, gaming and more, LoboCorp initially presents a very simple premise to the player : Manage a facility focused on research of abnormal entities, and translate that work into energy. More successful work, more energy produced. 
Simple in theory, fascinatingly touchy in practice - you're applying a very loose version of the scientific method here, and spoilers! LoboCorp has very, [i]very[/i] loose definitions on ""employee safety protocol.""

The entire game is rendered in a fun, cutesy bubblehead [i]'moe'[/i] aesthetic; very charming, no eyesore to look at for long periods.  You won't feel a thing when the staff dies! Look how cute they are when they scream!
Of note is the English translation, which used to be much choppier (being translated from native Korean); the recent (as of writing) update has since cleaned it up dramatically. (I'll note I don't entirely approve of the translation cleanup, as some of the Engrish actually helped accentuate how strange and esoteric the game is).

The music is superb, though you'll be hearing two or three tracks far more often than the others; the inclusion of a diegetic music system rating you based on current panic level really does help you keep solid tabs of how well you're keeping the facility under tabs -- and conversely, how boned you really are when things truly hit the fan.  
Of special note is the [i]""Second Trumpet""[/i] theme. You'll know it when it happens - and you'll learn to love/hate the level of chaos that provokes it.

Being a roguelike game built on a 'days' system LoboCorp does a lot to try and balance the level of stress it ekes out of the player with some nice quality of life features, both built-in and unlockable. It is mechanically rich and thematically saturated, with subtle and not-so-subtle hints to Hebrew scripture and Kabbalah teachings, alongside its varied references to exterior sources.

[h1]A few tips for the prospective player![/h1]
The wiki exists, but please refrain from using it until necessary. This game thrives on uncertainty and study.
Never be afraid to fail, as you learn more from failure than success.
Never be afraid to restart; unlockables stay unlocked through playthroughs, even equipment (until death!)
If it sounds bad, it's probably bad. If it sounds good, it's [b]definitely[/b] bad.
Do look over the provided manual and attempt to parse the four-color-coded stats system, as the terminology used is a little intentionally esoteric. Red is physical stats, White is mental stats, Purple is workspeed and success, and Blue/Pale governs speed.
Trust the manual. But don't trust it too much. 
Spread the love with equipment, and avoid the urge to overspecialize departments. 

Among the many things the LoboCorp offers, you'll get to :

1. It suffers from poor controls, which are a serious issue when tightly micro-managing your employees is necessary to managing/suppressing many of the abnormalities in the game.

2. Losing individual employees too detrimentally impacts the fun of the game. 

3. The game lacks serious graphical polish.  The artstyle seems somewhat unique at first, but you quickly realize it's pretty low-budget, apart from the story-ish driven NPCs you encounter (who are, admittedly, well-drawn and beautiful).   

4. The gameplay loop is not fun.  Unless you really enjoy pointing and clicking with poorly-drawn employee dolls and telling them to go fill-up progress bars, you aren't going to enjoy this game.  The trailers make it seem like a lot of frenetic, gruesome, fun stuff is going on often, but that's not the case 90% of the time.  And even if it is, it usually means your employees died and you have to immediately restart the scenario you're on.

Those are the most serious flaws of the game.

Second of all, it steers away from making itself be the Foundation rather a separate genre of things which shows originality from project moon. Third of all, you will not get bored, this game as a lot of abnormalities for you to handle with there own quirks and hell fire this also allows the game to have a replay ability due to the fact there is stuff happening all the time each in-game day. Ordeals, Abnormalities Breaching, Abnormalities Blowing up your employees, Core Suppressions with in-game mechanic changes, objectives, and a challenge mode so its a lot to handle. The only complaint I would have about this game is its lack of confirmed achievements, like some of the stuff in this game is extremely tough and I believe there should be some achievements for those who had to suffer terrible breaches such as WK and AP.

IMHO, this game is a blast and super fun to relax with and letting your mind wind down for the day so you can focus on what's in front of you. Fun manager game with a great story and I can't wait to play more of it!",1596680667,1596680667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After a while you are working at a steady pace, know what to work with and are fly through days. Then you get your first Aleph on day 18 and it's liked being being hit in the nuts with a chair. This game shows no mercy for people who make many mistakes and easily forget. You slip up, let CENSORED escape and unless you know what your doing (which is most likely not going to help), you are forced to reset the day (which has no penalties!) The music matches the mood of the game, and the only problem I have is how early you can get and Aleph on your first play through, which doesn't even really bother me since it teaches me how to handle harder abnormalities and ""puts me in my place"". I wouldn't give this game to people who only like action and fighting, since if you know what your doing you most likely won't have to face problems early on. You WILL hit the reset button a lot, and you WILL have to reset a run, but don't worry because all items and skills you learned will be kept, you just lose employees and abnormalities.

""You are a failure, and you always will be.""

That father is Lobotomy Corporation, and as you read this review right now you have a choice to make. You can, if you wish, accept that this man is in his heart a cruel and evil individual whom you have nothing to prove to and no desire to pretend you seek his praise. If that is your opinion then please, disregard this game, it is not for you.

If however you are insulted by this man's lack of faith in you, or feel you can prove to him you are more then he sees you as, with nothing but the chance, ONLY a chance, he will one day gift you with a pat on the back and a firm nod, then you have a difficult road to follow.

You will fail. You will fail again. You will fail so many times it looks hopeless. You will fail over and over and over. But each failure you will look up at this man and see he has not noticed. He already thinks of you as a lost cause. To him, it is no surprise you are in your natural state. He ignores you. Lobotomy Corporation does not judge you for your failures, it has no need to heap insults on you or question your determination. It has decided to let you do as you will and expects nothing from you.

I, like you, fought against that indifference. I worked and worked and did all I could to earn the recognition of my worth. But  just as was expected of me, I failed. I am 90% through this game, but I can't go one step further. 150 hours and I just can't do it. My father was right.

Maybe you're better then me. Maybe you can make it to the end and see what I couldn't. Maybe you can finish what i'm choosing to leave behind. I don't know. but it will be hard, and you WILL fail before you make it there.

You collect new SCPs every day for the people to touch. Touching SCPs generates [REDACTED], which we need for [REDACTED]. Everything is fine and dandy for a very few, precious days. Slowly, you come to the realization that certain SCPs do not like to be touched and will, in fact, rip and tear when given the slightest opportunity. We do not talk about [CENSORED]. Still, we must complete our noble charge of generating [REDACTED], so some of the little people will just have to be forced to touch the dangerous ones. Repeatedly. As [CENSORED] inevitably envelops the fragile flesh of even your most steadfast and valiant operatives and continues to spread across the underground bunker, utterly out of control, you slowly pull your eyes away from the glass viewport and inject the [REDACTED] directly into your bloodstream with your main man netzach. Brooo, that's the way. Sometimes you just need to chill out.

The days turn into weeks and the underground bunker turns into an unrecognizable hellscape ruby goldberg machine that triggers the instant somebody passes gas in the wrong direction.

If anyone wants to try it out, however, I suggest to keep in mind that, while you'd want to try to keep any and all employees alive, especially for the first few playthroughs, that will be almost, if not completely, impossible. Although you can plan for things, and set things up nearly perfectly, RNG can always appear to ruin that plan. It's best to always be lenient, and allow one or two employees to die as you near later days. However this won't let you stay safe, and chances are, due to some of the Abnormalities you'll end up with, you'll have to start a New Game.
But that's why you'd want to sacrifice employees... Everything you learned about those past Abnormalities, and all the equipment you got from them, is still with you. You'll know when they show up, and be able to plan things out even better thanks to having more knowledge than you would've ever had before, and even be able to take on stronger Abnormalities without any casualties.

So, if you're into the idea of managing a bunch of mysterious, maybe-deadly-maybe-safe creatures not bound by the laws of reality like you're in charge of the SCP Facility, this is definitely the game for you.

This game's design is Hearts of Iron 4 levels of convoluted. But now at least the translation is comprehensible and makes sense. Everything is properly translated so it is easier to understand. There is a lot of mechanics to weigh and understand. It's promising so I'm going to continue to play it more after this review and if my opinion changes I'll update this.

The justification for the entire game premise is 100% an excuse plot and the presentation is very much ""anime-esque"" not just in visual but in the tonality of how things are presented, which is to say, very weak. This is very disappointing... but the game quickly glosses over it and moves onto the SCP/RPC material so you can handwave the nonsense story away and just get to playing an RPC like game.

My biggest grievance with LobCo so far is the game has only one theme which plays on repeat ad-nausium
I muted the music and just put on some iron cthulhu apocalypse which very seriously changed the atmosphere and theme of the game from something relatively light hearted in its handling of heavy subject matter into something dark and menacing. Which was much more enjoyable. This game's music is its biggest weakness. The tonal shift in the theme from the subject matter is cognitive dissonance and not only is the song annoying but it really distracts from the game's narrative.

Once you get around the incredibly heavy handed mechanics of the game it has a lot of potential. I like the risk of exploration that's involved. This is totally how the RPC/SCP groups would handle their entities. It's all about the danger of trying to understand something that is outside conventional understanding. Things will go wrong, stuff won't make sense. You will have to risk staff and they will die as you try to figure out what it is you're dealing with. Some of these entities get so weird and unknowable that there's a real challenge in disassembling their nature. I wish this was better explored, however, where you'd spend more time understanding something than what the game has. The system in place I feel makes it a little too easy to comprehend something over time. I'd like it more if it was, I guess, more rogue like and the anomalies were more difficult to understand with a much more involved process to debunk them with the risk being your entire game. That would add much more tension to the experience.

1st step. before level 4 qlipoth, put 3 employees that is just okay to be dead in binah's team so they can manage abnormalies when binah put meltdowns on them.

2nd step. press space hoping that none of your employees panic or die (if they panic, try to break them from panic if you can) and send them to abnnormalies to weaken binah while calling rabbit protocal 

3rd step. when rabbit protocal skipped binah's first phase (or skipped 2nd phase if you're lucky) try to use employees to surpress binah, dodging her pattern (when she says something, move.)

I love the themes and characters, it's a story I don't think will age badly, if anything it's the opposite. I honestly wonder how Library of Ruina can top this. It's sad the game was badly translated for so long, you can't just google translate a visual novel.

Okay so here's the part about the gameplay and the management part is really not that hard lol, one monster likes white work, other one will kill your agent if you try it. Trial and error is the name of the game, do it right and you will unlock info that tells you how to work on an abnormality without ever losing employees. Ordeals are different but you can always retry to do it again or get a new one. People are just really forgetful and not willing to admit their mistakes, they make this out to be Eve Online level of micromanagement or something when it's really not. Yes, there are hard parts I didn't mention but there's not that many of them.

Some tips: Get a few mods to lessen the grind(Full-Time Employees is one I HEAVILY reccomend). Don't listen to Angela and take care of your agents(guys you control), you need them to progress and while I don't encourage trying to be jesus, if they keep dying every day you will not have a good time. Abnormalities are really cool and creative but try to keep them in their boxes, the first time an abnormality escapes is really fun, the second time is a sign of your failure. Want to finish the game legitimately? Prepare for a heavy grind and like 100 hours of box clicking.

This is a fairly decent management game, with a fairly simple management idae, you get one new thing to manage every day, you pick 1 of 4 ways to manage it, and you learn how it reacts. Your people get stronger based on the ways they help manage your new monsters, and can equip things to help deal with escapes.

Where this game shines is that the monsters that you manage all have their own very specific intricacies/guidelines that you need to both learn and follow, and these make them all feel like their own interesting SCP's to manage. The extremely different ways that these may require handling beyond the 4 ways of management, and the ways they can react, make them all interesting to learn. As the game progresses you learn more about how to deal with your new ""abnormalities"", whether naturally or unlocking information about them. 

That said, this game is definitely not meant to be completed your first time in. Mismanagement of the abnormalities will kill your worker, which may lead to escapes and further deaths. Challenges you are required to beat may lead to over half your staff dying. If you have too many people die, you won't be able to manage some of the abnormalities correctly, which will lead to further deaths. Information of the specifics of how to handle your abnormalities can be unlocked by managing them at any degree of success, and sometimes it can be hard to understand what you're doing wrong until its directly told to you.

That being the case, this game has a wonderful reset feature, where you can either reset to the last 5 day increment, or from the very beginning, with all the information you have unlocked and equipment you've gained. You also have the option of resetting the day completely, as if it hadn't happened yet. This resetting is key to the game and you're going to want to do it at least once if not more, even from the beginning. The challenges you complete give you permanent upgrades that make resets far easier to start out on.

As you get through the game, the story will slowly be told to you from various perspectives, all leading up to a larger picture. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story, but because it is based on your progression through challenges (which only need to be completed once), it will come in very uneven chunks based on how well you are doing. The abnormalities all have their own descriptions as well that are fantastic to read, and give the guidelines of how to handle the abnormalities more context.

I fully recommend this game to anyone who likes management games or the concept of SCP-like things.

And for a game like this, I wouldn't really want to use outside wiki to tell me what to do.

Lots of the above might be design choices, that player is supposed to advance trough trial and error alone. And that the UI is supposed to be poor to make the game harder. The problem with that is that it takes a huge amount of time and effort to play the game. Solving a problem does not remove the said problem, you may very likely encounter the same problem in following day. Every day takes more time than the last, every new monster takes longer to figure out than the last and every day there is increasing chance for the day to fail.

I did enjoy this game quite a lot at first. In the end the UI and the amount of time this game requires made me not enjoy playing this game anymore.",1593297853,1593298358,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
568220,71516164,76561198264106921,0,1,6592,0,5825,1699348580,"I saw one (1) picture of Netzach on twitter and having just come from Fire Emblem my brain went ""Well I liked another green haired man, what's to say I won't love this one?

Cut to almost 100 hours of screaming, crying and begging my employees to ""just please stay alive"" over and over I can wholeheartedly say this game is definitely the most enjoyable thing I've ever come across. 

It starts out overwhelming - the machanics are a lot of things thrown at you at once, but thankfully the tutorial makes a fun way to get to grips with things, and you are always gifted an ""easy"" abnormality first time around to help you get the hang of things. Then it quickly starts to ramp up the action with the trial-and-error nature of learning about each abnormality and how to best get energy from them to progress your game. Even if it's grindy and requires restarts - you'll come across new abnormalities each time around and there's lots to think of and consider in how you need to build your facility to better suit your objective for the run. (Eg: I need ALEPHs for Gebura or I want non-breaching abnormalities for the Suppressions).

The Characters are full of twists and genuine emotion, and all lovingly designed. Must say, getting the art book absolutely added to the enjoyment as I can see all the details and sketches that have gone into the facility and the abnormalities themselves. Each creation has its own story and it's a genuine pleasure to discover each one. It's also neat that one can customise the employees themselves so adding in your friends/family/OCs/self to see how long you/they survive before something eats (or worse) them! 

All in all, the fact that it took me almost 60 hours to unlock 10% towards the true ending (and now, 100 hours in I'm only at 40%) shows it was absolutely worth the £20 i spent on it and then some! I've even gifted it to friends so that they might share this glorious hell with me.

Basically, you are hired to be the manager of a facility for studying different things called ""Abnormalities"". These things range from weird doodads that can turn back time or make you completely bald, to horrifying monsters that will either eat you or do some other horrid thing to you.

You're tasked with sending your employees to study these Abnormalities in 4 different ways, with each having their own results. Some may be more effective than others, but until you actually fill out the information page of the Abnormality, it's basically up to chance. (That is if you don't just have the Wiki up in the background)

It gets harder over time as you deal with more Abnormalities at a time, which could end up working together to cause maximum chaos if you're not careful. However, if anything were to escape from their rooms, you can send your employees to suppress them. Studying these Abnormalities can grant your employees interesting equipment for combat and protection. There are also missions you can work on throughout your average day, these are linked to progression in the story, so do that.

The story is...interesting, and not really something I can go over in this review. Everything's not as simple as it may seem, and you might even have to bend the rules a bit and turn back time to have more than the default amount of days you have until reaching the neutral ending.

Whilst the gameplay might not be too amazing for those who enjoy action focused games, the lore and world building this game provides is fucking great.

This game is unfair. There are many different mechanics that you have to juggle involving the abnormalities to avoid disaster, each unique and most of the time incredibly difficult to keep track of. On top of that, there are some cases in which you end up getting abnormalities that have rules that contradict another, so you end up having to either put up with the horrible things that entitles or reset a few days to hope you get a better roll. By the way, resetting is also an integral part of the game. You'll most likely be forced to sacrifice progress to go back and grind better employees or equipment to have a fighting chance, meaning having to redo hours of work in some cases. Then after that, the game has boss fights that make trying to get through a normal day into a nightmare by instilling EVEN MORE rules.
This game is rigged against you. It will beat you up. It wont forgive you for missing even a single beat. It will get you no matter how well you think you know the game and it'll expect you to either persevere or try again for the 10th time. To be brutally honest, it's massively unbalanced and the devs know it because that's exactly what they want, while at the same time expecting you to get through it. It's stressful and infuriating 
...but, even after countless retries, over 100 hours of trial and error, and chipping away at this game on and off for over a year and only finishing it today, I can't say I hate it. Even though the devs didn't pull their punches when designing this game, they don't necessarily insult you for your failures either. It's a hard game and they know it, but they also know that with enough time and patience, they know you can win. It's reflected with the themes in the story and the dialog written; no matter how bad things are, it's still possible to get through it. That's why I like this game so much. It doesn't patronize you by making things do less damage, it doesn't make gear cost less when you lose too many employees, it doesn't do any of that. It gives you a difficult challenge and you try to conquer it. This ties incredibly well with the story too, but I'd rather not spoil anything. Personally, I don't really care too much for stories in games, but this game has so many layers and a lot of thought put into it's world that I couldn't help but get invested. The more you learn the more you realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes. There really isn't anything quite like this game.

It's honestly hit or miss. It's incredibly difficult and it doesn't get easy. The best way to gauge if you'd like it or not is by watching a video on the first few days and see if it interests you at all. Probably to like up to day 10. You might not like it and that's okay; just pass on this game, but if you DO end up liking what you see, then you'll no doubt enjoy what this game has to offer.",1592124666,1593036983,True,289,5,0.956698238849639893,0,True,False,False

This Game will not be suitable to people that lack determination and the ability to endure pain and frustration over and over again (unless you've beaten a Dark Souls-like game). It is a Korean game which theme is based off the SCP universe, with Fallout Shelter-like management mechanics, and anime-like design. As of recently, the Revised English translation has been added which improved the dialogue (I only recently bought it after it came out, so I don't know how bad it was before), and for the most part, not many complaints coming from me.

Story: (No spoliers, just very basic run down.)
You are the manager for this facility. The facility is divided into different departments, with a different Sephirah (essentially the Head of the Department) that report to you. You command employees (essentially D-Class, but not criminals, just people who needed work) who directly follow your orders. There are Abnormalities which you must work on using employees and gain energy boxes from them until you reach your daily quota. Overtime, you unlock more difficult Abnormalities and more departments, which allow you to gain more equipment and special abilities to maintain order. There are three different endings to achieve and a number of varying Abnormalities you may or may not meet (depending how many playthroughs you do to unlock them all).

Mechanics:
As explained above, essentially it is similar to Fallout Shelter. You can create and customize employees to hearts desire (or as much as you can compensate if you are trying to create a certain replica of a character). Hairstyles are kinda of limited to Asian hairstyles and you can't change skin colour. Overtime, if they still live (gets hard to keep them alive), they will level up their stats which, for the most part, will make them better prepared to deal with the Abnormalities. You can also stack points you earn from how well you do the other day to either upgrade an employee or create a new one. Abnormalities not only provide you with energy, but with equipment, weapons, and gifts. These can be acquired after you research the Abnormality enough times and bank up enough spare energy to create them (gifts are earned by probability when working with them). As you pass more days and unlock and complete more missions/tasks from the Sephirahs, you can respectively expand/open more departments and unlock new abilities as mention above that can be used to help maintain the peace. Moreover, as days pass, you unlock new Abnormalities. You generally get to choose one of three per day with their serial number and a quote of theirs which give you a small sense of what they might be.

Difficulty:
This game is designed to be frustrating. There is a reason why you can restart a day or rewind to a memory repository (didn't mention this, but every 5 days, it saves it in the repository [For example: Day 1, 6, 11, 16...]. It basically reverts you back to that day as the same but with knowledge kept of the Abnormalities you unlocked after the memory day. It gives you a way to avoid a certain Abnormality and a potential to choose a new one). It is possible to keep all you employees you have alive throughout the game (which I am currently doing) but from personal experience, it can be really difficult and time consuming. Overall, if you can't handle this or would prefer to keep your sanity, then go ahead and avoid the game. But if you want something challenging and interesting, then this game might be for you.

Price:
The price of this game is $28.99 CDN, which may seem a lot. For someone who likes the SCP universe, anime, and management/strategy games, it is worth. You can get a couple of different games with the different endings which makes it playable for hours to come. However, eventually you will unlock everything and the sandbox mode doesnt add much to it (from what I heard). You could also wait for a sale if you need to save money, but for the most part, this game is worth what you get (especially with all these bad AAA games trend going on, thanks 2019, 2020). Overall, if you believe you will play the game to the end, then it is worth.

In conclusion, this game of interesting and diverse cast of characters and abnormalities makes the story intriguing. Frustration can arise as you encounter more difficult circumstances but as you play, you can retry multiple times and devise new strategies or plans that allow you to be creative on how you personally will run the facility. Their lives are in your hands. Good luck.",1592779400,1592779400,True,20,0,0.674867808818817139,0,True,False,False

Despite the rough translation and other issues it may have, I've fallen love due to the various abnormalities that you have to manage, as well as the co-workers the manager (me/you!) meet in the surprisingly deep story this game has (if you can process things past the janky translation).

Things do get pretty infuriating at times near the end, though. But that could just be me being terrible at games.

If you like management games and want to delve into unknown horrors that will probably kill most of your employees? Maybe try it out.
I would suggest going into things blind, mostly because a) the mystery of finding out how dangerous something is is part of the fun, and b) it does keep certain kinds of information/items/benefits every playthrough so you don't go in completely blind every run (unless you choose to.)

If you've received this, congratulations!! We have reviewed your CV and determined you are the one to take on the position of Manager at our Corporation, you fulfil all the criteria and skills that we feel will be your most challenging task. 

As you are aware, we at L Corp are the largest energy companies in fact the only company appointed to power the world we live in. We strive for excellent delivery of energy to our homes and humanity due to this purpose, and our founder A has placed high expectations on us to achieve this every day. But before we continue, please examine the L-Pad we provided that details the contract's terms and conditions that you must accept. If not, press 'Refuse' and step away from the L-pad's blast radius of one kilometre.

....

Thank you for accepting your contract's terms and conditions. Level manager clearance acquired.

To continue, we must first address the rumours surrounding the corporation. Aside from the two prominent rumours that states our employees engage in after hour orgies and that we are a greedy, soulless corporation sucking the lifestream out of the planet to power humanity all rumours are true. Our energy source come from monsters we call Abnormalities, who either come to us or have been captured for their threat to the world at large and we interact with them to acquire the Positive Enkephelin boxes which stores the power siphoned from them. 

Your duty as acting Manager is to take care of these Abnormalities we secure, contain them in our facility, then siphon the energy. Simple, right? However, we should not forget to mention that we've gone through 35 managers in the past month before coming to you, and that's not including employee casualties from things such as: 

Possession and the urge to wear red shoes
Insanity from looking at incomprehensible beings
Sacrifice lottery draws
Mental breakdown
Suicides
Testing tools and machines
Participating in blasphemy and heresy of other kinds

As you can see from the above, your new job provides the appropriate challenge you crave. To survive, we will give you the first steps:

Work is divided into four categories: Instinct, Insight, Temperance and Justice which enhances your employees' health, mental fortitude, success at work and work speed. Abnormalities that are new bring unknowns so it is recommended you send your employees to prod and determine their threat level and what they respond to the best. Don't be afraid if they die, your subordinates are paving the way to discovery.

We classify our creatures from least to most dangerous: Zayin, Teth, He, WAW and finally ALEPH who are contained securely in their cells for you. As we bring in each abnormality at the end of each day, we give no indication of their threat level but only brief quotes and numbers to keep you guessing. Why? In the spirit of exploration and setting your own challenge against creatures unknown the next day for the most energy of course! Note that the more dangerous they are, the more energy you can afford.

If the creatures do get out, our staff are equipped with the most basic riot gear though with research time and energy, our Welfare team can create EGO weapons and suits to defend against these monsters, but only through sacrificing PE boxes to unlock Abnormality information fully so we can get a full profile of what they do. Trust me, you don't want to see what happened when we used incomplete information to make a suit, the employee's remains had to be torn from the parasitic suit. Angela will explain more.

With this advice given, we again extend our welcome to you, the new Manager of Lobotomy Corporation!! With the threat of death everyday out there...what do you have to lose with us?

Not perfect, of course, but still good and difficult. The concept is that you are the manager of a company that contains and harvests energy from abnormalities. You manage your agents and their work as well as try to keep the abnormalities from causing chaos. The best part of the game is just encountering new abnormalities and learning about their quirks, as you have no knowledge of them upon your first encounter. Sometimes, nothing horrible will happen and you will be relieved about the danger you avoided. Sometimes, something unknown and horrible happens, and it's your job to deal with the situation. You also have to figure out how to go about your day to day stuff collecting energy with the new threat inside the facility.

I was expecting a game similar to fallout shelter but that isn't what I got.  You have very limited control of what rooms are placed.  The group research choices ultimately don't matter as you unlock all of them fairly quickly.
It does have a bit of a rogue-like approach to it that every time you start over you carry your research, group and monster, as well as your equipment with you making each following trip through easier.
But then there's the RNG and hidden details.
You have 2 choices: 
1. Check the wiki in advance so you know which monster the different numbers mean and plan your approach accordingly with the data sheet on a second screen.
2. Choose with what the game tells you and when it kills you the first few times restart the day until you know what it does. Then unlock the research for that monsters so it tells you what it does so you don't have to remember or re-check the wiki.  After the monster is fully researched by either approach you can move on to the next day.
As for the RNG you can do the same action with the same character and get a good result one time and a bad result the next (there is a normal/medium result in between there).  While some RNG can be fun this just pushes it a little further than I like.
It is very much a unique game and I wish I could give a better choice than yes or no for recommending the game.  I would honestly say watch a lets play of it if you can find one just to see it.  Despite saying I don't recommend it I am glad I took it for a spin.  I just won't finish it.  It isn't difficult, it's just chaotic and frustrating.

The game can be very difficult and punishes the hell out of you for rushing things and losing focus.

There are also helpful abnormalities that while can still cause damage if used incorrectly, generally benefit the facility. These helpful abno's can range from almost no draw backs to absolute carnage if used improperly. The music is great, from calming almost elevator like chimes in times of peaceful work, to some of the best combat osts in a moments notice when you screw something up.

I'll try my best in this review to avoid spoilers, but disclaimer right from the start, do NOT look up anything about this game or some of the cool mystery will be taken away from you.

Lobotomy Corporation is a game where you manage a joint SCP containment facility and power company. I think it perfectly captures the feel of just how dangerous and weird working in such an environment is, while maintaining that amoral corporation feel. While the game is difficult and involves some trial and error, it never feels tedious since you can immediately retry the day if you don't like the outcome. Or if you feel like you've fallen too far behind, you can go to the last 5 day milestone you've hit to try and come up with a different gameplan for the week.

Although there are some legitimate complaints to be had about this game, I think they can be excused for the most part.
-The english translation is passable and does its job, but there are a few immersion breaking flaws here and there along with the occasional unnatural-sounding sentence. 
-The nature of dealing with new abnormalities and the fact you are very likely to do something wrong and kill one of your employees until you learn more about it could be frustrating. However, I do think this can be excused due to the fact you can restart the day whenever you want and the nature of the game.
-Customization, something purely cosmetic that doesn't give you any gameplay advantage at all, costs currency. Granted, it's only one LOB which is nothing later on in the game, but the fact it costs something at all is a bad choice IMO. Just let me customize my people.
-You will not beat this game on your first run. The odds are just far too stacked against you to possibly beat the game on your first try due to lacking EGO gear and likely not having optimized employees. But there is the upside that there are enough abnormalities so you will be seeing new ones very often on a restart. Also, you keep all EGO gear and abnormality information you unlocked on restart.
-Some stuff that should be in the game by default like a fast-forward button has to be researched as well as the ability to see health bars. This is like the only big complaint I have though besides customization.

I'm not good with ratings, but I seriously love this game. I would easily give it an 8/10. If and when the english translation has only a few flaws, i'll easily bump this rating to an 8.5/10. Very good job, Project Moon! I only wish I knew of this game when the kickstarter was active.

HOWEVER.
WORST. TUTORIAL. I. HAVE. EVER. SEEN. 
JESUS CHRIST. 30 YEARS OF GAMING. MOST OBTUSE CONFUSING MESS I HAVE EVER SEEN EVER. 
The game's themes are heavily based on Kabbalah: I have studied Kabbalah. KABBALAH IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAN THE FEKING TUTORIAL. 
AND THIS IS *AFTER* THE UPDATED IMPROVED TRANSLATION.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW BAD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR EARLIER PLAYERS.
HOLY. *CRAP!*

....so, yeah, it is a genuinely really interesting game, and I think I'll get a lot of fun out of it. but good god this is a Master Class on how NOT to do a tutorial or teach playing. 
examples? randomly pausing and unpausing time, telling me I can do that ""at any time"" and then disabling that function during the tutorial. so some long paragraphs went by in 5 seconds before I had a chance to read them. redid the same tutorial 4 times: still couldn't read it even with foreknowledge and speed reading. and then when I was trying to follow directions, suddenly time would stop, and I'd have to pan around the screen searching for what the hell it wanted me to look at now, because it doesn't move the camera for you when it wants you to see something. in a tutorial. oy vey.

...I could go on ranting for hours about how mind-bogglingly terrible the tutorial is, but I won't. I will say: 
Cool theme, obvious SCP etc influences, interesting to have the Kabbalah stuff in there too, nice art style, overall, it seems pretty cool, it really does.

but whomever made the tutorial should be put in a pilory in the public square and have rotten vegetables thrown at them for the rest of their lives *oh my god it's the worst i've ever seen* O__O

so, beware, it doesn't have a learning curve, it has a learning WALL. a wall that is electrified and covered in razor wire and that has a personal grudge against you.

Add a little of the Butterfly Effect and you've got this game.

This is an SCP-inspired game which manages to screw you over far more than help you, yet still somehow engages you with it's charm. Fun looking yet intimidating creatures, Waifus (Myo is best girl.) and fun characters, and a quite disturbing stories which support eachother are what make this game. You can make your own waifus too, in the shape of employees (even if it costs you a bit more.), but the employees can also die permanently, and if your favorite dies you can expect a reset.

I really can recommend this game if you can stand having to reset the same level a bunch of times before you finally manage to beat it, just to get the satisfaction of finally surpassing that awful day and seeing your employees grow both ingame and on you.

The problem is that from first hand experience and research from the community this game has MEMORY LEAKAGE meaning your game can crash if you play the game too long.

Now here arises the issues:
1. What if you play too long in one session? Thats ok, but annoying especially if you lose massive progress because this game saves on a cycle. You won’t lose much since saves after completing a mission, but you can lose progress.
2. THIS IS THE MAKE OR DEAL BREAKER if play this game casually or not into optimization you might want to downright PASS this game. Some boss battles can take a while due to it being long. It is uncertain if your computer can or cannot handle the memory leakage or not even my beast of a computer cannot handle the memory leakage ( for example a piece of my rig is i7). Now if you just an average joe there might be a high chance your game will crash during boss fights and become in completely

I feel as though the large level of difficulty in this game makes it feel much more rewarding when you end up beating one of the days with no employees killed, this isn't purely a psychological thing as the game itself also rewards you with LOB points to spend on hiring employees and upgrading existing ones.

The fact that it's so difficult to reach the next day (at least with no casualties) makes you much more invested in the story, at least that's what I found as I felt that I had earnt the progression in the story. This is amplified by the fact that some of the things you do and see in the facility have an impact on the story or are tied into it which I won't talk about any further due to potential spoilers.

In terms of gameplay it can get quite tedious later on like day 25+ and it normally requires you to play the game at normal speed due to the sheer amount of abnormalities you have to manage but earlier on you can get away with playing at 2x speed. The gameplay (sort of) loop can get repetitive as I've mentioned but I always found myself coming back and playing again regardless, the standard day normally involves you consistently dishing out work to employees to go and do a specific type of work on an abnormality this can be Instinct, Insight, Attachment and Repression though with some abnormalities one of these types of work may be replaced with a special type.

Abnormalities respond to certain types of work better than others so this is where information gathering comes into play, you need to spend the special P.E boxes you get from working on a particular abnormality to get access to information regarding how well it responds to certain types of work + any other actions the abnormality may take and under what conditions e.g. what happens when it's individual ""Qliphoth Counter"" reaches 0?

If you find that a certain abnormality responds better to Instinct work then you would send in an employee with a high level of instinct.

In terms of music it can get very repetitive after an hour of playing so it would probably be better to turn it off at this point though the changes in music give critical information like if a abnormality has escaped containment or not so there's a trade off with this.

Overall, I greatly enjoy this game the great story and interesting mechanics paired with the fair difficulty of the game keep me coming back to it.

I’m a huge fan of management games and horror (in particular SCP, which this game is unashamedly inspired by). I can’t remember exactly why I found it so hard to get into, but my guess is it was the incomprehensible English translation. So I shelved it as a game that I wanted to like, and just couldn’t. 

A few weeks ago, the game was entirely retranslated, so I reinstalled it. In those two weeks I played something obscene like 50 hours of it. I am so hooked. 

Don’t get me wrong, the writing still isn’t anything outstanding, but now that the game doesn’t have an impenetrable fog of truly abysmal localization, the gem in there shines through. The game is about managing a prison full of nightmares, monsters, and anomalous artifacts - it’s really the “SCP Tycoon” I had always hoped it was. When you get an Abnormality for the first time, you’ll have no idea how to manage it, and your employees will die - a lot. Slowly you’ll earn a series of entries which explain its rules: some Abnormalities are simple, like it hates a certain kind of work procedure. But some of the rules are fiendishly clever - requiring you to come up with your own real world procedures to stop you from making mistakes (my desk has a few index cards with counters and notes for various containment techniques). By the end of a run you’ll have dozens of creatures, all with different demands - one wrong move, and you can start a chain reaction of breaches which will end your game. 

The structure of the game is really unique as well. It’s kind of a rogue like, in that you are encouraged to start over but with persistent upgrades which make each run easier, but there’s no permadeath, you can try any day over. It’s sort of real time, but kind of turn based - explaining what I mean would rob you of the fun of figuring it out, but it reminds me of Dungeon of the Endless. It has the fun XCOM feeling of growing attached to your little guys, whose humanity is eroded as they work in your facility, but they die so frequently you have to get over that. Besides, it’s the Abnormalities who are the real cast of characters. And even though the writing never grabbed me, the plot did start to get compelling. And I just could not stop digging deeper into the earth and growing my prison full of horrors. 

The experience is playing wack a mole while memorizing and internalizing an ever growing set of rules to follow. If that sounds stressful, well, it absolutely is. But it’s actually really satisfying to throw up your hands and watch your ant farm get devoured by eldritch abominations. And there is so much to discover - this is a huge, really generous game which takes a long time to show you everything it has for you. Not for everyone, but if it sounds like it’s for you you have to give it a try.",1589826801,1589826801,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They're grindy, miserable hours of trying the same level over and over again. Retries are free, encouraging you to hit the retry button whenever you lose a good agent which is basically necessary in a game where so many random bullshit deaths occur. There's anomalies in this game that can quite literally, instantly end the run out of nowhere and it's very obvious the retry button is a clumsy way to account for those moments. The progression system is just inordinately terrible and punishes you for expending resources you've acquired to try and meet the in game goals. Replacing those resources can be a matter of hours and it basically just encourages a 1 playthrough mindset. 

The secret of this game is most things are not inherently harmful. There exists a handful of bad choices you can make (which you won't know about until you've picked them) but that is basically the only threat in the game. There's very little genuine experimentation or discovery because you're handed everything you need to know without discovering it for yourself. Much of the game is performing the same rote actions over and over. 

I can see why people enjoy this, hell I have derived some enjoyment from it. It's definitely the best (and only) SCP Foundation simulator on the market.

The game itself is simple. You got a bunch of boxes. Send a dude to a box to do a color thing to the box which generates victory points. Score enough, clear the day. Of course, the boxes have otherworldly monsters in them and they're picky. The rules keep piling on as you get more and more monsters. It should be simple, clean, and fun.

The problem is each day drags on forever. You don't know the rules of each new box, so you send someone in and they get killed instantly. Restart the day. You play along a bit, the meter fills, the monster busts out, you don't have the gear for a fight, restart the day. A botch is almost always a restart and these aren't quick days. The game just ends up being the longest most tedious game of Simon Says which each single new rule requiring a bunch of restart trial and error.

The theme of the game suggests you should expect your dudes to die, and in practice you get enough cash to hire quite a few, but most botches are worth entire sections of your team wiped out, including the high level guy who is the only one who can handle reliably the high level monster that just showed up so that's a restart too. There are no small screw ups. 

This just adds up to a giant fucking waste of your time. You're doing the same crap every day just slightly longer and with one more stupid rule but you're going to only be hitting the 3 most lucrative and needy monsters a day so you're just watching three meters go up over and over and over again and then you position everyone for the monster that spawns after X turns and then back to meters.

The straw that broke the camel's back was me getting a timer button. In practice, it is literally a button with one rule: Press every 30 in game seconds or else everyone in your base dies. After ten hours the game wants to throw an egg timer at me so now I can't veg out watching the boring meters fill because I have to hit the button every 15 seconds (in x2 speed) or else everyone will die. Fuck you too game.

On a side note, there's combat and it's just a gear check of your mans swinging at the monster until a meter goes to zero. You would think because it is VITALLY IMPORTANT to retreat the person getting focused by the monster as their health drops, the game would make it easy to see the health bars of everyone in a fight and select them individually. You thought wrong. They all stack atop each other because it's a 2D game and you have to page through the employee roster by department to see their health, and you can't pick them out from there apart from ""Cancel attacking"" which works wonders if and only if their last order was not to ""hang out in the hall currently being attacked.""

Also just because there is nowhere else to put this, for some stupid reason this game has two different meters called Qliphoth that represent two completely different tracks, increment in different ways, and have different results. So if you have trouble understanding the rules, just think of one as a time track until something happens and another as the monster mood

That said, compared to the monster box gameplay, that crap is manageable and intuitive. I appreciate the theme but honestly this overlong, tedious, terribly paced game can go jump in a lake. While I can't pretend that having to work around the moodswings of some of these ridiculous monsters isn't cool, their quirks wear out their welcome well before you finish the first of many required clears.

The random events and pseudo random ""Monsters"" you get can and will straight up force you to reset and maybe even force to abandon an entire run when you get really unlucky. I don´t mind ""hard"" games, but this is the bad kind of hard.

You straight up take a 1 in 4 guess whenever you encounter a new ""Monster"". Sometimes nothing bad happens - other times it straight up instakills you which is highly frustrating.

Other times you get punished for using a ""known good"" way a 2nd time or some other unforseeable b/s.

Yes, the lore/writing explains these things, but usually when this happens you didn´t have those ""hints"" unlocked yet. So you just die and have to restart the day. At least that part is somewhat forgiving. You can just do that and then won´t fall into the same trap again. Leaves a sour taste in my mouth though. I´m sorry, but when i am supposed to metagame from the get go, that is just weird design. it is actually intentional that people die and i understand that.

I really dig the general idea of the game and the lore is really the main draw to this. After several frustrating runs i ended up watching some lets play to get an idea what i maybe doing wrong. That somewhat helped with the experience.

Having the Wiki open negates a lot of the ""unfair"" insta kills, but that straight up ruins the experience.

The game is a lot like XCOM in that regard. You can customize characters and get attached to them, only for the game to take them away from you after a while. Personally i handle this really poorly and that will most likely result in me dropping the game REALLY FAST, but that is just me.

The ""boss fights"" i saw in the let´s plays later on are really creative and i can see why people like this game. I can tell a lot of love went into this project and the buisness model is straight forward.

Despite that, deep down I felt like I was lying to myself and went back to play more. Soon enough I got over my fears and surprisingly became a huge fan of this ""SCP"" management theme where we send employees to work, studying and trying to contain these abnormalities (while harvesting energy from them). I became unusually addicted to this indie game to the point where I eventually achieved 100% completion a couple days ago after so many hours.

Only things that were rough was:
- Farming for EGO and your employee stats could be a bit tedious (Not too bad for me since I would usually be doing other things while playing the game).
- That one bug that really annoyed me where an employee would become permanently out of control, then when you end the day...they would usually instantly die.

Other than that, I adore this game a ton. If anyone wants to try it they truly should but just know it might be frustrating/challenging in the beginning depending on what abnormality you get. You totally WILL have to restart all the way to the 1st day later on (a couple times at most), but you keep everything you worked for so it is all uphill. But the most important thing is you really should try to keep people alive in the early run because if they die they can lose that superior gear you worked for UNTIL you actually get the better upgrades in the future. But don't sweat it too much, you probably get enough to re-acquire the lost goods.

Personally I would give this game an 8.5/10 mainly due to still persisting bugs, but the game play and challenge is great, the art style is lovable, the music is absolutely astonishing, and the story is pretty rich. It is quite a unique game and very captivating. This game will always have a place in my heart, and I look forward to their sequel in the works as well.

Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs). The real-world website is community-based and includes elements of many genres such as horror, science fiction, and urban fantasy.

On the SCP Foundation wiki, the majority of works consist of ""special containment procedures"": structured internal documentation that describes an SCP object and the means of keeping it contained. The website also contains thousands of ""Foundation Tales"", short stories set within the universe of the SCP Foundation. The series has been praised for its ability to convey horror through its scientific and academic writing style, as well as for its high standards of quality.

Helpfully - or perhaps as another attack on perfectionists - you do have the option of starting the game again with all your current research still completed (if I'm reading the description right) which probably means you can avoid picking certain Abnormalities that are significant pains to house (oh, right, every time a new Abnormality is housed at your facility, you're given a choice of three with cryptic descriptions), or singularly useless like the one I chose that *always* kills the employee assigned to interact with it, meaning to complete the game in it's entirety you'll probably have to make a few goes of it or check out a guide.

But let me explain the game for you because it is not that easy. There will be alot going on at the same time.

In Lobotomy Corporation you play as the manager and take control of every worker in the facility. Your goal is to harvest energy by working with the various paranormal entities which are called ""Abnomalities"". This can be done with ease. There are 4 different methods that every worker is capable of: Instict, Insight, Attachment and Repression.  But not all methods are equally good. Every abnormality has a preferred method to be worked with. You can read everything at the information screen of the abnormality. But there is the twist. You need to unlock those things little by little with the energy you gain by working with them. So basically you need to let a worker do his work completely blindfolded. You do not know if the chosen method is the best. The abnormalities will behave different depending on their mood after someone worked with it . If you are unlucky you will have a negative result which can cause various things. From losing energy to killing of your workers or an insane worker who is doing mad stuff. 

Expect to retry the day after messing up. And you will mess up a lot. After you finished your goal for the day you can retry. 

Once you get used to the basic mechanics of the game you will have alot of fun. Every abnormality has its unique and scary design and story behind it. Also they are sort by a ranking system, telling the player how dangerous the abnormality is.

The general experience of the game is getting new monsters and objects and learning how they work. Some trial and  error is required, often resulting in the deaths of employees. Once a monster is understood, its threat is greatly reduced and it becomes manageable. The more dangerous monsters will enact a greater toll before this occurs. While inherently not a bad system, it does have a few glaring flaws. The penalty for losing important employees is quite severe, often game-ending. The more dangerous monsters are likely to simple devour crappy employees, so you have to use your more experienced ones. Since you can restart any ""round"" as many times as you want, learning different monsters becomes a tedious process of feeding them your best employees until you understand them and then retrying the level with this knowledge. In other words, this game starts to break down when you try to meta-game it. This would normally be okay, but since losing a couple important employees can end a run, there's almost no incentive to play the game the way it is ""meant"" to be played.

The longer the game goes, the more you have to manage. Some monsters will kill any employee who worked on them if that employee goes to work on another monster. So while you're dealing with a problem and assign such an employee without thinking about it, you can kill them. Some monsters can only be worked on by employees with very specific stats. This can be fun, but it can also be overwhelming. This is made worse by the intentionally clunky interface and lack of basic commands to make controlling your employees easy. The interface is intended to be basic to force the player to use more focus, increasing the danger of monsters that require focus in order to prevent disaster.

In order to win a round, you have to generate enough resources. So in the backround while you're managing disasters, you still need to generate that base income. It feels like macro play in an RTS in a lot of ways (which isn't that surprising considering the Korean origins of this game.)

You will probably enjoy the game if the following applies to you:
1. You like SCP
2. You like games that force you to multitask

4. You like starcraft or similar games where player focus is a resource

I think that perhaps the best aspect of this game is the way it scares you. while the artstyle and some of the monsters are less then scary. the REAL horror comes from you as the manager having to poke and prod these monsters to figure out what the hell they do. and you cant just ignore them or else they'll escape potentially causing mass havoc. this leads to the decision of risking a employees life or playing the lottery and hoping its a ""non-escapable"" object which cant escape.

luckily the game allows you to redo a day with no consequences if you completely mess up meaning that with time you can learn how to counter these monsters in a single day of work. but the initial fear and stress of what that monster does is more then enough to make you think twice before sending in just anyone on the next monster. while the reward for researching these monsters is PE boxes, special gear, and the history of these monsters. starting a new game also allows you to get different monsters on different days while keeping all research on previous monsters intact and still having access to their equipment. and you WILL need to reset atleast once because you'll most likely hit a wall where you cant care for a specific monster and it just destroys the facility everytime you start the day

The game centers around risk management and this part of the game is handled really well, basically the first game I've played were I am constantly weighing the risk and benefits while keeping the quota of the day in mind and my own self-set goals. The game also has a lot of interesting lore and character development. There's also a lot of mods for this game on top of it's normal replay value. There are a few things keeping this game down,the main complaint I hear is about stability issues but I haven't had any problems with this and I'm willing to bet most of it is because of mods. There are also some quality of life issues like the fact that you have to unlock being able to see your employees health and have to go to a different menu for a wile, this isn't the biggest issue because seeing employee health doesn't become important till later anyway but this is just one of a few UI improvements that could be made, you can fix most of these problems with mods but again stability issues. I have more to say but this review is getting long so i'll just say to summarize this is a really fun management game and you should definitely buy it if you like that kind of game.",1580075482,1580075482,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

재밌는데 얼리 기간이 너무 길었고, 큰 패치도 몇번있어서 제대로 해보질 못해서 아쉽

세일해서 사려하는 사람들을 위해 평가수정함
관리대상들은 매력적이고 각각에 맞게 관리법을 찾는 재미는 있으나
관리자들 육성이나 관리대상을 고려해 아이템을 착용하는 과정이 너무 번거롭고 귀찮음
관리대상들은 늘어나고 신경쓸게 많아지니 더불어 피로도가 갑자기 확올라감
난이도를 높이기위해서 어쩔수없이 필요없는 번거로운 과정을 넣은 느낌임
