1. In the public room, you can't start the game happily, because there are always people repeatedly entering and leaving the room, which makes it impossible to start the game, I think the game should cancel pushing room information when everyone is ready to start the game.
2. In the new version, if you choose the wrong lexicon or other settings, you can't go back to the waiting lobby in the game, which makes everyone annoyed.
3. In the game, when your brush draws to a location with UI, the brush can't draw properly. This is a bug in the new version, which will cause the full-screen landscape drawing to no longer draw better.
4. When someone quits during the game, the Tab's people list and the chat bar will be disabled to some extent.
5. In a normal 15s~300s painting game, the brush update is the most unreasonable, which is a very serious problem, because in a short painting time you don't have much time to adjust the value, this update is not even as good as the old version's 3 point value, which will make people feel stupid, I hope the developer can restore the old version's 3 fixed brush values in the next update again, or set it as an option that can Let the player choose the option.
6. In the painting game, the ""point"" and ""short line"" drawn by the brush is not very good, can be further optimized.
7. Flash animation will be played at the end of the game, which is more interesting than the old version, but you can't skip it, so it will seem a bit troublesome.
8. The tools used for drawing should not be limited to the mouse, in this update, if the tablet is connected after entering the game, the tablet will not work properly, which is not good for the game experience.

I hope this game can become better because it allows people to meet many friends and lose many friends.

As a Chinese player,I don't think our players should take this for granted.I could have recommend this game to my friends and classmates.But I can't stand those network drops and Internet connection wrongs so frequently.It's hard for me to trust developers who claimed that they had already tried their best to work out these problems.Instead,it seems that they don't really care about players' experience and they are arrogant to us. (Some other foreign players may be included too.)

As far as I am concerned,I don't think hire a team to maintain your servers and gradually improve network connection quality is a puzzle that harder than Goldbach conjecture. After all it is not a intense battle game, a bit higher lag is acceptable.

Now, the only thing you need to do is arrange a server near Asia! It 'll benefit all the Asians and boost your sales as well.

Paint bucket  区域一键填色?
better color panel, there isn't gray?  没有灰色？
Eraser? 橡皮？
Can't cancel after you clicked finish when drawing 在作画阶段点完完成，想进行修改可是无法取消
More and editable hot keys like Photoshop? 更多可自定义的快捷键？最常用的例如PS里的v移动, b笔刷, e橡皮, L选中？
Round brush? 圆形笔刷？
at the end listing out all images when selecting your favorite drawing? 选择最喜欢的画时, 列出所有作品的预览图是否会比现在点下一张的方法更好？

Please do more research on current existing relevant games. Observe the good and make it better so it won't looks like a scam 请务必思考一下本游戏与同类型其他游戏的问题, 吸收同类游戏的优点, 并加以改进以不至于让这个游戏感觉像个骗傻子钱的.
This game feels like it is created by multiple people that are not on the same page, which some of them have played the games I listed below and know what he is doing but some of them just doesn't care about the outcome. So just go play some similar games and u'll know how much your game is like unfinished. 本作给我的感觉像是一些没有进行深的交流讨论以及制定计划过的人们制作出来的游戏, 感觉某些人是玩过网页上那些类似游戏的, 但有些人制作时完全不在乎游戏过程. 希望那些只听描述没玩过的制作者们去玩玩类似游戏, 你就会知道本作有多像个未完成品了.

I just want you guys to know, that this game have A LOT of potentials!!! so if you guys just pay a little more patience on it, it'll be so much more better. 我只是想让你们知道, 你们的游戏有很多可能性, 只要再耐心一点本作就非常完美了.

Sometimes I would like to draw adult content but I was worrying about there are people in this game cannot endure it. I hope each room can have a tag means adult content acceptable, and people need to enable a checkbox in their setting to  enter these rooms.

Players who quit in middle, AFK, or draw/guess wrong things intentionally needs to get some punishments .. I hope each player can have a behavior score to show in the room preparation view and we can vote to lower it. Then the host can determine if it should be kicked.

Also, I wish I can get player information in the middle of game, or having some game history. Sometimes I want to add steam friends but they just quit right after the showing section, and I was not able to find them anymore.

There is a Discord server for this game but the chances of finding someone there who is willing to play when you are is quite low I would say. 

If you like to draw with friends I hope they also have the game or are willing to buy otherwise don't bother for now. They can't join in if they don't have the game like in Drawful for example.

I wish this game had more English speaking players but as of right now it is very rare to find someone in the English server. I had to ask a guy in the Japanese server to switch to the English one so that I could understand what is being asked of me to draw. Developer says this might change once they release the game for mobile phones. I hope that will be the case.

I will change this review if the situation changes. Happy drawing.",1626701569,1627073718,False,30,7,0.667969763278961182,0,True,False,False

开发者没想到吧。中国玩家撑起来整片天。

不过不要高兴的太早，这个模式很快会被国内画猜平台如QQ游戏，玩吧，甚至百变大侦探吸取，然后这个steam原版就会凉掉。

中国版的功能会更强大， 更多灵魂/写实画手。
