The pixel graphic is decent and full of style, there is a boss design and systems are ok but the gemplay loop is a bit uninspired(small segments linked together add nauseam) and the character customization during runs push you to perform forced synergies for your builds. The gameplay is serviceable but nothing stellar. What I disliked the most is the rogue lite elements balance, there is too much power hidden behind them, so it creates arbitrary gates. When you're building a rogue lite, gameplay and mechanics discovery should always come fiirst, here mechanics are forced into you in a very dumbed down maneer and force you almost to play with upgrades.

It is not that bad, but it is imho a bit below what I'd call a game worth playing.

I personally prefer the combat in this game to that of Dead Cells, though it does lack some variety. In Dead cells there's a plethora of new weapons to use, while this game has 4 primary archetypes, each with their own unique spells. The combat also plays a lot with the y-axis, jumping is fairly floaty and resetting dashes and jumps make staying in the air a fun skill to master. The combination of spells and primary attacks is a great balance to play with. That makes the combat feel really fun, but after a certain point, the gameplay with each character's arsenal becomes fairly repetitive. The primary source of uniqueness in the combat are the various auras which modify each run's approach to combat, and the gambits which modify the spells. There are several spells in the game that feel like minor variations on others, which sometimes makes selecting or switching out spells feel less impactful. Lastly, after a certain point, the challenging enemies becomes limited. The elites and the more challenging enemies are still interesting, but there are still a lot of smaller, easy mobs. This game is still young so I look forward to where the developers will take the game with updates.

The story is interesting, but somewhat basic. The voice actors are decent, but sometimes the lines they're given are cliche. The zodiacs themselves are fairly basic characters, though a couple of them are really unique.  The artwork in the game is really pretty and is one of my favorite parts of the game. The character designs are really unique and the variation between all the characters is a high point in my opinion. 

Overall, I recommend this game. It is not the most difficult game, nor is it the most intricate narrative, but it is a really solid, fun game.

First, the positives. This game very clearly mixes the easily recognisable level structure of Dead Cells with the narrative structure Hades so amazingly perfected. It is a 2D platformer that rewards exploration while also not punishing you for dying so often, because every run you do - be they short or long - advances the story even further. Combat and spell customisation is great but certainly takes some getting used to. I also personally feel like it could be a bit more intuitive, but that's just me. Sometimes it's just difficult to pull off combos or dash away in time even though I'm very clearly pressing the right buttons. The art in Astral Ascent, in one word, is just gorgeous. The landscapes in the background, as well as the character designs and even the soundtracks are well made and possibly one of the game's biggest selling points for some people. Co-op mode is a great bonus, though I haven't made use of it yet myself. 

So what are the cons? Well, for me the biggest thing that is keeping me from giving it an 8 or above is the story and the dialogue. It is, for a lack of better words, cringe and incredibly cliché. The characters, despite their cool looks, unfortunately fall flat as soon as they open their mouth. They sound so one-dimensional. They have one signature trait and that's their whole personality. The story also just isn't very interesting in my opinion. You're trying to escape from a prison but to do that, you have to beat some overpowered celestial beings. That's basically it. No real side stories, or any interesting ones at least. You want backstories on any of the characters?

From my perspective, this hinges on the fact that Hibernian Workshop has a masterful understanding of what made roguelites take off in the first place, and where the flaws lie in current genre design trends. 

 Enemy telegraphs are clear, and indicators almost always give appropriate time to react. Responsiveness is excellent. The time between starting a skill and being able to cancel into a dodge is virtually instant. If a spell does lock you into an animation, it probably comes with either the ability to reposition while casting, or a straight up invincibility state during the cast. In concert, these factors allow combat to flow beautifully. Visual chaos does become harder to manage at high destiny levels, but this is a pretty ubiquitous problem in roguelites IME.

Build control is brilliant. Instead of hinging on a single system where all of your power comes from, Hibernian Workshop went wide and did it well. Between echoes, gambits, auras, and traits, the amount of fine tuning you can do to your build is immensely satisfying. This also allows for a much higher ceiling of ""the perfect run"" for a given build, as there's almost always room to fit in more synergy where you find it.

The final aspect of the trifecta here is enemy and boss design. Enemy variety is great. Attack patterns come in a wide variety, and you'll want to approach them with a strategy in mind as failing to address troublesome enemies first will bite you. On higher destiny levels, little enemies are my main gripe. Most telegraphs give you just enough time to react, so little guys tend to get lost in the mess and it makes damage hard to avoid in the lategame without a suitably busted build.

I don't have intensely reasoned rationale for saying this. I've played a lotta these games, but not all of them. This is a statement from my heart and not my mind, but I can say Astral Ascent has bar none THE BEST boss design of any roguelite I've played, maybe any roguelite made at the point of this review. The back and forth that develops as you learn their patterns and understand the attacks that at first seem unfair is such a joy to experience. The fact that they're almost all extremely likable characters with great designs is a cherry on top.

I could gush more. This game deserves it. These devs also deserve your money, so you know what to do if it looks like fun.",1682545489,1705072835,True,1,0,0.513863921165466309,0,True,False,True

The biggest flaw with Astral Ascent is that it tries so hard to be Hades, so hard, but it fails so miserably because Hades is better at everything. Period.

As with Hades, you're trying to escape somewhere, you have a hub world with many characters, dozens if not hundreds of upgrades to unlock, story that unlocks itself little by little, you have to beat the game multiple times to see the real ending, full voice acting, fast paced, action packed game and so on.

The issues are:
- The writing is bad. Not horrible, but bad. Cringe, most of the time. Very cringe.
Characters are one dimensional (both main characters and NPCs);

- The shallow writing reflects directly on the voice acting. While the actors aren't bad, the voice directing hasn't been very good, to say the least.
For example, you have the fiery, hot headed, expansive hero (there are four heroes); all of his lines are spoken like he has to be excited and extrovert every single line. There's no nuance whatsoever.
All the characters' lines stay stuck to their ""personality"" which makes for a very bland voice acting.

- Gameplay wise, this game does play a bit different than Hades. For starters, it's a platformer, so you can jump.
Each character has a basic attack and a unique special (called ""signature move""). Then you can equip up to four spells and each spell has four slots for extra power/effects. Also each spell can be upgraded for higher damage.
The gimmick part is that the spells rotate each time you use one.

Most Negative Reviewers dislike this mechanic, but I don't mind it at all. It's gimmicky, but not game breaking by any means.

Oh yeah, you also have ""auras"" that give you passive effects for the run.
And you can get upgrades for your basic attack and signature move. 

Then here's a double edged knife: while some people may enjoy the amount of customization, others can find it unnecessary over the top. I wouldn't call it overwhelming, but Hades has proved that you can keep it faster, cleaner and better. 

- The boss battles are... OK. 
Depending on your RNG, they can be easy or almost impossible. 
(not impossible, but they'll take so damn long that you will give it up). 
The issue is: your main attack does very little damage. It's purpose is to fill the mana bar so you can deal real damage with your spells. 
However, some spells are slower/have shorter range and on later difficulties the window to hit the boss is really small. 

Some bosses are notoriously harder than others, because they keep moving way more frequently making them harder to hit. 


Well, I could go on and on with this list. Again, especially if you compare it to Hades. 

But once you stop seeing the game for what it is, stop reading the atrocious dialogs, turn off the sound (so you don't have to hear the bad voice acting) and truly getting into the game's gimmicky mechanics, it IS a fun game. 
Controls ARE good and responsive, which is a must with this kind of game. 
You can feel that you start ""gitting gud"" also. Of course, unlocking perma upgrades help, but it's a game that you, the gamer, improves as well. 


I probably won't 100% this game, unlock all the endings and such, but it's still a nice one. 

Just wish that with the amount of effort and money that it's been put on it, it would be more it's own thing and not a Hades (derpy) clone.

I'd soft recommend this to action roguelike junkies, but there are too many caveats for me to be enthusiastic about it. It's great fun for the first 5 hours, but after a few runs the cracks start to show, and by the time you're doing D3+ runs, it's fallen apart.

You get four spells, with access to a single one at a time. Your spells are on a cycle with an order you define, so it's a lot of fun to think up chains. Almost immediately, you start to get visions of combos you might be able to do, but often times they don't pan out. Usually, the same two gameplay systems are the culprit: Physics, and mana.

For starters, the game is simply too floaty. You can stay airborne almost indefinitely. Your air jump regenerates after you basic attack something, and your descent to the ground is very slow (unless you do a 2A command input for a standard ""downwards stomp"" type of attack). Your iframe dash is usable mid-air, and you don't lose height while mid-dash. Initially, all of this feels neat; you can do big aerial auto attack strings, and it's never cumbersome to run around the screen while platforming or hitting airborne enemies. 

It doesn't take long for the floatyness to get in the way of your combo strings though, really slowing the game down. A lot of spells are tied to movement, so your character's positioning will shift around as you cast (often jumping up, or dashing around). A lot of the coolest combos _feel_ like they should be able to play off of this movement. It's exciting to imagine lunging forward with a dash strike, followed by a jumping backstep that leaves a mirror image, then throwing down a barrage of ice shards into the hoard of enemies. 

But upon trying it out, you'll find that once you're in the air, you just kinda stay there, making any follow ups pretty hard to execute. Doing the downwards stomp to get back to the ground is generally slow and unsafe, so more often than not you abandon your hopes of creating smooth strings in favor of doing some additional movement, or simply basic attacking. Fully grounded strings don't tend to fair much better, as the only reliable animation cancel is your dash, forcing you into too much movement when going for precision.

One can easily work around these limitations and concede to different strings with more homogeneous hitboxes and angle types. In particular, it's very effective to spam spells that hit straight downwards to rain death from above (you're in the air forever anyway), or just spamming attacks that hit in a line in front of you. It might not feel as neat as the combos your heart wants to do, but it's simple, and it works.

... Or at least, it'll work until you run out of mana, which isn't going to take very long. The only reliable way to restore mana is to auto attack things. Generally if you have a full mana bar, you can get about 3-4 spells in before needing to stop and hold down the auto button.

The problem with this is that using the auto attack sucks on every character... a lot. They do nearly no damage, they lack any weight in their animations, and have no oomph in their sound effects. Put simply, they don't feel good. Mechanically, they serve their job decently when you do stuff like add debuffs to them, so you can spam autos to stack up ailments like Burn or Poison; but multihit spells tend to be better at this too. You never want to auto, you just have to. For those who are less experienced with this genre and think ""What's it matter if the autos don't feel good?"", I'd liken it to an FPS with bad gunplay. It's a big deal.

Autos are pretty slow too, even when you get 25%+ aspd buffs rolling. I get the sense that a lot of the reviewers who call this ""fast paced"" are unfamiliar with fast paced action games—it does step it up a notch compared to Hades or Dead Cells (both games that, in their intentional slowness, have proper weight to them and feel good), but it lags behind something like One Step From Eden, ScourgeBringer, or Astlibra. As it stands, it feels like the game can't really keep up with me on the offensive... but it doesn't really demand mindful timing or precision either. Ultimately it becomes mashy and 1 dimensional. That said, it demands a decent amount of attention out of you in order to properly dodge attacks, so there's a disconnect where defense and evading feel about right, but your offense is too sluggish and limited.

The most fun I had were runs where I lucked into passives that made mana management way more tolerable. There's some passive auras that help with regen, and a very short-lived buff you can pick up that gives you infinite mana. When you get a taste of that, and you can play without the auto attack constantly getting in the way, it feels pretty dang good. But it never lasts.

The game is somewhat challenging at least, it took a solid 30 hours for my first D6 clear. Each time you turn up the difficulty a little bit, you can feel it. But part of this because the game suffers more from RNG than it should. Since your auto attack isn't a very reliable part of your build, you have to rely on active spells and passives to make it through the tougher encounters, and if you happen to get a run where the pieces don't come together, it feels a little hopeless. 

Buuut, you can generally make do with only 1 or 2 decently upgraded spells, so it starts to encourage building around those and neglecting your other slots. Once this realization hits, the character building degenerates into nothingness, creating the conditions for tedious mindlessness to seep in. You mash to cycle through your cheap filler spells until you get to your buff upgraded one, line it up, let it go, then hold down your crappy auto for a bit. It's mind numbing.

Visually the game looks pretty good, and it doesn't feel too noisy even when the screen is hella mobbed in Eclipse challenge rooms. Still, somehow non-gameplay elements (OP, backgrounds, cutscenes) all look way better than the gameplay elements (actors, animations, effects), which feels a little dubious; they know how to make the store page look good, I suppose. The character animations in particular are strange, they look rotoscoped to me (though the store page advertises frame by frame). Regardless, this is easy to look passed.

Harder problems to overlook are the atrocious writing and voice acting, which are roughly on par with a 90's WB Kids anime dub. The writing is such a problem that the game would better if there were simply no story or dialogue at all. Characters are stupid and 1 dimensional, lines are corny, delivery is literally laughable, and the game fails to convey meaning in any of it. It's all one big trite annoyance rife with inconsistency. Between the villian that unironically yells ""FRAK!"" all the time and the playboy martial artist that refers to himself in third person, I'm certain GPT-3 would have done a better job. It feels kind of like a preteen's first visual novel script that they posted up on deviantart or so. (EDIT: An update added another voice track (Japanese) and it is an improvement.)

The music is fine on its own, but in the context of the gameplay it fares only marginally better than the writing; I was quickly getting tired of the first stage's track, and there's hardly any tonal shift in the second stage, despite the fact that I just went from a breezy plainsland to a desert volcano. The music fails to bring you into whatever environment you're supposed to be in or convey any particular emotion. It's just kind of there.

All in all while the game has some interesting systems and it has glimpses of insane potential, it falls short enough to get tiring quickly. Really a shame—it's so, so, close. With some extra speed and ""oomph"", a bit more gameplay tuning, and a little more skill based consistency, it would hang with the greats.

2. The verticality of almost every enemy attack is not properly shown (other than beams). Hell - I'd almost rather you DIDN'T show me how they're going to attack, if it doesn't properly describe how to dodge it. Moreover, the red markers/beams/etc aren't always precise. I think I'm out of it, but oops - there goes a quarter of my health!
3. Combat can be extremely floaty (attacks/spells keep you in the air) making positioning for these hard-to-dodge enemy attacks even harder.
4. Everything attacks EXTREMELY quickly with very little animated telegraphing.

The concept of this game is excellent. But... the movement is seriously not for me. I like precise, methodical movement. It CAN be quick, but not floaty or chaotic. I wish the dodging system relied on jumping/dashing instead of floating in the right spot through actions that are NOT jumping/dashing. Making the game about 30% slower would help with this, but the rest of this probably can't be helped. 

Hell, I'm not looking for an easy game. Make enemies hit harder. But don't make me feel like there was absolutely no way to win. 

Side note: For those reading who enjoyed the fluidity of Dead Cells, ignore everyone who is comparing the two.

UI is very easy to read and understand without being overwhelming

Basic attacks have perfect damage numbers and sound effects to make them satisfying to use.

Spells are all cool and beautifully animated.

Signature spells are fun and unique but i wish that there was 2 or 3 options to choose from for each character since a lot are either basic or kinda boring to use.

Bosses are stressful but fair actually think they're better than deadcells and are on par with souls bosses.

Customisation is everywhere allowing you to make cool distinct builds each run.

So much to unlock so you're not mindlessly doing runs just to get to the end.

For the latter, part of the issue with trying to utilize the Hades style of story-telling is that the you need to use a pantheon of gods/characters that have personalities and backstories that the audience already has a notion of. That way you can allude and subvert what the audience expects the characters to do. Otherwise you need to take the time to build up and introduce the characters, which Astral Ascent does not do.

Instead it forgoes much of the world-building at the beginning for putting you into the gameplay loop. There is a lot of variety in terms of spells and passives, but it does (somewhat) devolve into the mash buttons to fill the screen with flashy effects. The bosses do force you into a loop of dodging and openings, which is nice. There were few times where I was baffled by how I got hit/died, so the enemy's moves and hitboxes are well-done.

Overall, pretty addicting. Would even buy outside of a sale.

My main wish for a patch is being able to remove spells from the move pool. I have yet to see some of the cooler spells you get at the end of the game because the player is incentivized to choose spells with the matching element to the auras (passives) you choose. The room you get for changing the element of 1 spell shows up infrequently (which I understand is for balancing). I would hope they patch in a method to either purchase another gambit in that room or to remove spells from the pool (possibly via the endgame crescent-thingies).",1704298187,1704298187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It iterates on the standard fare by giving you four playable characters with their own pool of spells, and in each run your character will have a rotation of four spell slots, and each spell has four slots for modifiers, allowing for a pretty fair level of player expression that I personally find addictive.

That being said, it is VERY easy to fall into favorites regarding spells... as some of them are just overtly more useful than others. Anything that can maximize on-hit effects and minimize the chance of missing will rise to the top and I find myself trying some spells only to immediately realize that they will be passed over or recycled every time I see them. BUT as you play the game gives you more opportunities to reroll or recycle spells to dig for your preferred loadouts, so it can be mitigated to some degree, it's just regrettable that some spells and effects are ultimately not very useful.

However, the magic/skill system is just absolutely AWFUL. You have 4 skills, and every time you use a skill it rotates to the next one like 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > back to 1. As a result, you never know which skill is currently on rotation in the heat of battle, so you just end up pressing the skill button and hoping it does something useful. When I press the skill button is it going to be AOE damage around me? A vertical line nuke? A horizontal nuke? A projectile? A dash? You just have to press the button and cross your fingers.

Also, you can acquire 4 upgrades per skill, so eventually that's 4 skills each with 4 random effects. It feels like a slot machine and not in a good way.

Unlocks and meta progression are well balanced and does not feel forced at all (the only thing requiring a bit of farming are the colors... so it's not mandatory and only cosmetic). You don't need to farm Destiny fragments to enjoy your runs and create powerful characters.

There is a lot of variety when creating your character, and pretty much everything feel smooth when it comes to combat. Spells are diverse enough to satisfy everyone.

After finishing Hades, I remember thinking ""I wish other studios will take a few pages from this game"". And boy, did Astral Ascent developers  (Hibernian) pay attention!

With a [b]hyper satisfying gameplay loop, tight intrarun variance, perfect run duration, meta progression and compelling ""just one more run"" incentive, this nails most of what makes the roguelite genre so enjoyable.[/b]

This game has the nervous & frantic combat from Dead Cells, the iterative storytelling from Hades, 4 different characters with distinctive personalities and gameplay, and, most outstandingly, a  [b]2-player multiplayer that in my opinion is its best selling point[/b] as it's the best in the genre since Isaac and the Gungeon.

A colorful, fast and furious game best enjoyed with a friend. If Hades and Dead Cells are the 9/10 of the genre, this is a solid 8.5+.

[h2]Grab it for[/h2]

(+) Excellent moveset,  [b]very reactive movement [/b] rife with double jumps, dashes, wall climbs and plunging attacks

(+) Surprisingly  [b]detailed spellcasting system where you are invited to fine-tune the sequence of your spells as well as their on-cast secondary effects [/b]. High ceiling to optimization

(+) High replayability due to the way that Auras, Echos, Zodiac spells can significantly effect the play you play the game, even if obtained in the middle of a run.

(+)  [b]Brilliant boss design [/b]: combat is epic and the intro cinematics are badass

(+) Path of Destinies (equivalent to Ascensions / NG+) level 6 reveal  [b]entire new movesets for bosses [/b], in the same way the ""extreme measures"" features in Hades did: just after you think you have the fights figured out, the enemies take the shackles off and remind you how much you still have to learn. Hats off to the devs for pulling this out successfully

(+) Coming back to the garden and the bar, with its relaxing music in the background, is a welcome change of pace between 2 bouts of frenetic dashing. 


 [h2]Although that said, you should be aware of some shortcomings [/h2]

(-) The  [b]plot, writing and dialogue are disappointing [/b], which makes the Memory Fragment unlocking underwhelming. A lot of effort went into crafting backstories for the Zodiacs, but not much of it is compelling. Little character development in the dialogues with your characters and the zodiacs between first encounters and final runs. You'll quickly learn to click ""redeem all"" and ignore the text. 

(-) The screen can quickly turn into a  [b]hard-to-read clusterfuck [/b], especially in multiplayer. Even in a single 1 vs 1 with a Zodiac, it's not always clear where the safe spots are and how to dodge certain attacks, which, instead of encouraging the player to figure out the patterns to eventually play clean and perfect the encounter, results in  [b]rewarding button mashing and brute force [/b]. 

(-) Invulnerability frames for bosses are an infuriating feature to waste your slow-loading summon on.

(-)  [b]The UI and effects codex are quite bad [/b], with a few special offenders that must be called out: 
- when replacing upgrades on your special ability or weapon, there is no way to first check what the offered 3 choices are before you decide if, yes or no, you want to replace one of your upgrades. 
- confusing color code which lets you think that you are picking the right gambits, but in reality there is no synergy between 2 abilities that have similar names and the exact same color. 
- some special effects from Astral Auras are not described at all

(-) The tutorial manages to both hold your hand too much (start / stop / go talk with this person) and fail to provide important information you'll have to figure out later.

You can tell this game was inspired by Hades. It doesn't do it nearly as well, though. 

Some warning boxes are not accurate. The time between impact is inconsistent (they have ways to communicate a delayed impact, but they dont do it randomly for some mobs). There's a fire spear guy who's charge goes far beyond the box indicator.

I wish this game has directional aim. its just a chore, it doesn't add anything to the game. if the angle is there the idiot should shoot the enemy instead of into thin air. the angle options are pretty big though - perhaps bigger than they need to be? 

On keyboard and mouse. scrolling through menus is just a pain. pressing r to skip chatter before a boss fight and then using my heal because thats bound to the same key. or quickly inserting an aura and using your heal because theres a gap between choosing which aura and what slot to place it in and they're both the same key for some reason. 

i really dont like the potion system. rng heals for the main source of healing just sounds lame. the discomfort does not equal enough engagement, for me. Also, having a full heal ready and being at the awkward 60-70% hp level and then getting more healing rocks just feels bad. the rocks are getting wasted. id need to use my big rock inefficiently so i can continue building another big rock. cant i build two big rocks? having a greater heal for a higher risk is a cool idea, though. 

It's kinda lame getting and beating the final boss and then he just kills you in a cutscene. There are cooler ways to do it. He could show some irritation, or he could enter a phase where everything becomes a one hit ko and the more your run level or something the less this is a one hit ko, or the lower his aoe attacks until a point. those have their own problems, but the current system doesn't feel like im working to take down a big boss. hes a pushover that barely hurts and then kills me. im up to new game 5 or something and its not exciting. 

the combat in this game is 'dodge the red boxes'. the dash is very generous in its invincibility and has a minuscule cooldown so you don't really need to dodge the boxes. you can just stay in them and hit and then iframe through the aoe. i compare this to skul the hero slayer and (for example) you really needed to pay attention to enemy animations and keep in mind that x unit has a huge aoe that i need to prepare for. the dash being so generous and free means a lot of the game is trivialised. theres no traps, theres no gotchas, and if i do get hit the damage is so low it doesn't really matter. my mind is not engaged by this combat. 

This game has too many spell effects. iirc, each element has 5 different effects and theres 6 neutral effects. so thats 31 different things. and you need to get these in your spell gambits, and then hope you find an aura or mutation that increases the damage of these random things you've decided to focus on. its so hard to build something with synergy just by the sheer chance of finding something good with your aura. 

even though spell descriptions are aplenty, im still not clear on some core elemental mechanics. whats the difference between sapling and slime? does something that buffs thunder damage also increase the damage a nimbus does? does frostbite do anything other than a dot? does stacking freeze mean a bigger slow? why do i have to ask these questions? 

i feel like this game looked at other games and tried to be better. but they didn't understand fully why competitors had certain things the way they are. for example:
 - the dash cooldown is a moment shorter than the dead cells roll. but the cooldown on the roll is like that because if you roll needlessly the mobs will punish you. if you take out that moment dead cells would be a worse game. in this game, the only time i feel like im punished for dashing unwisely is in boss fights. 
 - the red warning boxes are there because in Skul they were good to show clarity in messy fights. and with the way the game was set out that really helped. here i feel like the enemy models are distinct and unique enough to not them for every single enemy. 

also, cutscenes are way too long. i wanted to see the pretty pixel animations, but it takes so goddamned long for zodiac fights to begin that i just want to skip them (which i cant!) and get to the action. theres a big animation on choosing which boss to fight, then the dramatic reveal of the boss, then (if you have them enabled) a 10 second pixel animation of the boss trying to be cool, then the obligatory chatting, then finally the fight starts. its too long. just let me fight. 

so yeah, its alright. it has lots of problems, but the bones are good.",1702121295,1702121295,False,2,0,0.483162522315979004,0,True,False,False

I don't want to have to commit to a single player casual action game.  

I don't get it.

EDIT: Well, they finally did implement the mid-run save, so I've started playing the game and enjoying it as I don't have to commit to long sessions every time and can just casually grind away.  It's fun, the controls are very reactive - just changed my recommandation from NO to YES.  Good job!

ENG

The game is really well designed. We play with a main character named Ayla and our overall goal in the game is to defeat the zodiac signs and reach the last boss named Master. To do this, we go through the worlds of earth, fire, water and air to reach the final boss. I played and finished the game with Ayla until I unlocked Octave and with Octave after I unlocked Octave. 

First of all, the game is very fast. Generally, wall climbing and double jumping are not given at the beginning of the game, but these features really brought speed and mobility to the game. There are many events in the game. As we go from one room to another in the worlds, we enter another room by seeing a few things. First of all, there are two rooms, the exploration room and the battle room, and these rooms provide access to boxes that can be opened for 3 or 5 keys, give us new abilities, give us Aura, which is a passive ability, or provide power-ups called Gambits to improve these abilities, give Quartz -the main substance used in the dungeon- and also provide stars according to their difficulty. The game is really incredibly detailed about this. Both abilities, Gambits, and Auras have their own rarity, and abilities also have elements, and as long as a Gambit is given according to these elements, the elemental damage increases in addition to its own damage. Apart from that, abilities also have their own levels and we have the chance to upgrade these levels as we progress through the rooms. We have four abilities in the game and while these abilities are the abilities of the character we choose at first, we can improve these abilities and add Gambits as we progress. Apart from these rooms, there are also special rooms. In these rooms, we can rest, gain Aura, choose Gambits or elemental Gambits, take on challenges given to us by the Zodiac Signs and gain their powers. 

The dialogs and monologues in the game are extremely beautiful. Each character's short dialogues with the characters in the garden, learning a little bit about their past, their goals, their little laments when they sit in the rest rooms, their dialogues with the zodiac signs are extremely well done. Every word is voiced and very well done. 

There are four things I don't like about the game. The first one is that the game gets incredibly slow when fighting the final boss, the second one is the lack of improvements in the garden, and the third one is that we have to finish the game too many times to reach the real end. You have to replay each main character and each sign of the zodiac to see the true ending. The last one is that the bosses are randomized when you finish each world. Unfortunately, I finished the game without ever meeting Pisces in the water group. It was either Scorpio or Cancer.


TR
Oyun gerçekten çok iyi tasarlanmış. Ayla adlı bir ana karakter ile oynuyoruz ve oyundaki genel amacımız burçları yenip Master adlı son bossa ulaşabilmek. Bunun için de sırasıyla toprak, ateş, su ve hava dünyalarından geçerek son bossa ulaşıyoruz. Oyunu Octave’ı açana kadar Ayla ile, Octave’ı açtıktan sonra da Octave ile oynayıp bitirdim. 

Öncelikle oyun çok hızlı. Genel olarak duvara tırmanma ve çift zıplama oyunun en başında verilmez ama bu özellikler oyuna gerçekten hız ve hareketlilik getirmiş. Oyunun içerisinde birçok olay var. Dünyalar içerisinde bir odadan diğer odaya giderken birkaç şeyi görerek başka bir odaya giriyoruz. Öncelikle keşif odası ve savaş odası olarak iki oda var ve bu odalar 3 veya 5 anahtar karşılığında açılabilen kutulara erişim sağlıyor, bize yeni yetenekler veriyor, pasif yetenek olarak geçen Aura veriyor veya bu yetenekleri geliştirmek için Gambit adı verilen güçlendirmeler sağlıyor, zindan içi kullanılan asıl madde olan Quartz verip ayrıca zorluklarına göre yıldız sağlıyor. Oyun gerçekten bu konu hakkında inanılmaz derecede ayrıntılı hazırlanmış. Hem yeteneklerin hem Gambitlerin hem de Auraların kendi arasında da bir nadirlik derecesi var. bunun dışında ayrıca yeteneklerin de elementleri var ve bu elementlere göre Gambit verildiği sürece kendi hasarı dışında element hasarı da yükseliyor. Bunun dışında yeteneklerin de kendi seviyeleri var ve bu seviyeleri de odalardan ilerledikçe yükseltme şansımız var. Oyunda dört tane yeteneğimiz var ve bu yetenekler ilk başta kendi seçtiğimiz karakterin yetenekleri iken ilerledikçe bu yetenekleri de geliştirebiliyor ve Gambitler ekleyebiliyoruz. Bu odalar dışında bir de özel odalar var. Bu odalarda dinlenebiliyor, Aura kazanabiliyor, Gambit veya elemental Gambit seçebiliyor, Burçların bize vereceği meydan okumaları yapıp onların güçlerini edinebiliyoruz. 

Oyundaki diyaloglar ve monologlar aşırı güzel. Her bir karakterin bahçedeki karakterler olan kısa diyalogları, bu vesileyle biraz geçmişini öğrenmemiz, amaçları, dinlenme odalarında oturduklarında küçük küçük hayıflanmaları, burçlarla olan diyalogları aşırı güzel yapılmış. Her kelimede de seslendirme yapılmış ve çok güzel yapılmış. 

Oyunda sevmediğim dört şey var. Birincisi son boss ile savaşırken oyunun inanılmaz derecede kasması, ikincisi bahçedeki geliştirmelerin yetersizliği, üçüncüsü oyunda gerçek sona ulaşmak içi oyunu çok fazla sayıda bitirmemiz gerektiği. Her bir ana karakter ve her bir burcun gerçek sonunu görmek için tekrardan oynamak gerekiyor. Sonuncusu ise her bir dünyayı bitirdiğimizde gelen bossların rastgele olarak gelmesi. Su grubunda Pisces ile hiç karşılaşmadan oyunu bitirdim maalesef. Ya Scorpio ya da Cancer geldi.

Bunlara rağmen muazzam bir iş çıkartılmış. Steam Dolara geçtiği için aşırı pahalı fakat ucuz bulunca bütçeniz yetiyorsa mutlaka alıp oynamanızı tavsiye ederim <3",1701811073,1701819554,True,5,0,0.512636184692382813,0,True,False,False

The game is amazing

Video Review if you'd prefer that format:
https://youtu.be/92pNtkFovZ8

Synopsis/Story:
Astral Ascent places you in the role of a liberator seeking to free individuals trapped in astral prisons from The Master's conquests. The central prison, The Garden, guarded by the 12 Zodiacs and The Master, serves as the main battleground. Each playable character has a unique backstory, providing clear motives for defeating The Master and ending his reign of terror. The in-game dialogue, voiced by a cast of NPCs, mimics Hades in enhancing character depth. Although some lines lack the finesse of Hades, Astral Ascent's execution is commendable.

Visuals & Audio:
Astral Ascent is a visual treat, featuring gorgeous pixel art and well-animated cutscenes with an anime-inspired feel. The visual effects of spells and abilities are captivating, with meticulous details in different areas. While the art direction stands out, there are moments of visual clutter, especially in multiplayer. The soundtrack is excellent, seamlessly complementing the game's different areas. Voice acting adds personality to characters, although some lines aren't the best, possibly due to the developers being from France.

Gameplay & Mechanics:
Astral Ascent's core lies in its smooth platforming and engaging combat. The tutorial effectively introduces the game's complexities, and the hub world allows for meta-progression. The platforming mechanics, is amazing with a few nuanced mechanics that are really cool to make use of and learn. Combat is a blend of frantic action and strategic thinking, demanding attention to enemy patterns. Each character's unique abilities, spells, modifiers, and auras ensure diverse and appealing playstyles. The game's difficulty is decent, if you have good timing and decent understanding of the mechanics you can over come those inevitable bad runs.

Multiplayer:
The 2-player local co-op in Astral Ascent is generally enjoyable. However, the lack of simultaneous spell and gambit selection can make choosing rewards take a lot longer than it should. Shared screen experience occasionally hampers visual clarity, with player indicators helping mitigate the issue. The addition of online co-op could potentially address these concerns, enhancing the overall multiplayer experience.

Length of Runs/Replayability:
Run lengths in Astral Ascent vary based on player familiarity and whether in multiplayer. On average, multiplayer runs take more than an hour, while single-player runs can be completed in roughly half an hour, perhaps a little longer depending on your knowledge of the game. The game boasts extensive replayability with four characters, diverse spells, items, and the destiny mechanic. Future updates introducing new characters or boss modifiers could further enrich the game's content.

Final Thoughts:
Astral Ascent is a solid recommendation for anyone looking for a polished gameplay experience. The game offers a visually appealing world with charming characters and dynamic mechanics. Despite minor imperfections, it stands out as a top-tier roguelike in 2023. If you're seeking a game with responsive platforming, engaging combat, and lasting appeal, Astral Ascent is a worthwhile purchase that won't disappoint.",1701812554,1701812554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first 30 minutes were difficult, and I hesitated to pay it back: despite the *superb* art and music, it didn't click right away, because I couldn't figure out the gameplay loop. I tried anyway, because behind it all, I felt the game was really trying to show me how much fun it could be.
The thing is, you have four powers, constantly rotating. Unlike Hades, where each build is carefully constructed and you control everything, here it's (in my opinion!) really harder to control exactly which spell is going to happen, and its precise effect (because you can also add modifiers to your four spells!) But what you lack in control, you gain in fun: the game is a marathon, where you try to survive with a rather weak attack button, until you can unleash hell with your spells - not unlike A-RPG such as Grim Dawn/Diablo. And it's a lot of fun.
The game isn't Hades, I still prefer it, but once you start to understand how it's meant to be played, you're in for a while.
It gives you a lot to consider in your first few runs, and it takes a while for the pieces to come together; but whenit does, it's a perfect bliss of fun and sexy zodiac warriors.",1701609317,1701609317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has perhaps the most fluid feeling combat the genre can offer with the animations and art polished to the extreme. The variety in spells and modifiers for each runs is quite a lot and I'm sure they'll be adding more. 
The boss design is the key standout and much more well done than others of the genre. 
The difficulty never feels like it's overwhelming or extreme and you constantly have meta-progression which guarantees that you will progress in difficulty levels eventually.
The narrative is not the best even if some of the character and their interactions are likeable. The lore and world-building is mostly done in the background and it's more interesting than the main narrative. All of the great voice acting lends to the world feeling alive.

Now what do I think is lacking is perhaps the lack of a reason to go past the main ending as I'm not someone that sets goals for myself in a game to achieve maybe past getting all achievements which I am close to. After a few difficulty levels, like in Hades with heat 32, you're not really encouraged to go further. The game is still super enjoyable, but I don't have much of a reason. Unlocking new spells, auras, gambits is not really that interesting to me and the game doesn't feel too challenging once you master the boss' attack patterns and figure out stuff.
I think it's an excellent pickup if you enjoy 2D action roguelites but if you're someone that needs the game to set goals for you to keep progressing and wants it to be 100s of hours of replayability I don't think this is it.
If you want a roguelite that maybe lasts 50-75 hours and is really enjoyable throughout, then this is definitely a blast to play and I'd highly recommend it.",1701427572,1701427572,True,21,0,0.698276698589324951,0,True,False,False

That said it could be for my whole character, the spell, each knife in the spell, spells as a whole, my attacks while the spell is queued, my attacks while the spell is in progress, my attacks in general, etc. It seemed to impact my basic attacks and not the spell itself though. This is one example, but that is then repeated across all modifiers in the game. I'm picking things up that are only vaguely explained, then they work completely different to how I would expect them to since I am applying to a slot attached to a spell/spell slot.

I think this game is definitely worth your money. The best thing about it is the gameplay. It has some of the most fun synergy building systems I've found in any roguelike and I think that out of any other roguelike I have played or seen it has the best moment to moment gameplay. It's not perfect but if you are looking for a roguelike of the highest quality at an indie game price point.

A little more in-depth:
Now this game (after my time in early access and after release) doesn't have any outright flaws but when I compare the game to other roguelikes, specifically Hades which in my mind is where the bar is at currently, it falls short in some areas. Personally I prefer the presentation of Hades. Art and music are very subjective elements but I really feel like Hades had more polish when it came to art (but the difference is relative enough that my feelings my come down to preference for a specific art style). This game has smooth animations and everything looks great, but I really felt like Hades art was just a step up. Still the pixel art is nice. The music I think might be one of the more consistent meh elements of the game. Composing music is insanely hard but as a player there was never a moment I wanted to look up a track or was wowed by the audio of this game.

The narrative here is also definitely not why I'm playing. There are stories and lots of pieces of information to discover about all the different characters, but I don't think it's delivered in a very interesting way. I've been comparing this game to Hades a lot but honestly I would say that there are plenty of roguelikes that have stronger narratives. It doesn't take anything away from the game but it doesn't add much either in my opinion.

Ultimately though the game is just pure distilled fun. So many insane options, a really fun flow state, and even the decision making both out of run and in run are exciting to make. You get tons of unlocks after every run which feels really rewarding (but does eventually run dry) and ultimately I think this game is amazing. Like I said I really think the gameplay is the best of any other action roguelike. I loved Hades but this game is actually more fun to play for me.

Ultimately if you don't like this style of game, don't play it. If you aren't sure or you do like it however please pick it up and give it a try.

Visuals, music, gameplay, replayability, variety, and difficulty are all exactly where they need to be.

Fluent control, carefully designed rouge system, outstanding bgm, great artworks with an easily-accepted constellation background and continuous devotion of devs make this game excellent. Imo this game is as good as Hades to a great extent.

But here are some feedback of game experience which drives to write this from the perspective of expecting a better Astral Ascent.
1. During two-player cooperation, both local and steam remote fun, the chaos of controllers that host (me) turns into slave player while my friend turns into master always happen, making us a little confused.
2. Bugs do appear in a rare pattern during my cooperation playtime, like i can't pick up the spell that i bought.
3. Maybe we need indicators that show where i am, coz the scene is just too full to recognize myself especially there are two players in late game. Combining it with the dyeing system seems practical but currently these colors can''t help to distinguish the character.
4. The explanation of spells, enchants and effects are fuzzy.  A numerical display option that clearly shows how much damage it can deal would be better. Or this kind of fuzzy description is designed intentionally for exploration experience?
5. The resources are not balanced for cooperation mode, where drinks and stones are rare while enchants and spells overflows. Btw, low level spells are sold at 30 gems but grant 50+ gems, an obvious numeric bug if i'm not misunderstanding.
6.  4 heroes are not balanced too, htf the gunner has 40+ seconds cooldown special while others are just around 15 iirc.

Finally thank you devs for bringing us this wonderful game, i'm already expecting the fifth hero XD.",1700924842,1700924842,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Visually incredible game : stop and look at the detailed pixel art on backgrounds is surprising , its a nice contrast with the flashy , and sharp (Some of them) skills , one of the most beatifull roguelikes out there

- Really flashy combat and animations : Not only your skills , the boss fights are awesome too

- Fast paced and good movement : Very enjoyable if you are looking for a game to pump some adrenaline while dodging some screen covering attacks that leave some small pixels

-Nice progression : Levels are quite balanced overall
- Daily modifiers : You can choose one of three daily modifiers every day , gets some nice variation 

Cons : 

- Very fast paced if you are not familiar with these type of games
- Cutscenes are unskippable (I think?) : By the third time libra was gonna beat me into minced meat , got really traumatizing

Critique:

- Challenge spike on certain bosses or levels : Libra is harder than Master , prove me wrong 
- Lack of rooms : 1.0 just released , so its undestandable , but by run 30 or so you will probably see most of the rooms
- Some builds depend heavily on you finding a very specific aura : If i see another ice fragment astral on my pure slime run , i WILL cry 
- This game goes for a common way of story in roguelikes , you do something -> you get a conversation in your hub area about it , its simple , but thing is this gets really jumbled up really easily because when 2 things happen that trigget a conversation , one gets pushed back until next time you enter the hub 
 This stacks up overtime , by my 44th run , the hub learned that i defeated Libra
- I would like more interaction between PC and Zodiacs : Banter beetwen PC really makes them feel fun , and if they are friends , but there is a very limited amount of it
And zodiacs are the second most developed chracters after the PC´s , but there is just so little opportunity to chat with them , and most of it is general 
I would like to be able to talk to them in the bar , get a friendly one in the hub even to speak to them

Unlocks don't feel super mandatory, difficulty scaling seems to be fine so far.

Voice acting and cutscenes were a good surprise, so for those looking for a more cinematic story experience won't be disappointed.

Controls are responsive, animations and abilities feel impactful. Can get a bit visually cluttered but that's an issue of any roguelike that lets you scale your stats to absurdity.

Variety in builds between runs is decent, builds revolve around elements and keywords therefore they are not overly convoluted (talking about Skul here...love that game though)

Boss fights are very well crafted, nothing feels out of place or unfair. Just good reaction / pattern based fights.

Transcript:

Dead Cells and Hades just had a baby:  And its name is Astral Ascent, and it’s gooooood.

	That’s the TLDR anyway, but also doesn’t do the game enough justice as it’s completely hooked me in a way that a new release hasn’t in awhile.  The artwork is beautiful, the animation is seamlessly fluid, the music is enchanting, the story is…OK I guess, we’ll circle back to that later, but, most importantly, the gameplay is an electric, screen clearing display of organized chaos that invokes a sense of wizard-power-fantasy that few other games have achieved for me.  With how stacked this year has been with incredible releases from AAA studios and indies alike, I almost feel obligated to help it out by showing this game some love, and if you’re a fan of the rogue-genre, I think you should too.

	Astral Ascent is a sidescrolling action roguetype where you play as one of four different characters and attempt to break out of an eternal prison-realm by an ominous unknown entity named “The Master.”  At first, the format and gameplay is pretty familiar and seemingly simple. Each character shares a simple dodge, double jump, and falling attack that may remind you of another certain game…  They also have their own basic attacks, signature abilities, and exclusive spells to each.   The secret sauce for this game, however, is in its spell-based combat.  Most rogue games tend to focus on either your basic attacks or weapon pickups being your primary source of damage, with active abilities just being a secondary option that, while offering some useful utility, are only available to use sparingly or, if you’re like me, completely forget to use them at all.  Astral Ascent flips this dynamic around where the active abilities, or in this case, spells, are the stars of the show.  Throughout a run you’ll find several new spells to add to your arsenal, with up to four equipped at a time.  Spells, naturally, use mana as a resource that is refreshed upon landing basic attacks, making a simple but satisfying loop of interspersing spells and attacks in order to keep your mana up.  Unlike other games, though, where you’d normally be able to freely use whatever spells you want, Astral Ascent requires you to use all four spells in your “queue” in order for them to refresh.  This sounds weird at first, but it’s actually a small mechanic that makes a world of difference in terms of making the moment-to-moment gameplay feel fresh.  With this system, the player has to keep in mind what spells are coming next as to position themselves accordingly in order to get the most out of each.  Some spells are more forgiving and will attack most of what’s on screen or auto-target enemies, while others require a bit more precision and, in some cases, actually grant invincibility during the cast animation as a means to dodge attacks.  There are a metric ___-ton of spells to choose from and the animations and effects from the ones that I’ve seen are spectacular.  Some are more useful than others, but like any rogue game of this type, that’s to be expected.  Spells can also be augmented with “Gambits” that offer varying effects from launching meteors on cast or summoning poison-dealing saplings.  Furthermore, passive abilities called “Auras” offer significant bonuses and have huge potential synergies with your spell-queue and even other Auras.  All of this together creates an absolutely WILD array of possibilities, and some of the late-game results from these intertwined systems can get ABSURD.  It’s a very, very satisfying system.

	But what are all these spells good for without things to fight them with?  Astral Ascent has a solid bestiary of grunt, elite, and ESPECIALLY boss enemies to fight.  The opening half of the first area is a bit of a pushover, but that quickly changes.  All enemies have a variety of attacks and patterns to keep you on your toes.  Some packs of elite enemies and challenge rooms are honestly tougher than some boss fights.  And speaking of bosses, this game’s bosses, kick.. ASS…  A lot of times in these games, I get to a boss and think “____, a boss” but here I think “_____ YES, A BOSS!!”  If it wasn’t obvious by now, the bosses in Astral Ascent are representations of the twelve Zodiac signs, each with their own personalities, unique dialogue, and fighting styles and they are all extremely satisfying to fight.  Some of the attacks genuinely made me think “how did they think of that?”  Unfortunately due to RNG I haven’t fought all of them, but so far I think it’s safe to say these devs know how to make a good boss fight.  The best part is the enemies and bosses only get more interesting as you rack up successful runs.  After your first completed run, you gain access to Destiny Levels.  Think Heat Level in Hades or Boss Cells in Dead Cells.  Even the first Destiny level expanded the moveset of regular enemies and elites making regular encounters much more interesting.  It’s a solid addition of variety so far, and given that people in early access have previously cleared Destiny levels 30 and higher, it seems like the challenge won’t prove to be insurmountable.  It’s a great take on adding difficulty to runs that’s more than on par with similar systems in other games.

	There’s also some little details and quality of life features that I really appreciate that I think are worth mentioning.  Being able to preview what a spell does before picking it up, being able to save and quit mid-run at the start of ANY room, the icon for your next spell appearing above your character, and, most important to me, the option to outline your character and enemies for better visual clarity that the game points you to right at the start.  These are always the qualities I feel that make a good game great, and are my favorite things to point out because I feel they’re a noteworthy indicator of how much effort the devs have put into their game.

	I feel at this point it goes without saying that the presentation is gorgeous.  The character artwork, cutscene animations, spell effects, and overall scenery are nothing short of eye-candy (Also shoutout to godrays, I’m a sucker for godrays).  I also appreciate the main menu with its Kingdom Hearts vibes.   I’d wager some people may have a bit of pixel-art-fatigue in the indie sphere, but I personally think there’s a certain charm to pixel art that goes beyond feelings of nostalgia for games-of-yore.  I dunno, I never get tired of it.  Audio-wise the soundtrack is insanely good.  The hub world music alone is incredible.  And the rest of the tracks deliver equally well if-not better.  Audio during combat has just the right amount of ‘oomph’ to it, with spells, enemy attacks, and important prompts like being out of mana all being audible enough without being too overstimulating.  The voice acting is… alright.  Most of the cast gives a solid performance, with the Zodiacs being the highlights (though I might be biased because they’re all hot, not as hot as Papa Yalee, but hot nonetheless).  Some characters are… kinda annoying though.  Kiran, for example, is probably my favorite character to play, but least favorite to listen to.  I’m kind of over the “over-confident-frat-boy-who-punches-things” trope.  Kiran: “I’ll forgive you… if you can do THREE HUNDRED PUSHUPS FASTER THAN ME!”  Overall, though, Astral Ascent is a great audio-visual package that is quite the achievement for such a small dev team, let alone a game at its price-point.

	As for the story… it’s… OK I guess.  I’m still fairly early in, but so far the story hasn’t particularly gripped me.  The stakes aren’t exactly interesting from first impressions, big bad guy destroys planets and we gotta stop him and all that.  And while many of the characters are charming, especially this Capybara guy called “Sire Bapy” who I just wanna give a big ol’ hu",1700690840,1700690840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of those games you come back to for the rest of your life.

I bought this game over the holidays to have something to play on my laptop while I visit family & friends, and it's been great!!

Dialogue constantly interrupts gameplay. Spell and upgrade management has you fighting through layers of UI. Visiting the shop is actually awful because of how long it takes to work through the available stats and spell inventory. Returning to the hub world gives you a chore list of NPCs to go talk to.

The main problem, I think, is that there are too many progression systems that each do too little. There are at least 6 different upgrade systems within runs (Spells, Gambits, Auras, Guardian Prowess, Andromeda Drinks/Stone Altars for stat boosts, and Feathers for leveling up spells) and several more outside of runs (permanent stat boost NPC, spell unlock NPC), but none of them are particularly interesting or impactful. The game demands you CONSTANTLY scroll through choices and menus, but the choices you're making are between things like ""+3% armor"" and ""+5% attack speed"". It's boring. The spell/gambit system is somewhat interesting (you can essentially slot elemental proc effects onto your equipped spells), but the menu navigation is clunky and fights against the pace that the combat tries to set. Room navigation also feels pointless, as the game demands you compare choices, but each room almost always plays the same and almost always grants keys as a reward. 

Astral Ascent clearly takes inspiration from Hades, but it doesn't capture the simplicity and speed that Supergiant nailed. In Hades, room choices are represented by a single icon without text; boon choices are a simple ""pick one of three"" with no need to equip anything afterward; and shops typically hold three items max. Everything was pared down to an absolute minimum so decision-making was as fast-paced as the combat. Astral Ascent feels like the opposite, with every choice you make requiring you to scroll through not one, but several, menus to both compare and equip an upgrade -- and, after that, the actual upgrades are dull more often than not. There's complexity, but not depth.

Take these problems, add in mediocre dialogue writing and baffling enemy design (why is the Master, bent on enslaving the universe, sending cute little plants as henchmen?), and there's not a lot left to redeem the game. The artwork is gorgeous, but that's about it. I may play this a little longer, but I will more than likely refund it. It's sad to say, but the game is just not very fun.",1700687711,1700687711,False,10,0,0.583621978759765625,0,True,False,False

The character design is the only weak element of this game, and some of the character design would be better with the adjustment of a voice actor. Whoever voices Ordan and Kiran is the weakest part of the entire experience. Both character are tough and covered in muscles and the voice sounds like the opposite of that. I don't know if it was a Nepotism hire or a diversity hire, or if someone actually sat in the studio and decided to design the character like that as a some kind of point, but it's just cognitively dissonant from a design perspective. To then use the same voice actor with the same unique voice characteristic twice just baffles me, because they're putting on the voice in the voice that they're putting on. It feels so ungenuine. Aside from that one specific frankly C+ student and it's by no means anywhere near the worst in the industry, the voice actors broadly let down the experience and largely fail to convey the emotion about most given situations, which is only an issue when measured against everything else being flawless. I can't help but think that the original voices in the director's head were of just a slightly higher quality than what they could afford.

The gameplay is buttery smooth, controls feel tight and responsive, the depth of play feels limitless, the pixel art is fantastic and there is absolutely nothing I can fault in most other regards concerning this game. It has a charming anime/cartoon intro that builds the world, a consistent astrological theme, consistent and colourful, minimalist art theme and the characters are consistently likeable with little exception. I've never encountered any kind of glitch, error of programming or anything that makes me think that the person or team responsible in that regard isn't extremely talented. The pixel artist probably grew to the point of being one of the all-time greats within the industry while developing this title, and while I still think they have some work to do toward setpieces and environments to put them on the level of work like Children of Morta and the all-time best games, it's still easily one of the best efforts if you cut out games that are almost known more for their art than their game.

The game itself is a platforming roguelite with the most similar game I've played being Dead Cells, but with many aspects that remind me more of Castlevania, especially the more artistic Ayami Kojima entry of Symphony of the Night. I hate platforming games. I adore this game. It rewards precision and careful planning of your actions without ever punishing you with instant death traps. You're given plenty of movement opportunities and everything is fluid in such a way that almost feels like it's emulating the Flow state from Mirror's edge. When you get the timing down, especially with the first and presumably most tested character, everything just effortlessly blends together and your movements become slick and refined. To give an example from yet another game, think of Fox in Melee and then Fox in Melee except he can L cancel sort of movement tech.

The combat centres around generating Mana with your standard attacks to then cast powerful spells, which rotate in a list of 4. This allows for a huge amount of freeform customization regarding your character. You can design your spells to be a cohesive combo, with each 4 designed to be cast one after the other. Stun, uppercut, uppercut, downward slam, for example. Or you can have 4 seperate spells that simply shoot homing projectiles. Perhaps you have a 3 hit combo and a move that makes your character invulnerable and untargetable? It's entirely up to you. Added to this system are ""gambits"", which essentially add effects to your spells which range DRASTICALLY, from ""On hit deal +10% dmg"" to ""on spell cast, cast a weaker spell"" to ""after spending 10 mana you summon ghost swords that follow you"", auras, your selected character and their unique ability and the overarching tree that allows you to broadly get bonuses when you either attack or cast a spell, all randomly generated, there's nearly an unlimited number of character builds here. Unfortunately, gambits have an ""elemental affinity"" that means you're going to have to be ""choosing a build"" a lot and some spells just aren't going to combo together, for example turning into a tornado of blades and then firing a projectile will usually cause the projectile to not lock onto a target in melee, but you're mostly going to be able to pick anything you want.

Ultimately, probably one of the best, most creative, artistic and overall polished action roguelites I've seen with SUPER light platforming elements (The platforming in Rogue Legacy was boring to me but this is much better). I believe that this is the standard at which games of this ilk should be held to. Except the voice actors they were either members of the crew (which is actually sort of charming and makes this issue far less of an issue, I simply don't know), very cheap or nepo babies.",1700526027,1700526357,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The good 
- You can play as slow as you want and as reckless as you want, no time gating in this game. so for any of you who hates time limit to get something or oops you just get hit, sorry your upgrade dont do anything now better suck it up slow hands

- Any Upgrade or Scaling power is never wasted. 95 % of anything you find in your run can be recycled to some curency, so you never feel like you just made a fatal mistake early on when taking something you dont have synergy on.

- The story is decent but the voice acting and the character personality is diverse and fun to listen. the dialog make sense.

- Good Early, middle and late game progression , the game start normal where  at first you die to mob then learn its move set then die to boss then learn the boss pattern then clear the game that rewards you with  upgrade then try more harder difficulty

- fair  content lock . what i mean is you can experience everything in the game with some good mastery, not like dead cells where they need to hinder your healing and nerfing your Character . in this game  you can be a goodlike hero while fighting a buffed enemy be it mob or boss. i say you unlock everything in hard difficulty ( but you can still play at extreme if that is your goal)

-flexible difficulty. you can choose you buff and your enemy buff in ascension like system when trying to master the game 

- You dont need a good platforming skill in this  game. the room exploration and battle is not ridled with traps or cramped, its  wide and the traps works both ways

- The combat is tight with some pretty good synergy between each element and you are not getting punished much for swapping your main element mid run

The Mid
- 4 Playable character with that have 20 unique spell 

The Bad 
- The background scenery in every room fells the same but its a minor thing ( youre playing roguelike game though)
- The enemy variety is lacking but the boss is good
- the game vision effect can feel a bit too much some times
- why do you need to be online to use telluric scope ? this doesnt make sense the coop is local anyway and its a decent unique buff. always online thing in single player game is a no go.",1700390159,1700390159,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But I stuck with it because I saw so many positive reviews - and I'm glad I did, because after a few hours more I'm now having a blast! The key to me was realizing that, even though this game looks and feels a lot like Hollow Knight or other Metroidvanias, it's really not. If you expect to engage with each enemy individually by using your main attack, the combat is going to feel too stiff and restrictive. But once you start thinking of it almost like an ARPG (Diablo, Path of Exile, etc) then it really opens up. Your goal is to create ""combat loops"" of spells and abilities that you use against entire groups, while your main attack is more just about generating mana. The game doesn't do a great job of communicating this, but if you can get into that mindset, then it's really fun and rewarding. The boss fights are really great too and stand out as especially well-designed. I don't care much for the story or aesthetic - fantasy stuff like this doesn't really appeal to me - but the art is great and the environments are varied.

I finished my first run in about 4 hours and only a hand full of attempts The gotcha that most roguelikes implore to keep you playing here was the most dissatisfying of all the roguelikes ive played before with simply saying you failed to escape and giving you a death screen after beating the final boss. 

I originally thought this would kill my excitement to try another run but 7 hours later i cant stop going back for more. I would put this up there with Hades and Dead Cells as one of the greats. I would argue that the combat even feels better and more reliant on your strategy to compete in the areas before boss battles. The Boss battles themselves do feel a bit easier however.

 Dashing, attacking, casting your spells, everything is snappy, responsive, and reacts how you want

Graphics
The pixel art is gorgeous, the FX are juicy, it's a joy to watch.

Sound
Full voice acting, great music with really complimentary sound design.

Rogue-lite elements
The build diversity is really cool, you feel the choices you make along, with exciting discoveries. 
The meta progression has a good pace and feels pretty good, there are a lot of elements, and a pretty novel system of daily modifiers you can choose from for your character.

Boss
This is the main selling point imo. They are insanely cool, with original patterns, design, and personalities, I love everything about them. Their intro animation is godlike too. They don't last too long, and feel really threatening.

Art, music are definitely AAA level.  There is a lot of love put into this game.

Regarding mechanics, people might find that combat can feel clunky or not very engaging -- this is not the case.  All movement is able to be cancelled with a dash.  You get one dash, but it resets upon impacting an enemy with a basic attack, leading to a fluid combat system, albeit detracting from the beautiful art present within the attacks themselves.  Dashes can also be reset with a ground slam, which does require an enemy to hit.

Difficulty.  This game will absolutely maul you at the higher difficulties if you don't prepare properly.  It's also very very approachable on the easier difficulties, a very good balance.  You can choose modifiers to make the game harder/easier and are rewarded with permanent bonuses for completing these difficulties.  There are many choices, which leads to a strong choose your own adventure system.

My one complaint is that many (or even all) of the spells have pre-swing animations.  They don't leverage the art of the game mostly and serve to dissuade me from using spells altogether.  The spell system is an attempt to do something unique regarding spells in games, rather than just FIREBALL over and over.  It uses a rotating 4 slot system and you MUST spend each spell to re-use another one.  Duplicates are allowed.  

I really hope they change dash cancelling auto attacks proceed through the later animations of characters, so I can see the rest of the animations more often.  The spell cast delay I'd hope they change to be associated with huge high level nuke spells or something equivalent so they FEEL strong.  Standing still to throw 3 shurikens feels awful.

After playing full release, none of the issues mentioned in my prior review concerning multiplayer were fixed/changed. If you plan on only playing single player, and enjoy roguelikes this is a tentative recommend. If you're buying for multiplayer, I'd pass on this one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, this game is actually quite fun. I was on the fence between a thumbs up or down, but ended up leaning down after trying the multiplayer.

The good:
It cannot be overstated how amazing the art is. It has the best pixel art in any game I've ever seen bar none. The writing has made me chuckle a few times. The voice acting and direction are great. Most of the spells feel great to use and look pretty cool. The boss designs are phenomenal. The gameplay in fairly fun when you get to interact with all the systems. I love the aerial movement with jumps resetting on hits and unlimited dashes.

Now the bad:
The majority of gameplay involves using your basic attack and dash. Using your basic attack feels like hitting your enemies with a wet noodle. It's unsatisfying as hell for all characters except the dude with guns. The mechanic used the most feels the worst to use. A lot of other negative reviews complain about not being able to use spells more often, but I don't think that would an issue if basic attacking had more impact and felt better to use.

Dashes are not awful per se, but I wish they retained some momentum to make movement feel more fluid. I want to move fast on exploration levels and flow smoothly between enemies in battle arenas.

The multiplayer experience is terrible and needs a lot of love. The majority of resources are not shared between players (key rewards, shop stat buffs, certain aura rooms). Revives shouldn't be free to use, it should cost some hp or something (or at least make this toggleable). You can't look at two items at the same time, so when selecting spells or gambits, you must do it one after the other rather than simultaneously. There's plenty of screen space to fit two things on either side.",1683342614,1700110001,False,37,1,0.511637449264526367,3,True,False,True

Forgot about this game and haven't played for almost a year, went back when I heard v1.0 is out. Played from the start, and gahdawm they made improvements alright. Everything's smoother, no more frame drops. I love the new aura system and the changes they made for the skills of each hero. Time to sink more hours into this until hades 2 comes out.

My previous review below are still valid. This game's awesome.


***************

Verdict: 
Must buy! The only thing that might discourage you to buy it (for now) is that the game is incomplete and some random fps drop issues which is a tiny inconvenience at best. 

- The story of the game has huge potential, I love that it's like Hades where there's a progression in terms of the NPC dialogs. Makes you wanna do another run just to know what the NPC is gonna say next.

- Phenomenal music and narration, the music goes really well with the fast-paced game (or slow paced areas) and the voices for each NPC is really good. It makes you feel that each NPC have their own unique identity.

- Art is hella great, period.

- The action part of the game is AWESOME. Just with the initial release of two characters there are already a lot of build that you can create. The execution of skills and attacks of your character is so smooth that you can chain your AAs in between skills fluidly.

- Replayability for sure isn't going to be a problem, even with an incomplete game it's already really fun to play since there's already a lot elements that you can play around to build your character for each run. I'm looking forward to the release knowing that there will be a lot of bosses and 5 different characters.",1650182264,1700043358,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I played Early Access up to the update prior to Telluric Telescope, and had to force myself to put it down so I could save some content for the official release.

The Zodiacs are akin to the gods in Hades in that each run has some character or lore flavor to add between them and your player character.  I thought all the voice acting was decent and really gave the characters and world some depth.

Combat has tight controls and the focus on the 4 rotating skills allow for a lot of variety to runs if you're looking for that.  I wish the sound mixing had some more impact on normal attacks but skills are popping off so often you don't notice after a while.

Music is top notch and by the same person that did Dreamscaper (I think).  Each track really blends in with its stage and helps pull everything together to give the world and exploring it a great feel.

I've put all my hours in on the Steam Deck and it runs like a dream.  Art style and animations are on point, and I never had a performance drop even in late game with all that chaos on screen.

Now I write it after beating it numerous times on different ascensions on full release. I liked this game from the very first time I played it, but there was only one issue I had with it – it was too easy. And I do mean it. It was easy. If you can beat a rogue-like from like a second run, something is wrong. And it what I did on early access. Now game is released fully, with 2 new locations, new bosses and mechanics. Is this problem fixed now?
No. Apparently, it became even more apparent. Yes, I am saying it after numerous playthroughs, so I have a lot of things unlocked, but... well, in first location, it is literally hard to take damage at all. Second and third locations... are perfectly balanced. Bosses are still just ""minor inconvinience"", but overall, second and third locations are neither too hard, nor too easy... but then, you just get overfed. At 4th location, I oneshotted most enemis (minus bosses), and even Zodiacs died in like 10 seconds or less. At this point, having all Spells at level VII or higher is pretty easy, and if they are at this level... go, queen, slay. Nothing can really live through a Spell or two.
Final boss... is disappointing. To this point, every single zodiac had its unique mechanic, at least on 1 or 2 attacks... final boss does not. He is... just a guy who hits very hard and very wide. Is he hard? Depends on whether do you have 20+ attack increases or no. Just joking, he is usually easy. As I said, attack patterns are pretty simple and even damage is not cracked. He is... just boring.

So, is the game bad? Absolutely not, it is a fantastical rogue-like, one of the best I've ever played. Is it too easy? Yes. But it is not a reason to overlook this masterpiece. Just make sure to not expect a hardcore challenge.",1650062125,1699987835,True,4,2,0.523333311080932617,0,True,False,True

First, the melee characters are completely useless in the face of the guy with the gun and the drone. There is no reason to play any character that doesn't shoot.

Second, the synergies are absolute trash. There's an entire slime tree and it has no point. In fact, most every skill doesn't matter. Choose the guy with the gun and get the laser ability that makes you invincible, then you win the game.

Third, the levels are regurgitated from world to world. You'll see the same structures time and time again, and find the 'hidden' treasure predictable and not even worth going after because you're really just trying to pump damage with gun guy.

Fourth, there's a dragon named barbecue.

Fifth, the basic, I mean the most basic enemies have far too much health. From world to world I find myself feeling so weak and underpowered. I mean, I'm killing little cute mushrooms and it takes about thirty seconds to a minute to beat a room full of like six of them. They won't even let me leave the room until I push the X button enough times to kill them. X X X , then B to dash, X X X, wait for skill to be off cooldown, repeat.

Last, the voice acting is close to being unbearable. I really like that they tried to have voice actors, but the spelling errors, mistranslated dialogue, and awkward interactions take me out more then they make it endearing. 

I really tried with this game. I've been waiting for it for some time, but there is no balance for the skills and abilities, the choice of characters are imbalanced, and it just makes it un-fun after some time.

That kind of playtime in TWO DAYS is a pretty big indicator of how I feel about this game. Superb amount of polish here for an early access game. Worth your 30 bucks. If you liked Dead Cells, Hades, and Skul the Hero Slayer then you'll like Astral Ascent. If you're not a fan of rougelites or action platformers in general then maybe stay away from this one. 
I understand that this is an early access title and will be subject to some big changes down the line, but my praise will probably still hold up and my criticisms will hopefully start to get less relevant as the game takes shape. Anyway here's a couple thoughts;

Pros:
-Mechanically, this game is buttery. Feels great to play, movement is clean and precise. There can be a lot happening on screen at once and I still feel like it's all quite readable. Attacks are well telegraphed and nothing feels as though I'm not given a chance to respond to it before it goes off. Build crafting feels good too. Between elemental affinities, auras, spells, gambits and upgrades to your kit in between levels, builds come together feeling unique and powerful more often than not. 

-Great art direction. The intro animations for new characters and zodiacs are fluid and stylish as hell. The anime pixel art vibe just works here. Each character feels really distinct. 

-Music and sound, hot damn. This game has such a great, expressive score. The Exploration zones transition fluidly between more energetic arrangements for combat and more subdued for traversal. There's a billion generic orchestral video game scores out there but I think this one has such beautiful arrangements of it's melodies. It's a big reason for why the atmosphere of this game is so good. Sound effects are impactful and I love how chunky they make combat feel, especially for Kiran. 

- I'm surprised at the quality of the VA in this game! It breathes life into the cast and makes me feel attached to all their little character interactions. I find myself wanting to clear the game with a rotating cast of characters just to see how they all interact with each other, a quality that reminds me of Hades in a very good way. 

Cons:

- The writing generally isn't at the same standard as the music, art and gameplay. There's a lot that works really well, like each character's unique spell descriptions being written from their perspectives, or the banter between your character and the zodiacs. That said, I feel that the entire game could use a pass over for spelling and grammar. Some sentences feel janky, like an original english dub of a 90's anime. This does make sense, this game is an international effort. All good, but It pulls me out of the experience just a little bit. Sagittarius is a fine character but when she's introduced she keeps using the word ""frakking"". She says ""frakking"" to your character like a deeply christian 12 year old at the end of his rope would say it to their bully. Like, the point is made, but my second hand embarrassment is so visceral and pure that I skip through her cutscenes every time. 

- There are a few parts of the game that feel a bit imbalanced. All the successful runs I've done so far involve one or two copies of Energy Strikes and a couple crit related auras. Effects that activate after 40 basic attacks aren't going to be doing anything nearly as meaningful as an ability with a percentage change to activate, so they just feel like win-more icing on the build cake. I understand that you've got to make chaff so that the creme can feel more meaningful and exciting to find, but I feel like some of these abilities could be tuned to feel more impactful. 

- Menuing is a little awkward in regards to the inventory. There's no place to inspect any of the upgrades to your basic attack and signature spell after you've take them, so having a complete picture of how your build works can be hard if you can't remember exactly what you took. It would be good to be able to see -all- of your stats and abilities on a single screen. Sometimes that information is hidden. I'd rather have all that avaliable right in front of me so I can make more educated decisions about my build.

All of the cons are just nitpicks. They don't tank my overall opinion on this game, which is that it slaps, on god frfr. Astral Ascent is fast, kinetic, fun, and somehow manages to be cozy at the same time. 

buy it with your dollars

It's definetly not a bad game but I simply cannot recommend it. The game is unbalanced, it's roguelike flow is repetitive, the enemies are sadly uninteresting, the boss fights are ok, at most. The things are all pretty too look at but tasteless at the same time. It's like a really well made copy of Skull (and, by extension, Dead Cells) but that's all you'll get: a copy. 

Characters are undeniably unbalanced betweeen them (can Octave do any damage at all?). The astral auras literally NEVER drops, wich is a problem because your runs depends 99% on RNG. It's that felling like you can never do the build you want, the game ends up deciding it for you anyway.

As many people have already stated, the art is just phenomenal, I can't get enough of the immaculate flow it pulls off along with the vibrant and mesmerizing colours. Character design is unique, dialogue is quick and funny, and the voice acting seems just perfect, like I couldn't imagine a different voice on ANY of the characters that exist.

In regards to combat, not only is it incredibly addictive, but its also Fair. Enemies are easy to pinpoint and their attacks are telegraphed just enough to dodge and not get upset if you're hit. No matter how I look at it, getting hit and dodging in this game is a pure skill aspect, even through the NG+ ascension aspect (albeit im only 6 levels in, this could change). This isn't something I can say about a lot of games, one that many people know that will stick out is Dead Cells, you could be the best player in the world on that game but if you're caught by a random grenade, you're almost certainly done for. Being caught in this game is virtually non-existent, you can always dash, you can always move, you're not restricted by anything other than yourself. Movement is fluid, dashing feels nice, jump resets are enjoyable, and wall climbs couldn't feel better.

Something a lot of people will mention that they dislike is the spell system and that normal attacks don't feel strong, and I can't really blame them because it is quite unique. I think what some of these people fail to understand is that your normal attacks aren't meant for damage, yes they DO damage, but their main use is to refill mana so you can cycle through spells faster. You have 4 spell slots and can switch each out with new spells you find along your journey, all spells have a mana cost ranging from 1-3 with the more expensive ones naturally doing more damage or having a super useful aspect to them like invulnerability. It's up to you to figure out if you want to sacrifice some cycle speed for those big hitters or if you want to stay cheap and cycle faster for a constant stream of smaller impact, or even a mix of sorts. (I personally love doing 1-2-1-2)

I'd say my one complaint, which fixes itself as you progress/reach higher difficulties, is that healing is *very* hard to come by. In my initial runs (first 5-10) I often had moments of going through an entire map without acquiring a single health crystal. Most often this would be in stage 2 after i beat the first boss, I wouldn't get an opportunity to heal until I got to the Bar before the 2nd boss, which really put a lot of my runs at risk. This isn't an issue anymore with where I am, as you get to purchase upgrades to make health crystals more common, but it did frustrate me just a bit when I was starting out.

Overall I'd give the current version of this game a solid 8/10. It's a bit difficult to adjust to at first with it's unique combat system, but after just a couple runs it felt almost natural. Once they release the final few bosses and maybe touch on multiplayer (I haven't played, but I've heard some bad things), I can see this game becoming a 10/10 for myself and many others. It may even become my #1 if it continues receiving the amazing care it's been getting so far.",1690963882,1690963882,True,11,0,0.638379514217376709,0,True,False,True

Ayla and Kiran are for those that like quick close quarters with many diferent options of mobility, Ayla being an assassing and Kiran a fighter archetypes,  Octave is for those that like high powered attacks that vary between precision and messy destruction and Calie is a setup character that can apply a lot of debuffs and has some powerfull abilities when used right, there will be one more character that i am crazy to see what they do.

The NG+ was interesting before but could become frustration on high levels and didnt feel rewarding to play, but now it has come together really cool were you can customize you run even more and the changes feel not only organic but FUN.

The story, aesthetic and music are amazing, it all has depth and as you play the story really comes together with the characters interactions.

I think anyone that like roguelites should consider this, there is a mountain of content already and when it is released... I think this will become even better.",1688608690,1688608690,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The pixel [b]art[/b], both character and enemy animations, backgrounds, and especially boss intros, are astounding. Fluid and concise, with an 'outline' mode for those who might have difficulty differentiating the action. 

The [b]gameplay[/b] is fast and fun; the character controls are responsive and satisfying. Shooting off a combo of the many varied spells, feels and looks gorgeous. The style of the game is cohesive, saturated, and gold plated. Having an original flare to abilities has always been a hook for me, and Astral Ascent shines in this department. One of the characters abilities is themed around gemstones, both her basic and more complex spells. Firing gemstone arrows from an emerald bow and sliding into a ruby spear charge, with a topaz greatsword finisher.

The [b]narrative[/b] surrounds a prison, 'the Garden' from which our main characters are attempting to escape. to accomplish this they will face the twelve zodiacs. The games characters became an unexpected highlight. Instead of becoming archetypes, slaves to their astrological monikers, astral ascent goes out of its way to make each and every character, enemy or otherwise, feel three dimensional. an interconnected web of relationships and interactions is slowly revealed as you play the game, peeling away the characters depths one layer at a time. 

tl;dr game good you should buy 10/10

Your basic attack may as well not do any damage at all and exists only to charge your spells, which you cannot choose when to perform since they follow an ordered sequence. So in the heat of combat, you need a ranged attack and instead do a melee spell.

You'll spend more time dodging than fighting since every enemy has a ranged attack and can shoot you from the next town over and you'll be facing at least 5 foes at a time.

Normal fights are a slog and take forever because, since there's so few health drops, you cannot risk being aggressive and have to rely on hit and run tactics.

Lots of little power ups, but because there's so many, they end up having barely any effect.  Just lots of reading and weighing options that ultimately have no meaning.  You'll be dead soon anyway and have to do it all again.

Builds in this are hard to put together in the sense of reliability, but once you realize what spells suit you for each character. You're on your way. 

The boss mechanics are challenging but not impossible. The game rewards aggressive gameplay due to jumps and dash(dodge) refreshing on hitting an enemy. Requiring you to weave hits in to dodge some nasty combos.

I'm playing after the ""Spells and Synergies Update"" and I believe it addressed a lot of the concerns of those with middling reviews. I look forward to constantly checking up on this game for the next few years whenever a patch drops to see this game get even better. 

In short, it's a wild, sort of anime-style hi-rez 2D action platformer roguelike that's main unique traits are the champions that you choose to use on each run and the spells you'll equip them with. You have a rotation of four spells, starting off with four of the same spell and slotting in new spells as the run progresses. You go through your spells in order, like drawing cards, forcing you to think about what spell is coming up and how to use it. Spells can be slotted with gambits that modify the spells and synergize with the rest of your strategy. The best roguelikes feel meaningfully different from run to run and this game really checks that box with it's vast array of spells, auras, talents, and unique buffs. After finishing a run I just want to switch to a new character and dive back in. 

The moment-to-moment gameplay is the best of any roguelike I've ever played, Dead Cells included. The invincible dash is on a low cool down, letting you jet around the screen. You can (double) jump super high and doing damage resets your jump leading to insane control over movement. There are fights where I don't even touch the ground, jumping between enemies in the air and deploying screen filling spells and attacks. Combat is first in class, and that's really the most important thing, because the core game is so fantastic that the developers can continually add to it and take this really special game to even higher heights. 

If you're on the fence about this game. Don't be. If you like roguelikes, if you like super frantic, tight action games, and if you want to see where the devs go with gem then just get it now. It should only get better.",1680061797,1680061797,True,10,0,0.646802842617034912,0,True,False,True

[h1] Update 3/18/2023 [/h1]

So far now they have 4 Characters totaling Ayla (dagger) Kiran (Fist) Octave (Dual Pistol) and Calie (Gems) and the 4 World is out which is definitely a lot more challenging. They reworked some of the rooms only appearing in certain conditions. And Auras! they wasn't kidding about adding 250 Auras. The synergies that each Aura have now. It isn't just plain old If you heal you get a shield for 3 seconds. It'll be something like that with an added of 2 armor and anything else revolving around that field. Fall attacks trigger combustion and ember. Burning enemies that are crit heal. Its a new fun system that will make finding a nice build you like really fun. They've definitely come a long way with listening to us the players and community to making an amazing game. So if you're gonna hate the game hate us honestly haha but we're all doing our part communicating with the dev team to make a really fun and unique game.

[h1] Overall thoughts and What to know [/h1]
I gotta say this is one of the best rouge-lites out there. It's so damn fun and rewarding even when you die. You always have new things to look forward to once you finally die or complete the run. You use spells to do big damage to enemies and can also be slotted with up to 4 gambits that give that spell special effects like, % damage/heal chance of crit or status and even summons. Your goal is to escape but each stage will be a fixed list of 3 Zodiacs that will be random. So 4 stages and with each being 3 zodiacs that are random and after either encountering them or beating them once. There is a chance you can find them in the next run or at A bar and they'll join you if you can clear their challenge. There's only too much to explain in a review to cover everything but I'll do the most I can.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Spells/Gambit/Auras - To use spells you need Mana which can be gain by Basic Att or picking it up from trees. 
4 spells can be slotted. Cost 1-3 mana. Can be rearranged. Have to use all spells to refresh, no cooldowns. Where to find? Peddler shop (refreshable using currency) Void Boss. Any exploration room (small chance) Celestial Spirit. Zodiac boss. Zodiac Challenge. Salvagable for Currency. Cannot regain gambits when salvaged in case you want to add a Gambit onto a different spell unfortunately :( Spells can be upgraded to do overall more damage using Pavo's Feather or you can simply find higher level spells with a chance of a gambit slotted.
Auras - Auras are passive effects like 15% attspeed/dmg or permanent wisp. 4 can be slotted and replace. Can be found by going into a Yalee Kingdom Room. The more Yalee you rescue (kill elites that have yalee captives)
The more Auras can be found in The Yalee Rooms but you can only pick one Aura.
[h1] Currency [/h1]
Sun Pieces - Used for unlocking passive power-ups for your runs. Buying new spells/auras you've unlocked. Can be gained by finding memories during exploration rooms. Completing challenges. Defeating enemies and Zodiacs once run is completed.
Stars - The higher the difficulty the higher the Stars. Used to buy upgrades (Hp/Att/Attspeed) at andromeda's Bar. A chance for fixed amount of Keys, 1 Slot unlock, and Quarts From the Chameleon. Every room that involves combat will give Stars.
Keys - Used for the Astral Chests (found in exploration room) 1 Key for Quarts and heal/mana or 3 for chance of Upgrade Shrine/Aura/Spell/Gambit. Used for a room (forgot the name) after beating a Zodiac. The first room will have a few rooms and one special room that requires 9/12 keys (2nd stage/3rd stage) and 3 of the random npcs back at Base will give you a special effect like bringing you back to life or one free purchase at each Peddler shop.
Quarts - Healing Shards. Spells/Gambit at the Pedler shop or the special Sun Room.
[h1] Visuals [/h1]
Amazing and buttery. Very charming and easy on the eyes with all the spells and attacks going off when fighting loads of enemies.

I'm sorry I can't get it all noted down. But it's very well worth it. Especially if you enjoy the Rouge-lite Genre and the whole Zodiac thing. There isn't a Video out there that explains Every use of Currency. What each Room has. List of Character spells and general Spells but it's worth playing for yourself and seeing it or simply watch a video on youtube. Runs are usually about 20 to 40 if you make it to that farthest stage which is 3 for now.",1664966388,1679158943,True,3,0,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,True

Compared to Dead Cells or Skul, this has few things going for it. Wonderful art being the main one. Voiceacting is solid, character design is delightful.

Gameplay is really, really lacking though. 
Balance is atrocious and severely limits any meaningful choices. A central tenet of this game seems to be giving you worthless filler upgrades, while simultaneously creating 'locks' that you need to spend points to upgrade just to keep your  path open to future upgrades. 

What this means is that I'm weighing either optimizing my build -- to get stat upgrades, to go for keys only and 1 cost mana spells -- versus the *opportunity* to get cool flashy stuff. And usually the cool flashy stuff is lackluster or actually worse than the starter spells. So what that means is that if I go for the risk of hoping for a flashier build, that build usually is destined to die. It reinforces playing just at the core loop of 'choose the key room, dodge a bunch, hit square and triangle a bunch to cycle through your starter spells and use whatever crap upgrades the game throws at you til you win based on dodging and DPS'. 

Besides that, the world and terrains are very empty and uninspired compared to contemporaries. 

Possible when this comes out of early access it'll be better but so far the design choices feel pretty baked into the game.",1677600758,1677600758,False,3,0,0.500122964382171631,0,True,False,True

But I saw the sale and figured i'd save myself $5. AND I AM GLAD I DID! I would pay full price for this ($5 isn't much of a difference anyway). This game is BEAUTIFUL. The graphics are beautiful, the characters are rad, enemies look great and are really cool and fun to fight and dodge, the animations are fluid, the art is great, the voice acting is solid, the spells are sick, the gameplay is tight, the audio is clean and will make any audophile's eargasm, I could go on. I was skeptical of this game and had been eyeing it after seeing it played in a video about roguelikes (and heard people say its similar to dead cells, which i sorta disagree but do agree that the gameplay is tight like Dead Cells). The game is also co-op, and kicks Ember Knights ass (I thought that game was garbage and felt that people only liked it for the co-op). This game is definitely worth your time. If you're a roguelike fan, this is definitely a must own. I can't believe I slept on this but I am glad I did considering I heard that not all the story bosses had been released yet. I am extremely impressed with this games and if a game is not fantastic, i'll refund it typically. This game is a 9/10 or a 10/10. I enjoy this a lot and will be spending a lot more time in the beautiful, colorful world that is Astral Ascent (and no my username is not related to this game).

In my opinion, one of the best games to come out since Dead Cells and Skul!

- The movement and controls are incredibly fluid, it feels SO good and responsive. Definitely the best selling point of this game. Even better than Dead Cells somehow.
- Lots of spells, abilities, combos, modifiers, etc to customise your build as well. Could use a little more variety I think, but they've already diversified it I'm sure they will add more.
- 12 incredible bosses so far, they all are pretty impressive and have nice attack patterns.
- The ascension levels are quite challenging especially when you stack them up.
- The music is great. Although it doesn't always fit the action style perfectly, it's still doesn't make me want to turn it off which is good.
- The story is okay? There's a lot of lore that's interesting but we're missing the last part of the story so hopefully we'll know more soon! Obviously this is a roguelite, don't buy it simply for the story.

A couple of things that can be improved here and there obviously, but this went from a decent game to an incredible game quite quickly, especially this latest update so I figured it deserved an updated review.",1649809526,1675628757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The first boss has the most absurd movement and skills it's annoying as hell to play the first stage over and over. Souls-like x1000 and it's a pixel graphics platformer. The concept of moving in super close to do attacks that do almost no damage to just use a spell here and there is extremely unenjoyable in this execution. Timing is also completely unforgiving for this game. The boss has so many differently timed pauses between all of the moves which makes it just a game of learning the boss moves and timing of them over and over while the rest of the game is a boring breeze.

Too long, but will read anyway:
As said, the art, music, characters, designs, are nothing short of incredible. Like, the quality is nearly second to none. It kicks the crap out of Dead Cells and Skul: Hero Slayer in terms of presentation, and it's not really even close.

The combat is not bad, it has a very solid base. But I think there are some issues. I think some of the smaller enemy's attacks are poorly telegraphed. They are way too small, and the feedback on when they initiate their attack is nearly completely lost. The other thing is that enemies initiate their attacks while you're attacking them, which I'm never a huge fan of, especially when there are like 20 enemies on screen, but only one of them matters, while the others take juuuuuust long enough to kill that they take little pieces off your healthbar. It's just more annoying, and it feels like the dash has way too much downtime, for few iframes you actually get. Though that could just be perception. I managed to first-try 2 of the bosses, and I think the bosses are generally well designed. They have unique moves, but I think they are built to lose against your first try, since you never really know what they are actually gonna do until it actually happens, unless you come in extremely well prepared with a ton of HP and a healing charge. Also enemies drop HP drops so rarely that you could complete the entire first stage and get 1-2/5 shards pretty regularly, then another run you'll get like 10 it's pretty inconsistent. Seems like a pretty weird rate for the system to punish you so heavily for using the charges before you reach the 5 you need. Also 80% of your damage comes from using your abilities. It's not my favorite style, but it works, however, that makes the game run super differently if you don't get good spells, it becomes a huge slog. And you only typically get 3/4 spells that you're forced to cycle through by the end of the first stage. Meaning, you have to fight the first boss with basically 2/4 of your main damage dealers being more of a mana-tax, rather than an actually good damage option, to get to your (hopefully) good damage options. 

All this is to say, the combat is good, but has some flaws that if were addressed, it could be a masterpiece. Personally I don't like having to cycle through spells by having to mill through the other 3, and sort of makes half the combat about buying time, and farming mana trying to deal chip damage with your main attack. Alternatively, and much more boringly, you could wait till your single, consistent ability on your LT cooldown goes up to actually do any amount of sizable damage, then use the opening to farm more MP. Idk, it feels clunky for how dangerous it is to farm MP while so many of the abilities are almost one-shot kills on everything but bosses. It feels like it should maybe be more evened out. Weaving spells during the natural combat rather than only engaging TO GET to use your spells.

The metagame, or the overarching strategy also leaves something to be desired. The choice between keys, currency, or a boon to one of your abilities seems like there's only one good answer. KEYS. Keys are how you get run-wide passive stat bonuses. My best run ever got stacked with strength, and it's almost impossible to do that with anything other than keys. The aura bonuses are almost always useless, despite being very important. Like, you can get an aura that will give you a small bonus when you poison an enemy! Cool! Sucks that all my abilities, weapons, and passives are for fire... There's hardly any buildcraft, and you sorta just have to hope the game gives you a synergy that you can use. And, even then it's like ""deal a tiny bit of ice damage when you cast this spell"" which is negligible compared to the actual strength of the spell and I feel like I hardly ever notice. That and also why would you put your passive bonuses on the early spells? You have to go so far out of your way to upgrade them, that 90% of the time, you'll have 1 OP spell, 1 decent spell, and 2 literal trash spells because you literally cannot afford to invest in your other spells, since spell upgrades, slot unlocks, and spell upgrades require you to go well out of your way to get. Better to just farm passives and then get some money to replace your spells at the guaranteed shop at the end of each stage. 

I think the designer was afraid of people becoming too OP, while wanting to make an RPG system baked into a rogue-like. This game feels like it has the quality of a fully fledged single player adventure game, with the setup and everything, but they were almost afraid to take that route due to the lack of replay-ability. 

It just feels uneven, uneven is the way you could describe almost everything in this game, but this game is still genuinely an artistic wonder, and I hope that the gameplay and metagame eventually reach the point to match it's near flawless presentation.",1675288752,1675288752,True,28,1,0.686268031597137451,0,True,False,True

-----

Honestly, I want to love this game so badly. The art is great, the animations seem pretty good, the combat is interesting and the mechanics are slightly different from everything else I've played.

Unfortunately, the game runs like complete dogshit and stutters so hard it makes almost any of the more precise timings impossible. Any more than 3-4 enemies on screen at the same time and you're basically running the game at half speed. I'll probably update my review in a year or so when this game is out of early access, but getting a hard thumbs down from me until some serious performance improvements are made. I've got a GTX3080 12GB and an intel i9 11th gen... the only reason a pixel art game should be stuttering at all is just poor, poor optimization or the underlying game engine. Lack of graphics options is another huge underlying issue--there are only two settings or so to change. No framerate options period, no vsync options, period.

early access done right

the new exporter is great. loading times are essentially gone, even on hdd.

replacing utility spells with a character specific ability and adding a level system was a good idea.
i´d like to see some more meta progression or options for those abilities in the future. maybe being able to choose an ability out of a pool. 
the balance between them isn´t quite there yet. ayla seems to have the strongest and most fun ability out of the three (low cd, quickly executed, easily usable to combo, good dmg and an additional effect with the shadow mark), while kiran suffers from a slow counter move that often misses, has a pretty high cd and even gets you punished for using it sometimes. the idea of a counter ability is great but it just doesn´t work really well in this case.

i´m still not the biggest fan of octave and the drone doesn´t really help it because it adds absolutely nothing to his playstyle. his spells aren´t that bad but something about his basic attacks just feels wrong to me.

all in all still a fantastic game and i´m excited for more content

maybe rework ocatve a little so he isn´t that boring and clunky to play as and pls buff my boy kiran a little bit, he deserves it :)",1669171662,1671386650,True,8,0,0.545082747936248779,0,True,False,True

I had difficulty understanding how to build my spells, I couldn't, at first, understand why the second zodiac just absolutely bodied me. Turns out gambits scale your damage. I'm not sure if I missed a tutorial on building spells or what but knowing that matching spell scaling icons to the gambit spell type is a must to do any meaningful damage.

What I mean by that is, when you pick up a spell. On the top left of every spell, there's a scaling shown, so tier 2 spells have 40% + gambit modifier. Leveling up with pavos feather increases the 40% and using gambits scales up the second number. I was only able to figure out how to scale elemental gambits. For example, a spell with fire scaling would have 40%+ a fire symbol. For every fire gambit you equip, your spell damage goes up. At 4 fire gambits, you have a +100% damage.

As you progress, you get higher and higher tier spells, so the game boils down to minmaxing when to scrap a spell. You could have 4 gambit slot unlocked tier 1 spell with matching gambit bonuses but it gets outclassed by any tier 4 spell.

I found that for each world, maxing out a single spell either with gambit bonuses or with pavos feathers resulted in better success. So after world 1 for example, I would have 1 spell that was either tier 4 or had all the matching bonuses. I would swap my other spells on the fly and just hoped for the best.

I couldn't figure out how to scale the non-elemental spells to any meaningful degree. I think a spell building tutorial would be nice.




Character Stats

I think scaling health was the go to. Attack speed felt like a trap, at best you get mana to produce more spells with higher attack speed. But your auto attack damage is miniscule.

Damage scaling felt like a trap, I'm bad at platformers and a glass cannon build never worked out for me.

For my Octave run, I had 13hp, 4 damage and 3 attack speed buffs. Take that how you will.

I think that the basic attack damage should be scaled up a little higher, I shouldn't always have to use spells to take down the most basic of enemies in exploration rooms with any sort of meaningful efficiency.


Gambits

I think there needs to be more gambits for each element. I think around 10 should be good. Reason being, with three electric spells, all of them had the exact same modifiers I think. Just electrify on hit. Albeit with different % of success. I think more unique gambits would be nice. Hell, even unique mythical gambits would be nice. Something like 10% chance to recast a spell or something like that.

Non-elemental gambits, I couldn't figure out their scaling. So I thought they were useless. Having a gambit tutorial would be nice.


Powers

I lucked out with a 5% hp Regen power along with 3 powers that modified electric damage. So I geared my spells to scale with electric damage and it seemed to work. I did have trouble understanding/seeing with my powers did. I think either slightly changing the colors of the elemental effects or making them slightly larger might be helpful both for seeing and understanding the elemental effects of spells and powers.


Prowess

I picked bellator has: 5 seconds of increased duration, cool down is 20 seconds shorter but 5 seconds less duration, and electrify on hit.

I think the signature spells were done well, I liked Octaves and Ayla's spells. The fire guy, I never played after I saw that his auto attack range was quite small.

The modifiers for basic attacks were underwhelming. I picked up the +20% damage modifier and after a few rooms, it became redundant I thought. I think basic attacks need some work, to make them viable for damage along with giving mana back. Even adding a stagger to some enemies might be helpful, like they do in deadcells or hollow knight.


Aesthetics

Loved what you guys did with the pixel art. Looked up how the game looked before, and I'm glad you made changes to character art in dialogue screens.


Movement

Love the movement of the game, just wish there were more I frames when dashing.


POV while playing

Just wish everything was slightly more zoomed in, just a little so I can better follow what my spell effects did. I had 3 electric spells, all with 4 matching gambits and I couldn't for the life of me tell what spark did. I could never see it on the screen before it vanished.


Andromeda's Challenges

Fun concept. Just would like to see different iterations of it. All of them currently are 'take no damage'. Something like 'clear room in 1 minute' or a 'survive 1 minute' might make it more interesting.

[/tr]
[/table]
[hr][/hr]
I was looking for a co-op Hades experience and this is the closest game to it. Beautiful game with well thought out mechanics: You have spells, utility spells, auras, special call summons and many more. There are many additions in-game while doing a run that makes you go ""WOW"".

[hr][/hr]
The art is insane from Main Menu to Animated Pixel Dialogue plus Voice Acting is superb. World 3 is available now and there are 3 playable characters with their own unique spells and they also have access to general spells. I sank in 80 Hours in Hades got the true ending and this game I have like 88 Hours counting and World 4 is yet to arrive.

[tr]
	[td]You have meta help from NPCs you get in certain rooms to spells from bosses you whooped.[/td]

🟧CONS:

[table]
[tr]
	[td]Cons are mostly for 2-player gaming since the game is designed for 1-player runs.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]2 players share their upgrade path: you choose which one upgrades their spell or stats so the upgrade ""loot"" is divided when another player joins in.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]I have upgraded everything at the base, at the start of a run: you are given only 1 random spell + aura/feather and this is bad for 2 players. I have so much excess currency just sitting at the base since I already have everything maxed out.[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]Stat upgrades like the 5% attack speed and 5% damage feels grindy for 1 player more so for 2 players since only 1 gets them, you don't feel them in-game unless you get many stat upgrades (5 to 10 upgrade stacks).[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]There are many cool spells and auras but you have no access to them to make it less RNG and make it more build specific like in Hades.[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]💠Suggestions:[/h1]
💧With everything unlocked at the base allow us to purchase 1 spell or utility spell or aura per player with the excess currency that is just sitting waiting for World 4 to arrive. 

💧Give 2 players 2 feather upgrades per room.

💧There needs to be gambit altars like the spell altars.

💧5% Attack speed and 5% damage upgrades need to be catered to player 2 as well.

The world is beautiful , i absolutely love the how everything looks. Im a sucker for pixel graphics, the characters are all loveable in their own way and you can tell the devs are putting a lot of care into this game. Honestly i have played my share of early access games, most show potential, few live up to it. If they never improve this game and left it as is i would be very satisfied. Now luckily there is still more to be added. Now let me get into a few specifics:

The combat - Smooth and addictive, the combos are great and the spell mechanic adds another layer making every run feel unique and fun. I love customisation and figuring out on the fly what spell, gambit etc will fit in any given run is great. 

The music - Ah this is where the charm lives, the soundtrack is lovely, for an action game it feels like it wouldn't fit but honestly it is just so relaxing there has been times mid run where you can stop at benches and sit and i have my characters do so for a while just to listen to the track and marvel at the art.

The Lore - I haven't gotten to the end of the game yet but from what they have put forward in the first couple hours it just makes me want to keep going to find out more about everyone. The premise is super interesting and the rate at which you learn more and more is good. 

Overall: I'd give this a solid 8/10 simply because it isnt finished yet but if they keep up with the how good things have been so far it would be a solid 9 maybe evem 10/10. Longest review i have ever written so that gotta count for something as well!

I know its unfinished, but i wonder how many gaming hours they'll add, hope it's lots more without needing to abuse difficulty.

I'm loving it everytime, its really so good, you actually feel immersed and in touch with the characters you play, you can feel the love of the story, specially in Ayla's case, she seems to be so deep with each one of her lines, even the short ones used in the middle of minion fights.

The design is wonderful, not perfect, of course, but its still wonderful, and about it not being perfect, forget about it when it comes to the zodiacs, they are IMMACULATE, never ceasing to wonder me everytime one of them appears, the introduction animation of each one of them is characteristic and bonded with each respective boss, just like their attacks too, which gets me to the point of the boss battles, each one of them is beautiful and frenetic, but they surely dont feel unfair at all,  the sensation is that if you got hit, it was not any kind of bs, it was your fault

Skills are creative and satisfying to use, but its kinda disappointing how its very clear that some of them are way better than others in most of the situations, something you could make a tier list of, but i don't find this kind of thing positive since it kinda restrains completely free gameplay, but if you're skilled enough, you can use any set, since you can actually beat the game without using any(if you're able to do this, you're a psychopath also no more Astral Ascent, you got enough)

dodge mechanic is the only bitter mechanic i've found up to the present moment, doesnt feel much useful for actually using its ""invincible"" frames, most of the time I use it for repositioning, also the repetitive dialogues with most characters from the garden really is an underwhelming surprise specially when theres an arrow pointing to the character, and I feel like the game's going to be so quick to finish, even when its finished...

Overall, loving the experience and definitely will recommend this game to my friends, who will probably enjoy it too! Really, you guys should try the 2 players mode, i haven't just because I dunno anyone who has a controller, but it sure seems fun!

I was never able to get into Rogue Legacy, for example, and wrote the genre off, until I recently played Hades, Risk of Rain 2, Backpack Hero, Slay the Spire, and now Astral Ascent. I love these latter titles for multiple reasons, but the common denominator is a complex, in-depth system of mechanics that is yet somehow incredibly intuitive and rewarding. Astral Ascent does this in spades, and as such is well on its way to becoming my favorite rogue-lite. 

One more thing that Astral Ascent does better than all these games (except maybe Hades)? A wonderful story, memorable NPCs, bosses, and allies, lovable characters to play, and incredible dialogue/voice acting. The art is also pure joy to experience, and that's something considering I never really enjoyed pixel art before this game.

If there's anything to improve on, for me, would be the randomizing of skill drops. I've unlocked a lot, character-specific and general, but I feel that after a few dozen runs, I still largely get the same 6-8 skill drops. I presume later skills get unlocked on maps with more stars or later areas, but even with that I haven't experienced even 20% of everything I've unlocked. Maybe I'm just unlucky though!

+ different characters with unique skills and play styles - it is quite fun and provides a lot of diversity. i've found two playable characters so far in my early access run, but the developers addressed there will be more.

+ fast paced movement and combat. it's a pleasure how the combat is playing out so well already. it's pacing is fast, with layers of vertical combat and many different spells. improving the skills with gambits and building some synergies is quite interesting and enjoyable. the magnificent combat is already one of the major selling points.

+ the boss design is excellent. there is a lot of variety in design and skill set, making each boss a unique and memorable experience. i really liked their decision making a pool of different bosses for each encounter.

+ liked the room progression system. it's all about meaningful decisions and how you progress in your character development.

+ eye-catching pixel art in-game graphics and exceptionally well-drawn character art. astral ascent is a pleasure to look at!

+ fully dubbed dialogues, and the dub is actually decent as well. i'm usually quite critical about dubs and prefer no dub over a bad one. at least, the audio quality. the quality of some of the dialogue texts is something they have to dastically improve on.

+ combat controls are quite decent, ui controls and managing your stuff is a tad bit clunky at times, but nothing you won't get used to after a couple of hours.

+ wholesome sound design, calm and relaxing audio is soothing your ears on a high level quality.


[b]what felt debatable to me:[/b]

~ melee combat feels weak no matter what upgrade you're obtaining. there is quite some balancing to do. at least most of the spells seem fine tho.

~ charming characters, although they don't have enough interesting lines of dialogue.

~ it's awkward how the game shows you a dialogue symbol on npcs, but they don't even have anything new to say. instead, they'll repeat the same line over and over. please don't bait me with pop ups, if nothing is going to happen.

~ some character names are pretty nonsense. a dragon called ""barbecue"", are you serious? it's not funny.

~ meta progression needs to be worked on. 

~ some of the enemies and their skills kinda aim tracking you, which feels awkward to play against.

~ would've loved to see different outfits instead of different colors for the same skin.

~ the combat controls are quite good, but piloting the UI and managing your items can be a little clunky at times. this is nothing you won't get used to after a couple of hours tho.

~ pricing of the early access isn't accurate in my opinion. 20 bucks on sale for an early access title is a lot to ask.


[b]what i disliked:[/b]

- unnecessary detailed AND unskippable tutorial. it was indeed well built into the game, but i generally dislike forced tutorials. even more so if they're showing me plain and basic game mechanics like: how to attack on the ground, attack in the air, jump, dodge and so on. it's simply boring for seasoned players and will be delaying the game for no reason in the beginning.

- it's not possible to skip anything meaningful to speed up runs. like boss intro, end of run resource count (at least not fast enough), respawning and so on. those things will take up an unnecessary amount of time while doing a run and in between runs.

- game performance is kinda bad in this early state. frame drops, micro stutters and lags. the good and odd thing is that the combat performance is actually flawless, but starting a dialogue or loading something hurts the games performance for a couple of seconds.

- didn't like the traps at all. please make them destroyable or think about other kind of traps, like basic spikes or something. undestroyable thingies which spawn a constant flood of enemies are not fun 
[strike]and the plants are kinda garbage as well, sometimes blocking you off from looting your items completely.[/strike] (plants already got fixed)


that's my conclusion after a couple of hours and more or less finishing the early access content. i'll update this review after more hours played and of course content updates, which will happen since the developer is motivated and reacting to critique from the player base. overall i think this game has a bright future, so i'll rate astral ascent with an 8/10 despite having some early access problems. the premise is definitely there, and only time will tell if the devs manage to make a real gem out of this already pretty solid base of a game.",1650289165,1651315281,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True

The gameplay is excellent. It's fast, skill based, and feels good. It's a unique combat system, to be sure. 

Your melee attacks build up your mana, which is used for your 'spells' (read- skills). Each character has their own available spells, based on their motif. 

These must be used in rotation, so there is a strategy here as well to how you arrange them- you can rotate them, but you have to use all four slots before you can reuse any, so spamming is off the table. Keeping track of these during a boss fight can be tricky, but I'm sure with experience it becomes easier (Don't want to think you're throwing magic tracking knives and instead use your explosive doppelganger). I saw someone griping that melee attacks don't do enough damage- that's a design choice, homes. Your melee attacks deal with weak enemies and generate mana for your skills. 'Melee build' is not a thing (or if it is, it's esoteric). Melee plays a good supporting role, and your ability to get in, get hits, and get out (or follow up with spells), is key.

The rogue-lite meta progression is also satisfying, increasing spell variety, character upgrades, etc as you go. 

The levels are cool- first world is very 'Secret of Mana' with pastoral backgrounds and enemies. The art is great.

My one nitpick, and I may have to just live with it- I really like some of the character art, but it's a little too anime for me- not always, but little corners of the game. The creatures that live in your ever expanding garden (home base) are pretty cool, but one of the two playable mains is pretty annoying looking (and more importantly, sounding). It's a little odd, separate from my qualms with anime, that everything is really cool stylized pixels until we've got realistic head portraits/ models in town. This is pretty minor, and not a reason to skip, for sure

Anyway, almost wish I'd waited on this one- not because it isn't worth your money now- it's very well put together- but because I wish the whole game was already here to enjoy all at once!

... right now the ""late game"" consists of increasing the difficulty with modifiers. Problem with this is the modifiers are interfering negatively with gameplay. Randomly spawning invincible clones of fallen enemies or giving them randomly retaliation damage means that the only way to consistently avoid damage is to take a step back and wait, which is boring and / or frustrating. Not to mention the bad visibility of green-blue enemies in front of a light blue background. Make the clones killable AND timed or make them do only one attack before vanishing. Clones can randomly increase the difficulty of boss fights so much, that it becomes impossible. We need counteractions for that.
... some attacks of enemies are inconsistent. Sometimes projectiles get destroyed when they touch the ceiling, sometimes they bounce back to come down faster on you.
... especially one enemy is designed so frustrating (spinning leaf thing) that I hate every second fighting them. Enemies that attack for a few seconds at a time without you being able to damage them isn't fun at all, especially when fighting in what's basically a narrow corridor. Not fun at all if they are invincible clones.

Nonetheless these are things that can be fixed and without the modifiers everything works fine, because 95% of the enemies and attacks can be counteracted.

having a good time playing it while i do think its a bit pricey for an early access, it has good quality in the graphic department so maybe because of that.
my only complaint atm is only about the beginning spells u get in the start i think it would be nicer (because there are a lot of spells) if i cant choose at least 2 or even one starting spell of my own before each run, maybe implement it as a function we need to buy later on.

The gameplay is smooth, fun, and varied. I particularly like the ability to permanently stay in the air during combat and the advantages it allows skilled players. 
I've only fought the first boss of the game but the design of the fight is very promising for what is to come - Like all good boss fights, it encourages an aggressive playstyle and presses you with quick attacks that allow you to retaliate every time if you figure out the timing and positioning required.

There are some things I think could use a push in the right direction:
- The progression system is vertical, meaning you don't really customise your power-increase, and you just kind of get stronger in all aspects as time moves on. 
- The non-boss enemy design isn't the spiciest, I've only seen 2 worlds but so far the vast majority of enemies will only have very basic attack patterns, and most will not get to attack you at all before you kill them, giving a lot of enemies a target-dummy feeling.

I will say, new rogue-likes come out daily these times, and I try almost all of them. This one stands out, and its only recently released as Early Access. Very excited to follow it along its progression.",1650400754,1650400754,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The only issue I saw that arose came with the boss fights, I'm not a game designer nor do I know a lot about the ins and outs of programming - but the AI in boss fights still sees the dead co-op player as a living player and will priority target them still, it made the boss fight funny, but probably not intended on what the developers wanted!",1650382971,1650382971,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I also love the art style of the game and the whole game is animated really well. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay is far too simplistic and way too floaty.

Looking at the game, I thought it was going to be a Devil May Cry / God of War type game where you could do cool combos….. And you really can't. This is because your attacks, while flashy, are very basic. You have a button that you use in order to do basic attacks and a button that you use in order to use your spells. There's pretty much no variation to your basic attacks. In fact, you can just hold the basic attack and your character will automatically attack. In regards to the spells, you can equip a total of 4 spells and you can't freely select what spell you want to use. The ""spell"" button will simply use the next spell that's in the queue. Once you've used all 4 spells, they'll all ""reset"" and you can use them again in the exact same order.

Using spells cost mana, and you gain mana by using basic attacks. So what the game wants you to do is to switch between using basic attacks and using spells. While that looks fine on paper, in reality you're fundamentally using one ""combo"" over and over again which is ""Complete a basic attack sequence --> press spell button ---> repeat"". I mean, I eventually felt God of War 3 got repetitive since I used certain combos over and over again, but even in that game I was at least using 4 different combos/strategies! With Astral Ascent, it feels like the same thing over and over again. While the game might have a lot of different spells, it effectively doesn't matter because there's no decision-making involved in how you use the spells. Spells will always do more damage than basic attacks, so you'll always want to use the spells as soon as you can. 

Not only is the core gameplay overly simplistic with effectively just one combo, it just isn't very satisfying. Sure the spells look good and flashy, but when I am simply using them at a press of a button, it doesn't feel satisfying at all to use them. In my opinion, there needs to be some level of difficulty in the execution of your attacks (e.g. Devil May Cry) in order to make it feel rewarding to see all the cool effects on screen, but this game doesn’t have any of that difficulty. 

It should also be mentioned that while the game wants you to switch between basic attacks and spells, even THAT has issues. This is because the game has almost no hit stun on enemies except for the very smallest of enemies (and sometimes not even them starting in the 2nd biome). This means that in the opening you have in order to attack an enemy before they move onto their next attack, you can EITHER choose to complete a basic attack chain OR use a spell. Not both. So the simple combo of ""Complete a basic attack sequence --> press spell button ---> repeat"" becomes EVEN SIMPLER to ""Complete a basic attack sequence ---> dodge"" and ""Press spell button ---> dodge"", repeat. 

I will say that the bosses are really well done. They can pretty much stand toe to toe with Hollow Knight bosses. The bosses in Astral Ascent have a large variety of moves and really make you think of how best to damage them while at the same time dodging their attacks. Unlike regular enemies who are simply a matter of building up mana in order to use a few AOE spells to take them all out, you can't do that with bosses because they have too much HP. So no matter what, you have to master the bosses if you want to defeat them, which is great. They also look really cool.

In my opinion, some core changes need to be made in order to make the game more satisfying to play. 
	• Have more hitstun and refine it: Hitstun is crucial to most action games. If players are attacking an enemy, they need to feel confident that they can complete their combo without risk of getting attacked back. Even defensive games like Dark Souls have hitstun! So a lot more enemies should flinch when players attack them. Even the ""bigger"" enemies should flinch after they've used an attack and are ""vulnerable"" to flinching, or they might flinch if you deal enough damage to them/do one huge damaging hit. This also helps players feel like their attacks have some impact. For good examples of proper hitstun, you can see games like ""Have a Nice Death"" and ""Odin Sphere Leifthrasir"". 
	• Allow actual combos: This can really only be implemented with the hitstun being refined. Currently, since enemies don't really get stunned with attacks, you can at most do 1 or 2 attacks before having to dodge. If the game has a more refined hitstun system, players will then be capable of doing long combo strings, which will also feel really good to use (e.g. basic combo attack chain + spell + basic combo attack chain + spell + basic combo attack chain + spell + basic combo attack chain + spell. WITHOUT any dodges in between).
	• Balance the spells more: Currently, it seems that you'll pretty much always want to use long range AOE spells. The spells really need to be balanced so that there's a reason to use short range non AOE spells. For example, maybe AOE spells should have a long windup such that it leaves you open to attack AND can't be used in a combo chain (since the enemy will recover from hitstun before the move finishes being used). Then, there would be a reason to use short range quick spells since they have combo potential whereas AOE spells would not.
	• Allows players to use any spells they want at the press of a button instead of being in a specific order: I think this is the first game where I've seen players being limited/forced to using their special abilities in a specific order….and I don't think it's a good system. I really think you rob the players of their agency by not giving them the option to use whatever spells they want at the press of a button (e.g. by having the up, down, left, and right keypad correspond to the 4 spells). It would add a lot of depth to the system if players can use whatever spells they want, since then a lot more spells suddenly become viable. For example, currently I wouldn't use a spell that only attacks up or down because it's too situational, but if I could choose when to use the spells, I might want to always have a spell that attacks up just in case for aerial enemies. If you're worried about players making one spell OP and spamming it over and over again, simply get rid of the feathers that increase the level of specific spells. The gambits are fine since for the most part, they're only really useful if you use multiple spells together.
	• Re-work enemies to have more defined roles: Currently, all the enemies feel very similar. While they might all look different, they pretty much all do the same thing which is that they all want to run up to you and hit you. Enemies need to feel more unique. E.g. some enemies should be rangers and attack you from a distance. Some enemies should heal/buff other enemies. Some enemies should stay in the air. Etc… 
	• Re-work exploration rooms: Combat rooms are far more fun than exploration rooms. Exploration rooms just have a series of 3 enemies that you need to fight, which isn't very difficult. I honestly think you should ditch the whole ""exploration room vs combat room"" idea and just make every room an ""exploration room"" but you're forced to go into arenas where multiple enemies spawn for you to fight (e.g. a typical combat room encounter). A good example of this is the game ""Have a Nice Death"".

Overall, this is a game that looks really good….. But its core systems aren't very deep and therefore can quickly get repetitive. I can tell that this game has a lot of potential though because the bosses are an absolute treat to fight. If the core systems can be changed such that even fighting regular enemies is challenging and rewarding with a lot to master, I am sure this game can become a lot more fun.",1650369623,1650370026,False,171,15,0.514427006244659424,24,True,False,True

The realistic looking characters look a bit off-putting when in dialogue. I feel bad saying that because I'm sure a lot of work and effort was put into the characters design.

The second problem is I'm having is frame drops when I hit one of those pink bubbles or if a lot is going on onscreen. I feel like this game has the potential to spiral out of control with the amount of spells and augments. Having this many things happen at once should not slow the game down if it is the main gameplay.

Things I like: 
- Graphics are great
- Combat is pretty satisfying
- Movement gives a lot of flexibility on how you approach enemies and adds a nice vertical dimension to fights
- Meaningful choices about routes through the different zones, giving you a ton of options for how you want to scale your character
- To add to that, HOW you upgrade seems to matter. It feels like you can make a better or worse choice along the way and that can make the run notably tougher or easier for you. I think as I'm starting to make better choices, the runs feel more streamlined
- The healing system is interesting, utility spells are a nice departure from your ""active"" spells, and the auras give nice permanent boosts that feel like they matter from within a run
- It feels like there's a LOT of replayability here, and the NG+ system is fun so far and looks like it's shaping up to add some nice difficulty and give the player a lot of control over how to apply that difficulty from run to run


Things I'm less fond of:
- Even with damage scaling, it never really feels (to me) like your character hits very hard if it's not a spell. Honestly, I don't want to melee regular enemies 10-20 times to kill them, and IMO, melee damage could be scaled up. Right now, the meta-progression feels like I have more options per run as I go, but it doesn't feel like I'm getting much stronger at all from run to run. This can be particularly egregious during boss fights, which ARE fun, but which can tend to drag on for a LONG time because you have to hit them through SO many attack cycles.

Edit: I still think the damage could be scaled up BUT it feels like less of a problem with some of the stronger auras, and I'm seeing those more frequently now. The boss fights still sometimes feel like hitting an angry sandbag with a spatula.

- There are situations where a reward like an astral chest will be placed between two traps. It's a minor thing, but it doesn't feel great. I don't want 2 tree stumps to chuck 6 explosive dudes at me repeatedly while I decide which stat I want to scale.

Edit: I still think this is true. I've had a few instances now where I've gotten smacked by a static trap while standing in front of an altar or at an end-of-level reward. It's never ruined a run, but it's made me grind my teeth a little. 

- Some parts of the ""return to town"" experience feel weird. For example, a bunch of the unlocks from the poet and the dragon (who wears his name well, despite what my character may think) were already auto-unlocked prior to my completing my second run. It makes the meta-progression aspect of it feel less fun, because I didn't have to work to unlock them.

Edit: I think I was wrong to suggest that a bunch of the selectable spells and auras were ""fluff"", so I deleted that from my first comment. After some more play time with them, they do feel better to use than I expected. I do think that synergies seem harder to build than I'd like, but maybe that's because they're not meant to really lock in until late game, which isn't out yet. Might be nice to see an added bonus if you have like 2 of the same type of gambit apply to a spell or something, particularly since there are a limited number of Pavo feathers and you can only upgrade so many times. 

- My own personal thing, but 4 spells feels like maybe 1 too many. I'd rather see more ways to upgrade the spells I do get. Combat is frantic enough that I'm not really actively choosing individual spells during fights most of the time, and the icons are small enough that I'd have to memorize the rotation during each run or stare at the lower left corner to pick them in real time anyway. The pace of the combat just makes it seem like there isn't really time to do that. It's a little different with boss fights, but given that you HAVE to cycle through spells, it feels like they're on a conveyor belt most of the time anyway, and 1 fewer might make for a better rotation, and synergies would be a little easier to build up. 

Edit: I'm torn on this. I still feel like the spell rotation is a little clunky. Maybe it's because I'm usually still toting around one ""beginner spell"" even by the end of the second zone. It's probably because I'm prioritizing keys and spell upgrades and Andromeda's bar when it shows up, but it seems like you SHOULD be prioritizing those things. It just always feels like there's one weak link in the rotation that doesn't really need to be there, especially because the ""gambit slot"" upgrades are so rare. Weaker/neglected spells are just going to continue to stay weak/neglected, because you're not going to spend the resources to level it or add a slot, when you already have 2 or 3 other things that are better and aren't maxed out. 

- A new one: I've had a few runs now where, even though I've taken keys whenever I'm low on them, I'll still hit a spot where I won't get any keys for several rooms in a row. It doesn't happen often, but it really sucks when you have to pass up 4-5 astral chests in a row. It seems hard to make up missing that many upgrades or auras, and so the run is kind of scuttled just because of bad room RNG. Maybe a mechanic where if you have 0 keys, the likelihood of a key room choice appearing at the end of a room increases by a small amount every time one doesn't appear. That way, if you're ever out of keys for more than a few rooms, it's because of a choice you've made and not because of bad luck. 

I like this game a lot. It's a ton of fun, and I'm eager to see where the devs go with it. I think it's more than worth the asking price, even at this point in its development.",1649903151,1650172422,True,72,2,0.840694785118103027,0,True,False,True

[b]Things I like: [/b]
- Game feels very fluid after rebinding Dash to a shoulder button - it always feels better for horizontal platformers.
- Spells are fairly unique.
- Audio is great.
- Difficulty feels decent at the moment (Beating Stage 2 is very doable after a couple of runs).
- Concept of rotating bosses is interesting and pretty well executed.
- Interesting stages.
- Pretty visuals if you like pixel art. If you're not really a pixel fan (like me), it's passable and inoffensive.
- Is actually fairly charming.

[b]Things I'm on the fence about:[/b]
- Melee/Spell balance. Right now, Spells comprise of majority of your damage - melee attacks cannot compete. This is somewhat fine, but sometimes it feels bad chipping away at something for 20 or so hits.
- Spell hitboxes can be strange and unintuitive. Ethereal Knives, for example, has a homing property, but only if it's cast in the right direction and within a range around your character. Despite that, once it's locked on, it has unlimited range, so it can feel a little weird.
- Portrait Artstyle. The style on the Title screen fits the game much more, but the in-game portraits feel slightly mismatched (YMMV).
- Mana not recovering when entering a new stage. I understand that Mana is supposed to be a resource on its own, but seeing as it's renewable from simply hitting things, it feels a bit odd that entering a new stage doesn't just set you at max Mana. As it is right now, it makes you want to finish off enemies with basic attacks... which would be fine, if the basic attacks didn't hit like peanuts. It would significantly speed up the game's pacing.

[b]Things I dislike:[/b]
- Percentage based Gambits. Nothing is more irritating than an unreliable effect. It feels like an utter waste of a slot if it doesn't proc, and borderline broken if you get several procs in a row (Infinite Mana, for example).
- No way to customise the start of the run beyond character selection - at least, up to where I've played. Wizards of Legend, another spell-based roguelike, allowed ways to tweak your initial start via spell selection or starting relics, allowing for strategies before the run even starts.
- Upgrades seem fairly linear at the moment.
- Progression does not feel smooth - some things are unlocked even before features become unlocked.
- Lack of visual clarity. Everything is so bright and vivid that it can be very easy to miss things when there are several enemies in the same location, mostly due to the game lacking outlines.
- Luck plays a huge factor. You can get an Aura that has a Freeze effect... and have zero spells pop up that gives Freeze.

[b]Things I would like to see in the future:[/b]
- Customised starts to runs. The current system is similar to Dead Cells and Skul, but with 4 spells that you're forced to cycle through, this feels a lot less impactful than it should be.
- Basic-Attack or Dash upgrades (not just Auras). Finding an upgrade to something you use 80% of the time would be very nice to have.
- Mana Recovery on new stage (or on stage completion). See above.
- Passive spells. Not only would they potentially reduce your cycle, they might open up interesting interactions. Maybe set a cap so it doesn't change too much.
- Boss Relics, or really, something that can alter gameplay/playstyle significantly. (1 less spell, last spell in cycle does X, can dash twice, etc.)
- Less percentage-based effects on Gambits. (Seriously, Hades only had Critical Hit mechanics as the only chance-based mechanic for a reason, and even then it was just a concept of 'more damage'. Stability is very important to curb frustration in skill-based games). Nearly all gambits in this game is percentage, from status effects to buffs to summons, and it is frustrating.
- An alternative damage reading system. I would still like to see individual components of damage on-hits personally, but this is subjective to preference.

Overall, Astral Ascent is out to a great start, but it's currently still missing elements of core design that makes me truly addicted/hooked. It can feel like a slog rather than a blitz at times, unfinished EA content aside. I'm looking forward to more content, polish, stabilisation/optimisation (game can stutter, slowdown, or take ages to load at the moment, but this is understandably the first build) and am planning to set the game aside until it's more fleshed out.

To buyers, this game has a bunch of potential, depending on how well the devs listen to feedback. You're not buying the game for now, you're buying it to support it for the experience you might get later. I'd say it's worth it if you're a fan of the genre and are looking for something new and have already played the most well-known titles, and a few lesser known ones (like Blade Assault or Niigate Tale). 

But if you're new to the action-roguelike genre, I'd recommend playing the already completed gems first (Hades, Wizard of Legend, Skul, Dead Cells, Warm Snow). They'll give you far more bang for your buck at the moment and have sold like crazy for a reason. Come back to Astral Ascent later.",1650083325,1650083634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The story is about defeating each zodiac representative, but unlike when that girl you went to high school talks about them - you don't want to kill yourself while playing this game. 

The gameplay revolves around accumulating mana with your light attacks then spending said mana to perform various spells. These spells serve as the main point of customisation from run to run. You're able to upgrade and augment each spell accordingly. There's a lot of freedom with build creation. 

The game also has local coop which is good if you're unlike me because you have friends. 

I also rebound most of the controls as I found having both dash and light attack as face buttons was awkward as hell. I recommend using a Dark Souls control scheme to free up your right thumb.
