I had a great time playing. I didn't quite make it over the 200 hour mark (which is my personal threshold for a good game). It got boring for me after a while because their was not that much to do after your settlement is well established. Despite the good mechanics, descent graphics (too cartoon-like for my liking), fine sound, and entertaining game-play, I think it lacked the depth to hold my enduring interest. However, I've seen that the developer have kept updating and improving the game. I have yet to reinstall to see if those changes fixed my personal grips (its on my to-do list. I'm currently on a 30 break from gaming and writing reviews as a substitute). 

I do want to commend the Dawn of Man Dev Team for a job well done. I'm glad you have my money. I remember this game coming out of nowhere and rocking Steam. I was on that bandwagon and the attention was well deserved. I've become extremely frustrated with the progress of Ancient Cities, leaving Dawn of Man as the sole champion of caveman simulation.

1) boats: i feel like having a boat like a rowboat could be a very fun thing to have and you can go up and down a river to find further resources or even start a colony for resources you would might need.
2) roads: road could be a amazing add to the game that it could speed up your peoples movement and even different types of bridges like a stone one to also increase speed as well as stone and dirt roads then make you people faster then on normal terrain.
3) Better birthrates: I personally fell like the birthrate even after a few updates are still WAY to low and you have to more grow from the random visits you will get. Some how the traders show up more some times more often then births. Maybe make it so that if there is more then %150 food for you population then the birth rates should double because it fells way to slow.
4) AI civilizations in the map: honestly, for me have been raided way to many times some times I feel like I need to take my revenge but since I cant do anything I just fell annoyed but if you add AI civs then you could lay out some revenge. But of course i know not everyone wants that so you can maybe make a option in the before starting a new game to turn off AI civs but leave raiders and traders. Another perk that could be nice with it is that you can make traders and raiders and set prices and levy attacks. it could add so much more time for people making kingdoms from conquering all of the people. Also the more people you conquer the more raiders will come every year from other civs to try and stop you. All I'm just saying is that AI civilizations could be pretty cool for us 
5)Animal pens: I mean do I need to say more about a Animal pen. keep the animals from wondering into the town. they don't do anything in the town besides BLOCKING MY MOUSE EVERY TIME. So it would be very nice if that could be some thing you all can add.
6) Animal can help drag megaliths: its always takes way to long for people to drag the stones so if we could get horses or donkeys to help drag the stones it could help cut time. Also adding wheels to it as well but not inertly history accurate.
7) The ability to assign people to work on a farm field and work stations instead of them just going of the workload. 

if you had the misfortune of reading this whole rant on what they can add the the game then let me thank you for reading this and hopefully some of these items you see on this list could be something you want the devs to add.

You can domesticate animals, grow crops, tree orchards, hunt animals, fish. Eventually, you can even build walls around your village, erect watch towers for raider attacks. It has a very well thought out and logical tech tree. Only bad thing I found was that the villager AI gets confused sometimes, especially when you build walls very close to mountains, the villagers pull the logs to the walls to build add ons and they leave the sleds behind, you have to end up deleting them and build new ones. That is the only bug i have found in the game and its not game breaking or anything, so you can easily deal with it.

Just a fun game really. Not too in-depth, not too casual. I am still experimenting with best ways to herd in cave hyenas to have a cave hyena zoo/meat grinder. All I can figure is I need at least a 2-gate entry to move live food (disobedient resident/unsuspecting raiders), and their enclosure to be around a lake with no connecting river since those obstruct full wall enclosure. If anything I will attempt with other less dangerous animals. A mammoth menagerie is a goal. By the way, this is unconventional game play.

So here are my big THREE top annoyances that take away from game enjoyment: 1. You cannot easily find all of your villagers, there is no option to highlight all of them to see where each is in order to find, watch over, or delegate. 2. So much relies on workstations, however, there is no option either to see where all your workstations are to find them easily to adjust or delete. This is majorly impactful, as if you just can't find a workstation you still have workers going there even if you don't want them too. 3. Camera controls are exceptionally frustrating and unintuitive. You can get stuck against landmasses, it will keep scrolling down from said landmass even while pressing W etc. If THESE were fixed, it could easily be one of my top 3 games of all time. HOWEVER, they are making ""cheese"" updates and not handling these --- problems which are making me lose interest. I love this, but it's really killing it for me. I don't want to spend half my time looking for where my people or workstations are, or getting my camera stuck all the time.

Its progression is streamlined enough that you know what you need to do to progress, but flexible enough that you can put off progressing for as long as you like, so the game doesn't feel rushed. Raiders become more and more challenging, especially if you haven't struck a balance in weapon and armor production/storage, which is a challenge in and of itself while trying to balance food production and resource gathering. It's easy to get ahead of yourself...adding just a few huts can throw off your town's equilibrium, so at some point animal husbandry becomes crucial to overcoming population growth spurts due to the inherent food/resources it provides. Finding a balance between the human and animal populations is yet another challenge, as domesticated animals eat some of the same foods as the humans.

The sound and graphics are superb, as is the music. The game feels polished in every way except lacking in main scenarios. But in a way, they take so damn long, especially at 1x speed, that it still makes the game a very long one to complete. The thematic challenges seem pretty cool too.

There are some very fun mecanics and ideas here and I recommend Dawn of Man if you are remotely interested in early human civilisations and want to have a good relaxing time between more hectic games.

There is so much detail and love put into this game, from the range in the skill-tree to the animation detail when constructing buildings. You can see exactly how every building gets made, with the required resources visible on the ground until needed in the process. The camera feature is also really cool, letting you watch people or animals as they go about their days.

The wildlife behave realistically, with predators occasionally attacking prey animals and either killing them or leaving them with battered health bars, thus making it easy for your people to take the animal down themselves or steal the rewards of the kill (if you're willing to risk retaliation). I was playing a community challenge recently where I messed up early game and desperately needed hide, saw a bear that decided to mess with a pack of wolves and got itself killed. The wolves weren't interested in eating and so left the bear free for scavenging. 

Lots of neat little tips and tricks to learn to get the best play, and the game itself isn't too demanding when it comes to my computer, despite its age. And when you're done with the many hours of content to play, you can go onto the community page and download new challenges put together by fellow fans.

Even changing to hardcore difficulty didn’t change that very much.

My only complaint would be with the AI, which seems terribly inconsistent. You directly give orders to your settlers in this game, you just suggest what you want them to do and they will action it based on priorities. On multiple occasions I would tell them to hunt a mammoth or another dangerous animal and the AI would then send out a large hunting party, yet halfway through the journey to the hunting ground 2-3 hunters would decide they were hungry and would turn back to the settlement. It would end with only one or two hunters reaching the animal and subsequently getting killed because they lacked the numbers they originally had.

Two things that I should have known from the beginning that would have saved me of some struggles:
* Build your settlement very compact as it will me way easier to deal with raids. 
* Always keep an eye on the ressource limits - the ""endless"" option is a bad choice in most cases as you will suffer spam of useless tasks that won't help you anything (setting the flour and bread limit to a reasonable amount changed a lot for my game). 

The management of tasks is quite tricky and there is a lot to be desired in that field. But overall this is a very good chill game. I don't see why so many seem to complain about the game not being complete and that there is more that needs to be added. For me it is was a perfectly sound experience throughout all the different ages. Sure, some more additions like fences or bigger community houses or temples would be a nice addition but already in its current state the game feels very complete and balanced to me.

You progress through creating pottery, making more and more intricate (and deadly) weapons and tools, learn how to farm and domesticate animals, etc. Eventually, you'll have a sizable Iron Age fortification on your hands—if you survive that long. It isn't really all that hard to survive, but the seasons go by quickly, so you could easily end up with people starving during the winter. Also, animal attacks are a constant danger, and later on other human tribes will attack you. Additionally, there are different scenarios (including one in which you play as a group of mammoths!) of varying difficulty.

The creators put a lot of effort into changing the type of fauna available in the game as time progresses. Mammoths and other late-stage mammals appear, while others go extinct. And you get to see first hand how easy it is to over hunt an area and be forced to journey farther and farther out to find game. Additionally, the atmosphere and music in the game is wonderful.

The game has been kept alive by players creating mods for it, and it's fairly easy to create one yourself. You can't do much but vary the landscape and what's available in the area, as well as how many people you start with, but it's fun to play with.",1700861268,1700861377,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

858810,73522547,76561198281163841,156,29,5944,0,835,1700662478,"Great game. Absolutely love the concept, graphics aren't bad and the gameplay is overall great. However I will go on to point out to the devs that a few things don't make sense. 

1. When I first started the game, I had like 36 settlers. Then 4 raiders came in and literally took out all but 3. After an hour of playing after that, the settlers workload was at 4000% and I couldn't get anything done. I couldn't get anymore settlers either because the homes were destroyed and I couldn't build anymore because the workload was too high. Find a way to prioritize tasks. The high priority button seems to not have any effect. 

2. When everything seems to be going great, get ready to fail. I hit about 81 settlers. Had great amounts of meat coming in and 3 other sources of food. Bread, Peas and Chickpeas. Yet about 15 minutes after I hit 81 Settlers, I started losing all my incoming food and they started dying of starvation. I now only have about 23 settlers and a huge encampment that I now have to go through and demolish most of so my settlers workload doesn't hit 4000% again. 

3. Not enough buildable area. I get that during the stone age they didn't have the ability to flatten land and had to work with what they had. But I doubt they only had enough land to build at most 10 huts and a few extra buildings. In all honesty, unless you build every single building right on top of the other, you have no buildable areas. You start out with a nice mostly flat space, but anything outside of that area is inconceivable. You either have to travel a great distance to basically build another settlement, or you have to try and figure out where you can place a building. I mean even on the slightest hill, I couldn't place a simple campfire or some farmland. Oh and if you try to farm, only do a 2x2 plot, unless you have 150 settlers. I started out doing 5x5 which is the max size and every time you need to plant or harvest those crops, it takes 25 settlers. Each settler can apparently only work one block of crops per year. 

4. The ages. OMG! Horrible delivery. What's the point of advancing into an age, when you don't get anything new in that age really. I advanced to the copper age. Guess what, I can mine copper ore, I can make coal to smelt the copper and I can smelt the copper. But, I have to advance to the Bronze Age to get a Tin Mine, Tin Smelter and then the thing to smelt Copper and Tin together to make Bronze. And Bronze is what you can make weapons with. Their is literally no point in advancing to the Copper Age. Oh wait, I forgot, you can get the donkey and a wheel in the Copper Age. 

5. Domesticating animals. Wow, useless feature and a complete failure. So the only animal you can apparently get in the wild and domesticate is the dog. I unlocked the, goat, sheep and cattle. Yet, I haven't been able to make one domesticated yet unless I bought it off the trader. Another broken feature in the game. And they die. Which is great for realism, but they can't breed, which makes no sense. So you're constantly having to trade away your supplies for more domesticated animals that within 3 years, will die, won't reproduce and will provide minimal food and supplies. It doesn't make sense for me to have 10 goats, that produce a total of 100 milk and cost me 360 trade value plus the food I have to feed them while they are alive. That 100 milk in one year won't equal up to the value of the resources I have to put into them. 

Those are my biggest points. Don't get me wrong I love the game and in the first night of having it I logged 14 hours on it. But, even though my overall opinion of the game is good, I still think this game has a long way to go in terms of balancing and true great playability. I'm playing it on normal. The next level is obviously hard and I can't imagine even attempting this level at it's current stage. There is no easy either. I'd say if you get this game for $15.00 or less, go for it, but anything more than that, don't waste your time right now. I paid $17.50 for it and I'm already regretting it.",1596127730,1699960331,True,0,0,0.490996211767196655,0,True,False,False

Am I glad I bought it? Yes. But I am glad I got it on sale for $12.00 because after 20 hours of playtime I don't know if I'll get much more out of it. A lot of this game seems ""luck"" based and you have little control other than where to place buildings and harvesting sites. I feel a lot of things need fixing/adjusting for me to put anymore time into it. 
I played through to the last stage of the game and honestly stopped because nothing I did prevented my people/animals from dying in the winter even though I had PLENTY of everything they were asking for, they refuse to use certain ""lower level"" items so they just sit in your storage and complain they don't have enough of something? Was constantly told I needed more cold weather clothes even though I had 110 long sleeve shirts and only 85 villagers?
I understand this is a fully ""developed"" and released game, but I feel there could be massive improvements.
AI is dumb AF. You are told through the tutorial to micromanage your people but not too much, and honestly I don't know how you can ""micromanage"" too much considering the lack of individual control you actually have. 
You constantly have to adjust the ""limits"" in the game. I even adjusted some to be 125%-150% of the population and still every single time I had someone new join the town I got flooded with ""You don't have enough x y z"".
There is a weird imbalance with things like ""leather"" and ""dry skins"" which both use the same material to make, but EVERYTHING YOU MAKE/BUILD use either one or the other, so you are ALWAYS short of one of them.... 
No matter how you dole out the levels of importance, you're constantly told how overworked your people are....but it never seems to matter? Your people have ""morale"" but it doesn't ever really seem to effect them except it says they do their tasks slower, but no matter how many totems/funerary/whatever i was told to do to make them happy they were just... always sad.
I had several people die from starvation even though I had an overabundance of food rotting away in my storage? And they were just...standing there. doing nothing...starving to death.
There are diseases in the game that you literally just wait for your person/animal to die because there are NO medical preparations. ever?
Hunting seems a little broken. As soon as you develop your town even the slightest all the animals seem to DISAPPEAR off your side of the map. Like... I they have to travel halfway across the map to find something to hunt. I wish there was an actual map overly screen so I could see where I've discovered. You can only explore via scrolling. 
You can also only tame ""baby"" animals, but these are the first ones your AI targets to hunt (With or without telling you). So I wish there was a way to have a yes or no hunt list? Like ""only attack adult animals"" or ""Do not attack donkeys"". You have to physically find, select, and click ""Tame"" on any animal you want to domesticate (except dogs, they just... appear out of thin air.)
Late game my animals were starving to death in the winter even though I had plenty of food stored and had them all set to High priority because no one ever actually put food into the barn reserves? and you cant demand anyone to work on a specific building (IE, select villager, select barn). 
So, i just got to watch a flood of ""Your sheep died of starvation"" messages because no one remembered to feed them in winter at a 78% workload and 300 straw in my reserve.
I wish there was a way to gain knowledge faster/more efficiently, especially later in the game where you require massive amounts for each tree talent...
I also dont understand why there are so many different crop options when everything is just compartmentalized as ""Fruits/veggies"" or Grains....
So even though you can't learn brewing til you can domesticate rye/barley, it just uses any grain because it all gets turned into a single slot in your inventory and they all share a harvest/planting season. 
You can't really spread out your development into multiple little towns because if anyone/thing attacks they all just... form around gates. There is a way to ""change"" where the gather point is but you can only change it like a step or two away from the gate, therefore making a completely useless option. (instead of in the center of the gate they can gather to the right or left of it instead!).
Fighting AI is also ridiculously dumb, they will attack everyone in the raid except the ONE SWORDSMAN that is lobbing of heads left and right.",1698632928,1698632928,False,38,2,0.735758662223815918,0,True,False,False

Very little games focus on the paleolithic to iron age eras, which is quite unfortunate. The building and gathering mechanics are a lot of fun. The combat/battle parts ar rather weak, and i found a lack of flexibility when organising the defence. It would be nice if I could manually select a rally point, rather than it being fixed to specific gates. An option to split the forces between multiple rally points would be nice too. Another small downside is the repetetivnes of the game.

It's true that it can get a little slow; however, once you figure out how to gain experience points faster and when to speed up the pace in the right moments, it does get faster. I enjoy the scenic graphics though they are not realistic. It's picturesque enough and the seasonal changes are pleasant. It has an oldie sim game feel similar to the park tycoon games  I played as a kid. If you're looking for a graphic heavy, fast paced and intense RPG game, then this game is not for you. The pace is intentional to mimic the pace of human civilization and I personally don't mind it. You can have as much or little control over the people. The game play as a whole is fairly simple. Also the tutorial is very helpful! It would be nice to have an update with more ways to gain experience points besides building materials. Developing music and art and eventually literature would be nice to include in a future update. The changes are quit gradual and you never feel rushed or interrupted to make important decisions or changes. Sometimes the AI can be a bit stupid; for example the dogs will continue to attack the same animal until they are killed themselves. Another annoyance is animals will just casually walk into your settlement. Other than that, I enjoy the general style of the game. The domestic animals are fun to adopt and grow. The traders are life savers! It would also be nice if the people's appearances differed as individuals especially the children. The names for the people are really interesting. I find that the more I play, the more I learn how to get better and more efficient at hunting, defense and food production.

I first played it years ago but found myself returning to it recently. It has that nice mix of management, survival and strategy. Like Banished, but with some combat. 

Starting with literal sticks and stones to progress through primitive ages is fun. I liked growing my little tribe into a picturesque and walled little river-valley village. 
It's kind of the game where you set your own goals a little. There's milestones to get, techtree to work through and temples to build. You can be kept pretty busy even after you've figured out your long-term food situation. 

The combat in the game once you reach iron age with its increasing raids starts to get a little repetetive and difficult, if you don't prepare properly. It's clunky, but it works. 
I can see the growing raids getting annoying for some, but I just accepted them as a fact of life true to reality. Why wouldn't jealous outsiders want to take over my sweet dank rivervalley.",1694549038,1694549038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nonetheless still a fun game to kill time and have fun building up a prehistoric settlement. Anyway, number 1. I do notice the devs have totally abandoned this game wich had so much more potential if updated. Such as a middle eastern or Asia maps and unique buildings. Number 2, I would love to see multiplayer like your friend is on the same map building his own town while you build yours and you can rather ally and trade with them or war with them that would be amazing. Lastly AI could use a bit of an update they are a bit retarded sometimes like when I have plenty of food and water and they still for some reason decide to starve themselves and blame me by reduction of morale, even though the workload is 43% witch is pretty nonexistent and should be no excuses for not being able to pause and take a quick lunch break.

You basically guide your little tribe through development and expansion.  The main threats are much the other games of this type, the weather, starvation and wild animals etc.  Though there are also human raiders.

The thing it gets right is the food production.  Unlike many other games like this, the system seems to work, most of the time.  You don't see weird population collapse for no reason, or your villagers just decide that they don't want to collect as much food today and actually choose to starve themselves to death instead of working for you.  Which might make you seriously doubt your management strategy.  

But they could go further with some automation. Things like ploughing, irrigation and  using animals and such which made a massive difference to mankind and so on are obviously missing. Then again, so is a game behind what is a nice front end design.

The way the technologies are developed and what they bring takes your from stone age to iron age is obviously underpopulated.

It has nice feel to it.  Not hard to the point of not being enjoyable, it is a pleasure to watch your village develop and it is relaxing to play, while always giving you things to do.  

There are no game breaking bugs and no discernible performance issues ( note - I do have very high Spec PC's).  But it runs really well at very high resolutions even with 8 x Anti aliasing override and 16x aniostropic forced on through the Nvidia control panel )  But it seems well made.

It has a very nice overall feel and a really well thought out UI.  In fact, one of the best UI systems I have seen in one of these games.  DO THE TUTORIAL - it is very short but the UI is just different enough that you will want to see it to use it as well as possible.   But it is really well done.

 I can already tell that it isn't going to be endless which is a shame.  But there are extra maps and so on to try.  The amount of content is a bit thin. When I first reviewed this game. To really rise above where it is now, it could be more open ended, without an end point. 

There has been some additional content since and it has made it well worth buying. Still, if I have one concern, it is that this journey is way too finite. Humanity existed how long? Yet here we are.",1558865754,1691856111,True,0,1,0.507638931274414063,0,True,False,False

I'm not giving a negative because the game is inherently bad, but it is just not good enough to recommend. I have 28h on clock here, so I really did give it a go, but 70% of that time was just running the game at x8 speed, waiting for things to complete and knowledge points to be earned, while doing other stuff off-screen, including once leaving the game on (very late stage) for about 3h unattended, while a Cairn construction was slowly taking place.


This game has potential, that's for sure, but here's a list of issues I found irritating:

1. A hunting-gathering tribe with no domestication tech starts as setteld. It makes little sense both historically and for gameplay mechanics. Hunters finally catch up to prey far away from settelment, go back because they're exhausted, while the animal lays there and rots, waiting for another person to get there and butcher it - and then for someone else to run for the meat and skin left behind.

2. Tempo. It just makes no sense. Seasons change fast, yet building and crafting takes their sweet time (to some extent understandable for manual labor), and what's worse, people are moving soooo slow (and that's when they're in good mood - low stats turn them into snails). Things need to happen to get knowledge points and advance, but each next era requires more points which do not come any faster - it feels uneven and quite streched in time. People consume food, but eat maybe once per season, once their hunger bar is low enough. It would make more sense if food and water were consumed out of stock at a certain rate based on population.

3. Movement paths. It seems to be no terrain modificator, people would go up and down a mountain in straight line rather than through a reasonable path (possibly shorter because it's flatter), or swim through a river rather than use the bridge right next to them. Small things, but next to the tempo issue (which can only be defended as an attempt to convey a realistic feel of manual work) it's infuriating.

4. Defense mechanisms. In pre-fortification game it makes no sense - sure, unarmed will take shelter, but the armed will not move against a pack of cave lions in the camp until someone gets bitten (and that's when the game does issue the attack warning, not when predators just happen to stroll by). With fortification it gets better, because defenders gather at defense structures.

5. Morale. It's stupidly easy for morale to get down, but untill beer is invented (late in the game), there is very limited option to restore morale. There are structures for that, but their cooldown time is long. Also, it's just weird that the only option to restore morale before beer is to, more or less, pray. At least the children should be able to restore morale by playing, what kind of child goes to a tomb for a morale boost? Bruce Wayne, maybe? Also, any kind of social life is missing. Middle of the winter and morale's on the ground? Throw a feast! Consume maybe 1/3rd of food supplies, get nothing done for two days - holidays are not a new invention. Working your ass off while having no real human connection is.

6. Rolling megaliths in late game. Very on point before we get carts and horse/cattle domestication, but if we're keeping the ability to put a monolitic structure late in game, we should be able to use horses to pull these things.

7. Domesticated animals on the loose. Then will wander off anywhere and someone will chase after a sheep to wool or goat to milk. If we can build a proper palisade, we should be able to build some fences.

8. Micromanagement, but not really. There is just so many things you can't do. Trying to get someone to slauther a pig asap? Good luck finding someone currently holding a knife, because they can't go switch a sickle for a knife at nearest warehouse. Want that guy with a sickle to go for the nearest grain plot? No can do, already assigned to some random person half a map away. Well, since walking takes so much time, maybe I could assign a work zone for stuctures? Or a reasonable perimeter for hunt? Nope, the hunting work zone will just tag a deer and never mind it got halfway through the map before the hunter got assigned.

9. AI decisions. Person is dehydrated and there's a well just in front of them? No, better walk to a river downhill. Person just finished cutting this part of field? Why send them to the nearest plot, when they can waste half of season walking to a field on opposite side of settelment. Attack alarm? That guy on hunt far away from settelment has to abandon task and start running home! Hunter just got that prey, but is mildly tired? Why bother to butcher it and take what you can carry, just leave it for the next person to find. An adult with a sickle assigned to carry straw while children could do it and more grain needs cutting.

10. Map size and view. It's too big for just one settlement, but you can't start new ones because people will run like crazy between them and accomplish nothing but low stats. It's also unpleasant to navigate, because you can't scroll far away to get a fuller view - you can only move low enough for every hill to obscure your view and then get a nauseating bump when going over it. Plus, of course, once you scroll to far and get lost, you have to wait for a focusable notification to get back - no ""back to settlement"" button.

Bonus: so many more structures/techs/features could be added! A ""longhouse"" or any other community center, providing prestige and morale (and possibly a place to organise a feast). Alehouse, once brewery is discovered. Watchtowers could be set to have a crew and raise a localized alert when enemy is spotted. Sacks, craftable for additional carry spots on wearers. Fine-tuned workload rules: areas, default assignements for housholds/individuals/defined groups as tech progresses (i.e. households by stables assigned primarly for animal care; adults with a weapon on hunting duty; kids get no-tool tasks before tool-carrying adults, etc.). Hunting traps, progressing with tech. A witch/shaman hut, with herbal resources and human operator, so we could attempt a treatment (as far as I experienced, now every infection seems to end in death). I truly believe that if the game gets more content, more things to do and look forward too, it would greatly increase the fun and re-playability.",1691273458,1691273458,False,15,0,0.677459359169006348,0,True,False,False

The task shouldn't be too hard, though it depends on the scenario and so on, but each era (from stone to iron age) will bring its own challenges. At first, the dangers comes mostly from wild game and the elements - as well as possibly mistakes made in regard to resources - but sooner or later, the danger will, as many post-apocalyptic games and what not reminds us - come on the form of other humans, which will require other measure than the aforemented dangers...

The game isn't hard to grasp, and will for long periods be fairly relaxing to play, even if you have to keep paying attention to certain details. Still, for the most part your villagers can be left to take care of themselves, but again, you have to pay attention, especially ehen the seasons change, because sometimes, the AI for the villagers is just plain lousy when it comes to prioritizing things, especially their own safety. I've lost count of the times when some villager wandered off to do a certain task far away from the village in the middle of something like a snowstorm, and even when they do try to make their way back, they won't be running back to the village, resulting in them slowly dying as they walk back (or to their task), wastefully... Really, the AI should've been better or had more options for tailoring the villager's behaviour. As it is, you're struck having to micro-manage a bit more than what should be truly necessary, IMO. However, this is the only flaw/downside of the that stuck in my memory as I played it... I suppose I can ses people finding the slowness of the game (speeding things up notwithstanding) a bit tedious, but you know... Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither did mankind make it from the stone age to the iron age in the blink of an eye (well, not by our way of measuring such things anyway)!

[b]#3.[/b] The camera is locked between a certain angle and you can't move it to your liking, so for instance, you can't play with a top-down view at all.
[b]#4.[/b] It's exceptionally difficult to see the resources between trees or your villagers or even animals. There's no way to make the trees 'fade away' from what I can see, so this is going to be a permanent irritation.
[b]#5.[/b] You can't group your villagers together, like into groups of hunters or groups of gatherers for instance, which makes sending out a hunting party an absolute pain in the sack because each time you have to find your villagers who have the correct hunting tools and then you have to send them all to a central point so that you can then 'mouse drag' to select them all for the hunt.

The tech system rewards the player for doing a variety of things, and doing them regularly - you get points from building structures, collecting resources, and hunting animals, which you can spend to level up through the tech tree.  What makes this work particularly well is that there are diminishing returns; you get a point for building your first hut, your fifth hut, your fifteenth hut, etc, meaning that you're incentivized to explore all the different things within the game, and cast a wide net, though if you want to grind, you can do that too.  

The combat system is also very nicely done, and the same mechanics apply whether you're fighting hostile wild animals or defending against raiders.  It is extremely satisfying to see your tribe take down its first Woolly Mammoth, and that satisfaction doesn't go away even in the late game when your forces, now armed with steel weapons and mail armor, climb their stone walls to defend against the similarly armed raiders who've come to despoil the settlement.  

One great thing about raids and raiders is that they add urgency to the game, and put pressure on you that you didn't have in games like banished: a raid in the spring during sowing or in the fall at harvest isn't just an annoyance, but an actual emergency that you need to deal with as quickly as possible, so that your people can get back to tending the fields, to ensure that you don't starve - or run out of fodder for your animals.  

One last thing that I would be remiss in not noting is the developer's focus on accuracy: it's very clear that they put a lot of research into the cultures and mechanics that they are modeling - the game simplifies a lot, but you still get the major highlights of a Northern European society's transition from the paleolithic to the iron age, beautifully rendered.  

Something that I wished worked better is outposts that would allow you to cache supplies for your people further out from your main settlement - but given the constraints of the game engine, I understand why trying that is basically doomed to failure.",1687723081,1687723081,True,11,1,0.653725087642669678,0,True,False,False

For pure realism, I'd have the people be nomadic until they get agriculture.  But, I know that would probably be substantively harder to code and make balanced and not overwhelmingly complicated to play.

Despite that, there is a definite pivot in what you do when you move into agriculture.  The early game is really about making sure you get enough successful hunts and have the right structures to make everything you need from that.  Once you start to grow grains, you need a LOT more wood to cook all that break, and the walls you'll make initially are wooden as well.  So, you'll rapidly find that you're denuding the areas around the settlement of trees for the most part (I left one wooded segment nearby cause I wanted easy ""stick"" collection -- I also left a few trees for tannin gathering).  But, this is how early villages worked too, so, its not unrealistic.  The Natufian peoples of the middle east who made that transition, and domesticated goats, caused the deforestation of many parts of the middle east, causing a food crisis in their own time as the trees were useful to them in ways they didn't know, for the agriculture too.  But, that crisis caused agriculture to spread into Europe, Africa, and South Asia as Natufians fled in every direction, taking their knowledge (and grains) with them.  This is why most of the world has domesticated grains that originated in the middle east (the far east is the main exception).",1686897897,1686897897,True,14,0,0.695550382137298584,0,True,False,False

Lovingly crafted by a small indy studio and sold at a relatively low price, it gives you a lot of content for your money and is well made. 

Dawn of Man emphasizes automation and slow and methodical gameplay for a relatively chill and relaxed experience. Everything seems to take a long time, even the bad things. If you’re running low on something, you’ll have plenty of time to take corrective action. Aside from the sudden raids on your colony, nothing really takes you by surprise. Instead of a day/night cycle, the game’s time span is measured in seasons and ages. Time is easily trackable and moves slowly. You can speed up the game to 8x, which will get you through the game quicker but sacrifices some immersion, which is fine by me. 

Building you colony and watching your people live their lives is rewarding and fun, and building your town is intuitive and doesn’t feel overwhelming. 

The look and sound of the game is good, especially for a small studio. 

For colony sim fans, getting this game on sale is a no brainer If you want something new and unique.

Highly recommended for people who want to challenge themselves during repetitive runs. 9/10, good job.

This game can be done in a single 8 hour sitting, or if you are like me, it could be a slow, well-thought out progress-oriented game-play that takes you 20-ish hours, taking your time to gather resources, have stockpiles, budget the technologies to unlock, never run out of food and always min-maxing your trade opportunities to acquire new technologies and weapons. Or you could get attacked by a pack of wolves/lions and have all the children killed while the adults are chopping the nearby forest for wood for the winter and construction projects, and while dealing with that, being unable to build fortifications/elevations and then get a significant portion of your population killed in the next few raider attacks.

I can see why some may think this game is boring.... you play it once and you are done - repetitive, i get it, fair point. But that can be said for basically any single-player game - i think the value is exactly in the repeatability here. Challenge yourself - can you build a civilisation that can stand the test of time without agriculture by only hunting/gathering? Or without any farm animals? Or how about never ringing the town bell? Or maybe no walls? how about no tools past the flint/bone tech - all of those are a repeatability challenge that you, as the player, can do, once you get to play the game for a bit. As i said, it is not for everybody, but is is definitely a game that i enjoy playing.

By this you just can't win this one without getting one headache after the other. So think about it if you want to torture yourself that way before you buy!

I played it with fun for about 3 days then I just gave up on it. If you could at least reduce your front with towers against enemies by some mountain in your back, but even that doesn't work. You end up repairing till you just say "" No thanks"", because you never got enough time to get all back up and running in time, then a winter comes, the buildings get damaged by the season and then enemies come each year to finish them up so that you can only build them up from scratch. And I did already build the smallest possible village to have less to protect.

I still don't want to give it a bad review although I just can't believe that the developers could not or didn't want to fix that!

While the game has some interesting concepts and mechanics, it falls short in a few areas. One major issue with the game is its lack of depth. Although the game boasts a variety of resources and technologies to research, the game play can quickly become repetitive and monotonous. Once you've established a successful settlement, there isn't much incentive to continue playing. Additionally, the game's graphics and visuals are fairly basic and don't do much to immerse the player in the prehistoric world. The sound effects and music are also lackluster, and can become annoying after a while. Another downside to the game is the AI of the villagers. They often behave erratically, and their actions can be unpredictable. This can lead to frustrating moments where you may need to micromanage the villagers to get them to do what you want. Dawn of Man has some interesting ideas and concepts, it falls short in execution. The lack of depth, basic graphics and visuals, and unpredictable AI make for a less than satisfying experience. While it may be worth checking out for fans of the genre, it may not be the best option for those looking for a more engaging and immersive city-building experience.",1680621384,1680621384,False,4,0,0.476943761110305786,0,True,False,False

Graphics are great, technology tree has all needed techs and thematic is pretty exciting.

Downsides - only 3 scenarios, and a lot of time is waiting for next settler to join your tribe while all tribe gets food to survive another winter. Scenarios have victory conditions, but maps look extremely similar. Animals on maps get generated twice a year very randomly. Also later some species of animals go extinct automatically.

Game is okayish to get for 10-12 Euros, I guess. Maybe one day I will beat second scenario... but for now first one was enough for me.

So I was initially quite interested when I saw this one. The game has many cool mechanics, and if you're familiar with Banished, you will grasp them quickly.

 DoM starts you're small group in the Palaeolithic period, where survival is the challenge. People are a resource that must be managed as they are born, age, and die. There is a realism here that is very enjoyable. Starvation, dehydration. exposure, and even animal attacks are a real threat. 

 As you progress the game by accumulation of knowledge that you choose by just doing things, you will eventually enter a new era. This opens up new crafts to build things like clothing, weapons, tools and structures. New techniques are learned like farming, animal domestication, and fortification. Each era expands the game, sometimes dramatically as seen in the Neolithic era.  

 A particular new mechanic in this game is workload stress. It seems to be a common issue with new players that might not understand it at first. I quite like this feature and managing it is rewarding and fun. Basically you can assign people work areas and tasks and they make it a priority which makes sense as the whole community is depending on them. You have to manage this so is doesn't effect people too negatively. They need time to eat, drink, worship and pray. You can end up with very exhausted and depressed citizens if you push them too hard for too long.  

 The game mechanics, transitioning time eras, and general atmosphere make for a very enjoyable colony builder that takes you from the Stone age all the way to the early Iron age. It runs pretty good on my old PC which I was concerned about, but no issues.  If early humans interest you and you like Banished, you'll just love this one. 9/10.

Another thing is the way the game is constructed and you can't make your tripe more that 250-270 people. The females don't reproduce enough, or the spring migration group of people are too small to make an effect on the population. I do understand the point of having this difficulty on late game, but its beginning to be really annoying, especially when you play on a specific save game for a tone of time and see almost no result at the end of the day.

That is saying a lot, after having spent hundreds of hours playing Banished, Anno 1800, Surviving Mars, The Wandering Village, Before We Leave, Outlanders, MicroTown, Endzone, Foundation, Nebuchadnezzar, Ostriv and Timberborn. Only Captain of Industry may be equally engaging.

If you have enjoyed any of these games, give Dawn of Man a try as well. You won't regret it.

Dawn of Man is best described as Banished 2, to be honest. A similar chill vibe and the same setting. Tasks are mostly automated, which I prefer. Your villagers will simply switch between tasks, whatever is on the to-do list. The worker AI is clever enough and the UI displays the current workload. Villagers die of old age but there is no death spiral, like in Banished. You progress by unlocking upgrades and new features, which you earn by reaching goals, like crafting 10 swords or building your first warehouse.

One thing that I love about Dawn of Man is the wildlife. You need to hunt animals for food and hides. But you can also tame them and put them to work. Sheep give wool for warm clothes. Donkeys carry your goods. And cows help you plow the land. The animations are so cute and the utility so useful.

Expect raiders to plunder your village and attack your people every other year. Violence in colony builders is usually a red flag for me. I want a chill experience. Luckily, Dawn of Man tuned the challenge perfectly. Once raiders are spotted on the horizon, press a button and your villagers will pick up their armor and weapons. Fights are easily won. Build walls to protect your essential buildings and erect watchtowers to give archers a superior vantage point.

I cannot wait to sink my teeth in the more challenging maps next. And I will also try the sandbox maps for a more casual playthrough or crazy creative builds.

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[list]
[*]The tech tree makes some sense
[*]It can be a nice challenge to deal with threats and attacks
[*]It's counter-intuitive, but the game encourages multiple settlements
[*]The variety of game modes and settlement locations provides a high replay value
[*]There's a reasonable number of Steam achievements
[/list]

[h1]CONS[/h1]
[list]
[*]The game is considered complete by the developer (nothing new since early 2021)
[*]Population management is akin to Banished, beware the death train
[*]In-game alerts pile up fast, and food spoilage is rampant when building to pop growth
[*]While the tech tree makes sense, there's not really a sense of discovery
[*]Would have liked to see some options around nomad-ism
[*]Would have liked to see a trading system between settlements (not just traders)

When I found out that Dawn of Man was on Steam this whole time, everything changed. With the inclusion of Steam Workshop support and MANY quality of life improvements, I can say that this is the Definitive Edition of the game. The menus, controls, graphics, and quality of the PC version FAR exceed the Xbox version. All the information you can possibly want is right at your fingertips. Selecting units and issuing commands has never been easier. The casual city builder features a light roster of buildings and items to craft, but every one of them must be chosen thoughtfully. Is it really time to go on the hunt? Or should you focus on chopping down trees or collecting rock and flint? The answers only come with a deep understanding of the game's mechanics. This is a casual experience that must be explored if you are a fan of the genre. Steam Workshop offers a good variety of fan made maps and other gameplay tweaks that really add life to the experience. That being said, this is a finished product. Do not expect any further content updates besides the occasional bug fix.
The AI can be questionable at times but don't let that stop you from working around it. Would recommend.

Not sure how much more i can get from this game, 
It feels a lot like a game of Cesar 3 except you never change maps or scenarios. you're forever stuck on the first map.

The goal never changes, so it becomes a bit like I am playing to survive so i can survive, why am i playing ? 

as resources around you start to deplete you are forced to expand, but expanding causes a forever unstable workload. the more people you have the higher the workload required to sustain those people. 

Eventually you run out of resources in your area and jobs take longer to do. 

There really is no end game. just acquire the same tools using different resources.  

Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the game, but i think i have nearly reached the end of what i can enjoy without any extra content to fill the end game. 

The enemies upgrade with you but still feel the same, they don't have a settlement so you cant go and attack them. i feel this would be a good end game.

I mean, I built stonehenge (or rather scheduled for the tribe to) - you would think that there would be like an announcement like what you would see in a Civilization game (short clip celebrating an accomplishment); instead I was scrolling across the screen and said, ""Oh look, they built it... but... it doesn't seem to affect anyone much.

1. Assigning villager to focus on hunting specific animal and make a hunting hut so villager can go far from village and survive by this hunting hut (might as well as other things like chopping wood, stone, gatherer, etc).
2. Assigning villager to bring the supplies on specific storage hut (i believe this will help player to split village to other area).
3. Make some general menu/windows to manage garrisoning villager or split villager to other village (RTS game doesn't have this which it should help to split the village in this game which have very vast map).

After all, thanks for making this game.

Going into Dawn of Man I really enjoyed it and immediately sought to get the challenging achievements such as getting 100 settlers in the Stone Age or 900 prestige before you start working on metals etc. 

The game play at the beginning of these achievements is great but later on towards the end goal they really showcased some poor mechanics. For example, to get 900 prestige you need a ton of buildings and at some point buildings stop giving you prestige so you need to focus more now on getting new settlers, great fine. But then you realize that for whatever got forsaken reason there is a soft cap to gaining settlers, meaning after a certain number of settlers you no longer receive migrants and have to rely on birth rates but those are also janky and soft capped so the more settlers means the less births happening (Having plenty of extra resources only helps at the beginning). 

So to gain 900 prestige you would have to sit there watching your settlement do the same cycle for weeks on end just to see the population rise by 10. Granted these gripes are for the challenging achievements which are supposed to be challenging and these gripes would really only affect long-time settlements, but they're still worth mentioning as the whole soft-cap idea makes little sense when you also include achievements meant to break through the soft-cap. Also as others have mentioned people simply don't do jobs sometimes, which makes you really have to force them to do specific things, and the map is cool, but once you build your settlement it feels like there's no reason to explore or visit other areas just prioritize your own little spot. Even if you have low resources going further is counter-productive because it feels like you're spending more resources than you're gaining.

TDLR; Great game for a nice relaxing settlement manager, but if you plan to get achievements or build long-time settlements be ready for some silly mechanics",1673303778,1673304048,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The scenario progression is relatively uninspired, and the given maps have little buildable area. For a map so large, it would have made sense to have a settlement system in place where each camp could manage on its own and trade. Instead, we are given a ""one-village"" system which means that the workload quickly grows over its maximum, and villagers must go further and further away for minerals, megalith materials, and hunting. This would be fine if there were support for a nomadic style of play. 

The raid system is random with no basis in reality. If you follow a raider after they escape, they disappear into nothingness. Having raider villages in-game would have added to the immersion. A missed opportunity

Lastly, I understand these are pre- Iron age people, but this, unfortunately, ignores all of the beautiful things pre- Iron age people accomplished. The height of engineering is a Cairn?! Ok.

Playing this game while listening to Paleoshaman music (search it on youtube, it fits the game really well) is a trance like experience which made me lose track of time.

Nevertheless, when assigning tasks villagers do not now how to prioritize, for example a low morale villager who is starving would prefer to go to a spiritual site and raise their morale rather than eat, come on! The same applies when thirsty or tired. Even after trying to force the villager to do the common sense action they don’t. I read on a steam post (https://steamcommunity.com/app/858810/discussions/0/3113647550043480990/) from 24 February 2021 that the developers are ready to move on, that sounds great for the company. However, there’s still a few more tweaks the game NEEDS before completely moving on to another project. Most of my complaints have to do with villager tasks prioritization and common sense survival decision making. Why would a villager collect sticks, logs, or repair a structure when the village is low on food. The village has sufficient grain to create flour, and bake bread so why would the AI not prioritize food making?! Not to mentioned all of this is happening while harvesting, the mortar, and the hearth are set as a priority. Anyway, I don’t want to make this post too long. All I’m asking from the developers is to at least create/design a button/option for players to give a command to all villagers and prioritize food making/creating/eating etc. above all other tasks. Something with the same function as the raider(s) alert button but for food. If I was in charge for one day that’s what I would give the players.

Without my constant prompting, the tribe wandered about waiting for instruction. Animals roamed at will through our camp. Fish splashed about in the nearby lake. But my people wandered around without direction, without the sense to help themselves not to starve. So through the winter we struggled. A few died. But we survived. I would like to say it was my bold leadership that got us through the struggle. More likely it was luck. I had managed to motivate my people to collect just enough food to survive the winter. 

Now we must build up for the next winter. We are out of wood. We are out of flint. Our huts need repair. Our fires are down to a few dimming coals. So again I must lead them by the hand into the forests to hunt. I must tell them to go pick up the sticks and gather the flint so we can replenish our spears. I must tell them to go fish so we can gain our strength before going after the bigger game. 

See, in this management game, your tribe has only one brain: yours. You can make work areas and assign people to them. Then they will go and do the work that needs doing. You can use your primal vision to scan the surrounding area to find these vital resource zones. It will have to be you. Your tribe has no brain of their own. They would starve camped out beside water full of fish if you don't tell them to go fish. 

I suppose a lot of management games suffer from the same sort of defect, the need for constant micromanagement. A few will allow you to set aside areas that the computer will manage for you. Most require you to get out there in the forest and show them where to hunt. This is one of those games that requires your constant managing.

The setup, a tribe in the early dawn of mankind, is unique. Once you get a feel for the endless managing screens, the UI is better than most other management games. Once you get knowledge points from doing various tasks, the research tree has a lot of options. It will take you many winters of near starvation to get to the point where you can farm the land. But you can get there. It may get a bit tedious though.



conclusion

unique setting makes up for the usual management game flaw: idiot followers. For fans of these type of games (and I am a fan), the unique setting will make the effort worthwhile. For those who don't have the patience for managing their check book, you won't want the burden of managing a bunch of mindless hominids.",1672073421,1672073803,True,5,3,0.563080251216888428,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Detailed and you need to be on the ball to make your tribe thrive.

- Lot's of realistic factors which affect your people.
- Lovely graphics.
- Hours of mindless fun.

My cons; 
- Raiders are awful and they don't get spicy they just turn up from a random direction, kill people and leave. Feels really basic.
- Once you reach a certain point there is literally no further progression, please add more ages and technologies you can research.
- Characters can take forever before they execute a task and will end up complaining for a while before they actually feed themselves etc.
- The last update was almost 2 years ago. GIVE US MORE CONTENTTTTT.

I have never seen one with such a bad job prioritising system as Dawn of Man. I cant figure out how the game handles the priorities at all, so i just assume it is a linear list - job # 50 will be 50 until the previous job has been completed. Then it will be #49, then #48.
Your workload is tracked in the form of a %, and if it goes above 200% then your workers start to -not do anything-. If it goes above 400% then you are in the death spiral.

In short: if you have too many jobs, people stop doing jobs. The more work you give them, the less work they do. Once you have a village of 50 workers, you only have -maybe- 8 jobs in progress at a time. The rest of the jobs sit on the list, increasing your total workload.. which the game tracks; penalises you for; and helpfully reminds you that your ""Workload is too high"" every half a minute.

I have had to restart too many times as my people were cutting down trees or building a building, rather than fetching food. They are all the time starving or dying of thirst whilst happily cutting down trees. Such a dumb design choice.

It's fun kinda like banished with a lame bandit addon, the bandit attacks can be summed up to small attacks. Bandits can easily reach and destroy your towers even over a wall. it makes building towers almost pointless, worst part? they cost valuable resources that can only be grown or gathered slowly,( hoping a workshop addon comes a long and removes the straw as a requirement)
The terrible tower system is the only reason this game is getting a thumbs down, no way a bow made outta prey leather and a stick is going to topple a fricking tower made outta logs at 30+ feet. Maybe kill my archers, worst case maybe break a few ropes holding the logs, but 10 bandits armed with prehistoric weapons aren't going to destroy a line of 10+ towers(out of 10 i had 2 left, only 10 attackers, all with the basic bow and some bone spears) I also had 40+ defenders. 

I am gonna thumb down this game, until this is fixed, reduce their damage to the towers, give them fire archers... the idea of some weak ass bows toppling my towers ruined the gameplay for me. what's funny is I left the game running all night. I woke up with many resources and a few holes in my walls. maxed pop, full happiness plenty of food.

After you reach a certain point in the game, you sort of hit a dead end.  I've thought about this concept in the past and how cool it would be to have a game that started wildly primitive and develop a small society into what's essentially the iron age.  Obviously strategy games do this kind of thing with simple model changes, but this is more of a city builder or simulation rather than strategy and the gameplay does change as the settlement progresses technologically.

I think it's executed well if you keep thinking of it as a purely a settlement simulation, but there are a few downsides.  I think they've made a sold game, but it falls short in a few areas:
- The AI isn't perfect.  I wouldn't even call it great, but it's okay.  They have improved it.  It was terrible.  Pathing, prioritizing, etc. isn't great.
- The maps seem like they're vast, but in practice they are very small.  Even just a few minutes into your first game you realize that you're little settlement is very static and the people have a very short range to hunt and travel.  The AI doesn't reliably carry food or water with them, so their range is very short.  They'll starve to death if they walk past their front yard.  The ridiculous amount of hills forces you to build in small areas.  The maps suck.
- The only mechanic that has any moderate level of difficulty is raiding parties.  Mystery enemies from somewhere out of the map show up in increasingly larger and well-equipped raiding parties.  The AI is very poor and they come from the same 1 or 2 directions each time (they do this because terrain funnels them).  It's annoying and cheap.  Improved AI instead of masses of people would be more fun.  The raids are predictable and not a fun or creative way to add difficulty.

One thing would have made this game truly outstanding instead of just decent:  Multiple settlements on the same map.  If other settlements existed on the same map.  You'd have a great level of complexity to manage those relationships to your advantage.  Your settlement would have to explore to meet them, learn their language and culture (some are more hostile), trade with them, fight them, etc.  It would have made it into an outstanding game.  Different settlements could have had much closer access to or even ownership claim of different resources.  It's such an obvious mechanic to add, but they got lazy and just added raids with a wave of AI enemies and launched the game.  Admittedly it's another step of complexity, but multiplayer games would be possible... Not just PVP either.  It would be possible for 2 or more players to collaborate on the same map and support each other.  If one got hit by disease, AI raid, crop failure, etc. the other player could trade them food, give them shelter, population/manpower, help defend them, etc.  It would be great fun.  One player could focus on something like mining and manufacturing because of access to mountains while a friend provided food because of close access to farm land.  Co-op could have been great.

The base mechanics are there, and the game works, but there's a massive opportunity missed with this game.  It's still good, but the potential was incredible.  They got about 70-80% of the way to making a masterpiece.  Madruga Works did a good job.  Hopefully their next game will be amazing.",1609633249,1669157174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Good resource management game.
Does a good job of telling the story of man organically through gameplay (i.e. start by gathering, every hunt is important, then transition bit by bit towards an agricultural society not because the game forces you to but because it's the only way to sustain the large populations you're aiming for.
Impressively intelligent villagers: no pops starving next to a full granary here; people eat when they're hungry, put on woolens when they're cold and prioritise tasks intelligently.
I really like cavemen, Primal is my favourite Far Cry.
I love the way capturing wild animals for domestication looks like the villagers are politely debating the benefits of an agrarian symbiotic relationship with them.

Tastes may vary:
It's slow paced but then it's a game about the 12000-year evolution of primeval society, what were you expecting?
The villagers are so smart and the economics so micro-light that sometimes I wonder if they even need me.

Cons:
The UI is a bit rubbish, especially around animal domestication.

Since returning i have noticed that there has not been any updates from the developers.  Are we forgotten about? its great game overall , starting a development, hunting zones, foraging zones etc, its all standard stuff.  what i have come to realise though is that sometimes there can be a lack of animals to hunt.  i set up hunting zones and there was plenty of food etc, ( this has happened on several occasions)  then all of a sudden it says low on food, so i checked hunting zones etc so see if there was any animals to hunt, there wasn't so went on to lay down more hunting zones, only to realise after scanning over a map as to where would be a good place to hunt that there was no animals, as far as the eye could see there was 2 boars ( 1 which escaped lol) and some kind of bird flying around lol.  then people startedto die of starvation, and for some reason there was quite a long space without a trader so couldnt even buy anything to get through it. so that was the end of that . lol . not much you can do with a map where there are more people then animals to eat. 

anyway for anyone wondering, this is a slow burn game, don't expect to have a massive village etc within half a hour with all sorts going on. also making the list of jobs to do to long will upset your people and they will literally walk around with red sad faces above their heads and a message in the corner saying work load to high... why cant it be a list of jobs to do instead of workload to high message which infers that all jobs are trying to be done at the exact same time. lol.  

anyway if i am missing anything please feel free to let me know how to get around any of these issues as i am not slating the game as i like games like this.

so that's my thoughts for now anyway.  
would be nice with some more updates and progression with the game from developers which i doubt will happen because as far as i am aware the devs are now finished with this game even though it does feel like it is a unfinished product because there are many things which feel as though they haven't been developments and expanded on as much as they could have been which is the issues i have had with this game. its a good game but didn't do my full research on it  before purchase and thought it maybe still under the wing of the devs who will do some more work. didn't realise they had finished made their money and already moved on. so unless they come back to it i am not sure i will either. unfortunately.",1660476378,1669050025,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's entertaining, fun and for the most part well made. It does tend to take some time, there's plenty to do, it's very micro heavy, especially in later game stages and there's a wide variety of tasks to assign and observe. I quite enjoy it despite it's flaws, so overall, I'd recommend it if you are into the genre.

 It's main detractor, for me, is that they never really finished polishing and optimizing the AI, interface and other small little things that could really have been used to make player life enjoyable.

For instance, the npc thought process is as dumb as a brick. You tell them to hunt something a good distance away, it'll often send settlers that are tired, hungry, thirsty and occassionally low on morale. There's no AI thought process that tell it... oh hell, maybe we should have a send off perty before the big hunt. And there's no way for the player to tell the npc to eat and drink right before the hunt, least of all as a group. It makes long distance hunting a logistical pain in the ass that could make one wanna slap a computer screen, with a forehead. 

There's also no way to really make satellite settlements for the same reason. Remember how children of the nile citizens would go to the OTHER side of the map for services they could receive in the local area if only they waited for a bit or were somehow tethered to that local area? Well Dawn of man takes it a step futher. The npcs will do exactly this but EVEN if these goods and services are ready and available right next to them.
 It's like they found a kill switch the HIV researchers have been racking their brains for decades, trying to find.

 I still enjoy the game despite the flaws and what they tried to do with the game was nice. It feels more like one of those experimental games to see what the devs could do with it rather than a final end product, if that makes sense. So I would recommend it with caution. and forget about the refund window, 2 hours really isn't enough to really explore this game in a meaningful way.",1668848302,1668848491,True,0,1,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

-I had hopes that this game will improve and will have enough content to keep me playing.
-Waited some updates and wanted to try the game again there was somethings added since release i discovered them. Then i realized devs left the game no updates for over year i have no idea why.
-This game did have potential if game did updated with content.

*Fun gameplay.
*Bad progression system. ( 10 fish achieved you gain knowladge to learn bow now like cmon)
*No new maps. (One map with different start locations only.)
*No look overhaul. (some textures are cool some of em just out of paint)
*No bug fixes. (lof of em.)
*Couple small additions will add couple of hours of gameplay depth but no replayability.
*Progress was slow now there is no support from devs anymore.

Hopefully they return to adjust the game and hopefully they are not making another game, when they did not fully finished this game.

The atmosphere is great, the music is pretty good and the theme overall works really well, but there are a lot of problems...
The game starts out with a lot of things to do but with a bit of effort you manage to grow your settlement and progress through the ages. Getting more advanced tools is very satisfying, particularly when you get to copper and start mining. Unlike in Planetbase (PB), mines produce limited ressources. This will pose a problem later on in the playthrough. 
The raider situation is alright, a bit of a challenge that isn't as easily managed as the intruders in PB but it's a fine feature.

Overall the game is incredibly entertaining at the beginning and I would say up to a population of 80-100. At that point you will want to start expanding significantly and here come the issues.

Firstly, the ressources to make structures (notably stone) are incredibly sparse and you end up having to go very far to gather them. Which leads to issue with the villagers' AI. And you better pray if you somehow set out to do something during Spring or Fall. If you start something important (like expanding your base) during these seasons your villagers will completely forget to tend to the crops which will lead to starvation of people as well as livestock. And this is the first issue you encounter when growing your settlement.

As of my last save in Ancient Warriors, I have about 300 population with as much livestock and I just stopped playing because i'm too annoyed by the games mechanics.
In PB, I was able to colonise the entire playable area reaching 1000 population, which I did because it was easy and FAST.
Here, growing your population takes forever and because, unlike PB, ennemies can spawn anywhere, you can't grow your colony at any significant speed. In PB you just had to not place spaceports in your new area and you'd be fine. Here you have to start by building a wall but raiders will attack the walls even if the gates are open, rendering your progress meaningless. On top of that, because of the scale of my base, I tend to lose 30-50 people if I have the raiders spawn on the new side of my base, as my villagers won't work there and have to run across to get to the defenses.
Anyway at that point the game is mostly waiting behind your screen for either raiders to spawn to put up the alarm or waiting for the population to grow without doing anything. I had plans to colonize all the rivers but the time it would take just makes me not want to bother.

I realize now that even if I do want to recommend the game, I'm incredibly sad seeing what the game could have been with more development. I'm quite frustrated. The game seems unfinished. Aside from the bugs that many others have complained about, I seriously thought this game would receive a lot more features, like maybe new epochs being explored beyond the steel age. The tech tree feels lackluster. 

To summarize my thoughts, this game is overall an improvement from Planetbase, but it's really not enough. Many systems are still broken (AI notably) and the game is lacking in content overall.

If you enjoy this type of games, go for it but be prepared to be frustrated more than content at the end of your playthrough.

For the money you spend this is a great game to buy. It's a really cool concept surviving in dawn of civilization. The game gathering and base maintenance feels easy and natural, and really really easy to get into. Graphics are really good. It's a lot of fun to progress through different ages and build up your base accordingly. 

The game features 3 different modes and multiple maps (ancient warriors will give you a run for your money, it's hard, challenge for experienced players ) The game has fun set of challenges, which i hope to see more of. Most importantly the game has community created scenarios, which are a lot of fun, and it's free! (no dlc bs)

Developers adding more content via updates all the time, which will make this game better. I have seen the huge improvement in amount of bugs fixed and AI, as well as, a lot of new technologies added. I believe this game will be amazing once it's fully polished. That being said you will see villagers doing something silly like gathering at the opposite gate during an attack. 

P.S. if you want to 100% this game in achievements, it's easy but boring. Paleolithic Overpopulation and Stone Prestige are very grindy achievements where you go to speed x8 and wait. My advice is to set your base get a case of beer or whatever relaxes you, put on your favorite show and let the game run for a few hours.",1582699276,1665253832,True,1,0,0.501108646392822266,0,True,False,False

The reason I say that is because early on you start with no upgrades and have to slowly progress through each era unlocking upgrades that are meaningful to the game. Bone tools, bow & arrows, fortifications, farms, dogs, animal domestication, etc. Fortifications are a major part of the game as you get raided fairly often so you have to be constantly building everything up and it takes quite a bit of time and effort to wall and reinforce everything.

Once you make it to the copper age you'll find all the tools and weapons you can craft have the same exact stats as the stuff made out of bone. It's not even worth your time crafting them. All the big game goes extinct so you have to turn to farming and having animal farms. Once you have a massive horde of goats and a dozen or so fields of wheat... the game is pretty much over. I had 200 pop and set my goats to 75% of my pop and it was basically infinite food.

The bronze age is largely redundant as well because you almost immediately jump into the iron age which has superior weapons. There's almost nothing you unlock in the copper and bronze age that is meaningful to the game at all other than ploughs and upgraded houses.

The iron age is basically the same, but for w/e reason you also have steel weapons which make the iron weapons redundant.  Imho its like the developers ran out of ideas from the copper age and beyond. Some of the buildings reuse the same exact models as well. Each time you jump an era the raids get stronger and stronger so you have to be prepared.

Both games are what I would consider ""challenging casual"".  There are challenges to overcome, but once you get the hang of them, the games are great for the casual player, who doesn't want to be severely punished for making mistakes.  Most mistakes are recoverable, and learning experiences.

I don't think I've run into any bugs in EITHER game, which shows they were very careful about making sure the products they released were *ready* for release.

I originally picked up Dawn of Man, and after getting something like 300 hours in, tried out Planetbase.  I'm thoroughly enjoying Planetbase as well.

Gameplay on both games is simple, and pretty easy to learn.

2020 Review
Game was great at first. Played like 12 straight hours. Once you hit the Bronze Age, your peasants eat a retard pill and refuse to do anything meaningful to make your settlement survive. They stopped harvesting crops and making tools. I had 0 other tasks assigned, and it said most of my peasants were not being used. Instead of harvesting the things to make the animals have food, they stood there while the city collapsed around them. For such a small little bug, it made me rage so hard I uninstalled the game. At least I received a day of entertainment. Maybe I will check it out again in a year or two.",1596262277,1661969181,True,0,0,0.372461110353469849,0,True,False,False

If I can build stone walls, why not stone towers? Towards the end of the game; traders become redundant; the trading is not fair since they no longer have any resources that you need or want. I suggest including rare resources such as gold or silver that could be traded for goods or vice versa. Gold and silver could also boost the prestige of a colony or chief. the forest regenerates itself fairly quickly but not oak or pine trees; which is OK since it teaches us forest management; a very interesting aspect of the game.

While not impossible to finish, games like Frostpunk are lightyears easier to complete.

These are the most annoying issues I've found:

1) Once you go over a certain Era, you seem to not receive some notifications at all.
Your cavemen die, and you don't know why or how, but the Era before, the game could easily detect when a cavemen died of old age, which is most probably the main cause of the unreported death.

2) Most notifications, on the other hand, are quite annoying, it seems like the developers are some kind of anxious bastards, so whenever something is amiss, like for example straw or food in general, you get bombarded by notifications every 2 minutes.
I read they were even worse before, but who would think of being so annoying to a player? Is it some sort of punishment for playin' the game?

3) The raiders attacks: I created an anti-raider structure, basically, but the cavemen managed to be killed regardless, because they will not attack hand-to-hand unless the raiders rush inside the settlement.
They will prefer watching their watchtower getting destroyed rather than rush as 20 those patethic 6 raiders deciding to attack a full armed settlement in such a small number.

Unfortunately, it seems the game won't receive any more patches, which is a shame, because the idea is good, and more adds-on would have healed this half-mess a lot.

Other than that, I will put the thumb up, because despite its flaws, it is entertaining.

More info if you're interested, based on my experience:

At the beginning, the secret is to do one thing at a time, build up vital structures, hunt often, and then, once the village gets more populated (let's say, 25-30 cavemen), you can go hunting 24/7.
Keep the workload between 50% and 100%, it's really easy to get around 150% at the beginning, we don't want that.

Press 8 on your keyboard to find out which actions you need to perform, in order to earn technology points and unlock more structures or weapons/tools.
Technology points can be a pain in the neck, and sometimes it will take a while to earn them.

There is no particular order to start, but I would recommend quickly getting the first power up for dogs, because sooner or later you might be attacked by feral animals, such as Hyenas, Wolves or Cave Lions.
The dogs will defend you. They might die for you, but well, it's part of their job. They will re-spawn in time as puppies.
Your cavemen's lives are super precious, so you must prevent them from dying.

Once you have dogs domestication as power up and some better tools, you can go hunting mammoths and make sure the dog will tank the hits. Hunting mammoths is worth it, and actually you can hunt solitary mammoths early in the game, bring around 4 cavemen though.

Don't allow your cavemen going too far away from the village, or they might take forever to come back, which means they might get tired, thirsty, hungry and such during the way.

Little trick: double-click herds of animals if you want to try to hunt them all at once.

Keep some weapons (not all of them) and clothes in continuous production in your production building, and build a second production building just to be sure, because you might get even 4 people joining your village at once. The faster they get their tools, the better.

Keep an eye on your ""Welfare"" percentage, the higher it remains, the better. 
Prestige will go up REAL slow, so no need to rush it.

Build transports as soon as possible, because your cavemen will get low morale when carrying heavy materials such as boulders or logs.

Build totem or skull poles as soon as possible, so your cavemen can regain lost morale, but please also note, that your skull-poles have some kind of cooldown, so once used once, cavemen won't go near it immediately.

This should be enough for starters. :)

The real problem with this game, is that it throws everything at your face during the Neolithic Era, between fucking Raiders coming outta nowhere and farming fields, taking initially forever to become effective.
During Neolithic Era, you basically have around 40 people, and just hunting is not enough, you need farm camps and animals domestication.

I would recommend hunting a lot and get around 100 meat, then some fish and fruit, then getting 22 knowledge points before jumping to the Neolithic Era, and then quickly upgrade and spend the remaining ones to build fortifications/watch towers, because from that Era onward, those damned raiders will pay you visits and they can kill your cavemen quite easily.
Once you're able to start cultivating, everything will get easier. Study the plants and what they do/when they get planted, and you should be fine, although the game hasn't been particularly well developed, so unexpected shit  may happen.",1629041469,1661482366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Played through a few times now.   It's a good game.  Worth the money.  

Grindy?  Yep, but not horrible.  And you can change it pretty easily if it's not your thing.  You can change the whole game if you know what you're doing.  There are guides here on Steam that tell you how.  

There are also mods that do it for you.  Flatlands is a good one.  

In my previous review, my one complaint was the lack of variation in the maps.  

Turns out, there is a way to create your own maps with vastly different terrains, so it's all good now.    

It would be nice if we could edit the main game, so we could get our obligatory Star Wars and LOTR versions, but  life is rarely perfect.  

The genius part of this game is the work area.   Place a circle down for cutting trees and villagers will begin cutting trees in that area.  If someone (gasp) dies, someone will replace them.   There's plenty to tweak, but it never feels like you're micromanaging.  You can set almost everything to produce to a certain level, so you don't get a surprise that you've run out of swords or something.  You can go get a drink and come back.  

I don't know how to write this without it sounding boring, but  work management is the center of this game.   No worries.  It's clever and requires some strategy.   It's delicate.  You can't just throw your shoulder into it and push on.  It's a balancing act.  I've had games where it went smooth all the way through.  I've also had games where my villagers all died.  

When it clicks, it's great fun.  Hell, it's even fun when it doesn't.  

It really doesn't bother me that the devs left the game.  This has been one of the most flawless, polished games I've played in years.   200 hrs, and I haven't had one crash, one bug, one hiccup.  Loading times are fast.  Not a lot of hoops to jump through on the way in or out.    

To me, this is how games were 10-15 years ago before the early-access craze started.   You bought a game and it was a complete, quality game out of the box.",1606320056,1661406540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By the end of your first scenario you’ll get a firm system in your head, which for example will stick the progression of metals exploration and tin+copper=bronze formula for the rest of your life.

Lots of menus. And those menus are bound to F1..F8 and 5..8 keys, easy accessible and highly useful. There are also several compact stats screens which you can stick to the main screen for a great convenience of yours. And you can speed up the pace with 1..4 keys, up to 8x speed, which is so handy, satisfying and time-saving.

Addictive. Almost like Civ, there’s always one small thing more to do in your settlement, one more virtual year, which you surely have some plans on.

Graphics is sweet. It’s not hardware-demanding and it does render pleasant scenes of nature. Accurate building stages and animations of activities.

Learning curve is perfect and the difficulty of the game is very adjustable: you just start with the ‘Continental Dawn’ scenario by default, and even then you can select Hardcore option (single save slot; more frequent Raider attacks, etc); and after that you can start ‘less accessible’ scenarios or try Challenges (there’re certain specific goals you need to meet in every one). No real grinding even for achievements, all processes are highly automatable, no need for micro-management (may not be true for harsh environments, I haven’t tried that, but you choose it advisedly anyway; it’s true for the basic ‘Continental Dawn’ scenario though).

Background music is nice, kind of relaxing, quite memorable tunes with some antique instruments by the look of it.

A little downside: AI is not excellent. Path finding is sometimes troublesome (particularly with building walls of fortifications in some peculiar manner of yours). Raiders spawn from a side of one of your gates, no real threat in gaps. Though, in the late stage of my CD scenario playthrough they started to run from the mountains, where I had only bare walls, they broke through them and poured into my camp, so next I fortified those points, and they continued to attack exactly from those sides, eliminating any challenge.

Two major gripes that prompted me to write this review so far:
1) Camera movement is terrible. If you get motion sickness from games, you will definitely get it bad here. I only have this problem with FPS games but this is the first time an RTS made me nauseous.
2) You can micromanage things but you can micromanage inventory of a unit. If the unit has a wooden spear, it's almost luck of the draw if he picks up the upgraded bone spear.

I've been watching videos for days. Now playing it myself i ReAlLy love it. I recommend this game if: You played Banished, into city builders. For now if i MUST rate this game is a 7.5/10. I still hope this game will have a function that let you control a AI like Dungeon Keeper. Havent seen that function in games for years. Correct me if im wrong. 

Things i like: Weather effects, Gentle paced, Skill tree, Fast Seasons

Graphics: 9
Entertainment: 8 (10 with dungeon keeper function(a 15 if im able to slap my slaves)) :)

At the beginning it really sucked me in, after all, there is that ""magic"" of management and building simulators in which you want to see your town grow and put down every building you there is. It really did that for me, but nothing else. 

Once you've placed everything, laid out a decent city of about 100 citizens and unlocked steel, there's nothing else to do. I miss even the simple thing of having the raiders, the ones that attack you, living around, nearby your settlement, which then would give far more options in terms of gameplay, like raiding them, stealing their village resources, kicking them out of their home, etc.

So, from my point of view and experience, this games needs far more content which aims towards improving gameplay because, as it is, it only offers one pleasant first playthrough and, after that, everything is the same over and over, maybe you can up the difficulty a notch, but you won't be offered anything more other than some extra challenge.

With that said, I'm sorry but I'll be giving a thumbs down, not because it is a bad game, but because as it is right now, it lacks content and deepness in its gameplay. Buy it if you want to experience it, you'll have fun for sure discovering all it has to offer at the moment, but, after that first discovery, don't expect much more unless you felt in love with it in a hardcore way.",1551895604,1659876385,False,2,2,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

Dawn of Man cannot be described by a single genre. It's more like a mix of city building, civilization development and slight bits of strategy. 
The game takes place in a heavily underrepresented era, ranging from the paleolithic to the iron age. In the early stages you'll focus solely on surviving and gathering for the winter, being able to develop only with the small excess left from what your people produce. As you progress through time, you will acquire knowledge points, which you can research several technologies with. These techs give you access to more advanced tools, buildings etc., letting you gradually get more resources to build with. Once you progress from the ooga booga stage, your settlement starts to blossom; advanced housing, shifting to farming instead of gathering, domesticated animals and so on. Overtime, you'll meet other tribes aswell, some friendly and willing to trade, some not so much. In the later stages producing metal tools and weapons will be an option, thus making trading and fighting against the enemies easier than before.

Pros: 
-Graphics
-Unique style
-Nice technology tree
-Huge maps
-UI

Cons:
-Slightly repetitive
-Enemies a bit underwhelming
-Limited interactions with other tribes

To sum up, Dawn of Man is a nice, unique game which you can spend several hours playing with (although I personally find it hard to dump lots of hours in one sitting into the game). I'd gave it a solid overall score of 7/10.",1654727158,1654727158,True,7,0,0.573181569576263428,0,True,False,False

Combat is very hard to handle because you can't really influence what your people do. Not as much as I would feel I need in this game. So the combat heavy scenario just isn't an option for me.

The advertised auto-priorization of food in regards of durability doesn't seem to work for me. Settlers prefer to eat the freshly dried meat but let the berries rot.

Also, as with Planetbase, sometimes you just don't get more people. I have free space, I have a surplus of food, I have a high 90s scoring and a high exposition rating but neither do I receive new settlers nor do my women birth more babies. Apparently there also is a gamewise limit of around 300ish people.

The auto-priorization of the settlers is better than in Planetbase (as in they don't starve while transporting food) but still they seem to just do nothing a lot even though the work load is high. At least one missed transported berry is not a chain reaction to doom anymore as in Planetbase.

Also I feel it's a missed opportunity to go further than the iron age. I really got into gear with high level farming and ranches, I could finally support a huge new thriving civilization but... I am already in the iron age. There's no more to come. I feel like this could have used a wider range.

All in all its a fun game with a lot to improve, I paid 21 Euros for so far 17.5 hrs of gameplay (of which probably 75% were fun and the rest waiting). I will probably play more. But I wouldn't buy it again for 21 Euros.




Update:

As expected, I've played some more but it really hasn't gotten any better. Even though my work load is at 30 % only, people are IDLING next to PRIOTIZED tasks. My raw skins are rotting in the tanning station, because noone bothers to add tannine. I only have around 100 people. Why do they prefer to idle on a low work load and leave tasks unfulfilled? I don't get it. Probably bad coding. Like.. oh what would it be... Planetbase?

Also the ingame help advertises that my animals can be fed with grains if I don't have straw. I have 400 units of grain and my animals starve. Again, low work load. Apparently, that was also a lie.

Progressing tech is lackluster seeing how you go from the beginnings of the settlements forming to the iron and steel era. The production is done by everyone so you can't assign villagers to be dedicated smiths, hunters or whatever you may need, this leading to weird prioritization where you can have an abundance of the needed goods but no one to make it. Off the last point the AI has pretty poor prioritization standards, it could be the beginning of spring and instead of ensuring the crops get planted they will run off and go cut a tree down, or you are low on food and instead of turning your flour into bread they will go and cut down a tree, no clue why trees are so high on the priority list. Expanding is a central part of all civ/city building games, this game it almost seems less worth it to expand, more people doesn't really give any true benefits and in my case when I expanded the raiders would spawn right on top of my walls giving me no time for my people to run around to grab their armor and weapons to defend.

All in all, seeing has how this game won't be getting any new content due to the devs having stopped any support for it back in 2021, is it worth it on a half off sale, sure but otherwise don't get it full price.",1654496828,1654496828,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

For me personally, I have two big problems with the game and they both have to do with scale. The game is simply too small. The tech tree is painfully shallow when you consider how many eras this game covers - and the game is never hard enough to make any advancements feel important. Certain technologies should serve as watershed moments where your civilization fundamentally changes. That doesn't happen here.

The scale of the 'cities' you manage are also pitifully small with the AI being so unoptomized that getting larger often serves as a detriment because meeples can't prioritize jobs correctly resulting in them running across the city from one job to another.

The gaming space has a serious lack of games exploring this fascinating early era of humanity when we were still battling to conquer nature. Unfortunately, this game just doesn't do that struggle justice.",1654327067,1654327067,False,53,1,0.808410048484802246,0,True,False,False

Former review: There are still a lot of issues with this game, as the two current top reviews demonstrate (both the positive and negative ones). Obviously, I've had a lot of fun and with my gameplay hours you'll see I've been a keen player. But the issues are still there, mainly in the areas of AI and gameplay. I haven't seen this issue mentioned yet, but it sucks seeing 50% of your population lost to no food when you've got enough for everyone but no one will make bread, even if you directly command them to do so, for example. There are numerous other examples in the other reviews. On the gameplay level, I think others are right in pointing out that there's no real goal. You can be raided (and this interaction requires little if any strategy) but you can't raid. You don't even know why you're being raided in the first place. It's not as if they're competing for your resources either. They just come in all slash and burn with no interest in taking your resources or your people as slaves.

Things quickly fall apart with no way to manage satellite settlements with the games atrocious path finding and tasking. Or even flexibility and control with a single settlement. Have to overbuild to keep the game from spamming warning messages at you. Inventory and resource management is very basic leaving you little flexibility in gameplay.

 1 - Devs are constantly adding to it at no cost to the player - no paid DLC so far / no microtransaction bullshit - just constant polishing & love for their game. This friends, is the gift that keeps on giving. Their twitter has all the updates, check it out: https://twitter.com/madrugaworks .. 

2 - Game has a sweet level of realism & Artwork doesn't feel cartoonish to a point where it's breaking the immersion like some other City Builders. This is some fantastic artwork & a lot of research went into ancient technologies/buildings to make it even more historically fit.

3 - Music is relaxing and fits perfectly with the game

4 - I've never had any bugs whatsoever. None!

In all seriousness this game is absolutely amazing with how well its done for a game that was never finished. I could go on for days about what I love about it but 1. There are hundreds of reviews saying the same things and 2. there is a word limit on these reviews so I will keep it simple. 

One thing that i love and dont see too many people mention is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal with how well it was composed and I would say it is on par with the minecraft soundtrack with how peaceful and calming it is. I love hearing the use of instruments like the Kalimba as it adds to the whole mood of the song and really translates well what kind of music you could expect to hear during ancient times. 

Some things that I would like to see added...

1. Multiple AI Tribes. It would be very interesting and more immersive if your tribe wasn't alone on the map. Yes there are raiders that show up every so often but theyre quite easy to handle and not a huge threat. I wish these raiders would at least try building settlements of their own that you could raid or even trade with, it would make the game much more interesting in my opinion. 

2. Ability to have more than one settlement. So yes, technically you can send people off to build in distant lands but no matter what you do, the AI only recognize ONE settlement so they will keep going back to your main location for tasks. I wish a system was implemented where you could send them to settle new lands and start a new tribe. This would allow you to move with the animals as they migrate. 

3. Bigger maps. Nothing much to say on that. 

4. Would love to see the Atlatl as a weapon you can make and use as it was incredibly common during the stone age and very easy to make. Unfortunately it is always overshadowed by slings, bows and spears in games despite it being arguably more popular.

5. Expansions. Would be super cool if they released DLC's set in different parts of the world like Africa, Asia, South America, etc. with unique and historically accurate animals, tools, geography, religions, etc.

6. Religion. I wish the religion in the game was more in depth and had more to it than some totem poles and standing rocks.

7. Art and Music. While I love the soundtrack it would be cool to be able to make instruments and art that i could watch my people jam out with while celebrating warding off raiders or surviving the winter. This could tie into religion.

8. Dino Age DLC. Not historically accurate but would be awesome to see a DLC set during age of dinosaurs with all different types of humans (homo erectus, neanderthals, homo habillis, etc) 

9. Lastly, Boats and deep sea/lake fishing along with hunting sea life like whales and sharks. 

Anyways these are just ways to make an already amazing game even better.

Painfully overhyped and mass advertised by streamers on release. The game is fun but crippled by the same ai issues planetbase, another game made by the same devs is. 

The game is initially fun but crippled by slow development and punishment based on poor resource balancing on the map. 

Edit: My initial review was based on the very short amount of time i was able to play the game. 
It is now completely unplayable, crashing frequently (Every 2-5minutes) that will leave you with a guaranteed corrupt save file. 

I've emailed and have conversation with developers about this issue but they will only comment that you must have outdated video card drivers. 
Tracing logs will drag it to a thread line failure in the game, something that is obviously a developer issue. 

When mentioning this i was blocked by the developer and am $35 out of pocket for supporting a game i thought might genuinely be good.. Currently awaiting to hear from Steam after hours of trouble shooting..

It's pretty slow-paced and chilled out, you can spend a lot of it being very hands-off if you so choose. In the early Stone Age eras your people are hunter gatherers, and spend a lot of their time just working to find food and survive. This is something the game handles really well, as the transition to becoming a settled agricultural society feels natural and it changes the flow of the game.

Beyond this though the game does kind of fall apart a bit thematically as you progress into the Bronze Age and Iron Age. In the real world these eras saw cultures become much more complex societies, with all kinds of infrastructure, cultural development, and more complicated needs and desires than simply sustaining themselves. The game really does nothing to represent this at all, and it still feels like you're a very simple agrarian tribe rather than a real Iron Age society. It does feel like the developers kind of lost sight of what they wanted the game to be once they moved beyond the Stone Age stuff.

This game has no endgame to it & is very repetitive after a while if you don't kill off your people early on. 

That's my only Cons to this game. 

The good far outweighs the bad, It's a city builder for ancient times. Resource management is key to making it to whatever end there is. Going slow & not rushing development is what's going to get you thru this thing. Always have more supply than demand. If you got 2 people in a tribe, have 6 of everything. If you have more, trade the extra or build a tent to raise pop. You wanna know it's time to place a tent? Wait til you have so much supply that it ain't getting used fast enough, then put a tent & repeat. This will make your game slower & longer but probably the best all around strategy.

Tips for game beginners:
1. DON'T try to kill a mammoth with a flint spear... Why? Because it'll impale your entire hunting party, stomp you flat, and wipe you off its feet on one of your domesticated wolf dogs. 
2. If you're insistent on killing a mammoth to feed your tribe, then hunt an old mammoth. Don't bother baby mammoths, because Mamma will get you. 
3. Don't build too many houses, because more people will join, mingle with your tribe, move in together, and have babies... Then you'll have more mouths to feed than you have food for.
4. TAKE YOUR TIME. Go slow and learn the game. That's where your enjoyment comes from. 
5. Watch out for those dang cave lions, raiders, and stupid hyenas!
6. The pigs run fast, so wait until you have dogs and bows & arrows to hunt them.
7. Watch out for the lightning!

Slow-paced and very detailed developement of primeval settlement, hunting (or even taming) unique creatures, breeding cattle, harvesting crops and lots of other interesting stuff - very exciting.

It's all about process. It is very satisfying to watch how settlers go hunting, build new or repair ramshackle huts, transport giant stones to build some monumental structures; how they create clothes, instruments and weapons to deal with local threats. Overall - tons of unique activities.

What also worth mentioning? - definitely it's primeval setting. Not something you can see very often. And great animations as well. It is especially important, considering how many different tasks you settlers have to perform. Local AI is also rather good for the most part. And visuals in general are also rather picturesque.

Unfortunately there is one big problem, which ruins this idyll. The game is unfinished and was abandoned by the developers. And this leads to a bunch of other problems, like bugs, anoying limitations and unrealized ideas. While the game has no goals, it feels like it has it's hidden limits and at certain point any solid content just ends.

For example, the bigger you settlemt - the harder it is to expand it (lack of space suitable for building and resources) and the more problematic it becomes for local AI. Depleted resources can be found far away - but it leads to logistical problems. Technically you can build new settlemet, but settlers do not recognize it as another settlemet, what leads to problems with AI. Etc, etc, etc.

Eventually, I recommend it nonetheless, because it is still very fun. This game has just huge unrealized potential. If it was not abandoned - it could become something truly fascinating.",1652244272,1652280377,True,13,0,0.594545245170593262,0,True,False,False

When I came across Dawn of Man (DoM) I thought it was your run-of-the-mill colony sim/city builder. Nothing wrong with that, it is my favourite genre(s) after all. But the market is so oversaturated with arguably mediocre titles with the rare diamond in the rough among them, that you can be forgiven for not having any expectations so as to avoid disappointment. DoM, it pleases me to say, falls in the latter category.

Leading a tribe (for a lack of a better word) of primitive homo sapiens beginning in the Paleolithic and all the way to the Iron Age, it gives you a deeper appreciation of what our ancient forebears in the distant past had to endure in order to just survive. From disease, to dying of starvation, to fending off hungry predator beasts in winter. Little wonder the average life expectancy hovered around 35 years of age in those days. Worse still is the attacks by raiders; sporadic in the earlier ages due to the low human population density, they become much more commonplace once you leave flint tools behind and discover rudimentary metallurgy. Such is human nature, where the earliest origins of conflict (for food, livestock, sometimes even breeding partners) prove to be an internecine one for all sides involved. 

Again, I cannot stress the enjoyment to be had in playing this game. My only lament is that the developer Madruga Works seems to have stopped updating the game as of this review's writing. Though I understand DoM took a good four years to develop with over a year's worth of content being poured out, it should be unsurprising that Madruga Works, a small team to begin with, should want to move on and focus on developing other games. Similarly the modding for DoM is constrained by the game's engine. The lack of a map editor, which I feel is a golden must-have for games in this genre, is particularly disconcerting. The most that DoM's admittedly dedicated followers can hope to achieve is set parameters which will affect a map's layout; something I personally opine is too complicated for the more technologically obtuse among us. Myself included. 

For all that said and done, I would still recommend DoM to anyone curious enough to read through this long rambling of mine.

It's still not great, but it's definitely better. My original review is below for transparency. I will cover some of the changes after:

============================================

As an archaeologist, I want to like this game. It had a lot of promise conceptually. I gave it several months to mature, then came back to give it another try.

But it really feels like I'm playing some other game that just has a prehistoric skin slapped on it. The Palaeolithic is particularly just simplistic, and I wonder if the developers ever actually cracked a book about it at any point. Their portrayal is crudely stereotypical, creating a scenario where the abundance of plant resources is inconsequential until agriculture, forcing a reliance upon a diet of 95+% meat. REAL prehistoric humans were quite ingenious about this sort of thing and made broad use of fruit and vegetable resources while these ones seem content to harvest it and let it rot while they just keep gorging themselves on more meat rather than mixing things up a little or employing even the simplest preservation techniques.

After a while of having to hunt for pretty much all of your food, you're probably going to end up in a situation where the game has up and wandered off to the other side of the map. You're probably running low on flint too, and usually your starting point is just kind of limited in its potential while some better place is available elsewhere. Where REAL H. sapiens would have responded to a situation like this by picking up and moving, despite apparently living light, these are fundamentally incapable of moving  their settlement any distance. At their very best, your people in this game are not all that sharp, but attempting to move a settlement sends them into a case of the flailing stupids, such that the most gratifying part of my last game was actually watching them all die in a blizzard because they could not manage to break down their camp, load their things onto a sledge, move a bit downstream, and rebuild their simple tents in less than a year.

There's just so much about this game which could have been interesting if any thought was really given to it. Like dogs. Here, you click on 'dog domestication' in the tech tree, then a bunch of dogs just start hanging around your camp. They don't really do much unless something attacks your camp. They just kind of lay there, and you can eat them, and then more show up, and you can eat them too, and more show up, and you can eat those. They don't breed. They don't hunt. They don't herd. They just show up and cheerfully await a biface to neck.

This isn't to say that the game is TERRIBLE (though the AI is) or without any fun, but it is lacking in much by way of depth. Just another grunted out town-builder, really...

========================================================

So, that was the original state of things. As I said, some things have been improved since then.

It is somewhat more possible to do the nomad thing now, which was a pretty big strategy until the arrival of agriculture in the Neolithic. You can even do a nomadic start where you lack any tents but notionally have slightly more resources. It's still a very inelegant thing to actually pull off well in a timeframe sufficient to get up and running by the next winter.

Dogs do a bit more than just hang around camp. They can actually help you hunt and their domestication is actually now a big step in the game.

Faunal variety has increased, though it's still all megafauna. 

In hunter-gatherer stages, your people no longer eat 95% red meat. If you harvest plants, they will actually eat them instead of letting them rot en masse while gorging themselves on meat. Plant resources, however, are still limited to summer/fall and very low in breadth. In later stages, milk can be made into cheese, greatly increasing its utility as a food source.

A lot of the effort seems to have been poured into late stages to add depth to combat, including improvements to fortifications, the addition of armour from the Bronze Age onward. Ploughs are now a thing. Behaviour of villagers has greatly improved, especially during raids.

But all in all, diets (especially in early stages) are still very stereotypical. Big game specialization is key, and gathering is still very underplayed. Hunting of things smaller than wolves doesn't really exist. Aquatic resources are limited to fish. And life consists overwhelmingly of hunting and eating in early stages, with almost a total absence of anything resembling art or decoration despite the key role it played in societies from the late Palaeolithic onwards.

It's definitely better, and I'd say it's actually a good buy during a Steam Sale. Development has now ceased, with it still seeming to very much be a work in progress, so I can't really recommend it at full price. It does, however, seem to go on sale on a regular basis.",1563262420,1652117814,False,61,12,0.704985141754150391,0,True,False,False

Once you get to the later stages, the game just decimates your population. no wait, that would imply only a 10% reduction...when in reality, it's more like 25%.   I literally had 30% of my population die due either to starvation or dehydration despite there being more food than population of MULTIPLE kinds and THREE TIMES the water than population.  And of course when your population dies, your productivity goes into the shitter and NOTHING gets done.   You can try to cut back on the tasks your people are doing, but then a nice raider party, that is TWICE the size of the last one the game showed you, shows up and wipes you out.

Some ideas to improve the game:

1] Raiding parties need modified behaviors, they are biased towards gates to the point that you don't even need to build walls just gates in general areas and you can essentially choose where you will be attacked.

2] All farm animals have the exact same diet. I think some depth could be added by adding some variation here. Pigs (for example) are a relatively low value farm animal, but could be more interesting if they could eat all (or most) human foods in the game (as per real life). Horses also prefer oats etc.

3] Managing wild game was a major part of Neolithic hunting. It would again add depth if the animals you choose to hunt more had impact on their spawn rate or could even be made extinct through over hunting. Human's, for example, are believed to have contributed to the collapse of mammoth populations, but if you choose not to hunt them, it would be exciting to see them in later eras.

4] The RNG on animal and crop disease is devastating. This is probably true to form as a simulation, but can make game play extremely depressing as a diseased crop of straw can lead to a long winter of slowly dying livestock.

- Visuals could be better (overall its not bad, suits the game, but some textures are plain ugly - grass). Animations could be more detailed too.
- Too easy - if you can manage limits, workzones and workload, you wont have any challenges even on hardcore...food is too abundant, winters are too mild, attacks are easy.

<Edit>
After 10+ hours in this game, I would say its more of an Early Access state of game. Some things are clearly concepts/work in progress - Combat, Seasons impact, AI of villigers, threats in general. Only part that is ready to be marked as full realease is the building/management part (the core part). I still like it, one of best Early Access games I played so far (Considering the pricing, Im not mad its ""Full release"". This makes a big difference, lot of indie games are releasing in worse condition for 30E, so have to give DoM devs points for beign down to earth)

Dawn of Man is a deceptively simple city-builder/survival game - easy to learn, but you will scream and shout when you finally reach your fifth year without losing anyone to a cave bear attack.

A few tips:

1. Hold H while click-dragging a selection to select only hunters (villagers with weapons on their person) and 
2. Have groups of hunters attack single animals at a time for quick takedown with little chasing. 
3. Make sure to build a storage tent right away - you will also need a skins dryer to make skins for the storage tent.  Otherwise, materials will overflow your tiny housing tent storage slots and be lost.",1649807289,1649807289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you progress through the eras, you'll see your priorities shift as you balance new tasks with the steadily growing population while balancing resources. My favorite part was transitioning from an unstable tribe dependent on traveling wildlife for food to a steady settlement with dependable agriculture. Tips: You want to make sure you are prepared to enter the next era, as each comes with different challenges. Always try to maintain a solid welfare level above 90%. Set certain things to high priority even if your workload is below 100% if you absolutely want it done, such as crafting stations, crops, and stables; some of my animals died of starvation when I had plenty of straw and setting stables to high priority fixed this, for example. Find something to make/grow in surplus so you can trade merchants for needed items or new abilities to progress faster. Keep a few saves just in case something terrible happens (sold a bunch of wheat and now everyone's starving because part of a harvest failed, raids caught many of your villagers by surprise, or animal attacks were stronger than you anticipated).",1649622256,1649622926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
* Easy to pick up and learn especially if you are used to these types of games. I felt the tutorial told me enough that I could figure out everything else on my own.
* Fun to play, it's cool to start from the stone age and work your way up learning new aspects each time you make it to the next tier of tech
*Neat map overlay, basically what I mean is when you want to hunt or look for things to mine or collect there is a nifty button that highlights resources and also tells you how difficult an animal is to hunt (you'll be using that feature a lot)

Cons:
* My biggest issue is, eventually you'll have to move out further and further from your camp looking for resources. Yes, you do get the ability to make carts and things that help you carry more items but my issue is let's say you'd like to start another little colony. Well there is no way to keep your people from walking back and forth between the two colonies. They'll be stupid and pull resources from one side and walk all the way back. That's very time consuming AND they are often attacked by wild animals. If there is a way to keep them in certain areas other than when you assign them a task, I have yet to figure how to do it. That mechanic alone, makes me disinterested in continuing much further in the game. It's a very time consuming game as is and it takes a long time to gather resources and increase community size. 

* They don't really do a very good job explaining knowledge. Knowledge is your experience level and that's how you raise your tech level. As of now, they do a piss poor job explaining how you do that. You have to do more reading, and it's something that should have been covered in the tutorial with more detail. Honestly, considering how time consuming it is knowledge should be gained faster through a larger variety of tasks. 

* They need to do a better job letting the player know when resources are low, whether that's from over fishing or you mined everything in the area because I lost the first time I played. I didn't know that the areas I had been fishing were out of fish. So my community started starving, and I had a hard time hunting for food. ALSO, some resources can only be farmed at certain times of the year, of course that's fine except sometimes there is so few of that resource that it's just pointless to even try to farm it. Wheat is an example, it can only be farmed in fall BUT I could barely find any even remotely close to my community.   

* I've already slightly touched base on this, but the game just takes too long to level up your tech. Maybe that's because I don't know the tricks and shortcuts for the game but I got to the point where I was at stalemate, I couldn't find anything to hunt and didn't have the resources I needed to continue to build. So, I just had to wait for animals I could hunt to repopulate the area. 

If I go back and continue to play Dawn of Man, I'll update my pros and cons list. But for now, I think I'll wait for more updates. This game for sure caught my attention for a few hours, but in its current state I'm ready to move on and find another game.

There are a couple of issues with automation that necessitate micromanaging - for example, adults have a wider skillset than children, but you can only automate by task, not by villager type, so adults end up doing menial work that children could do while the children remain idle and the more demanding tasks don't get done.

It looks pretty enough, it is cool to put tents made out of skins, huts made out of mud and sticks, make things from flint and bone, dry meat... This is like... the very basics of a game in such a setting.

There are some odd things, like you can unlock pottery but you do not make any pottery? You just... have it now, so you can make people carry water. No crafting here. Such things are just weird.

But the main offender is the AI, oh my goodness, the AI is SO BAD and FRUSTRATING 
I sometimes do not even know why people are not doing stuff! They just... do not.
Why you cannot gather mud? Just... get some mud oh my goodness

And if you do not have a barn or whatever, but have goats, your goats will die out of starvation because... because. 

People are also a bit lifeless. They work, with their horrible AI, they sometimes pray (by going on their knees and such, never dancing or anything of this kind) and that is it? When they are idle, they stare into space.
I did not see them talking to each other, having fun, children playing. 

Which may be a weird complain, but I miss the old Sierra games. Sure, they were different, based on the road system, and they were rather silly, but still, why cannot other building games feel so... alive, lived in?

So - play it if you also crave a prehistoric time setting with stone tools etc. The game is ok. But AI is so frustrating, and something is... lacking in the game, in a way that I cannot fully recommend it to anyone else.

- - - - - -

EDIT; Just to add that the game appears unbalanced, and sure, single player experience does not need to be super balanced but like... I jumped from people dying from starvation (also, by the way, weird thing you cannot boil grains?.. Like... why? and no cannibalism? well, maybe it is just me) to, as my goats quickly started multiplying, such a sudden abundance of food it is rotting away. 

You can set priority of buildings to high, but so far I did not notice it do anything - e.g. I put 3 buildings to be built, I set the priority of one of them to high, and people still would take care (slowly) of the other two first

Also, the speed... I have no idea what is up with that, because even in tutorial they do not just introduce the speed-up as optional, they tell you again and again to speed up to the maximum, as if the authors were aware the game regular speed is too slow? It is really odd

I thought, well, the regular speed could be relaxing, perhaps. Sit back and see what your people are doing. But it is just so very slow, and the people really will not do anything interesting, feeling so lifeless, I cannot think of playing the game without constant speeding up.

And then there is a thing that bothers me about food. E.g. you have few types of cereals to plant, but they all count as one resource; they just have different stats (this produces more straw, this produces more grain...)
 And again, they can be eaten only when turned into flour and then bread, which is a weird lack of insight.

It's very easy-going on you and easily enjoyable after a day of work. You might feel disappointed if you're looking for action-packed, competitive gameplay, such as you see in Age of Empires or the likes (mind you, it's not even the same genre).

However, it's not to say that the game is boring. There are several aspects to the game which need you to focus, as one bad winter or one bad raid can easily cripple your settlement. This is doubly valid for hardcore mode (iron-man mode). Always have crops to last you for two years! Some of the achievements are not so easily obtainable either, so you're definitely getting your money worth of game.

Maps are not random, but each map has several starting points which adds some diversity. You can also start in nomad mode and settle a different area every time as well. 

One word of warning, though, this game is not getting any more updates. In other words, this is the final form of the game, period. You can get some extra content from the Workshop, but nothing official anymore. However, for its price, you're getting a lot of game as it is.

Also noteworthy is that the game isn't very forthcoming about its more refined features. There is a task priority feature, so that you can prioritize some tasks, such as sowing/harvesting crops over others, but it's hidden under a very inconspicuous button so it's easy to miss. The game also fails to tell you that the villagers are not some sort of robots who can work 24/7, so the game gives them some time to rest during which they simply show as ""Idle"" and don't seem to do anything. That's directly tied to high workload and the game warns you if you go overboard with overworking your villagers.

All the maps are pretty crap, with too many mountains and not enough flatlands, and you will constantly be aannoyed at how far away your people have to travel to get megaliths

The people are idiots and you will be really frustrated if you get low on farming tools, because the people with farming tools just start to do all other tasks instead of focusing on harvesting, so you have to constantly click on the people leaving the feilds and make them go back to harvesting, which is annoying as hell.

This game is going to be mostly relaxing with small moments of ""OH NO"" mixed in if you let up your attention too much.  However as a game for relaxing it is highly recommended and a good way for new comers to get introduced to resource management.  A minor thing to note is that this game is basically a forever ""Beta"" game.  I noticed on the forums and steam discussion pages that there are bugs 3 and 4 years old that haven't been dealt with.  So is not so much a feature as it is simply lazy dev work in that regard.

Would I recommend?  Yes, its a fun game that is a great way to just relax and kill time.  That being said however its not a full price worthy game.  It still has a lot of issues and its not likely we will ever see a fix to them.  Your population in game is REALLY bad at picking jobs and there's no in game way to correct this.  You will simply have times where the game does nothing and your settlers do nothing.  There will also be times when they constantly do the wrong things.  This is not a ground breaking game, or even an all that impressive game.

In similar games I was almost bummed when my civilization reached more modern time periods and always wished there was something that was just ""ancient.""  Dawn of Man really hits me in my history gut in just the right way.  During the summer I disappear into the woods with historical re-enactors to live a bit of this life.  This holds me over in moments where I am missing those places.

If you are familiar with community builders like this then there isn't an adjustment period, you can jump right in and start playing even without the tutorial.

Resource/Micro Management 1/10: THE ONLY reason why this is ANYTHING above a 0/10 is because there is a basic system that is SEMI useful. But TBH and blunt AF, it's outdated and NEEDS an update MONTHS ago! Because of this absolute horrible system, the mid-late game is complete trash! There needs to be a system where you can dedicate certain people/amount of people to hunting, mining, wood cutting, ETC. Because with the current system, once your workload gets over %175-%200 for ANY reason, Forget about ANYTHING getting done for hours! It's messed up!

Hunting/Fishing 3.5/10: I want to give this a higher score, but cannot justify it. While hunting an animal that JUST happens to wander closer to, or RIGHT through the middle of your GOD FORSAKEN camp, the hunting party manage somehow to LOSE their prey...... LIKE WTF!? Not to mention that sometimes the party will travel half way or more across the map to kill their prey only to die to starvation or hypothermia on their way back..... So say goodbye to the meat, skin and all the tools/weapons/clothes those people had. No way to retrieve those.......... Fishing on the hand is a TINY bit better. But with HOW fast you deplete a river, it's dumb...... You literally need to switch fishing sites every 3/4-1 season. That's IMO(As a RL fisher, and who studies wild life) stupid, oh and also not to mention, inaccurate.

Combat 6/10: I'm happy to say at least one area is rather well polished, for the most part. To be fair there are some rough patches to be polished/smoothed out. But that's the same with any game. Mainly the one big one is(IMO) the single mindedness of that both your civilians and your enemies display can be staggering..... A lot of the times they will sit there attacking your walls or towers while your people surround and kill them, or pelt them with arrows. Honestly why not attack those who are attacking you? Another small thing is that some animals seem too under powered IMO, Like I'm curious to know how a full grown Bison can be killed by 1 dog and two people so easily?, or 4 hyenas can be killed so easily by 2 people with only wooden spears? Maybe this was done for balancing reasons? Oh well.

Scenery/Graphics 8/10: TBH the wilds are really nice looking, and so are the details of each of the individual tree, rock, bush, ETC. Only have minor things to say, nothing of which impacts the game play or playability due to lag. It's also nice to see a game this pleasing to the eye that can be run on a pretty standard system that almost anyone would have.

Terrain 3/10: My main complaint here is that no matter which map you choose, there are TOO many mountains/hilly areas. Along with almost 0 areas cleared of trees, large enough to start when playing Nomad close enough to the water, or good hunting grounds. This wouldn't normally be a problem. But considering you have to wait until u unlock flint tools to cut down trees, and you cannot terra form the land, this is a MASSIVE problem. And if you have say a Stone or Flint node in the way, you have to mine it for it to disappear and be built over. But if your workload is already too high, don't even bother.

So in the long run I give this game a 4.3/10. Safe to say this game needs A LOT of work before I'd recommend it to anyone. Let alone for $25. I forget the price of it when I bought it, But I know it was cheaper. Do I regret buying it? No, not yet. With time, and patience, I believe this game will live up to it's potential.

Currently you get to a point where your city runs itself 95% of the way and you're just waiting for research points so you have something new to do.  Lastly some things doesn't make sense, why did reindeer and wild horses go extinct?  They're still around today.  When crops get a disease you can't harvest them and have to remove them, that makes sense, but the land never recovers, even decades later, nothing can grow there, I don't even think you can build on it.  The game recommends you don't put a large plot of the same crop for this reason, but the disease doesn't just affect one grouping, it's all the crops of that type, no matter where you've put it.

Micromanaging your Neanderthals isn't possible, sadly, and that's why the game gets a thumb down.
Your evolved monkeys will start long distance hunting - while being tired, demoralised starving, dehydrated, etc. etc. etc.
Exactly, as you (the reader) came to the conclusion already:
They die before they even make it to the designated area.

Why they won't eat and drink before embarking, or at least take rations with them, is beyond my comprehension.

I have seen my settlers being starved in the settlement, and STILL deciding to go after that Mammoth 2 rivers away instead 
of recovering their stats first. Which in turn degrades your welfare. Welfare decides how many new settlers you will get. And it's annoying dropping from 99% down to 80% and losing 10 settlers before new ones arrive.

Dawn of Man takes players on a long journey from the ancient Stone Age all the way through the Iron Age, spanning over ten thousand years of civilization. 
There’s a real feeling of satisfaction when you successfully manage to carry your population through the difficult times or hunt one of those massive mammoths roaming the land. 
Dawn of Man does a wonderful job of introducing you to its mechanics through its simplified tutorial and easy-to-navigate UI. 
It doesn’t overwhelm you with actions and instead focuses on making your experience about managing your population and making sure they survive whatever comes in their way.
There is the basic build function, where players can choose whether to build more residence buildings for a chance of higher population or production-oriented facilities to further the industrial sense of the population. 
But the feature I particularly enjoyed was the work areas assignment. 
You assign a number of people to a certain area you mark on the map to gather a certain type of resources, hunt down animals, fish, or harvest and collect wild plants. 
This makes your life so much easier, and you can even control the maximum amount of resources you want so whoever assigned to that area will stop working once they reach it.

‘Primal vision’ is another innovative feature. 
It freezes gameplay and offers players an informative colourized vision of the world around them. 
It is most efficient in evaluating how dangerous the animals around your settlement are, and estimating how many of your people you need to send out to hunt it down. 
The game succeeds in diversifying the animal kingdom around you depending on the age you are currently in, including mammoths, woolly rhinos, ancient bison, megaloceros, cave lions, tigers, and many more. Hunting down these animals gets easier as you progress and research better hunting tools, which brings us to the technology system.

Dawn of Man rewards players with knowledge points when they achieve milestones, such as collecting a certain amount of resources, the first time killing an animal, surviving through winter or a natural disaster, trading, and other miscellaneous activities. 
It’s designed for the accumulation of knowledge points to come naturally through playing the game so you don’t have to go out of your way to earn them.
Knowledge points are spent in researching new technologies to craft new hunting tools, build better facilities, domesticate animals, and fortify your settlement. 
They can be spent freely; however, you are constrained with the age you are in at the time. 
You are free to unlock technologies in whatever order you choose, and this is where you need to make choices, since certain technologies will help you more than others, especially early on.
There are three main ways you can play the game, either through its freeplay scenarios or challenges. 
The freeplay scenarios start you off with a basic settlement, and you have to accomplish milestones before unlocking the next freeplay option, with three available in total. The later stages are the most compelling and entertaining, where players are often raided and have to protect their settlements from various threats.
The challenges section confines the player with a certain set of rules and a goal they have to accomplish with the limited resources they have at their disposal. 
Overall, Dawn of Man is a well-developed survival city-builder with the necessary tools to keep you invested and coming back for more.
I rarely encountered any bugs or game-breaking issues throughout my playtime, which is always a good sign. 
If you want to spend time building and developing your own civilization through the ages, don’t hesitate to give Dawn of Man a try.",1643401811,1643401811,True,6,0,0.558903634548187256,0,True,False,False

There's not enough fine control for late game which means your villagers end up doing stupid things.  For example, if I want a villager to do a task far away, they will have starved / died of thirst / turned back for seasonal clothes before they get there.  But afaik there's no way to ask them to pick up specific equipment in advance.

Then, if they die on route, other villagers will try and fetch their belongings and suffer the same fate.  I tried setting up a small outpost so they would have somewhere to go to meet their needs, but I can't move specific resources that they would need.

The technology advancement is a neat system wherein, the more things you do (both quantity and variety) the more tech points you earn. The tech tree is also laid out in an intelligent way with one tech stemming from its obvious predecessor.

Villager needs are pretty forgiving, I've never gotten to the point where my village was actually failing. This is amplified by the fact that the game really lets you progress at your own pace.

These genuinely are the issues the early hunter/gatherers had to contend with. I really like the Knowledge Points basis of progression. Actively hunting, exploring and developing your settlements builds knowledge points to be used to progress through the various ages of man ultimately finishing in the Iron Age (I know...this is the point most city-building games began at!!) The passing of time sees gradually sees the extinction of the various Megafauna and the encroachment of modern recognisable animals.

Pros:
- Early ages you have lots of fun hunting animals for food and earning tech points
- You can plan your village and even make it as a nice fortress to fend off raiders.

Cons:
- Very short (just 3 maps)
- The AI is super stupid (but maybe smarter than the developers). The villager will plan one crop and then walk half way across village to pick wood while the tree cutter will walk to plant the next field
annoying and game ruining when you have to  plant/harvest crops in limited time. 

Play Caesar 3 or 4. More challenging, better utilization of planning skills, more scenarios and cheaper.

- progression takes irl hours, forcing you to sit and watch while you wait for knowledge points to accrue
- resources such as wildlife will be permanently exhausted without your involvement
- 'gathering zones' mechanic is a very stupid idea (you need to manually raise the gather limit, set the number of workers, constantly move the gather zone)
- micro-managing workers isn't possible (no idle counter, no information of current/next task)
- graphics worse than Banished
- low morale villagers won't fight for their lives (realism?)
- many instructions missing (quality of tools, wildlife resources, buildings, etc -> in general the tooltip notices in-game only provide one sentence in the help menu which doesn't explained what you just unlocked, or how to even use it)

Progression feels good, if you advance too quickly and don't immediately invest in better weapons, armor and defense then the enemy raids will hurt.

A huge let down is that the developers haven't touched this game in about a year and a half, and before that the amount of patches and updates were very few. I think the last update they did was add the ability to make cheese...which is pretty useless. This game has a lot of potential to be MUCH better than its current state and its disappointing that the devs have essentially abandoned it.

With that said, I still highly recommend this game for anyone who loves strategy games. This is definitely one of my favorite strategy games I've played.

I have some comments about this game. I play other resource management and sim games and there are things that this game could learn from those.

1. A mini map would be very helpful! (Or even a N/S compass with an option to re-center the village?) It wasn't until later that I discovered that the Return (Enter) key re-centers the map. But a way to keep my bearings would be nice. Also, knowing the boundaries of the map would be nice, too.

2. More Micromanaging: I wish I could direct villagers to certain tasks and have them only do that specific task, except in emergencies, such as a raid. I find that the AI for the villagers is a bit awkward. I have villagers who are tired and hungry, yet they keep working until they die. Maybe that's how it used to be in the Neolithic Age, but I doubt it. I watched an old woman pull on a rolling megalith, by herself, and then keel over and die. What a way to go! Also, if I need tanned hides, I need them NOW, not when the villager feels like getting to it. I know you can click people and direct them places, which I have done, but I want to designate people to do specific tasks and only those tasks.

3. Better UI for resources, such as heat map to show what has a LOT of something or not. Or better ways to distinguish vegetation between fruits, nuts, and grains. A hover feature that would show how much of something is there would be great, rather than having to click on everything.

4. Certain interfaces should stay open when clicking around the map. This would be helpful with managing the Work Areas. I want to be able to see if I double marked an area and cycle through them. This would also be a great place to micromanage the villagers, where I can click a work area and have ""Grog"" and ""Amil"" gather the fruits for the Fall (for example.) A list of what the Work Area encompasses would be great, too, like multiple types of fruits/grains.

5. Indicators above production buildings (and buildings under construction) of what they are missing. I sat and waited forever for a hut to be built, thinking it was just because the Workload was high, when all I needed to do was get more mud.

6. Health meters for Raiders and Villagers: It would be great to see which side is winning/losing.

7. Item properties/qualities: For example, how much does a totem revive morale compared to just a skull pole? I imagine the Totem and Megaliths are better at it, but by how much?

8. How many units of food does one person need in one season/year? Does the quality and nutrition value matter? I don't know. I have fruits and breads that go bad because no one eats them. Does food variety improve morale, or does it matter? Some more specific stats on the foods and how they matter would be great. I know Grains are super important to human progress, but is there more to it? Is bread a nice-to-have or a must-have?

9. Wishlist: moving buildings easier. Sure that isn't realistic to how humans developed their civilizations, but even in Cities Skylines, I can move structures without an issue and that's supposed to be about managing a sprawling metropolis.

10. Camera angles! If there were anything to improve, I would love to change the angle to a more overhead view, rather than the current 3/4 side view. Also, zooming further out would be so helpful, especially when I get LOST in the far corners of the map. I'm so used to being able to change that and this camera is so restrictive. It makes it more difficult to place buildings and farmland.

I am enjoying the game as a whole. I like that is a bit of a slow progression, rather than jumping to the next era before I am prepared. I have full control of that, which I like. I like the quality of the graphics and animations. I like the premise of the game and how the village grows so organically. I appreciate the time and energy that went into this game. It definitely has room for improvement, but I am going to keep playing.

It has potential to be a super good game if only it had more to it. I want to like it so badly!..... This type of game is right up my alley!... But it just feels like it was half-assed with lots left out.

Needs

Multiplayer: Because it feels like it would be fun to play with and/or against a friend.... or more

Larger maps with actual AI villages for single player: The map is to confined and feels claustrophobic.... and random tiny groups of ""raiders"" popping up out of nowhere is terrible.   

Reasons to venture beyond the village: There's a whole map of blah!... The same thing from one corner to another. This game needs to include a reason to explore besides the little guys chasing a deer for eternity so they can starve on the way back after losing the prey.

Better hunting parties!: Because the dumb turds can never seem to bag the catch!.... SSooooo many of the hunting attempts end in failure after the dweebs chase the animals off into the sunset for nothing.

Sunset: the perpetual day sucks.

Longer Seasons: Cause WOW

More building options, upgrades, and expansions: Because Variety!

One stop production focus: With the click of a button your little clan go from cranking out foodstuffs to focusing on everything needed for clothing production or livestock task, or weapons manufacturing, or building maintenance/upgrades.... et cetera

Medicine shaman guy: to rub some mud guts and shrooms on your wounds to heal your ill clan.... and even the animals!

Land creation, manipulation, and leveling: For making great farmland, building sites, and all around beautiful settlements! 

Meaningful traders: The traders come, but there's no need to trade anything... There needs to be another village, or better yet multiple, to trade with where resources of one type are scarce where in another region they are abundant creating a need to trade..... Traders are useless as they are.

Dedicated class types: Farmers, Hunters, Gatherers, Smiths, Weavers, Wood Workers, Builders, et cetera. They could start off as a one-type-does-all but as you grow and they advance, they start to specialize to a particular field of work

Better menu access: It's okay.... but there are many QOL improvements that could be done to keep the frustration at ease.

Better AI!: Because the dumb turds will go across the map hungry with his sledge for a piece of meat then attempt to travel across the map again to another distant place (forgetting the sledge he brought) and then die of starvation a few meters from the berry bush he passed because he was programmed to be too stupid. I've got turds dying of starvation constantly with plenty of food in storage because they are not at all efficient in their decisions and travels... The logic needs an overhaul BADLY!

My overall score is 8/10. This game did A LOT of things right, but I feel the late game was underwhelming, and this game had more missed opportunities than I could count because this could have been a GOTY for strategy games.
PROS:
-Excellent music
-Intense early game
-Good AI for the most part
-Primal Vision was done well
-Going through the Ages and seeing your city flourish is great
-Not many, if any games have touched the Pre-Historic Age, especially city builders which we have so few of.
-All around relaxing game you can play hours on end, and feel the need to keep playing and growing your city.
What This Game Missed
-I feel it's very hard to and pointless to travel long distances in this game.
-Boats such as raft and kayaks could mediate this problem and allow players to progress faster and accomplish harder tasks in a reasonable amount of time
-Horseback riding for villagers
-Africa map since early humans came from there and it's an untouched period for most games. There is potential to Dry/Wet seasons instead of Summer-Spring seasons. Different disasters such as drought, sand storms, and flooding. Tweaked models of horses and cougars to zebras and lions. Explore some different aspects of African culture and African themed dress wear and buildings. This would most definitely switch the game up, keep players playing, all the current maps feel the same, and could even be DLC I'm sure most players would purchase and return to this game.
-Beekeeping
-Building ""Outposts"" and drawing ""zones"" for main camp and outposts. This could be a way to set up trade posts, defensive strategies, and move/explore more resources. Horseback riding could make this viable. 
-Other villages AI owned that players can raid/loot/raze and interact with trade and alliances/client states. 
-Multiplayer similar to AoE where two friends can build villages while also going head to head competing for resources, land, and dominance. 
-I really wish Diet was a factor in this game. Hunting and husbandry I find to be enough. I wish there were modifiers both positive and negative that would affect health, productivity, life span, and combat strength by collecting a larger/healthier variety of food for my citizens. This would encourage the player to be more interactive with their population. 
-I wish some resources such a Megalith rocks were more available and you could use horses/donkeys/cattle to transport it faster.
Conclusion:
This is a great game. There limitless opportunities to improve this game for DLC and the hopeful DoM 2 game. This game's foundation is solid and fun. I would make the argument this game is really fun for the early/mid game because of how interactive you have to be, whereas late game feels like maintenance. Overall, the game is almost a breakout game, I wish it had little higher budget, more development time, and Updates + DLC.",1636477992,1636477992,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You can't make people do smart stuff. You can't select storage houses to store a minimum of goods. Mining outpost you want to stock with wood and food and shit so you can keep the buildings repaired?

I've played the game for nearly 40 hours and every time I start a new settlement after returning back to the game I face the same problems again and again.

I set building certain things to ""high priority"" when I have more than enough resources to cover the construction and settlers still choose to hunt even when my food is past the set cap for hunting. I cancel the hunting tasks, and then they want to mine. I cancel the mining tasks, and then they want to chop down trees. I cancel chopping tasks and then they want to fish. I cancel fishing tasks and then they want to hunt. The whole time I cannot get more settlers because I can't get more buildings because my settlers are refusing to build them. Then my current buildings start to need repairs and they still do this stupid round-about of tasks whilst ignoring things that are clearly more important... Things I have set to a high priority because they are more important.

The same problems seem to arise depending on what you desperately need done. Do you desperately need food? Well expect your settlers to do this round-about of stupidity instead of collecting food. You sit there praying a trader will come so the entire settlement you have just spent hours building doesn't starve to death.

It's not overly hard to play and the learning curve isn't all that difficult.  But it is a time sink.  It's definitely a slow burn.  After 8+ hours of actual game play I only have about a dozen people in my group.

I only have 2 real complaints.  One, the UI is a bit clunky.  The biggest issue I've run into is that if I move too far away from my people it's hard to find them again since there's no map mode.  If they settle right near where they first spawned it's not hard because you can use the enter key to go back to the spawn point.  But if they moved quite a ways away it can be hard to find them.  And secondly, there's a lot of micromanaging that needs to go on.  Yes, you can set up work areas and they do a good job of tending to those areas.  But they seem to have no concept of figuring out what they need and stopping what they're doing to go get it.  This is most evident in food storage.  When food gets low you have to select a bunch of people and manually have them go hunt.  Sure, you can set up a hunting work area, but if there are no animals that come through that area regularly then it's a bit of a waste.  Just set up fishing areas (more than one on a river) and manually have your people hunt when their meat stores get low.

Besides those issues this is a really cool game.",1634320727,1634320727,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a colony sim/city management game, it's very simple and does absolutely nothing new or innovative. That's not to say it's bad--it's very competently put together and is still fun. Just... nothing special.

But I suppose the real value of the game is the content itself. It kinda feels like the sort of game your high school history teacher would've made you play and write a report on if they were hungover that day. Over the course of gameplay, you really get a sense of the slow, incremental advances that humankind made in prehistory to achieve some semblance of civilization. From hunter-gatherers to settled agrarians, each step feels challenging and well-earned. It's interesting to see little notifications pop up about what animals have gone extinct as you progress from era to era.

That's kinda it though. Dawn of Man is great if you're hankering for a particular flavor of paleolithic colony sim, but otherwise bog-standard in every other respect. To utilize a cliche, I wish steam hand a ""thumbs medium"" button to accurately represent my feelings for this game.

The concept is really good, but the execution is kind of ""meh"". After the first 2 hours you've understood most of the game mechanics, everything else is just rinse & repeat. Not a lot of replay value for me, since increasing the difficulty just means more grinding and getting more slowly to the same result.

CONs:
- not too much replayability considering it's a sandbox
- music is meh
- AI is stupid sometimes
- walls sometimes useless since raider AI can just go around them and you can't build more due to steep terrain
- can't attack, only defend your city
- building placing mechanic is ... old? Not sure how to describe it, but it's more similar to age of empires 2 than cities skylines, if that makes any sense.
- defense/attack options are very limited

PROs:
- concept is interesting
- chill game you can play while listening to music, your favorite stream, a podcast etc.

It's quite busy in the beginning when you have so low population but it will pick up the pace. The game is quite tough if you don't know what to prioritize in the beginning and you get resource stuck quite easily in the midgame. In the end the whole village can be fully automatized with production limits and it's so relaxing just to focus on the beautification aspect of the game. I would have like to have some more options with the buildings themselves. 

Some of the more poor aspects, in the beginning I would like to have a passive fur trapping or something to balance out the skins production. If you don't get enough to hunt it really hinders the production. Like having an area to tag trees as ""trappers for small game"". 
In the midgame the different grains do not matter. You only want to grow barley for the extra straw. You get enough grain from those. And I never focused on growing peas. It never seemed too useful.
Fishing I never used. I always had enough food from hunting and farming. Dunno why. Perhaps if you made that you needed a balanced diet of meat, fish and wild edibles it would be fun. You could eat just meat but perhaps energy or something would go down faster.

1. It's not easy to put together a group to go hunting.  I wish there was something like a group panel where I could click a villager, see what gear they have (appropriate for hunting), then add them to the group and send the group off.  I try to do this when manually hunting, but sometimes I send someone without a bow and they end up running out in front of the group and get killed if I'm hunting a Mammoth or a bear or something.

2. Placing fences to have them connect so raiders don't get through is a pain.  Trying to connect them on a hill and around boulders and stuff makes it seem like the path is blocked off, but low and behold, raiders just come right on through.  Usually have to figure out the gaps when raiders come and watch where they go to get over the fence.....  and the raiders being able to walk over mountains and stuff is ridiculous.  I wish it was set up to where I can use the geography of the area to  round off my fortifications better.  And what is up with watch/Guard towers...  only 2 villagers can be in those things?  And they get destroyed ridiculously quick.  For the amount of materials you have to spend on building them, it seems like they should be stronger.

3.  late game resource gathering is a bother.  by the time you get to the iron age, I find it hard to find anymore resources.  the villagers can only walk so far before getting mad and dieing of dehydration/starvation.  i tried setting up some small camps around the map to give them a place to eat/drink/sleep on their path, but raiders keep showing up and destroying my camps.  i don't have a way to defend them since by the time my forces ever get there, it's already been destroyed and then my forces are out the open and get beat up really good.  So not sure how to continue getting stuff like stone and wood and stuff late game successfully.  Seems like horses should be able to be trained to ride... that would be increase the distance villagers can travel without issue.

4.  Finally, I wish unit/structure info was easier to access rather than have to go into the help menu every time i want a description of something.  Most games have that functionality to let you select or just hover over the item and it would pop up description and stats for that item....  Like strength of swords and tools...  All I get is a star rating but in the help menu it only seems to talk about their durability and i guess you have to assume that higher metal weapons and tools indicate that they do more damage, but just doesn't seem very clear.  Would much rather have a scale of 1 - 100 in DPS stats or something.

I know this sounds like a lot of issues, but it is a challenging and fun game.  Just wish some of the mechanics were a little bit better for a game that's a few years old now.

You are unable to effectively control the actions of your people. They need supervision, but there's no good way to provide it. They will be starving, but refusing to hunt. When close to corraling a young animal, they will run out of stamina and just give up, never to return. There can be food available, but still people will starve. You can assign tasks, but they get carried out in a haphazard fashion. You can't effectively prioritize them, like: foodrelated tasks, construction tasks, toolmaking tasks, or whatever. If tasks can't be completed because a necessary ingredient is missing, you won't get a warning and at some point you discover you've run out of a crucial tool, or a badly needed building hasn't been constructed. Despite all of the dangers in this time period, your people just wander off on their own. Even kids! Nothing you can do about it. Sometimes several villagers get killed, one by one, by the same animal. Sometimes other villagers are close by and refuse to help. You can have all the weapons available, and still have your villagers walking around with the least useful tools, resulting in them dying when attacked. It is basically impossible to assemble a group of properly equipped villagers for a hunting party, even though that would be the safest and most effective way to hunt, making it that much more difficult to provide enough food in the early eras, or to supplement your food quickly in an emergency. You are constantly losing people in avoidable ways, except, they are NOT avoidable, as you simply do not have the necessary level of control. A better way to control your people and a better AI would be sorely needed to make this a better game. Even then, there would still be a lot of room left for improvement. Whenever you enter a new era, you are at a disadvantage, as one of the game hints clearly states: for whatever reason, the random group of enemy raiders that pops up ever other season or so, is fully equipped with the latest gear of that era. So if you level up, with plenty of the best gear from the previous era, the raiders can still kill your people quite easily. And the first attack is often very close to reaching a new era. One way of dealing with that is to, effectively, use an exploit: have enough research points available for the most crucial research on top of what you need to level up, spend them all at once, produce the new weapons, gear, defenses as quickly as possible. Even then, attrition keeps your numbers from growing. Having to lock down your village to defend it, is also not helpful as your villagers stop producing badly needed products. If it happens during a harvest, all the worse. It almost feels as if the game itself is fighting you. You can still get pretty far, but unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot of reason to. It's not like you can take the fight to the raiders and wipe out their villages. There's relatively limited options for defence. I'd have loved to be able to build Iron Age Hillforts, with earth walls and ditches. Sadly, something like that is completely impossible. Building a raft, or boat? Impossible. Your villagers would rather swim anyway, even in the dead of winter. Exploration is limited due to the small range of your villagers (and the constant threats to their health). I still wouldn't say this is a terrible game, I didn't have any crashes and if you pay attention you can reach the final age and research everything available.. But then what? This game could be an interesting and fun way of allowing people to learn more about our ancestors, but it stops far short of doing much more than scraping the surface. As it is, it is enough to keep your attention for a few hours, but it doesn't seem like the kind of game that you just keep playing, or keep returning to. Ultimately, it feels like with a bit more effort, it could've been a terrific game. Those are always the most frustrating, when you can see what it might have been..",1631127378,1631127378,False,4,0,0.513334751129150391,0,True,False,False

I'm really into the concept of this game. I'm an avid RTS player that enjoys AOE II, Halo Wars, etc. Those strategy games are very fast paced. So, definitely a mistake on my part for expecting a similar pace. 

The game doesn't encourage micromanagement. You just kinda point resources out, map out your buildings, and the AI takes care of the rest. Barely any keyboard shortcuts so you're just kinda roaming the map and clicking around the whole time spamming the time speed x8 button.

To be honest, I have encountered many similar problems, such as: [I obviously have more than 50 sickles, but only 5 people are harvesting wheat. There is no sickle, but someone is clearly cutting down trees and digging, but there is a sickle in the equipment bay. 】I think this situation is actually not a problem of AI IQ, but an important part of the progress of human society-""division of labor"". This concept is not reflected in the game. The early game is similar to a small tribe. The tribe’s production tasks are not fixed, sometimes hunting, sometimes catching fish, sometimes cutting trees and mining, and sometimes manufacturing tools. There is no fixed job position. Everyone needs to go where and where. But in the late game, hundreds of people, large-scale agricultural planting, animal breeding, and the supply of wood and minerals that must be maintained mean that fixed jobs have appeared. Take agricultural planting as an example. Sowing beans in winter, sowing cereals in spring, harvesting beans in summer, and harvesting cereals in autumn. There are jobs all year round. It is perfectly possible to use an optimal number of people, all equipped with sickles, and separate in each season. Step on the spot to complete the task of planting and harvesting. Rather than making a lot of production tools pointlessly to ensure that the people who really work have the tools they need; or there are 2 to 30 plows, but a group of people rushing to plant seeds manually, this kind of production is meaningless The low efficiency is also the reason why the concept of ""division of labor"" appears in human society.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that the production team can launch a ""division of labor"" function that players can control. My simple division of labor is recommended as follows:
1. Free man: The messenger is the same as the previous population mechanism. What tools do you have and what jobs do you have;
2. Farmers: give priority to get sickle, give priority to agricultural production;
3. Lumberjack: give priority to the axe, give priority to cutting trees;
4. Miners: give priority to pickaxes, priority to mining and stone mining;
5. Hunter or warrior: Priority is given to hunting tools, weapons, armors and shields, hunting is prioritized, and only warriors can be assembled in battle.
Then allow players to set the number of occupations in addition to free people, and the remaining population defaults to free people, which can effectively solve the problem of lower production efficiency caused by AI IQ in the later period. ""Division of labor"" itself can be made into a technology in the technology tree, and once the problem of production efficiency is solved by ""division of labor"", the production scale in the later stage of the game can be further expanded, and the technology tree can be further extended to enable players to perform More production items. If the production team can ""divide labor"", even if I sell a DLC alone, I personally support it.",1628658605,1628658605,False,4,0,0.526789009571075439,0,True,False,False

At it's heart it's very much like Madruga's previous game Planetbase. Great graphics, good balance, same icons and conventions for the most part, super addicting and fun, but still about 10% aggravating due to the shortcomings of the AI. The freedom of the player to try out creative strategies is limited by the AI. For example, your Settlement will almost certainly fail if you try to split anything up into separate geographic chunks. You must place all of your farms together or you will fail or be severely limited. You absolutely cannot start a 2nd town or you are doomed. As with Planetbase, Madruga does an incredible job on just about everything... except for the AI, especially when it comes to pathing and planning tasks. Autonomous AI is not the easiest thing to perfect, especially within the context of an indie game development cycle.

An example of the AI bugginess is that sometimes you'll get a bugged plow that causes a cow, horse, or villager to pace back and forth until they starve to death and die. I regularly find villagers dying way at the edge of the map when they had no business there. Similarly, I regularly find villagers dying of starvation or hypothermia while standing right in the middle of the village with plenty to eat and plenty of places to warm up.

In general there is just too little control of the AI and it often runs amok while you pull your hair out. Villagers will aggro and disregard direct orders during battle and run into the midst of the raiders just a moment after being ordered to run inside the gate to safety.

There are only 2 levels of priority for tasks - regular and high. I think that even 1 more level would give more ability to tune the AI. It is possible to micromanage the villagers with direct orders if you run your game very slowly, and this is a good idea early game or for anything involving hostile animals or raiders. However there are some actions that you can't order villagers to do even though you really need them to do it, like using spiritual building to regain morale.

Since food expires quickly, your settlement's ability to keep surviving depends on maintaining a constant and uninterrupted rhythm of seasonal planting and harvesting. Unfortunately this is where the biggest limitation in the AI can be found: The way that farming tasks are assigned seems to ignore where the villagers are actually at, so the only strategy that won't fail is to keep all farming in one area and avoid long narrow strips of farmland. You want your fields to be at least 10 plants wide.

As other reviewers hinted at, once you start getting into it you do get the feeling that you're learning to game a set of AI rules. Though there is still plenty of room for creativity, in several key areas there is one right way to win this game.

In general they went for a simplified UI compared to PlanetBase, slimming down the options menu to just a few items and dumbing down the reporting interface such that only 5 metrics can be tracked on a graph, and only one at a time. The lack of options to control which events do or don't slow the game speed is a bummer. I would prefer to shut it off for regular rainstorms (not blizzards,) and turn it on for traders.

Regular storms add little to the game because there isn't really anything you can do to react to them and prevent them from killing random villagers with lightning.

Raids are fun except that sometimes the raid warning doesn't trigger until the raiders are already inside of your base. Other times it warns you when they're still halfway across the map. This is either a bug or just infuriating design, not sure which. There's also no way to control when that warning happens - for example you'd think that guard towers or dogs would give you some visibility perimeter but they don't.

Similarly, sometimes Trader warnings are so late that the warning pops up and then immediately disappears as the Trader is already leaving town and no longer available for trading.

The AI of the wild animals though is great. Older animals will distance themselves from their pack, and predators will target and kill and eat them. Occasionally you'll get to watch a pack of Cave Hyenas get their asses handed to them for trying to attack a herd of Muskox. Generally predators will only attack when hungry and overall the likelihood and frequency of animal attacks feels somewhat realistic - bears will usually run away even if they could easily kill the villagers... but occasionally if a hungry bear crosses paths with a child it might decide to attack it. If a villager runs away from a bear during a fight, it's likely that the bear will also run away so it doesn't follow the simple aggro/not aggro pattern that most games use.

Overall I'm having a great time playing Dawn of Man and would definitely recommend to anyone who liked Planetbase or Banished.",1625939293,1628046205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The content stopped updates stopped and the reason given is basically that this game was experimenting for them and they are now moving on to more experimenting. Devs claim 4.5 years of development which isn't even that long for a game, especially if you consider that is often whiteboard and technical alpha's. If I had known the devs saw this more as an experiment aka if that was clear from the get go I would have prob not backed it.

The progression feels to me at least, as if you can reach the iron age but only with your pinky toe, I am not asking for castles or anything or keeps of any kind. But having hunters use horses to mount and chase easier so prey doesn't keep escaping for instance. Or since you get attacked maybe some motes or traps around the walls. 

Currently I would say the game lacks:
-correct balancing
-expanded modding
-several buildings to fit their ages
-basic roads
-A lot of iron age buildings and progressions

As people will now at least know what they are getting into and the game still being fun even if unfinished I do recommend it but get it when it's like 10€ or your regional currency w.e.

======================Old Review=============================
I love this game.
It adds some nice spins on things making a sorta City Sim with RTS elements.
Though I do hope they will keep adding more things as I do feel the content is still a little on the low side.

I would love to see things like making of roads to increase speeds and make that could make the movements look cleaner and less chaotic and perhaps at one point that they might use horse to hunt as well or perhaps to travel to far away monoliths.
And a bit more buildings would be great as well like windmills or a butcher so that meat can be used for more then just drying. Which they are working on adding more buildings.

Pros:
-City Simulation game with a twist.
-Survival elements.
-Seasons and actual passing of time.
-Modable (though lacking)

Cons:
-cannot use second screen while there is nothing to do so basically just have a movie or show running there.
-Low on replayability (currently) if you did all 3 scenarios.
-cannot access options once in-game.
-The messages for being low on tools or housing can become quite spamming when you are already working on fixing it but things can go slow but you get them every 5 seconds basically need some options for that to either reduce them or turn them off.

1. There are female/male young/old animals. If there is so much specification, then there should also be option to manage them specifically. Need something like: slaughter all the old ones before adults; or slaughter all the males at ratio of 1:4. I think remove the female/male and make the animals reproduce by a multiplier will just be better in general. I literally saw my villagers kill my female adult cattle before killing an old male one that's pulling the cart.
2. Cart and plow needs a global setting instead of clicking or double clicking to select the animals that are allowed on the cart/plow.
3. Prioritizing the tasks also have problems. They just do not get priortized even I set the tasks to priortized. Ex. I priortized my barley fields since the animals need straw for winter, but my villagers are like, ""nope, gotta milk the cow first"", ""nope, gotta harvest wool first"", and then by winter, they have nothing to do and starve to death. There should also be priortizing for hunting and taming because if they are out of food, I want them to hunt first before other less important tasks such as collecting sticks. ""Yea, i'm really hungry but I will go collect sticks instead of hunting for food.""
4. When events like blizzards happen, there should be a control to recall all the villagers back to the village. I hate how they are just going out to do their normal tasks, especially the far away ones such as going to the megalith stone. They will go and just die of hypothermia.
5. Running. I do not understand why would villagers default walk when they are dying of starvation/thirst/hypothermia. If they run, they can just make it back to the village alive.
6. There should be auto attack on the enemies when they are inside the village. There should be an option that let player set to attack all enemies within x distance of y buildings. Otherwise, a hoard of hyenas can just walk in my village and my villagers won't do anything until they attack them.
7. Villagers should be able to estimate how much food/water/sleep they need before embarking on a task. Because currently, hungry villagers will set out for long distance to megalith, but they will just turn back half way because they are hungry, or even worse, they die of starvation.

There is a need for some defensive buildings and weapons, but on NORMAL difficulty  you outnumber the Raiders, and the mechanic only serves to reduce your pops - sometimes; or, more importantly, to take time out of a busy season.
The tech tree works on accumulated tasks, which is unfortunately easy to exploit: Having played through the game once and unlocked the second challenge, I am much more aware of how to gain 'points' towards the next tech: Build 3 mortars for grinding flour, for example, and you will gain another 'point' - the fact that you don't need them is irrelevant. Discovering the tech progress screen has reduced the game to a box-ticking exercise.
But almost all games suffer from this - player vs programmer: Once you have decoded the mechanics of a game, you are basically exploiting loopholes: You are playing against the programme, instead of being immersed in the imagination of the developers, and, of course, your own imagination. At this point a game is merely a puzzle to solve rather than an artistic, or imaginative, experience.
What exemplifies this is the lack of connection to individual pops - there seems to be no specialisation, and no therefore no empathy for any particular person. When a pop is killed by starvation, or a wolf, or a disease, it is only a statistic - and in any case a decrease in population means that the algorithm for pop vs food surplus will ensure a new recruit before long.
Overall I would say that this is a very promising game, and you will probably get your money's-worth with one play-through, and I found the gentle pace very therapeutic (although it is possible to speed things up I enjoyed watching my village slowly develop). 
You'll enjoy it once, but there's not enough emotional involvement for repeated play-throughs.

PS Just finished second play-through on the newly unlocked map. This game is still hugely enjoyable, but I still think I stand by everything I have said above (the second play-through was a repeat of the first with longer winters). 
A brief note about 'empathy' (see above): It is. of course, impossible to care about all 100-150 pops in your settlement, but one of the benefits of adopting a sedentary lifestyle (possible due to food surpluses as a result of domestication of plants and animals) is specialisation. In human history, this process enabled the development of specialists (potters, metal-workers etc.), which the game depicts. But  it also enabled the development of a new political elite: Gradually the Elders of nomadic culture were replaced by hereditary or elected Chieftains and a political/religious hierarchy was slowly established - caring about all your pops may be impossible, but managing a few powerful characters could add an interesting dimension to what is basically an enjoyable but rather one-dimensional experience.",1625820786,1626165586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is an interesting concept, however at this time in its development, I can't recommend it to anyone at any age. I believe games should provide one with the sense of fun, excitement, and some sort of accomplishment based on the games mechanics and in-game achievements. This game has an overwhelming feeling that anything you do is an extremely slow chore even at 8X speed. The AI needs to be totally re-written from scratch. The mechanics are absurdly awkward at best. Every map generates too many congested mountains with very small camp areas with hardly any open plains in sight.  I spent most all of my time staring at computer monitor waiting for things to get done and watching the AI fumble. 

------{Graphics}--------
👎👍  It's acceptable. Any toaster can run it


------{Difficulty}--------
👎 The AI problems made the experience difficult to accept. It can't be changed. It's terribly flawed


------{Bugs/ Oddities}--------
👎 Lions, Bears, Rhinos, & Hyenas pass by you within only a few meters.  They are hostile at times and other times appear friendly 
👎 Can get very annoying watching the AI slug along and forget its assignments

It's relaxing to go through the ages, managing resources, inspiring to see the village sprawl and unfold. Lots of planning to do from era to era. I've encountered a few tough trading decisions. AI pretty generally makes good prioritization decisions.

[spoiler] I made it to the end of the first section of the game, sans 1 milestone. I had a population of 173 at the highest, was making steel, killing raiders, and living the high life. A couple factors came into play all at once that wiped my game out. First off, tools have durability. I didn't realize this, as I followed the tutorial and automated as much as possible. This resulted in my all my bronze sickles breaking. Now, as my stock of sicks was shrinking, my metalsmiths were making swords, axes, etc, instead of focusing on what I had the least amount of at the time: sickles. Now the game doesn't notify you if you're running out of something until to you get to like 5-10% of what your desired target it, so by the time I realized I was out of sickles, it was FAR too late to do anything about it. So now, my crops, which are my main source of food, aren't being harvested. This caused mass starvation, which caused mass deaths, which cause morale to plummet, which caused people to work even slower, generating even less food, and now the downward spiral of doom is complete. An interesting side note, as the population shrinks, your animal population will explode, because now you're people are so depressed they're not even slaughtering the extra animals for meat even though they're starving. The game definitely needs to rethink it's prioritization, and maybe offer some other options for the player to manually prioritize. So I went from a population of 173 to 36 in about 2 in game years. Anyways, fun game, but it's not an A+ title. [/spoiler]",1625635933,1625635933,True,26,1,0.699997842311859131,0,True,False,False

It has a well thought out tech tree  which has a lot more of the seemingly boring but additive tech that was needed compared to Civ. 

It is quite engaging although  I think I would have liked the various terrain as it applies to the game better explained when I moved on from the tutorial. 

It is quite enjoyable and you quickly feel inn the game so I was on some level actually worried when an animal fled while hurt about the animal and why my people gave up like bad hunters ... 

The menus are nice and detailed and you can get information about  just about anything. The one thing I would have liked is there to be more of a useful command menu always visible as what is is more informative. 

The help section is useful but there again it would have helped to have help relevant to the task you were attempting come up in the box.

The most major change is that any worker can do any job. Helps offset the often-annoying constant assigning of job roles.

It does play as a polished game, but the main reason this is a negative review is that it doesn't feel complete. The game lacks any sort of objective outside ""just expand"" and a lack of random events and interactive features ends up making this game a chore to play a few hours in. 

I praise this game for an innovative style, and it's challenge for survival. The food mechanics, in particular, are enjoyable as they need to be done right to survive. But it suffers due to an overwhelming amount of repetitive tasks that make me hate the challenge of providing for my village as later on all I feel I am doing is constantly optimizing my hunting zones, or timing the harvest of my farms correctly so my people don't sit around and watch the crops die. People will say that this should be expected from this game - but a few hours in and I argue it's just pushing a few buttons every little bit and then waiting to time the next one properly. 

This game really needs a narrative introduced to it - or something that makes each villager special and have a story. The player needs something else to do besides constantly slightly adjusting timing and zones. Without it, this game is practically a sandbox - and that's the state it is in now. 

Developer is done with major updates, which I do think is a mistake as I feel this game only needed a bit more love to improve it's player retention massively. I don't generally have a problem with this developer - as far as indie studios go Madruga is not bad - but leaving this in its current state is a mistake and unfortunately will have it end up in obscurity, and other games will take it's innovations and do it better.

Playing this game has mostly been a positive experience, and I'm excited to see where this game goes! However, the few, infuriating complaints I have are listed in the end.

If you've played the AoE or Stronghold series and you're the type of person that likes to build up your economy/skills/traits/military before going out to take out the enemy, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. Your focus is not on taking out an opponent, rather, it's on developing and maintaining a settlement which relies heavily on things like infrastructure. Make poor choices and your civilization will suffer (or completely die) from ailments such as starvation (look below for my personal complaint). You have to ensure you have enough food, resources, happiness, and yes, defenses as you will be fighting of raiders that get sequentially more difficult to beat. Practice care in growing your community because anything else will mean a quick and disheartening end.

Pros:
-EXTREMELY engaging
-Difficult in a unique, infrastructural way
-Satisfying to build a civilzation
Cons:
-Difficult in a VERY unique way
-Learning curve can be relatively steep as you'll learn little pointers long after you've gotten the hang of the game.

Now, for my critique. As stated previously, my experience with this game has been mostly positive, however, the few complaints I do have are significant. For one, the human AI is quite ridiculous. I've played a total of 3 games and each time, my settlement has died out due to starvation. Now, I understand that poor infrastructure and negligence towards the care of my people will most definitely lead to this end, but I practiced extreme care in my last game consistently maintaining <100% tasks and focusing on food before I made any advancements towards civilization. Regardless, at certain peak points, my people would randomly stop collecting food and engage in menial tasks (like collecting more sticks, logs, and stone when my storage held far beyond my set resource limits). This would result in a spiral of deaths by starvation and the ensuing funerary care would completely upset the continuity of tasks. Most of the time, by this point in my games, I would have domesticated a decent measure of animals, but even if I order them to be slaughtered for food, the humans would continue to collect sticks, logs, stones, and everything else that I have specified NOT to be a priority. By the time I am able to micro manage specific individuals to kill/collect my slaughtered animals, my civilization is too far evolved and any humans that survived the famine would be killed by the next raiders. Again, I played VERY cautiously (no building upgrades/new buildings/new ""projects,"" etc. until task load was low and food was plentiful) on my last game and I still could not keep my settlement afloat. I might just be a noob, but I managed each game (even on my first) to get my population somewhere between 115-140 humans. I don't understand why they keep dying off randomly.

Also, PLEASE make a medieval version of this game!!!! I'll figure this one out one day, but for the future, MEDIEVAL!!! And after that, any interesting era in time!!!",1625123179,1625123938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels like to me that unless the guys have the specific tools for it (Whether or not there are available tools for the job you need done) they decide to simply say ""naaah Screw that. Someone else will do it"" and if you're unlucky enough to get all or most of your townsmen who say this and suddenly you can't get anyone to gather 2 stones to finish the 1 production building you need done to make food. Even if you select them and rightclick to try to tell them to do something they tell you no. 

This would be fine IF there was a way I could actually choose what tools each one had. But you have no control over this. My last 3 hardcore runs died because of this. Apparently you have to essentially remove ANY OTHER thing that they could possibly want to do to get them to do what you have set to ""Priority"". But even then i've had a few of the townsmen stand around ""Idle"" instead of doing the priority thing. (I did have tools for them to use). I even went into the task menu and tried to remove all the other ones and nope, they just pop back up and the townsmen choose what they want randomly within the list. One of the runs died because ""Nah, I wont go hunt even if you tell me to because this tree looks interesting even though i'm starving!"" and ""Nah I wont plant/harvest the land even if it is set to priority because moving this large rock that was given wheels 1 year ago is MORE important!"" and the only way to get them to stop is to deconstruct the transport but they'll do that over planting food too. 

This last run I needed 4 straw to finish a blacksmith. I knew a raid was going to come next year and I needed to finish it and make weapons. Prioritize the blacksmith and prioritized the fields. They literally did nothing in the fields. Try to tell them to gather stuff in summer. But can't prioritize this to get straw and I can't manually tell anyone to harvest it. They only do 1. But even with the blacksmith prioritized, they decided to use it to repair a house. Thanks guy. Next year, raiders came and killed them all. They 100% deserved it.

The game is a pretty good balance of using resources and needing to be active to find food and everything while trying to find ways to gain knowledge levels. The fact you get the points by 'doing' and building stuff is a lot of fun and I love it. It pushes you to go hunt everything and build multiples of everything. But the inability to ensure that priority jobs get taken care of means that everything boils down to luck and if you get that unlucky choice you get stuck and there is nothing you can do but watch the time tick down until the next raid arrives and kills you.

TL DR: The basic control of the people is horrific that once you start getting a lot of things that have a constant flow you just have to sit back and hope they will do what you need them to do or just tell all 30-150 people in your town to only do 1 thing at a time to keep workload low.

Also unlike Planetbase this game is less forgiving. In Planetbase you have a smaller amount of items to collect for production to survive. In DoM it's a bit more complicated which makes the game all the more enjoyable.
Understand this is slow moving. There is no 'build it and forget it' type gameplay. You have to keep a close eye on what your villagers are collecting to ensure you don't come up short come Winter.
I'd suggest playing a game with no real outside threats. just build and collect supplies to get the hang of it. From that point on you can tackle a much more challenging scenario.

The downsides to this game are mostly excusable because I understand a game has limits, but I want people to know what to expect. I feel there is a lack of buildings; one or two more hut/home options, like even just a bigger home, would have been nice. And more decorative buildings/plants. Also either a path or road, or just organic pathing. The mountains are completely traversable which doesn't make much sense. The villager ai needed more work.

For a genre so over-saturated (Which genre isn't, these days? Not a bitchy typical gamer complaint...such saturation is very minor symptom of a platform that allows for a comparatively eclectic array of developers to offer content without a publisher), there's a novel enough theme to enjoy Dawn of Man and stick it out to get one's money's worth. 

The whole prehistory-iron age thing hearkens back to playing Empire Earth (barring that few similarities)  as a young kid and sucking at it and every other strategy/rts/4X/etc due to having a useless, dumbass kid brain. As an adult, the genre and all of its sub iterations comprise a large portion of my gaming...so, while not a pro (If you are considered a pro and you don't make money...you need better time and energy allocation) I am certainly experienced enough to find anything overly derivative to be taxing to get through.

Aspects of this are certainly derivative, but that's literally every game. I don't think people would love a game with entirely alien concepts and mechanics as it'd leave players befuddled and frustrated  (especially those who delude themselves into thinking learning a game or it's mechanics fast is indicative of intellect, particularly if all opinions/ideas/theories/beliefs are entirely unoriginal and adopted) ...So for fans of Banished, I know it's a basic bitch qualifier, this is certainly worth the money and Id recommend picking up. 

If you haven't played banished or some game attempting refinement of its concepts....You probably aren't reading reviews for this game or looking to buy it. Even my wife has heard of banished and shes like soooo bad at knowing all of the cool guy (nerdy and very uncool) things I love to productively utilize my time with (irresponsibly waste obscene amount of hours with)...Maybe this has/will be a great intro to the genre for some, although I wouldn't say it's an ideal start. Not that it's notably harder than similar games, maybe a bit slower and could turn some off before they develop an appreciation for the gameplay. 
I enjoy it, whereas my ""average"" review seems to be: 
=> buy 
=> play for 30min-2hr 
=> say 'Ok, word. That's fine' I'll circle back 
=> never circle back => rarely consider bad enough for refund and always think I'll get back 
=> Up at night realizing if I refunded 'fine' games, I'd have a clean looking steam library and tens of thousands of dollars more...

...but mostly the library thing is why I randomly may start screaming in my sleep. ""Hide games"" exists, sure...but I'd much rather keep going to PTSD support groups and steamroll people's actual terrible events to monopolize the discussion with my""steam library is messy"" story which, between tears and toweling off a sheen of crying snot, is about 45 mins.
That's my concise review of Dawn of Man! All of that is imperative to your decision to buy or not. I'd implore you to meditate on this before...
unless it's on sale, in which case do what I do ""Buy everything until you and your family's accounts are drained, excusing it with ""but we MADE money with how much I saved"" and belligerent refusal to understand the concept that 'saved during sale' is different from 'money made'"".
 If anyone sees through the ruse, break down, cry and say your gaming is a debilitating addiction and not your fault, make sure to have a deep, personal and heartfelt discussion, look into their eyes.

We should be able to click on tasks we want to send to the top of the task list or give an order of priority to each individual tasks.
Also, items that are equiped (such as clothing) should not appear in the surplus supplies. would make it easier to determine how much of an actual surplus we have.

Gets quite tedious. Especially because of the AI. And the raiders are just insanely powerful.


EDIT: 
Played again after over a year of not touching this game...
AI STILL sucks, among other things. I put harvesting the crops on high priority (nothing else on high priority) and half the harvest season is gone and they have harvested barely 1/3 of what needs to be done (I have enough tools, and they already planted them so enough people present obviously). I then remembered why I had unistalled the game and proceeded to do so again. Workload is also total bull, especially when they often carry ONE item at a time when there is space in their inventory for more (once again micromanage those moronic asses to carry to their limit). They walk all the time and so FUCKING slowly too.
Tedious does not begin to describe this game.
And Why the hell would they go hunt by themselves??? (I put the highest limit possible, 5, but still they sometimes go hunting in like a pair or a trio and get attacked by a pack of wolves, bears, etc... Feels like there is no cooperation. Also when you manually hunt, tedious yet again, you need to micromanage the crap out of them for them to attack close to at the same time...

So much potential, yet so little effort. 

Pros:
- Easy to get into
- Litte to no bugs 
- Systems kinda work and interwine with each other
- Kinda addicting when you're new into it

Complaints :
- The game itself is way too slow. When nothing is happening, you just sit there for 5 minutes waiting
- You cant micro efficently, you cant assign specific task to people - very much of the game is decided by braindead AI, you get to macro this stuff inefficently
- Children age way too slow. In the lategame, when you've reached iron you'll get attacked by 50-80 raiders at once. It is unavoidable that 2-8 die occasionally. They leave behind their children, that just wont age. Over time your population becomes younger and younger, and at some point 70-80% of your population are useless children (Ive had a game with 90/130 children), that leave your crop to die. 
- Prestige System is boring and uninspired
- Trading is uninspired
- at larger populations your people get really inefficient due to their walking distances
- AI of your people is really bad
- Combat AI is unusable - microing is almost a must
- You dont really feel the impact of migrating people and prestige
- Not enough building variety in each Age 
- No playing against AI players
- No multiplayer - coop and VS could have been great

Conclusion:
It's a great game for an evening or two, but the games bad lategame balance, lack of buildings and really slow speed takes much away from replayability. Is it fun for a moment? Absolutely.

Short answer - yes.
Longer answer - yes, if you enjoy being rewarded for planning out your city and sticking to it for a few hours.

The game does great what it sets off to - it creates this amazing feeling of growing a tiny group of stone age people into a bustling town of hundreds of peeps with steel weapons/tools, composite bows and mail armour.
It feels like it is very slow, but as you will spend most your time on x8 speed, it actually is not that slow (you won't hit iron age in 30min by no means, but it won't take you 40h either).

There are some things missing, tho. Not really missing, just things I wish were there, to make this a game I would play for hundreds of hours. (I am basing this review after doing a full playthrough from Stone Age to Steel, getting first 10 milestones)
First - the map is pretty big by default, at the start, I thought that there might be other tribes there with me (the Raiders, or the guys that trade with me), but that was not the case, sadly. 
That also ties in with my second thing - I wish migrating to a different area on the map would be plausible, as it stands, you either have to inch your way, building tiny settlements every 20m or your population will diminish and die out. Even more so, I wish you could kinda ""pack up"", either just with your people early on, or with a big line of carts full of food, materials and such. To move to a different area on the campaign.
Third - if this game, in the same manner, would go on to continue up to early medieval times and have the things I mentioned earlier - this would probably be my favourite colony builder.

Still, it is probably in the top5 for me, overall a good 8.5/10.",1623448251,1623448251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
858810,93573938,76561199121411887,0,3,8457,0,5217,1692580181,"The game as it stands now has very little replay value. It does make up for this with the amount of time you'll have to invest in expanding your city and unlocking knowledge to better survive, and it's brutal if you go in blind - at least that was the case for me. From that point on, it may be most enjoyable to the achievement junkie.

The balancing is off at some points. Especially in terms of your population. You may have heard that players have experienced a ""population cap"" which by all accounts shouldn't exist, especially with how easy it is to lower and sustain a population by simply removing houses and waiting for old age. My personal limit was 300, followed by very convenient lightning strikes and starving citizens (despite granaries at every corner of my city stocked with food). I spend a few hours trying to breach 300, but to no avail. To be clear, I had an average of about 1,000 units of food which never dwindles, 30 houses unoccupied, and no jobs outside of the walls with the max amount of every required tool - and then some. All with no issues in performance and not a single frame dropped.

But if you're less interested in attempting to crash your computer and more in playing how its meant to be played, the cost of this game is fair enough, though I highly advise waiting for a sale. It is worth mentioning how slow the game will be for newcomers, but there is a good chance you'll get lost in the shuffle and sinking hours in. I personally don't have much experience with city builders, but I'm happy that this was the game to serve as my introduction. Although I have been told that there is a considerable lack of building options. This hasn't affected my experience much. But if you like a lot of variety, I would wait for more content updates.

All in all, Dawn of Man is fun. Though it does need a fair amount of polishing and additions for long-term players, it has a lot of potential and I very much recommend for the patient player.

The fauna will change with you, in the early game the map is populated with all sorts of extinct megafauna, f.e. Mammoths, cave lions and woolly rhinoceroses (two kinds of rhinos actually), along with living animals, f.e. horses, reindeer and muskox. Hunting these animals is fun, but the game also acts as a virtual safari of a world that no longer exists. Just watching these wonderful animals is very enjoyable. As you progress through the game you gain new technologies and your society slowly changes into a complex agricultural society with its warfare and monuments.

The warfare is a little lacking, groups of raiders appear on the map which will head towards you. You can't raid them (as far as I can tell).

It also has a decent learning curve, the first scenarios lets you settle in learning the game in a land with plenty of food and ore to mine while later ones can get real tricky. Though ones you learn how to play surviving a raider attack will be relativly easy. The first time other humans decide to raid you´re pathetic village though its intense, its then that you´ll finaly see whatever you´re network of food collection and farms are strong enough. The same with you´re first winter, being illprepered will end the game for you. All that said the game might have its challanges but its not impossible hard to survive and thrive making it a good difficulty according to me.

The best thing i can say about it however is the developer, ive not played anything from them before, i don´t know if they have made other games even. But they are damn dedicated. The game still recives regular updateds often with new stuff and mechanics added in to give the game added depth.

Great game, played in quite interesting eras of the human species (stone age through to iron age).

I like that you control a small group of primitive humans and have to build a settlement to survive the environments - and to defend your tribe against wild animals and attackers from other tribes.

You can craft different tools and build a variety of buildings and structures, such as production facilities and defences, in free-build mode. You can place the structures almost anywhere and rotate them depending on your needs.

You advance in technology levels while playing the game. The more knowledge points you collect, the more you'll advance.

The gameplay is laid back and relaxing and it offers you plenty of time to build and craft at your own pace. You can play it in two modes: normal (easy and relaxing) and hardcore (more difficult and larger attacks from raiders - if you want more action).

The game is great ""as is"". A fully functional game offering hours and hours of fun and enjoyment.

If you read in the forums, you'll probably notice threads about ""the devs have left the game as they saw it as finished"". 

[b]Yeah? Keep reading...[/b]
The devs only stated that they don't work full time on it anymore  - and [i]probably[/i] will release minor updates only in the future. This doesn't mean that they wont work on the game ever again. Especially not if people keep playing it.

Don't let this scare you off. Besides: The community is rich in continuous modding content (maps and scenarios developed by content contributers), which offers many hours of additional gameplay. I'm one of them and have just released my first scenario-mod here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494229328&searchtext=]Scatinavia[/url]

So, would I recommend people buying this game? Well, of course! I've been playing it more hours than I can count. And I enjoy it so much, I decided to become a content creator.

The tech tree takes forever and after you get farm technology like crops alot of the animals disappear and you are stuck with rather boring harvesting fields. The early yrs of this game are great.  Graphics are great and controls are easy to learn.  Combat later in the game is terrible but the game really isn't focused on that.  Be aware that if you try to start a 2nd encampment somewhere else that the enemy will attack there first and many of your people will run from cover and get killed out in the open at the second settlement.  I lost half a villiage that way after hours and hours and hours of building them up.  So the game has some down points.,1621695542,1621695542,True,11,0,0.650923669338226318,0,True,False,False

This is one of the better city builder concepts out there. The game is already engaging--I can't wait to see what  other ideas are in production. A few notes: the pathing of the villagers needs some work. They will often go out to a field, cut one crop, then return to the city for a different task which is completely inefficient and if there is a way to command them to stick to one task its not clear how. Raider behavior needs some attention as well. They often run inside the base, oblivious of the mob with spears that they need to run through to get to a tower or some other target. Same with animals. You can run a pack of humans into a group of animals and they wait to be slaughtered. When they scatter, they remaining animals return to where they scattered from just to be slaughtered. The needs of the villagers can also get annoying. Villagers will travel 99% of the way to a target, then decide they want a different type of shirt and return all the way to base instead of toughing it out and finishing the task.  Basically, the devs have some work to do, but its all fixable. Overall, solid game.",1577559846,1621649835,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game allows you to grow your settlement through historical time periods far before most other games allow. Controls and basic idea are relatively easy to grasp, and once you start to navigate your menus and whatnot it becomes easy to do the necessary bits. 

Pros:
+Total control over where you start your village and your overall progression.
+Graphs and information exist to help you predict events and needs in advance.
+Fun to play
+Each settlement you complete can be as different as you like.

Cons:
- Can take a while for city plans to come to fruition
- Should probably consider your first playthrough a ""test"" because you will make mistakes and things may progress in ways you did not anticipate quickly enough
- Extremely touchy work/labor percentages make completing big projects a hassle (but on the plus side, this is kind of like real life so + for realism?)

*PROS*
- Easy to learn, hard to master; resource management becomes increasingly difficult as your tribe progresses. 
- A well thought-out system of progression (but also see cons)
- Hooks you in for quite a few hours

*CONS*
- (Where to start, really?)
- Becomes quite tedious after a while; gather food/wood/stuff, plant/grow/harvest, hunt/kill/butcher/process and such becomes quite a bit of a drag as your tribe grows
- Lame way of gathering ""knowledge"": so let me get this straight... I get my tribespeople to gather 15 more sticks, and now I can invent masonry? How does *that* work? Speaking of which...
- Strangely structured technology tree: I can choose to either spend my knowledge points on learning how to build walls and other fortifications or... I can learn how to build a menhir, which is a very large stone standing upright..
- No advanced resource management: resources still have to go through the same storage types late in the game, when you're dealing with more of a 'supply-chain' as early in the game, when resources are just stored and then used. 
- No updates to speak of in a long time: sure cheese making is nice, and the plow was a good thing, but other than that? It's been awfully quiet.
- No real culture: the people of the pre-historic era were no complete muppets who only looked for food, sex and a place to sleep. They had interesting cultures of their own, with some traditions and customs we still have today! You can't really move your tribe in any such direction.

However, after 4 playthroughs to end game I can say that, although this game is fun, it lacks content. There are basically 3 tiers of buildings and that's it, with a few buildings like ""cheesemaking"" sprinkled in between. As someone who has worked in the industry, I can say that is abysmal, especially for a game with building at it's core!

The Devs have announced they will no longer give major updates to the game which is a shame because I think a lot of people wanted this to be more and the saddest part is, it still can be. The developers did an amazing job on this so far and has easily surpassed the failed game ""Banished"" which was made in the same style but again, the game just isn't finished much like Banished was and I fear Dawn of Man will meet the same end.

The game needs variety in buildings, different sizes of buildings for more or less people, more fortification options, a larger tech trees that gives minor benefits to gathering speed or tribe member health, more tools like scythes, bags and baskets. Small improvements and quality of life stuff, the bread and butter of city builders/colony sims.

Later it's payback time and you go after them and anything that dares coming even close to your village while you rule over vast fields and build elaborate monolith structures to please the gods.

edit: I have revisited the game after almost two years and played through another game. It's still a neat game with interesting mechanics and a lot of things have been tweaked and improved and they've also added a couple of new resources and production lines, which is neat. That said, my original assessment is still valid. It is neat, but once you've established your colony there isn't that much to do.

My problems with the game are following:
-Both tamed and wild animal AI are weird - random wild animals may casually walk in to your settlement with tens of humans not only walking around, but are passive towards eachother, this is just plane annoying and dangerous. On the other hand, sheep and other farm animals (excluding dogs since they require no stable) may  wander out far away from the settlement into the forest spending most of the year there, and then not finding its way back before winter. 
- Without workshop Items, I would definitely not enjoy this game at all, the base map you get at the start of the game is OVERWHELMINGLY ****.

While I was playing I kept thinking this was still EA. My first play thru was 8 hours. Review text limit is small. Guess they don't want you to go into detail.

Another disappointing game where your people starve to death while working/idling.

Pretty boring, played at 4x or 8x, takes forever to get anywhere. You just mostly wait to get research points. 

Not enough wild animals to hunt or simply they don't drop enough. You constantly need furs for everything. Game suggests you mostly just kill old animals, that's fine, where are they? One here or they is not working. By the time I got half way thru the second age, it was hard to find anything to kill or tame. The food spoils, need animals to hunt. Houses constantly deteriorate and need furs to fix them.

Trading is a joke. You have to pay a lot more for less. Seen this too many times in too many games.
 
You have to constantly give orders since villagers just prefer to idle. Than when you give them orders to do something they get upset and lose moral making them even more useless. You can't even tell them to use the best gear, you have to hope they do it on their own, which they don't. They won't even wear clothes regardless of how many you have in excess and they will starve to death while working.

Game doesn't zoom out enough. At max zoom, you're bouncing over hills. Rotating the camera is weird, I found it really annoying.

1 small squared biome is all you get to play on. Gets boring fast.

I just felt my whole play time was just barely keeping my people fed and housed. This game is all about struggling to get anywhere.

I personally enjoyed this game for what it was but I would hesitate to recommend it. It is not terribly deep, with a very limited catalog of buildings and a very short time line. I really like the idea of a civ game that starts from the dawn of civilization, but I feel like this misses the mark a bit. 

Advancing through the ages does not do a whole lot. The game just doesn't change that much. Going from the Neolithic era to the Copper age, you'd think, would entail all kinds of changes! However, the only change that seems to emerge, other than a handful of new animals that you can tame, is that raiding parties have two or three more people than before.

It is engaging, well researched  and nicely paced. I was especially impressed by the care in reconstructing  ecological environments, and also in working out the impact of technologies  - the game is very much about the need to balance demographic growth with resources and prioritizing tasks.   All aspects of material culture are nicely done, with accurate graphics.  There is however limited room for choice, everything becomes very linear and almost automatic, so this is not a game to play many times over, perhaps two or three times in different locations/landscapes (the only real choice that matters).  This in part is a result of the major weakness of the game, which is that the social, cultural and political aspects are simplified and idealized (see below) massively, by contrast with the economic and technological aspects. There could be different marriage customs and festivals, for example, instead of having  economic man 100%?  In two things the historical depiction is deeply flawed. We know that historically male and female roles were very different in many of these early societies, but the game treats both sexes as basically identical for all the possible roles (including pregnant women).  The other big problem is that during the Neolithic and the Bronze Age social hierarchies became very important, with slavery for example... this is totally neglected. There was leadership, there were chiefs and shamans and aristocracies. Not every individual was capable of doing every specialized job by the later stages. There was human sacrifice too. In fact I could say that this is the version of ancient history of a utopian socialist, projecting unto the past a gender and social equality that never existed.

I'd first bought this on sale, and uninstalled in less than an hour. Gave it a thumbs down.

Got it on sale too - less than $20 - and I feel like I could have done a lot better for my $20.


I decided to reinstall, and play some more. After all, I hadn't progressed much.

The only thing that progressed was my level of frustration - and Frustration is something you'll need to get used to if you play Dawn of Man. 


The game feels more like one of those Early Access mistakes. You know the ones: the game publishers abandon the project, but they want to make some money off it, so they release the game as ""Early Access"". It's not done, it's full of bugs, the AI is terrible, but they release it anyway. So frustrating.

I will try to categorize the frustration, listed from lowest to highest. 


Watchtowers - if I put guards in it, they just come right back out... I have to put the whole town on alert, then the guards will stay in the tower - but then the villagers who are working stop working because the town is on alert. If there are only 5-6 raiders, as few as 3-4 villagers with bows can defend my gate - if they stayed in the damn tower. Frustrating.

Equipment - a villager can't drop it, can't return it, won't exchange for something else; they can't do anything but keep it in inventory forever... and there are only 2 inventory slots for tools. 

For example, a villager equips a bow to go hunting, then a knife to skin what they killed... it would be great if they could equip both at the same time, instead of getting a bow, making the kill, then returning to town to get a knife - but hey - the damage is done, they have a bow and knife equipped. 

You can't make them trade their equipment for an ax to chop down trees, or a sickle to harvest crops... they just wander around until there is something to hunt or skin. So frustrating.


Stables - there is no way to store straw (food) inside, and the AI tells a worker to put 1 straw inside, though I have 100+ on haystacks... so every winter, several animals die of starvation, even though there is plenty of straw, I just have no way to feed them. So frustrating.


Sleds & carts - sleds are called ""sledges"" in game for some strange reason... but, that I can get used to. What I can't get used to is why the AI will just leave them lying around, and prioritize their use for silly reasons.

For example, a villager will walk across town, pick up a sled, walk outside to the pear tree... now, understand, that there is only 1 resource to harvest (i.e., 1 pear), so why was a sled even brought... then, the villager decides they're hungry, so they head back to town; the sled is left near the pear tree. Now... you would think the villager would just eat the Pear, if they're hungry, but nooo... they go back to town to cook a dried fish. 

Then, the villager goes and does something else, and the sled just rots. Super frustrating.

Even worse are the carts. I can attach a donkey, so the villager can transport more resources, more quickly, and doesn't get so tired. That's great. But then a villager will pick up a donkey cart... and pick up 1 grain from the granary... to go to the mortar to make 1 flour... then abandon the cart to walk to the fire pit to make 1 bread... and my fields, granaries, mortars and fire-pits are literally 1 pixel away from each other. Not to mention, there are 30+ breads already cooked, sitting in storage. There are meats and fish, fruits and vegetables, all stored and ready to eat, but nooo... the AI tells the villager to use a donkey cart to pick up 1 grain. Super frustrating.

For example, a cart should be used to:
carry 4 meat, 2 skins and 2 bones back from a distant hunting trip
carry 6-10 stone back from a distant stone quarry
carry 6-10 wood back from a distant forest

Sadly, no carts are ever available, because the AI gives cart priority to: 
carrying 1 milk to the cheese-maker (and why carry 1, when 3 are in the queue)
carrying 1 wool to the outfitter (and why carry 1, when 5 are in the queue)
carrying 1 straw to the stable (and why carry 1, when 20 are needed; the cattle are starving, I get messages that they are dying of starvation,  I have 100+ straw 1 pixel away from the stable... and the AI uses a damn cart to carry 1... then abandons the cart).


I thought it couldn't get more frustrating than that. I didn't know true frustration until I advanced to the Copper age. I gave up after I hit the Bronze age.

The reason: Clothing.

That there are even multiple types of clothing is frustrating; the way the AI will prioritize changing clothes beginning with copper age is beyond frustrating.

Before the copper age, villagers wore whatever was handy: skin, leather, wool - or, nothing in the summer - if they had no clothes in winter, they made wool clothes or went into a hut to stay warm. They'd also wear wool clothes in the summer, and didn't seem to mind at all.

Once I advance to copper age: now I get messages that there aren't enough linen clothing for everyone. I don't see why this is a problem, but... OK. fine. 

I research flax; I plant flax; I harvest flax; I build more weavers and outfitters... it takes a few years, but I finally have enough wool clothing (for winter) and linen clothing (for summer). My population is around 80, so this was no easy task.

And the reward for my effort: now, my workers will walk toward a task... then change their mind and go back to town to change clothes... then head out to do another task, maybe pick up another tool, then change their mind about that task and go back to town to rest, then wander around not doing much, unless I micro-manage them by assigning a task that they can do, based on the tools that they have... and then, the season changes, and they go change their clothes again.


If our neolithic ancestors were this narcissistic about clothing, none of us would be here. We would have gone extinct pretty quick.

The game has no real shortcuts it takes time to build up your population and settlement, fairly slow paced and relaxing for the most part but once you have gone through researched everything made everything once you have experienced most of what the game has to offer the only other options you have are harder difficulty settings and alternate start locations on a few maps and the challenge mode, thankfully the steam work shop has other maps made by people for a bit more variety.

Just make sure you only issue a few building orders at a time or the AI will prioritise your new projects over there day jobs of gathering food, farming and maintaining the supply lines to production buildings, to the point where they will start to starve themselves to death working.

Only bugs I encountered were some very minor path finding issues, as in I had to demolish a building for them to be able to get to and build something else, despite the fact they managed to decon the building just fine to ready it for rebuilding.

Only real gripe with the game is the reach X population milestones on the maps.

For example say your need 150 people living in your town, your nearly there say 10 people to go, BAM lightning kills someone, then an infection or a disease claims someone else's lives, next an animal attack kills someone else, then more die repelling raiders and then the biggest head ache of them all old age just when everything is going well your nearly at that population milestone lots of migrants in groups of 1 - 5 at a time suddenly 10 or so old people die, wiping away all your gains from the migrants.(consider of your 120 or so current population nearly 60 of them are old people, who could die at any moment, stealing your hope of reaching the goal)

Now imagine that scenario happening in varying order, every dam time your near that population goal, decades going by.

I, as a lover of history and student for Prehistoric Archaeology, highly love this game. Bought it about a year ago and spent about 50 hrs ingame, unlocking all Milestones and thoroughly enjoying every aspect of it.
mining my own metals, creating an economy that actually works and serves my tribesmen in order to prosper, generating surplus on goods that do well when trading for technology, dealing with predators and raiding parties, giving order for new huts, storage buildings or crafting areas, constructing megalith structures and grave yards - all that keeps my attention while the game speed is anything but overwhelming, but smooth and still encouraging me in order to set goals for the next project.

I recognise that the developers keep adding new content to the game and bugfixing on a regular basis, which encourages me to hit back to the game and try newly published features and modulated maps and scenarios.

______________________________________________________________

still, there are some points on my wish list that I'd love to see to be additionally implemented:
- possibility to raid/attack other settlements on the map. situation now gets pretty dull after you hit iron age and finally finish the tech tree. what about going on attacks (which certainly has been proven by archaeologic sources that more or less organised war existed since at least neolithic time 5500 BC in Europe), raiding other cities on the map, which is only used up to 20% by the active player. maybe just small outposts, to gain control over more parts of the map. maybe a bigger, fortified city, competing with the player over map control, prey, metal ressources, and so on.

- different tribes and cultures, in different environments and play style (mods do cover that partially, i.e. map environment)

- Add more ages:
> Paleolithic: Mousterian (no H0mo Sapiens in Europe at that time, though, and solely hunter/gatherer), Aurignacian, Gravettian, Magdalenian. so called 'stone blade cultures'.
> Copper Age: add pile dwelling structures (housing?) that may be placed ashore lakes/within lakes. horse domestication unlockable.
> older/younger Bronce Age, maybe burial sites may vary ingame, that go outdated when aging up? cairn/tumulus unlockable.
> Hallstatt age (older iron age in Europe, solely iron weapons/tools unlockable ingame?),
> La-Téne age (younger iron age in Europe,  maybe unlock steel weapons and stone walls/gates in that age?).
> add more megaliths on the map. I love them henges and dolmen.

- as spreading out on the map is likely resulting in you loosing some tribesmen due to hunger, thirst or frosty temperature, building outposts on the map should be an option. some of your tribesmen ought to be set to stay in the newly built outpost (maybe a main building, town centre?), and not wander back to the main, starting area. that'll make it easier to establish new villages, them providing for themselves off the newly gained land.

- getting attacked by predators or raiders will interrupt your current plans, but is a welcome change of attention. there is a button to sound alarm that urges all my people home immediately. I want some additional features for that: I want to set a marker where my armed people rally for defence manually (at what position, which gate). I want to determine how many people shall pick up bows/slings and mount the walls in the process, and how many of my people shall pick up swords and shields, while the others keep building/crafting stuff. like the way how you set production limits. furthermore, I want to quickly select people with hunting weapons, best via a quick key. draw a box around several villagers, press a certain key or UI-function button in order to select all villagers with spear/bow/slings, and send them towards predators or raiders by single right mouse click.

- multiplayer-mode, quick start game mode. please, please, please!
2-4 player- maps w/ equal starting positions, co-op mode or combattants fighting for supremacy and/or victory points (generated tech points, housing, people, structures built/ wonders built, raiders/predators killed, tools/weapons created, edible food in storage, etc.)

However, the AI is really dumb, and can ruin your game pretty quickly. I''ll explain.  

Example: My people were low on food, therefore, I traded for food from the trader. I expected my hungry citizens to grab the food and start eating, but boy was I wrong. Not only did they leave it on the ground for half the season, three of them had the nerve to die of starvation. 

And while all of this was going on, my village had a bunch of grain, but absolutely refused to use the mortar to make more flower, even though it was the only job marked as high priority with a limit set to 30. 

Now my workload is sky high because of the loss of people in my small village, and not enough to tend to the fields. More end up starving due to the lack of yield from the crops, and half the population is gone within a span of a year in game. 

All of that could have been avoided if the AI would have done the basic survival thing in a survival game, eat. 

And while I get that the citizens could have been performing work tasks, you would think that if they are dying of starvation, and there is food on the ground, they would stop what they are doing to eat and then continue with their tasks. 

The AI seems to ignore some tasks you set as HIGH priority, specifically making grain and leather. You could queue up 10 in each and set as HIGH priority with everything else set to normal priority, and the AI will still skip over the tasks, constantly. 

This game has a lot of work to do in regards to the task and work area mechanics.

Its a very pretty game.  And well paced.  The controls and game mechanics are solid and easy to understand.   I're really enjoyed it BUT...
there's no campaign.  despite minor changes in the sandbox maps it will play out EXACTLY THE SAME WAY EVERY SINGLE TIME.   There is zero variability in the clans.  they will look alike and sound alike and not demonstrate any individuality whatsoever.   You'll proceed through the tech tree almost exactly the same way every time.   There is no specialization at all.  You will hunt animals, then add some crops, then add live stock.  in the mean time you'll defend your village from random attacks and eventually move some big rocks around.

There is an almost completely unassociated ""campaign(?)"" that has you leading various animals across maps.  Other than the maps are the similar to the ones you might plop a village on, there really doesn't seem to be any link between the migration mini-game and the city builder

providing villages with a little more distinction would be huge - maybe digging a bit more into spirituality or totems that make a village better at something or weaker at another task.    Allow villagers to specialize and get better at tasks.   Or actively trading with other villages, or raiding other villages.  or using boats on rivers or lakes.  a lot of potential that is really not explored.    Available mods seem to center on a few custom maps.  It was nice to see the cheese making update in Nov, but the whole game begs for more.  There's a ton of potential here.

DoM took my interest with its unique premise, which is being set in the stone/neolithic age, where you control a small group of hunter/gatherers and have to expand your tribe and research technologies, etc. This is unique amongst other city building sims as barely any games go for this era and setting, with the only major game I can think of around this time being Far Cry Primal.

In this game you hunt great stone age beasts and gather natural resources to expand your tribe, protect your people from dangerous carnivores such as Cave Bears, Wolves and Big Cats and become more technologically advanced. You can hunt Woolly Mammoths and Woolly Rhinos once you have enough people and the game looks very nice visually. The graphics are great and you can become pretty immersed in your tribal living. The character models are well done, as are the buildings in pretty good detail. The animals too look great along with the scenery, which you will be constantly surrounded by.

If you're looking for a fast paced game, this is not for you, as the game can be quite slow at times as your tribe just goes about its daily life. You can progress through the game by achieving milestones and unlocking research points to learn new skills, such as animal husbandry or thatching. The timespan goes from the stone age up to the iron age, so there's quite a few techs to research.

There are several big problems with the game, however. The largest and my biggest grievance with the game is the AI. While not 'bad' per-se, the AI doesn't know how to prioritise tasks. The greatest problem that arises from this is that the AI will not hunt for food when you're low on it and instead gather mud from a riverbank or haul a stone around, meaning your settlement will stave. This problem also extends to the individual people. They can easily die because they don't eat, drink or sleep and there's no way for you to tell them to do that. This is also a problem when it comes to fighting off raiders. Several of your people can attack them one at a time away from your settlement and just die, which is a massive waste of manpower and can easily destroy your settlement as you'll then not have enough people to run the settlement.

Do I still recommend DoM? Yes, of course! The game is a unique, fun experience to get immersed in this early part of human history. The AI is a problem, don't get me wrong about that, but they work most of the time well enough, and there's always a workshop scenario that can remove raiders or increase the amount of people you get to mitigate this. The game looks visually brilliant and there's enough to do to satisfy several playthroughs of the game.",1615805593,1615805593,True,12,0,0.599153041839599609,0,True,False,False

Like your animals will goble up all your straw, the straw you need for repairs and building towers despite that your animals do eat grain as well. The game just dont give you the player the options needed to properly take control. Some times wild animals will wander into your village, early on this is fine but as your village grows it become strange in the end to see wild animals walk into your town to attack the player. Raids help switch up the gameplay a bit, setting up a defense seems to work pretty good, but towers go down pretty fast to small numbers of raiders making it cheaper to keep gates open and just charge your attackers.

I really liked growing my village, farming crops, managing animals and placing down walls, gates and towers. I have yet to reach the final age and the developer might fix the straw issue so i will keep playing this for a while even tho there is limited content here.

However there are some major issues - intelligence of your villagers is just horrible - whenever they are attacked by animals or raiders, they just ignore it and die one by one , if you order group of people to attack said enemies, then they 90% of time just walk a few steps and then just scatter around and go away, again getting killed one by one. To this is connected the issue of walls - they are useless and work more like a fence - when you spend YEARS building proper palisade,with immense amount of resources, just to have it destroyed by few thrown spears, by raiders, against whom this is supposed to protect you - its not really worth it - and just butchers any logic behind it, in both game and real history. Another problem is , how some of those resources work, one for all - meat...you have to dry it, to be able to eat it - not cook it - so if you are low on food, and just hunt a lot - its useless, you have TONS of meat and your villagers are too stupid to cook it and die from hunger (not to mention, that hungry person would just eat it raw - implement some penalty or smth, but having it the way it is now is just retarded). Last issue is replayability, which probably is not high, since it seems to be all the time the same, just map differs - that is not much.

This game can easily consume all your waking hours. Highly addictive.

Just as the title promises, you start in the stone age with a small band of people and limited resources. As you progress throughout the game, advancing in skill levels and Ages - so does the difficulty level of keeping a population alive. 
You've got Cave Lions, Heynas, bears and wolves all competing against you for the resources at hand. They won't hesitate to attack and kill members of your settlements. Later stages, Human conflict (computer generated Raiders) comes into play, just as it did in history. 
Start in the Stone Age and end (currently?) in the Iron Age. Along the way accumulate Knowledge points and Milestone points to be used to increase skill levels. There are 2 Difficulty levels (normal & Difficult); two modes of operations (Settled & Nomad); 3 Levels of Game Difficulty in addition to 4 Bonus Challenges.
Micro manage your civilization or set them on auto - allowing them 90% of free reign to complete already established/learned tasks.

It makes me think of the opening levels of the original Age of Empires but just extremely zoomed in and granular on every mechanic. So instead felling trees to produce one generic resource (wood), you now have many types of tree that can be harvested for many types of resources (wood, various fruit, nuts, tannin). Hunted animals give meat, bone, skin, all of which can then be improved and crafted into higher value products. In some ways this reminds me of the step-up in complexity between early historical RTSs like AoE and e.g. Stronghold, where one has to build a whole production chain of fields, windmills, granaries and bakers to get bread. This is all very rewarding and a bit nostalgic somehow (though I didn't live through this era so I'm not sure how that works). I also like the way it's not super high intensity, it just potters along with your people going about their lives, but can be sped up to make things happen quicker if that's your bag. 

I hope the devs continue to add features, and/or consider a sequel with terrain deformation capacity - building ditches initially, evolving into major hill forts would be a great end-game goal. Some kind of day-night cycle would be visually appealing also, with differing activities over each 24 hour period - e.g. a need to set torches/ and guard for animals/raiders around your camp etc, although this would potentially affect the passage of time in game and might get a bit strobey on x8 speed!",1614866880,1614866880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Your hunters with follow the animals so far away by time they kill the animal half your people have starved to death.

3. You cant put your farm on any slight hill even if realistically you could.

5. You cant cook meat on a fire you can only dry it which i just find stupid.

pro's :

Easy to get the hang off, difficult to master.
Not too punishing when you make mistakes, you can come back from them most of the time.

cons :
Lacking in long term gameplay and replayability.
after 44 hours, I've done it all, and the other scenario's are just the same on different maps.
too little visual variation in buildings, only few have different skins/looks and it is only 1 or 2 extra.

Mixed Review: Reasonable game. Lacks challenge and replayability. End-game is dull.

+++ SUMMARY +++
In my first playthrough, I set the difficulty to Hard, and started a Hardcore game (no pausing). I had expected to fail. I had expected this game to be as challenging as Planetbase. It isn't. Its easier, and in my opinion, is kind of dull. This is my sort of game, and I don't normally not recommend games of this type. If there was a 'Mixed Views' option, I'd have ticked it. 

My concluding thought is that: ""I've played this game through once. And I don't feel like it's something I will ever want to come back to.""

+++ IMPRESSIONS+++
The early game is of Dawn of Man is great! The wildlife is threatening, and I have to carefully micromanage the activities of the actors in the game to ensure they have enough food, clothing, and tools to do the jobs they are being assigned. Every hunt carries uncertainty. Those first few winters are tough. Every untimely death is felt, and running at 1x speed feels like it's too fast to keep up with.

By the mid game, most tasks can be automated, and the player can ramp up the game speed; 2x, 4x. The role of the player is to manage more of the overall strategy of resource production, while directing the slow build up of technology points towards the growth of the civilisation. The threat of hunting falls away as the more threatening ancient animals fall to extinction, and my technology advances. As I take a step back from the micromanagement, I find myself distanced from the plight of the actors. Deaths, diseases, animal attacks, and other events cease to become significant as the population grows, a feeling that is comparable with other games of this genre; Banished, or Planetbase. 

By the end game, I'm playing the game at a constant 8x speed (maximum), and it feels tediously slow. Every event that drops your speed to 1x is frustrating. At one point the game prompts ""You should build defences, the raider attacks will be strong"". They are barely a hindrance to my settlement. Walls? Towers? I don't need them. My technology and population easily vanquishes every raid. I spend my time scouring the landscape looking for additional monolith stones, now so far away from my settlement that my actors cannot reach them without first dying of starvation, thirst, or cold, and that is frustrating.

I've completed the milestones, and the technology points keep coming, and In the 17 hours I've spent on my first game, I feel like I've exhausted the possibilities that this game offers for play. My growth is halted. There isn't quite enough variety in the late game to keep it interesting. As I said at the beginning, I just don't think I'll ever come back to it after this first playthrough. 

+++ POSITIVES +++
All this said, the game has many nice features.
* The environment is lush and verdant, filled with wildlife and terrain variety.
* The seasons change the land, and it's well done.
* The harvesting automation is simple to follow with the work areas.
* The 'resource limits proportional to my population' feature is excellent, more games should carry this feature.
* The 'view associated resource limits' button on each production building makes it very easy to manage.
* The game has a lot of resource types, and it is manageable, because the rate at which you unlock them means you can deal with each in turn, without being overwhelmed.
* The way animals can be hitched up to carts and plows is satisfying.
* The placement of farmland in non-square fields around other objects gives a dynamic and natural looking feel.
* The buildings look pretty good, and it's fun to place them, particularly the roundhouses and huts, giving the settlement an organic feel as it grows.
* Most of the game animations for the work tasks are nice to watch.
* As the game is largely not-threatening, it's nice to explore the town, watch the people work, and use the zoom-in camera to see what's going on.

+++ CONCLUSION+++
This is a reasonable game. It is reasonably priced. It lacks replayability, so I don't feel like I'll get my money's worth out of it.

There are some cool unique features, like allowing you to customize your UI to show you  the information you want to see, where you want it. Also changing your view to a sort of ""heatmap"" that highlights and color coordinates resources all over the map. It was a fun playthrough although I don't see a reason to do it again yet.

It is not a challenging game. After about 5-6 hr I left the game open and went to sleep. The AI is also not very bright and will starve to death without trying to get food. Also putting something as ""high importance"" does not help it get built faster, or first as they would still go and put 50% resources in other buildings and thus not have enough to finish the one I marked. /shrug
The actual annoying part is that I have about 80 pigs/goats. I am trying to save straw for buildings so I want less animals to feed. I have literally spent YEARS trying to cut down on my pig/goat population. My people spend half a year to kill 40 goats, the next half year harvesting/working, then the next killing 40 pigs, and by that time there is 80 goats again. Even telling the game I want goats/pigs to only be 50% of my population (should be 40-50 each) they still swell out of control. I also tell my village to stop collecting bone as that has 0 use late game, yet sure enough *I* spend half a year going through my storage deleting bones they continue to collect. 

For $20-25 its fun for a romp. Hopefully there are some tweaks and more content in the future. The difference in spawn choices don't seem to make a difference in having different resources and thus different challenges. But like I said, if I can go AFK for 8-10 hours and come back to no issues, that just speaks to how little of a challenge there is and how little of a threat ""raiders"" are.

EDIT: After 2 years I revisited the game and am not impressed at all. 
You cannot AFK anymore, since you need to tell your people to prepare to defend an attack.. OK. 
1) There are just weird mechanics.. For example, building walls into natural formations like mountains is pointless because there is always a gap to squeeze though. So need to connect the walls at all corners. Deal breaker? No, but an example of simple oversights. 
2) The AI is still incredibly stupid. 
a) My guy took a sled with logs to go build a wall, he gets there and decides he is too tired and heads back to town. Another person comes up and takes the sled with all the logs on it back to base, to load it with meat that is finished drying, to move it NEXT DOOR to the storage.. Completely disregarding the 3 other empty sleds just feet away. 
b) My people are constantly dying of starvation despite having 2x more food than population. WHY? This has been an issue for years... If people are vegetarians or something, the game needs to tell you.
3) The gameplay loop in general is meh.. You get Knowledge points for building something the 1st time, then maybe 5, 10x, etc.. varies on the item. You need these points to progress, so you find yourself building stuff you don't need yet, just to progress. Makes no sense for a city/resource management game to waste these resources just to farm points to progress.
The tech tree itself is underwhelming. After 10m of watching your people be stupid, just to farm you points, you unlock things that 50% of the time do nothing - they are just needed to progress to something else. So enjoy sitting there doing nothing for another 10m. 
There comes a point where your city is pretty big, and food is no longer abundant. But then your people die because they don't eat, then you need to scale back your workforce to compensate, just to grow again and watch people die. 
My counter to that was to make more farmland so people have to travel less and not die from walking for 30 seconds - and put it on high priority (the only thing on high prio). Workload still under 100% and guess who is doing the high priority work? 0 people and I have plenty of tools to do it. 
Which brings me to another ""minor"" point, as I unlocked better tools and such, I don't see any effect on the work being done more efficiently. 

There are tons of other similar games that are more fleshed out and just.. makes more sense. After playing again for another 10h, I don't see the need to play again until another massive update because no matter what scenario you pick, it is the same waiting game of farming the same points for the same underwhelming unlocks.",1551718213,1611948797,False,0,0,0.592500805854797363,0,True,False,False

Highly recommended for anyone who's interested in strategy games or city/civilization building games, it's rewarding, exciting, and immersive. I see a lot of people complaining about the game's AI, but honestly I think it's more of a user-error problem, once you get a feel for the mechanics and learn some strategy, you'll understand what to do and what not to do (for example, don't use hunting areas, just learn to micro-manage your hunts or go after big game that fights back, and keep your workload below 100%, or as low as possible).

PROS:
- Game only lags when auto-saving. And I have a 2012 MacBook Pro (8GB RAM), so that's saying a lot. Otherwise, the game never lags or slows down, even when you get huge populations of 300+ people. 
- Tech tree is much more extensive than it initially looks. Most techs are very useful and will really help your settlement grow and prosper, unlocking new resources and farming techniques, etc. 
- Game always constantly evolves and keeps you on your toes. Even though at a certain point you're mostly just fast-forwarding through the game, your still need to keep an eye on resource levels, if anything gets low it can end up being disastrous. 

CONS:
- New Settlements: As you start needing more and more resources for a growing settlement (flint, metal, stone, even wood) you have to send your population farther away for these resources and they'll eventually end up starving/freezing/dehydrating to death trying to get them, which seems to indicate that it's a good idea to build a new settlement or two, also for space reasons. HOWEVER, this is where the AI really, really needs work, and this almost always causes your civilization to completely collapse. It seems like the AI doesn't distinguish the settlements as being separate, and all this does is massively increase the workload, as the AI seems to prioritize tasks that are closer to the original settlement, so for example, everyone will go to work on fields close to the original settlement and only once those are completed, it sends everyone to the new settlement. This takes a lot of time of course and makes it hard or impossible to successfully grow food for the new settlement, and then everyone starves to death of course. 

- Mass Resource Degradation: Some resources tend to be made in large batches when you first unlock a new technology, especially clothes and sledges, carts, and plows. The problem is that they all then seem to degrade after a fixed amount of time and the result is that one winter, you have a mass surplus of warm clothes, and the next, you suddenly realize that 30 people don't have warm clothing and you don't have time to get it made before people start freezing to death. It would be more realistic if these items degraded over a random period of time, so that you never end up with half of your clothing supply degrading over the course of just 1 or 2 seasons.

- It's just about survival. So you create a large and prestigious settlement, work through the ages, arm your people with steel swords and chain mail and banners and then... what? Except for the occasional party of raiders or traders, there's no one else out there, making new settlements will just collapse your civilization, and there's nobody else there to attack, or conquer, or trade with. The developers have created by far the most realistic and entertaining early settlement strategy game I've ever seen, but it falls short by not including a key feature of most other games: other players. It's just about survival, and making sure you always have a resource surplus. I can't help but imagine how fun the game would be if it really created an impetus to expand and interact with other civilizations, fighting for resources, conquering enemy settlements, creating trade routes, etc. The game has soooo much potential, and I hope the devs have something in the works that would take this game that extra mile, because it deserves it.",1611532174,1611532174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels like a mix between Age of Empires and Banished. You start out with a small settlement hunter/gatherers and your goal is to expand your settlement and to develop your people to multiple eras. During these eras you unlock more stuff to build, like farms, watermills, and iron mines. You can domisticate animals to use for farming and more. I loved this development aspect a lot. At the same time you will go through some hardships of prehistoric life, harsh winters, attacking animals and later even raiders. The gameplay is a lot of fun and it requires plenty of micromanagement. The only downside is that the AI can be pretty bad at times, people starving while there is plenty of food etcetera.

The graphics remind me of games from 2005 or something, a bit dated. But it doesn't really matter to me. I like the soundtrack a lot.

Everything you wish was done right in production chains in other games is done right in this game.   Lower tier production is invariably higher volume output so that you don't end up with the classic 'pyramid of support' problem having to have 4 low tier producers for 1 high tier one.

You are able to set thresholds on production items universally which automates that side.  The raiders are a constant but manageable threat.

This game avoids many of the obvious early pitfalls of every other town management builder sim and I've probably played them all from Banished to Universim - and it's rich on features.

There's very little to no customization or personality in the sims themselves, so it is far more on the Forest Village, Banished end of the spectrum than the Rimworld/Kenshi end.

1.  Huge waves of enemies.  By the time you get to the iron age, the developers just throw massive waves of enemies at you.   These Zerg rushes lack any strategy, or sense, and have the magical power of being able to chop through 3' stone walls with axes and swords.   This just wears you down no matter how well you make your defenses.

2.  When a structure needs repair, but isn't broken, it doesn't function.   If they don't have repair materials, you can't fix it.  If it's your granaries, you village collapses through starvation even though you have plenty of food.

3.  You have no effective way to prioritize your building.   For a building/God-game this is flat-out crap.   Time-and-time again important things (set to priority) are ignored while they work on some lesser thing.   If you want to see a game that does this well, Oxygen Not Included is far, far superior.

4.  Crops.   Oh boy.  You're stuck growing huge amounts of grain.  It all has to be planted in the spring and harvested in the fall.  If you don't plant huge crops of grain, you can't raise animals as they eat the straw.   These huge plantings will spike your work-load.    Also, if you get attacked during planting or harvesting toward end-game, the attack takes some much time out of the very brief seasons that you don't get your harvest/planting in and suffer a food crisis.

5.  Hunting.  In the early game, they drop animals on top of you constantly.  Especially predators that can kill you.  By end-game, it's almost always a huge-trek.  Problem is that you can only hunt in the winter without dramatically effecting your crop planting.   But if you do, your toons freeze to death in the blizzard.

6.  No difference between bronze and iron, except to spawn larger  and better armed enemy spawns who are able, as I mentioned, perfectly capable of chopping through 3' thick stone walls and damaging your granaries so you starve to death because your toons can't be bothered to repair them because you can't change the sub-standard priority-system  to get them on that important job instead of, oh, do something not important, like fetching that megalith they'd been dragging around before the attack.

EDIT:

Put in 18 more hours.  They did a few tweeks.  But nothing fixes the inevitable slide into starvation as you're raided every growing season by huge bands of enemies.  Sure, I've got chainmail, steel, double-thick walls, guard-towers everywhere and I've cut the % of population that melees from 50% men, 30% women to 30% men, 10% women to cut back on the melee casualties...

But with the constant waves of enemies I either can't harvest or can't plant.  My animals starve to death and my 100+ population village (100% built up at this time) is now down to 61 people after the last raid as my sick and starving population couldn't repair the defenses (and I run a tight perimeter) in time for the next horde so I lost a good 20 there.

And, of course, I recognize the death spiral.  There is no way that village will be able to repair all the damage, get all the crops in and then fight off the next wave of 30+ chainmail/steel weapons barbarians.

EDIT II:

This is a typical spiral-into-death scenario caused by the lousy AI.  Everything is going mostly ok.  I'd say great but the people won't put on winter clothes because of the shitty AI so I lost 10+ to hypothermia that winter.  Plus I ran out of straw and for some idiotic reason I can't feed grain to my animals even though feeding grain to animals is what we do IRL:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352368323


I get raided right after this.  And inevitable town death-spiral starts as the people DO NOT PLANT ANY FOOD DESPITE THAT IS FLAGGED AS HIGH PRIORITY because they're too worried about bringing in a monolith to build a low-priority issue.  See the empty fields.  

The village was down to 71 people before I quit and re-uninstalled this broken-AI game.

This review will be concentrated on the game developer's created content and not the Mod community.

To boil down the theme of this game while contrasting with RW; Dawn of man feels like a slow Bullet Hell where you never get to feel clever about the management of your settlement as RW does. 
The micromanagement that RW has, makes the player eventually feel clever for tweaking the multitude of dials to get to the point of reaching the end game or at least the continued survival of the settlement. If set-up by the player initially, RW can get to the point of having fun with the chaos of fighting against everything the RW developer has thought of as the player masters the game. DoM has less of the micromanagement and the consequence is that you are asking yourself what is the point of playing this game? It's to the point that as a settler dies for whatever reason, you don't feel any level of responsibility for their consequences.
The greatest thematic tension of DoM relies on is the food supply for the people and the domesticated animals, which leads to a marginal decrease in population and not something to fear. The same problem in RW would be a significant set back that would cause the player to fear not surviving the next raid or natural disaster.

Recommendation for the developer
- Focus the game's theme away from a civilization grind. I want the choice of a brutal game from the beginning.
- Pivot to a Age of Empires like military conquest by including multiple enemy/neutral NPCs on the same map (Generally better option because of lack of AoE competitors and the map is already too big for the single settlement) 
OR 
Copy Rim World and make the extensive tech tree and do the anthropology history angle, as already developed upon, and blow us away with the struggle of mankind through the ages while being educational. Let the player micromanage everything. (A better option to fill the unfilled niche of RW clone that is historically accurate.)
-Expand the duration of the seasons.
- Double-down on the spirituality and the need for people to celebrate ancient/pagan holidays etc. 
- Add Engineered paths/roads.

For $24.99, DoM is not worth the money and needs more time to bake.

The tutorial is simple and the gameplay likewise can run basically on auto or you can micromanage to your heart's content to squeak out every little bit of efficiency.  It's very easy to step in and get going but takes a little time to master the finer points which, once accomplished, allow for much greater control and effective management thanks to an interface and task assignment system that is elegantly implemented in its simplicity and functionality.

The first game you play will seem like it's all too easy but I assure you that as you progress, the game offers all the challenge you can handle and will at times have you anxiously watching to ensure that the harvest comes in without a problem or that raiders don't show up while you're upgrading your city walls or that a blight doesn't wipe out the animals that pull your plows.  These events or, at times, disasters, occur regularly but not predictably, adding much to the risk versus reward element of your settlement's growth.

This is the experience that encapsulates this game for me.  I had my camera looking down from the top of a mountain peak, letting me see my whole village of about 70 or so people at the time, as well as the panorama of the surrounding peaks, the broad lake in the center, the sky and clouds off in the distance.  Fall had just begun, and the harvest was beginning.  I could see sections of crops being brought down in the distance.  A herd of aurochs came close to the edge of my village, in the corner between the wall and the lake, near one of the three pear trees I harvested every summer, as a way to mark the the season.  I could see the stone circle at the foot of the high mountain peak to my left.  I thought of my pleasure in it.

One slip and dang nab it you've set off a chain reaction heading straight towards extinction. Survival shouldn't be easy of course, but it should feel more like a village effort. Dawn of Man takes that into consideration.  But don't mistake that for being easier or boring.

There is a third, but if you don't mind using different controls than other games then you can ignore that. Meanwhile, everything else about the game is amazing. When I bought it I assumed it wouldn't have too much replayabillity, but I was for the most part wrong. I would like another game mode or two added, but that's about it. One game lasts quite awhile, and if you like this kind of game then you will likely want to play at least a few games. Which seems worth it to me, personally, for it's price. I do love that they added a challenge mode, though.

I also end up losing a lot of children, because again, the AI loves to wander off and have children pick up animal skins lying in the woods from a dead reindeer or whatever and the next think I know I get a notification that a child was gobbled up by another damn cave lion. 

Your people are smart sometimes and will bring two dogs, and three humans to hunt down a mammoth, which the ai is very effective at even if there's two.

If you look past the lackluster visuals, Dawn of Man starts kinda great. It gives you a sense of accomplishment for the smallest thing. A skull on a pole, felling a cave bear... baby steps that feel like giant stride.
Your tribe then advance through the eras. You learn a few new tricks, master what was once hard up until this pivotal moment... agriculture. In Dawn of man it means the game from this point on, will only sporadically need you. It will appreciate if you could plop down a building or click on a new tech every now and then, but will mostly go on on his own. DoM made me feel like we were playing multi for a while but then the game decided it would be more efficient if he did it all by himself. I could still watch tho, choose occasionally where to place some big monument but he would take care of all the little things...

Here's the problem. Taking care of the little thing is what you do in city builders, It's the genre roadmap. It would be Streetfighter letting you do everything except the fights.
And don't get me wrong I have absolutely noting against more contemplative gameplays. I am more of an Anno than Factorio fan. I don't mind period of relative inactivity while you watch what you built live and wait for the next problem/expansion desire to come up. But DoM takes it a whole mile too far.

The game simply runs out of gas way too fast.
Expanding serve absolutely no purpose, and the Ai which is oh so efficient at managing a centralized settlement becomes you undefeatable opponent if you try to create satellites.  
Techs in the latter era have absolutely Zero ""ooomph"". They feel like passive buffs that let the Ai do what it does even more effectively.
The survival elements become quickly absolutely moot, as raiders (the late game ""menace"") are little more than an occasional nuisance to make sure you are not completely asleep.

I feel like the game would have been better served (considering the limited resource available to an indie dev) to play his strong suit and develop the early eras instead of going wide and trying to encompass structural changes in our specie that spawned hundreds thousand of years and forged the concept of civilization. It ended up so diluted that you can hardly feel the great idea that started it all",1609076710,1609077128,False,3,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False

Dawn of man offers you the chance to lead a group of humans in an attempt to establish a primitive settlement in the Stone age. Your settlement must endure threats from hungry animals, unpredictable weather and even raids from other tribes. You progress your knowledge to advance forth through the ages in your constant struggle for survival.

The individual management is non-existent as far as I'm aware, you can't select a single guy easily, and your settlers have no skills or anything. The survival was very easy and 3 guys can take down mammoths as long as you tell the first guy hit to run away. So you just kind of afk with work zones and direct workers to hunt when it's convenient. There's some artificial time gating with how little people can carry, so you hunt an animal and kids can only carry 1 piece of meat out of the 4 back, so they run back and forth for ""days"" in-game, until you can make sleds... which are a bit strange and my people would leave them out in front of a (not full) storage for long periods of time before putting the stuff away, and I couldn't order them to put the stuff away because sledges had weird UI. In general, the game's AI is bad too, which you can see from other reviews.

Not really much interesting or ""original"" in the game either... I'm glad some people enjoy, but I'm pretty surprised this game has such high reviews. The most in-depth thing seems to be hunting, which consists of you box selecting multiple survivors, clicking on an animal(s), then moving the first person they go for away so they don't die. Which is very simple. I had a huge abundance of every resource. Also, when animals attack your settlers, there's like a 10 second warning like they all have ESP... I'm not joking, it will say ""Animal is attacking your X"" as a warning, and you go to them before they are hit and walk them to safety and the animal will come in the middle of your town and be easily killed etc. It's really silly.",1608762448,1608783050,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Pros:
The game ends up looking pretty good. The town you build has a charm to how the buildings look, I got very attached to my first, which is a good sign. You're forced to build to the landscape, which always creates the nicest appearance.
The progression and challenges feel, fitting. The differing food sources become more, or less feasible as humanity drives large beasts away. The game offers milestones which, are reasonable as a guide and motivation.
The tech tree doesn't feel super linear. While naturally the same solutions end up being vital, the path through technology is sufficiently malleable you don't have to feel you're just going through a set path, you can weave around as you go.
The construction is reasonably forgiving, it's nice to be able to position things in more than four directions.
Cons;
The most important one to bear in mind, the beginning is very slow. From day one you can basically automate gathering, even hunting. So the early game is too slow. Sitting, watching, waiting for research points to learn new technologies... so you have something to do, building to plan, a village to expand. I almost gave up on the game in those early stages. It gets better.
The priority system isn't great. It's really hard to make your people do what you need. I put my fields as high priority... between the two options of high or normal. I expect the villagers to do the fields, then everything else. That's not the case. While the game encourages automating commands, it's surprising it lacks a more elaborate priority system to command your humans.
Your people are stupid. There's nothing like watching your villagers starve to death while your stores overflow with food, die of dehydration when standing next to a lake, or freeze to death with full access to woolen clothing, fire and warm houses. The majority of this, could be solved if the people had some capacity to prepare for going longer than average distances to accomplish tasks. Pack a lunch maybe.
Combat is, dull. Full credit, I like that the defenders of your settlement seem intelligent enough to run to the correct side for the incoming raiders, although given the entirety of the fight is, sit and watch them stab each other, it's not engaging... but maybe it's not meant to be. You will however, know the frustration of watching your melee defenders hugging to a gate, while the raiders break in through a wall. Which brings me to the second of my biggest issues in this game. Anything the raiders break, you need to fix, manually. An option to automatically put a rebuild task on anything they break would be a mercy. Especially for the walls.
The end goal is, vague. So, you build a good village. Functional... likely a bad harvest from starving, but you hit your goals. The game invites you to play it six times or so, and there are... barely differences between the scenarios, the game is fundementally identical, but for one or two threats being more pressing. The solutions are the same, and are as effective. There's no victory fanfare, just play till you get bored. For me, I like a more finite goal.

Dawn of Man is maybe the best Citybuilder i have played.  It gives you no limitations what so ever.

The gamplay is enjoying. You build stuf, you get research points. You build better stuf, and so on.
You can let you people prioritize what to do. At first this is fine. But wenn you hit over 150 people, it gets kinda sketchy.
Sometimes your people wont feed the animals in winter, even if it is on high prio, and capacity is 30% - 40%.
But other than that, the game is super fun and fair balanced. (From what i have seen so far)

If something went wrong (and it did especially in the beginning) it was always my fault in calculating and weighting correctly and not the games fault.

Of course there is always room for improvement – but with this game it is only minor tweaks in some automated processes that would further enhance the gaming experience. (like distance calculation – inhabitants should not take up automated tasks if their stats are under a certain low level and fitter persons are available, like butchering – no automatic slaughtering of the last male or female of a species plus cancelling of the action to assign another animal should not be ignored) 

What I found very interesting were the RL realistic developments following the expansion of mankind – f.i. receding wildlife leading to a lack of huntable food for predators which only then start to attack the humans and their settlements

If our ancestors were like that, they would not survive the first winter. Just two words - specialization and tactics. Especially hunt tactics. No way to hunt herd animals, or large, or predator animals without traps, pitfalls and cooperation! And the most important - specialization. Settlers may be universal in paleolith, but already Acheulean culture shows the division of labour and specific social roles. The game about ancient people without any skill and social development - it's a shame!

In its current state this game is just something to play until waiting for Ancient Cities.

Upd. What a shame. Ancient Cities turned to be just a deception :(

For the price, there is a good amount of strategic depth, and I have found myself playing a good number of new towns and I feel only in my last one (89 hours in) did I truly reach about as good as I could do. There are nuances to be a bit more efficient and I did enjoy discovering them.

Make no mistake, most will end up playing this game for fewer hours than me, it's not the most long lasting game and I've only pushed it this long by trying all the different maps out and trying to be better.

On the positive side:

.) Starts out very good and is mostly fun to play.
.) Good concept.
.) Not too hard, not too easy. So should appeal to most players difficulty wise.
.) Game still gets free content updates & patches.
.) Animations and the games overall “style” are mostly made with great care (even if it's not on par with time).
.) Probably an “easy to run” game while still looking very decent. 
.) You can stalk animals or your own people with a automatic “follow this person” camera.


On the neutral side:

.) Performance is ok, as long as you don't want to go over 60-70FPS. Above that you will get constant  fluctuation of frame times that are off by around +/- 30%~ to your actual FPS, so it's basically pointless.
At around 60ish FPS the game runs mostly fine. Late Game you will go to 50< at times, there are some microstutters and short freezes when certain things happen and/or are selected. But all in all it's not really better or worse than any similar games in it's category. 

.) You will spend a lot of time just sitting there waiting for your people to collect, build or finish doing whatever the task may be. So prepare to spend at least 40% of your playtime basically just doing nothing. Weather that's positive or negative is up to you.


On the negative side:

.) The AI is, no other way to put it, mentally handycapped through and through. Your people, the animals, the raiders, they all have fallen on their heads over 9.000 power levels, sorry, times.
.) You can finish the entire game within 40~hours. If you go for a second playthrough on hardcore, make it around 80h. 
.) The endgame, so last epoche, is just an epic failure combat wise. The endgame gear, especially chainmail armor & oval shields, are brokenly overpowered and make any and all defensive structures basically obsolete. Raiders will slash down your stonewalls with swords in seconds. They will destroy your Guardtowers (made of iron) with simple bows and arrows faster than a human in good armor could be killed. It's just, plain and simple put, f*in stupid. Not that it's not doable but it's still stupid as the rest of the game tries so hard to be realistically and than there is this waiting for you in the end… It's almost comparable to the last season of game of thrones.
.) The aforementioned endgame gear, namely chainmail armor & oval shields, are part of a recently released free update. So while the updates are there, they are not always good for the game either.
.) The game has an inventory system for your people that you have no control over. This is what a dev had to say about how to control the inventory:
https://steamcommunity.com/app/858810/discussions/0/1840188800794190266/
“If you want to make it in a 'super-efficient' way you can send just the guy with the harpoon to hunt so he will go for a spear and when he has the spear, then select him and the other 2 that already has spears, click on the ground to make get them together and then send the 3 for the mammoth, by this way you have 3 guys close each other and armed with the best weapons available, they will kill the mammoth in seconds.”
Sorry, but this is pathetic, even for an early access game and most definitely for a released one. (For similar results just google “dawn of man inventory”)
.) The options menu can only be accessed from the games main menu. So you can not change the volume, graphics, controls or anything while actually playing. You need to save, exit to the main menu, change it there, load back into the game.
.) Building walls sideways is a pain in the butt.
.) Some minor issues, like buildings clipping, pathing, work prioritization not working, the games freewill system that gives you flashbacks to the original sims 1 on CD ROM and similar issues that have no place in an released game.
.) Small update: Yesterday I literally got overran by raiders (on hardcore) as they attacked during a snowstorm. All of my people basically died within 30 seconds of being outside, while holding the walls, due to hyperthermia. The raiders, who walked through the entire maps and were outside at least 3min before even getting to the city - wearing the same gear as my population mind you - were not affected by the storm, at all.
The TL:DR of this is: This is a situation where you will lose, no matter what you do, because you can't do anything. Great gamedesign. 


Overall score: 
3.5 / 10
The negative, even if some of it seems minor, is just looming over an otherwise decent game slowly draining the fun away from it the longer you play.

So, dear devs:
Maybe, just maybe, instead of providing free content patches to create cheese - which is utterly useless - or implement broken endgame gear, like the chainmail and oval shields, you should start fixing your utterly dreadful AI so it can catch up to the last 20 years of technology which would fix so many problems at once. Don't get me wrong, good job on not abandoning the game and still releasing free content, but you don't do anybody any favors if the content you provide is either meaningless to the core game or worse, breaks the core game even more than it already is, like, again, with the top tier armor & shields. 
Honestly, I’m glad I never played this in early access as I can almost guarantee I would have refunded it. Simply because if this is the “finished” version, I really don't want to know what the “non finished” was like, shame.",1607458423,1607705080,False,7,0,0.617894768714904785,0,True,False,False

On the good side, the visuals are nice and it has a couple good mechanics. That's pretty much it for the good.

On the negatives, the world is static and small (despite looking large when you first load it up). There's nothing to explore and it doesn't even have the concept of ""biomes"". The world is just a small box that with nearly identical terrain all the way through. Despite it's size, it's annoying that you can't zoom out more.

From a gameplay perspective, it's hard to stay entertained after a couple hours. You end up spending most of the game staring at your colony waiting for the next tech to unlock. Once it unlocks, you spend 2 -3 minutes placing new buildings, then you stare at the colony waiting for the next tech to unlock. Occasionally,  you'll have to do something exciting like move a gathering area to a new spot or place a mine. There is literally just nothing else to do in the game.

The ""tech"" tree is basically upgrades for all of the items that you first unlock (e.g. wooden spear > stone spear > flint spear). There isn't anything cool or fun to unlock. There's no challenge to the game at all. Once in awhile you will get attacked by animals or humans, but it doesn't really matter. Your tribe will eventually kill them. You might lose a few people, but new humans will come along and replace them in short order so it doesn't matter. Eventually, I just stopped worrying about defending because there was no point.

To me, it feels like the developers had big ideas, but ran out of money and released what they had. The mechanics are there for something much bigger than what it is, but the game in its current state just feels empty, repetitive and boring. If you like this kind of game (which I do), try Rimworld or Oxygen Not Included instead. They are infinitely better.

Everything you do while playing this feels like a polished early access game, because every step of the way feels lacking or semi empty, except at the start but that's just a learning curve thing. Literally every issue I had with this game while playing, I thought... It will get fixed shortly since this is a pretty solid early access experience, now that I know it's released, development will prob continue maybe for a year or 2 then be dropped. At this point it's probably better to just start working on a sequel.

I have 13 hours on one map trying to achieve all the milestones on the first map and am still missing one (20 steel ingots)
The first 6 - 8 hours are pretty solid, I think there needs to be dramatically more variety in the Tech, to offer different playstyles, to help you feel like you are making meaningful choices, but the illusion of this Tech tree quickly crumbles when in reality it's a pretty linear experience. Oh I didn't grab the plow tech now? Prob because either I have to get one before it or because there's just one of 4 other researches that are obviously just better.
So back to the 13 hours, as I said the first 6 hours roughly are pretty solid, this was as I was getting into the copper age. I get a prompt warning me the game is getting harder make sure to be ready. This scared me so I set in the previous era for another hour to prepare then catapulted myself into copper age with high expectations, that were quickly turned into sadness. Same game, nothing changed, the raiders only got harder in the last era, and were finally getting progressively harder than. but it took 6 more hours to get there, because at this point there is a huge diminishing return in progress, because there is a huge lack of content, and because at this point you should be familiar with almost all the core systems you do probably less micromanage then you started with. Which made me realize how baffling retarded the AI is, and how desperately I needed more control over their behavior. I went from having roughly 300 food daily to 20, just because the AI suddenly stopped farming grain... I spent 3 or 4 in game days trying to figure out what was happening thinking i'm about to lose just as I get to the end just to find out nope... the AI randomly just stopped prioritizing their food supply.

Summary:
Game is actually fun for a bit but you stop having fun at some point in the second half of the game, just managing how bad the AI is and then realizing all the cool tribal stuff you thought was going to come never comes. You realize there is no rival tribes for you to attack, it's just a wave progression system.

Game becomes more scarce with each era, and food production drops when people aren't happy, so the planting or harvesting isn't complete.

I dont find myself getting frustrated with this title as I did with ""Plantbase"" and instead I quite enjoy playing this one. 

The AI could use a bit more polish as they tend to make very questionable decisions in certain situations. I frequently find myself having to micro manage resource collection when I am hunting to ensure that they pickup all of the raw meat. It appears that even if the person is standing right on top of valuable resources from a hunt, they will leave those behind if any of their status effects trigger or are close to triggering, even when improving those status effects will mean that they are going to where those resources they are standing on need to be transported. For example, if a unit gets tired and needs to sleep while standing on top of a pile of raw meat, it will refrain from collecting anything into its inventory, even tho its inventory is empty and instead return to its house, which is a waste of a trip. This can be handled via micro management while hunting, and this failure is less obvious and problematic outside of hunting as most other tasks do not drop items to the ground, which is where this problem seems to stem from.

The only other thing I feel is worth commenting on, is that I wish there were more technologies and buildings. The end stages seem to be a bit bland and most of the enjoyment of building as well as difficulty is upfront as opposed to spread out through the game. But this is not a major issue for me.

Primal vision makes location of vital resourses simple, The ability to automate production in your settlement is outstanding in order to minimize undesirable micro-management.  An easy game to which one can lose several hours of time without realizing its passage.

My only real ""wish for"" in this game is for a more controllable Raider experience.  The Raider AI is not the greatest and raider incursions are straight forward, head first charges into the first defenders encountered.  It would be nice to be able to designate where villagers should assemble for defense against raiders instead of ALL defenders not stationed in towers congregating in just one location (Prior to building gates).  In my perfect Dawn of Man world, I could also arrange my defenders according to weapons carried so that archers could be behind melee warriors and tactics could be applied as opposed to your defenders bum rushing the mass of raiders.

All in all, the game demands that the player actually manage the growth of their settlement by not overbuilding or rushing to new epochs as the ability to sustain your villagers with needed resources can be overwhelmed by overpopulation i.e. growing your population faster than your ability to feed and/or cloth them.  Poor morale is a real bummer.

Lastly, community mods can create scenerios that can be really challenging.  Starting a game with only 1 person equipped with just a wooden spear and a piece of flint for a knife will a real test of survival.

It's a very well balanced game that gives you a bit of everything in just the right doses, I know fans of the more large scale city-builders may find leading a group of cavemen a little underwhelming but for a me this is spot on.  I was a big fan of the early settlers and cultures series of games and this is the closest I've ever gotten to finding a modern reincarnation that not only lives up to those games but also surpasses them in most respects.  If I were to make a complaint then I would say that the combat system is without a doubt the weakest link, the raider attacks are a good idea and exciting at first but prolonged gameplay leaves you wanting more, especially once you have your settlement established and stabilized.  I don't know what's in the works as far as the combat system is concerned but I would love to see other settlements (eg. raider camps) spawning on the map which would move the combat system away from its current defense-only role, which is a shameful waste of all the weapons my glorious economy can produce.

Pro:
It has a nice theme of early man working against the odds.

It has (or had) regular meaningful updates every month.  Though apparently adding cheese now counts as a monthly update so its getting lazy I think on that score.

Nice ideas around crafting.  Flint/bone and then metals as you progress

Nice ideas around tech tree, but could use a little rework there I think now as its progressed.

It hooks you in to the scenarios and levels. all are quite different challenges (northlands etc) 

Visually pretty good, and a nice 'lazy sunday' game

Cons:
Maps are not random in any way, and gets boring regarding that.

The AI is AMAZINGLY rubbish.....Swim to catch a x, oh he swam back, i know ill swim all the way to the other shore and then back, oh he went that way ill go home and wait for a dog, oh the dog runs to the hunter, oh nah he changed his mind, the dog runs elsewhere, oh no he is hunting again run the other way oh no hes unhappy now cancel, oh no its fine now for some reason.

AI again, kill anything in the water and 99% of the time the kill will land on the bank and either not be harvestable or will need manual harvest flag setting (cant die in the water of course, 'cause that would make sense)

Raiders are obsessed with towers, you can literally build one in the middle of nowhere and they will flock to it ignoring almost everything else.

Walls are pointless for the most part. Building your settlement for a long time to see 5 seconds of a couple of people with sticks destroy your stone walls is just rubbish.

In summary......Its a good game for the most part, but AI AI AI for the most part is the issue and balance (walls etc).  Same problem as the same devs had with planetbase.  Poor AI spoils the game, same with planetbase which I also have hundreds of hours in.

It's a great city builder that I've logged almost 150 hours into (at the time of this review). At endgame it does get rather tedious seeing as how when you max out the tech tree there's not much else to do, but if you're one of those types who wants to see their city grow as big as they can just for the heck of it, you'll have plenty of time.

The game is very challenging, which some people like and some don't, so take that how you will. It does have different modes with their own difficulty though.

A big thing about this game is getting your settlement to 'automate' itself, and getting tech takes a lot of time making this a very slow-paced game.

Some can find this kind of game-play interesting, I do not find this too boring, but it's not really what I was expecting for this kind of game, sometimes, it's more like an RTS than a city builder.
I still leave a positive advice for the following reasons:
I really like the additional challenges, where you have some specific objective adding some variety to the game
They are still making some updates, fix bugs, add contents, and listen to the feedback (thank you for that)
The concept is good, a city builder in the primitive age is enjoyable, and make me learn some stuff (however, double check on Wikipedia since it's still a game and not all you can see is accurate, but well, who knows exactly what was happening 3 millions years ago ??)
The pace is peaceful, some says it's slow (and it is), but if you don't like to rush, it's a good thing, and you still can speed up to 8x (I almost always play to 8x speed, and use 1x to give orders).

Pros:
- The tutorial is very detailed, and the help windows are great and easy to navigate. So this game is easy to learn
- There's clear ""milestones"" and tech tree. And you can purchase most tech. 
- Overall it is a pretty relaxing and simple city builder. 
Cons:
- The people are so freaking annoying sometimes. I know you are low on knives, that's why I've said to make some freaking knives, but noooooo you don't want to make the knives just complain. This even when the workload is only at 30%. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this happened often where I would have items set to be produced but none of the villagers would go make them, even when the workload was really low.  
- There's not a lot to do. Which is the main reason I don't think it's worth $25. It feels unfinished. Like it's just half a game. I means there's only 3 kinds of houses.

I watched a review on youtube before I bought it where they said ""this is the perfect game to come home and relax to after a long day of work"" and I couldnt agree more. Its slow paced but thats a charm to it. You dont feel rushed to progress, and honestly advancing in tech kind of takes a bit of the ""stress"" away from it so its actually really fun to stay at a primitive level, dreading winter is a real thing. Most games almost seem to be a punishment if youre low tech and not advancing, but this game just feels right at which ever era youre in. 

My only real gripes about the game is that it REALLY needs a map editor. You have several maps to choose from, but if we could make our own maps itd add so much more life and play time to the game. My other gripe is that theres no other settlements on the maps, its just you and some random raiders and traders. Its neat because it adds a feeling of isolation, size and loneliness, but itd still be cool to atleast be able to send your own trader out even if there are no other settlements on the map. All in all this game is amazing as it is. I havent experienced any bugs that ive seen mentioned in other reviews so those must have been patched. I give it a 9.5/10 since theres no map editor which it really needs, if it had one itd be a solid 10/10.

I liked the game, (Kind of) I did a single play through without restarting unlocking all 10 thingy's on the first map. I went to start another play through on a different map and realized I didn't want to do the same steps again. There is a distinct lack of replayability, its the same linear gameplay on different maps. There is not really another path to take to a successful map completion.

For a good idea of how many people slog it out to the end, look at the achievements. Getting to the Iron age is an achievement its part of the tech tree and getting there happens as you play and unlock tech points. Guess how many people have it...  37%. The end game is just waiting, you have a stable village that needs little influence from you. I was on 8x speed for most of it.

First off, the basics. The theme is hunter-gatherers developing into agrarian iron-age communities (with what I think is a reasonably euro-centric focus). It's pretty faithful to those periods afaik, and clearly a lot of work has gone into keeping it that way. It really pays off, 'cos the game looks beautiful. If you always wanted to run a little pre-Roman community of peoples, this is perfect.

If you like city-builder style games, this'll definitely scratch that itch. It's not got a large number of over-complex systems, but it's nice if you like to slowly and reasonably casually build up a working community of people. It'll still punish you if you expand too fast, but there are only a few things you need to keep an eye on.

I think the most charming thing for me is how subtly the game transitions through the ages. There's no one point where you go from a little hunter-gatherer community to a bustling iron-age town, it's very gradual. Villagers slowly replace their furs with wool shirts, gradually eschew old flint spears for new ones of copper and bronze. Your biggest threat might start as wolves, but gradually you'll stop being scared of their attacks, and start preparing instead for those damned invaders who seem to insist on chucking pointy objects at you.

In short, it's a great game. There's honestly nothing I would change about it. 10/10",1603450402,1603450402,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dawn of Man has a very strong skeleton with what I believe to be a solid vision of what they want their game to be, and I find great enjoyment in scanning the pre-generated landscapes to find interesting locations to try and set up a colony.  It's fun to slowly grow your settlement  [i](and when I say slowly, I do mean [b]SLOWLY[/b])[/i], and through the tile-grid based building system could stand to be a little looser, it allows the player to create rather organic-looking primitive villages.  For me it is always satisfying to build up a few farms, set up necessary workshops and hut areas, and finally encircle my village in a full wall with towers and gates.  It looks great from afar and up close!

However, my praise for the game doesn't quite outweigh the issues I have encountered, which lead me to leave this game with a negative review rather than a positive one.  To start with, I'd like to mention the issue of villager [i](and Raider)[/i] AI.  The game is a micro-manager colony simulator, and while it starts off incredibly easy to build a village, store up a massive stockpile of food, and start taming animals and expanding your population into the upper 50s to 90s, but the villager AI has a persistent pattern of dovetailing out of control when you begin to try fulfilling the increasing requirements of advancing into the next Eras to acquire new technologies.  For instance:  You have a sustainable food supply of 350+ Meat, 50+ Fish, 100+ Bread, and 30+ Fruits;  5 Grain fields to produce Straw and 2 Flax fields to produce linen for your clothes and tools;  animal space for 100 livestock with strict population limits set on them, and domesticated all types of animals;  6+ tanners set to high priority to make Leather for both repairs and toolmaking;  a population of 100 villagers.

Despite all that and even though you may have massive stockpiles of tools, straw, food, and labor strength to advance to the next Era,  with each Winter that passes your structures will begin to degrade which requires manpower and resources such as Straw and Leather to repair.  Straw comes from fields which are harvested in the Fall, and Leather comes from raw skins collected from hunting and skinning both wild animals and domesticated ones when they exceed their population limit, or reach old age  -  this also requires manpower, which will be a recurring theme in this review.  So, you harvest your crops right before Winter, and then your villager start using the Straw produced to feed animals and make repairs on almost all of the buildings you can create.  With the rate at which your animals will consume straw during winter, as well as the amount that will be used up doing repairs, even producing as much as 75+120 units of straw during the Fall will lead to a shortage during the Winter.  You may find that odd, but this is where the villager AI  [i](and Raiders)[/i]  come in.

Raiders attack 1-3 times per year and in steadily increasing numbers as you advance through the Eras and expand your village.  Your villagers' response when called to defense will be to spread themselves equally across all defensible position on a cardinal direction facing the attackers.  They are locked into positions and have limited Aggro range, requiring that the enemy Raiders come within firing distance of a bow or sling to begin attacking.  Your towers do not really provide a range bonus against Raiders, and are flimsy constructions that cost a fair amount of Straw to both construct and maintain, requiring multiple repairs per year.  Raiders in the late-game will typically kill between 5-12 of your villagers due to the way both of their AI functions, and you will often lose at least 2-4 towers in the process depending on the Raider's point of attack.  You can micro-manage your villagers en masse to attack the Raiders before they reach your village, but the casualties will remain the same if not larger depending on terrain and party sizes.  All of [b]THAT[/b] translate to this:  You lose manpower, and you need to use up resources to reconstruct and repair whatever has been lost.  Raiders will attack in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter  -  whenever, and it always interrupts what your entire village is supposed to be doing.  This is very detrimental as the seasons in Dawn of Man are very short when compared to the massive amount of tasks your villagers actually need to perform, despite seemingly having fulfilled all the requirements to support a population as large as 100 villagers.

As your available manpower dwindles, so too does your ability to perform critical tasks at important seasonal intervals.  If Raiders attack during the Spring, your villagers lose a huge amount of time defending, collecting friendly casualties for burial and tools on the battlefield, beginning repairs on structures and reconstructing your village for the next imminent attack, and then finally getting back to trying to fulfill the standard queue.  Planting crops  [i](even when set to High Priority)[/i]  falls by the wayside as your villagers scramble to perform other tasks such as sleeping to cure fatigue, praying to cure depression, drinking water or eating, or trying to craft tools to perform queued tasks.  The larger your crops, the more often they are neglected as your available manpower becomes more and more distracted by the ever-increasing queue of to-do tasks.  Summer and Winter are your only brief breaks to attempt to perform more goal-oriented activities like refocusing materials or deciding what you need to build next to alleviate the stalling task orders, while Fall is much the same as Spring except this time your villagers need to be harvesting instead of planting.  When Winter comes, you will either have gone through half your Straw, or be dumping all of it into your stables to feed animals while some of it goes to necessary repairs on houses so your villagers do not die of hypothermia from exposure.  Your Straw is burned through rapidly, and if you're lucky you might make it through the winter with 5-10 Straw at the start of Spring.  Planting time!

The dwindling resources; the increasing task demands; the sky-rocketing Workload percentage which begins to reach as high as 300-400% as your population, shifting up and down between 88-100 due to Raider attacks and the elements, struggles to perform tasks in the correct order of priority despite your efforts to guide them;  the lack of Straw leading to mass animal starvation in Winter, leading to a shortage of both food and labor sources which your various animals provided.

[b]Incompetent AI[/b] and [b]Failure to Properly Prioritize Tasks[/b] are the only [i]Major[/i] complaints I have about Dawn of Man, my [i]Minor[/i] complaints being:  The seasons are too short,  more reliable means of fortifiable defenses are necessary [i](be it tweaks to the existing ones or the addition of new defense features)[/i], frequency of building repairs should be adjusted down, and the tile-grid construction system would be nice a little looser, allowing more freedom to play objects on slight inclines and small hills [i](to fix parts hovering in the air, terrain can be automatically dragged up to meet the perimeter of constructions on inclines?)[/i].

For instance, the game took me twenty or so hours, yet there's an achievement for doing it in six. I've seen quite a few players posting it took them fifty to seventy hours to complete their game. It's really up to you. The more you get the calculator out and try to punch out more welfare for your citizens the more quickly the game will go. In the early game it can be played as a sort of semi-RTS. You can micro your settlers somewhat and are encouraged to do so with the hunting aspect.

My city went through violent revisions to maximize happiness, and you're always on a knifes edge when doing so. The theme is so well captured but I wish they'd stayed tighter with that theme. Maybe condensed to just the stone age to the bronze age would have been better with more granularity between that time. The transition between hunting and gathering to agriculture is a violent one in the game but the game never drops the Rousseauian society. The simulation sort of matches reality too, the game in the hunting and gathering era encourages you to pick off older animals that will put up less of a fight. After the dawn of agriculture, do to how population growth works, killing males is preferable to females because one male can impregnate many females. You can ignore all of this and play for hundred hours in one campaign but I encourage you not to and to look deeper.

Personally I love reading about this period, as opposed to dinosaurs, mostly because the scholarship in this period is much further along. Because it's more recent we have more data on how animals and humans of this time period lived than we do dinosaurs.

It's incredibly difficult to see anything in this game, starting a new world is especially frustrating because I have to start looking at the same environments that blend together.

Especially in the early eras, before you research domestication of animals and grains, it can get pretty brutal. Send a hunting party too far out just before the winter, and they could all die of hypothermia on the way back. Combined with a wolfpack or hyenas attack, and this can be game over for your small settlement. I love those early games though, because you really develop a connection with your handful of people to the point where you know them by name. 

Once you move away from hunter-gatherer to a more settled way of life, raiders start to appear. By then though, you should have a good enough supply or weapons + some early fortifications so that you can deal with them without much trouble. 

If there's two complaints I have about this game, it's these: 

1) raiders are too easy. Especially in the latter stages, they are at worse a minor nuisance. I really wish Raider parties would continue to grow in proportion to your settlement size, but the most I've seen was about 40-50 raiders when I had a pop of 300+. They can't even kill one of my people before I wipe them out. 

2) The lack of ability to assign your villagers to certain tasks. You can assign them to fish, hunt, collect water and fruits or cut trees. But you cannot assign them to specific production buildings, for example to make tanned skins or craft tools. Instead, the game relies on a ""priority"" system, but in reality it works so-so. There's been many times when my workload was low, with multiple people just standing around doing nothing, and yet no one would go to the tanner. You can somewhat alleviate this by building more of the specific production buildings you need, but it can create serious bottlenecks and become pretty frustrating. 

Graphically, it is gorgeous. I love the attention to details for each specific season (the fall with its vivid colors is my favorite). I've spent countless hours just sitting back, watching my humans just run around like a well-drilled ant-farm, content in the knowledge that we've managed to create a ""metropolis"" (it does feel that way after 200-250 pop) from quite litteraly scratch. 

Overall, I super recommend this game. It's very relaxing once you figure out its mechanisms, even if it does get a bit shallow towards the end of the tech tree, to the point where you simply stop playing a particular village because you run out of possible improvements and it gets a bit repetitive, as you really are in no danger from raiders. It would be cool to have a third or more of your population wiped out due to a raid, and have to rebuild from there, but it's not in the works yet.

It's got a unique aesthetic, the soundtrack is relaxing, and the game is a great time. That being said, there are certainly low points that can get a bit too repetitive. Especially when you're on the brink of unlocking a new era, it can be a bit of a drudge to try and assemble enough points to keep going. Each new era is refreshing and adds a new wrinkle to the game, and I definitely would recommend it if you like these types of games.

After you get to around 50 population though, hunting and defending enemy raids really isn't that big of a deal. You can easily just assemble your entire population to smite anything that roams near you in a matter of seconds. 

 I really enjoy how the elderly and children of the tribe contribute to the society in a meaningful way, and I like how resources do come back after they've been drained. 

I definitely think the developers should add more dynamic, more threat. When storms pass by, or when the winter hits, I think it should  pose a real threat once in a while. When either of these things happened, I just fast forwarded through them. I want to feel a real us against the world with this game, and it only partially delivers.

If you love 4X games like civilization this is like that but more RTS. If you love RTS games this is like that but more nation building and competing against the ever changing local environment of your town as opposed to fighting some rival nation or faction for land and resources (although that would be a cool mod for some people, I think). 

I am in the 3rd Age and just now starting to get small parties of raiders. There is also a first person mode where you can zoom in on any villager and follow them around which is very immersive and a nice break from the overhead mode you tend to spend most of your time in.  The flow of building the town is quite organic as time goes on (I have not fast forwarded at all as you can miss things fast or problems can crop up from not managing resources carefully). It really feels like you have to be careful to not run short on things. You do not want to get into winter time unprepared, and you may feel like a digital archaeologist as you guide the digital representations of your ancestors towards their destiny. 

I also like that it does not go to modern times, (Rise of nations is the perfect game for that in my opinion). The primal world is quite beautiful and deadly and is keeps me coming back to this game.  While you watch your town grow, and hopefully prosper, you may feel pangs of guilt as you guide your desperately hungry band of early humans to hunt beautiful majestic animals- which today are extinct. The huge Wooly Mammoth and Giant Auruchs as well as ancient Bison are some of these. You are as much the hunted as the hunter in these early animal confrontations as your people are trying to figure out how to make flint spears. You may find a group of equally hungry and desperate cave lions attack the villages vulnerable children in the middle of your town!  The AI seems pretty good so far, but they made them dumb enough to need a little help from the player- which is nice of them. For example, a person that is extremely tired or hungry gearing up to go out with the hunting party! Get back in your hut!

Now, with all the changes to the AI and the game itself it became something much less annoying. Not saying the AI is clever, just not dumb anymore :) Let's say semi-dumb, which makes this game not just playable but replayable as well. The developers really did their best and implemented changes to the peoples pathfinding routines, they now prioritize tasks better, defending from raiders is much smoother than it was. I really enjoyed my last game. Really great work from the devs, keep it up! 

2nd update: Some updates, as I have additional hours. It is said that every creation has the limitations of its creator. Well, if the developers of this game are as dumb as the people in the game, then I really feel sorry for them. I've just lost 20 people to raiders, and 40 on the previous attack. You know why? Because the guys walked against the raiders one by one, as they ran out of stamina. It's hillarius, imagine that you fight for your life and there is no adrenaline kicking in, and you are tired, so you just let the attackers kill you. Pretty unrealistic. Towers, walls are extremely weak, so you will loose a bunch of them every attack. You need to rebuild, then comes the issue that you had more than 100 people, so now their workload at crop planting time is too high, as you just lost 40 and then 20. The reaming ones are overloaded. Especially, if you want them to cut trees and collect some other stuff, they rather just die as they cannot prioritize. 
Straw management is very hard, sometimes harder than raiders, but honestly I really don't understand the people. I send them out for 2 stones for rebuilding the walls, they are at 87% of workload and they just forget to plant the crops, so I will have no grain nor straws. Come on. Why can't they remember that in spring, we plant and in autumn, we harvest. Just put that on the top priority, because we cannot plant a thing in summer. Prioritize only as much as they need, so they can do other important things as gathering wood for winter. So that if I loose half my town, they don't plant all the crops, but only what they need for the winter and that is prioritized.
Why can't I upgrade megalith stones to carved megalith statues? I just recycled one stone and build a statue next to it. The people recycled it, which means I had to waste 3 skins and 3 wood on it, so that they can take in to the other side of the town for the other statue and take the one on the other side of the town here. Can they just look at the distance and recycle the closest one? 
This game is hard, becomes easier once you realize some flaws and things, but it is rather annoying. The AI is very stupid, and I mean extremely stupid. I still hope the devs are not that limited. Dark Souls is hard, it is very hard at times, but it is not really annoying. You know why? Because this game has stupid flaws, like there is no straw to feed the animals and you cannot order your people to kill the animals, so that their meat can be used. You need to mess with the limits of the animals. You have 50 goats, and you have enough food for 30? Let's kill 20, no no, you need to lower the limit to 30 and your people will kill them once they have some time on their 67% of workload. Once done, you need to raise the limit again, otherwise you will not have more goats than 30. Why? Why can't I just order them to kill 20 immediately and not mess with the limit? Okay, I can, I can one by one click on the animals in the shelter, sending them out and ordering them to kill them. Thank you. This is why this game is annoying, because it is stupid, not like Dark Souls which is just hard, but at least not stupid and annoying. 
This was my 3rd run, I've uninstalled this 2 times already, now is the 3rd. I will try it later, maybe in a year. The game itself is good, the whole idea, the whole setting, it is just stupid. 

1st time thumbs down: It's not easy to write a review of this game as there is so much to love here, but most of it is ruined by the AI. But, don't want to run to my conclusion, first let's start with the good stuff, then the bad and the ugly tips for the devs :)

Pro:
Graphics: I really like it, it can be improved, but quite okay
The concept: good that you start in the early eras, then improve your city and manage everything
The production chains are quite easy to understand, no problem in getting the hang of the game
Music is quite mediocre, sounds are good
There is always a challenge you need to sort out, lack of food or leather etc. you need to be proactive to satisfy your people, but that is what you expect from a management game
Everyone is working, adults doing the hard part, but children are collecting sticks, little stones etc. which makes this realistic

Cons:
Not many building types
Not many animal types
Defensive buildings have not much health, 4-5 raiders always destroy 2-3 towers at every run, not to mention the gate which is always destroyed if you don't leave it open. Really stupid thing, maybe once I reach the reinforced gates, but the first palisades are not much of a help
AI: really, really stupid. Raiders always killing many, as it takes eons for them to get to the tower, where the horns are sounded. They never run, even if I double click for them they still walk, while raiders are destroying half the city. This means at endgame, you will lose 20 people, because they are rallying too slow and getting killed one by one.
AI again: My people (I have 150) are dying of starvation. I have 100 cured meat in my warehouses, 300 units of wheat, 93 units of water, still not cooking bread. That also goes for other materials as well. You need to be proactive as they will die on ther own. You need to micromanage everything. Collecting sticks, tannin, cutting trees, everything. Even tough the continious production is on for most common materials such as knives, sickles etc, they still not doing it. The workload is at 17%, so they are bored as hell, but still not doing work. This means you need to micromanage everything. Tip: you can double click on materials, so you don't need to click on each tree to cut out, or stick to collect. 
AI on the 3rd time: I have 140 animals, still dying of starvation. While 5 other people died of dehydration, but I have hundreds of wells and live near a huge lake. They are really dumb. 

Tips for devs:
The concept of the game is very good, the setting, the ideas, everything, but content-wise it is very empty. After 10 hours, I just wanted to reach bronze stuff, then iron etc. But basically I'm doing the same stuff all over again. Micromanaging the lives of the dumb people. There should be missions. Get a commercial agreement with the other tribe, kill 5 mammoths next year. Would really enjoy this. 
The world is big, but the village is small. Maybe a key for the camera to go home would be nice. Maybe there is, I just didn't know about it, but would appreciate it.
Culture points should be added. Just imagine, certain points (not technology) can be used for learning new skills, but these would have buffs as well. For instance, if you specialise yourself on beer you became a germanic tribe with germanic elements shown on buildings, having certain traits and advanteges of being a german. Or you can be Celtic, Sumerian, Egyptian or whatever, just something special. Would be nice to have the opportunity to specialize yourself in certain cultures, which would also mean they won't be able to build the same type of buildings. 

I will edit my comment once more content is coming to the game, I really love it, it is just a bit empty now.",1577475326,1600928831,True,0,0,0.797404646873474121,0,True,False,False

The feel of this game is perfect, the graphics are solid, the mechanics are mostly intuitive, and while challenging it's not annoyingly difficult.  For folks that like games like Banished this will definitely fit you well.  

Two of the aspects I want to bring particular attention to that I really like that's different from other similar games is that children and elderly aren't just drains on your resources, they actually contribute, which makes a ton of sense.  Children are able to do basic tasks and only have one item slot, and elderly are just as capable as adults just with one less item slot.  As well, that houses are not individually assigned, and that villagers can literally sleep, eat, and store or retrieve items from any house that is nearby.  These two aspects in particular are amazing additions that I really commend the developers for.

In fact, there's so much good about this game that it's easier pointing out it's few flaws.  So here's my nitpicky issues with the game: I would love an option to turn off [i]all[/i] notifications except the arrival of traders and raider attacks.  I don't need to be reminded every 30 seconds that something has decayed, there's too much work, or there's not enough stable space for my animals.  I got it the first time and even then I probably either already knew or really don't care.  These notifications are so annoying that I often play without a headset on cause I'm tired of hearing the constant bwah.  It would also be amazing if the game had some way of forewarning about Raider attacks, like a building or sending villagers on scouting assignments or some such.  I find I almost always save scum a Raider attack, because it's the difference between being caught unawares and losing 15 people vs. being properly mustered and ready and losing no one.  Finally the game does have a few odd bugs, like trees that instantly respawn after being chopped down (which is actually pretty handy) or one where when my workers were returning a sledge to the transport thinger they would try and walk up a mountain in the opposite direction first.  I would often catch them starting to make the trek and kindly redirect them in the right direction.  Finally, I'd like the devs to fix the hunting AI.  It makes sense for more than one person to go out as a hunting party, but when the first person to get in range blows the element of surprise by firing before any of the other hunting party members are in range, it really defeats the purpose.  And it seems like that would be a simple fix of just delaying the first person in range until either the entire party is in range or even just a small set few seconds to allow others to get in range.  Otherwise you watch as that Deer or Boar gets away because the idiot at the front got trigger happy.

Otherwise, a stellar game, well worth the price, very enjoyable, and again I highly recommend.",1600647678,1600648471,True,57,0,0.840970993041992188,0,True,False,False

It has the potential to be very good. but it seems the devs are not too concerned about gameplay or maybe wanted to get done too much at once.[h1][/h1]The game looks good and i see that a lot of work has been put in it, but i think the devs should have concentrated more on the early phases (paleolithic, mesolithic aera) and make them really work, before moving on. so much possibilities there, but the game with its still incompetent Ai (especially enemy raiders), useless trading system, limited map generation/modding possibilities, bugs, lack of tension or strategic challenge feels just boring.[h1][/h1] Most of the time the reason to get new techs and reach new aeras is to fight the boredom, not because i feel the need to make peoples lives easier. The principle of cause and effect is not really there.[h1][/h1]the survival aspect of this game is not very well implemented. for example, if you want to make a mod where you start with nothing,(or you somehow end up with nothing) you will notice, you have to build a crafter that needs animal skins for construction, in order to craft a damn wooden spear with wich you can hunt properly, to get animal skin. that should be buildable at the fireplace.  why do i need a building for such simple things.how is this a survival scenario?the crafter-building should make crafting more efficient instead of  beeing a requirement for it.[h1][/h1]Enemies just walk straight into your camp and get killed. their only strategy is to increase numbers next time around. but they will have powerfull bows eventually that can destroy watchtowers easily.;)[h1][/h1]Same with workers.

My original review was originally fraught with frustration because I, like many others, was frustrated at how stupid humans behaved in this game and looking at the tasks as secondary as I just planned out my city.  This is not a game about managing little humans and planning out your prehistoric city.  This is about managing tasks and resources so that your tribe grows stronger.  Your tribe is a single resource, and that resource is WORKLOAD.  The size of your workload determines how many jobs, tasks, build projects, etc you can perform at once, and the number of people in your tribe determine the size of your workload.  If you command too many things to be done at once, you are not merely creating a queue of things to be done in an orderly fashion.  You are creating a bottleneck.  You cannot expect your humans to be ""smart"" and automatically know how to do things.  Because this game is task-oriented, it falls on THE PLAYER to be smarter than early man.  Don't tell your humans to hunt a bear two forests away in the dead of winter. Heck, don't hunt very far away from home at all, and really you should try to have a huge surplus of food by the end of the fall.  All four seasons have opportunities and disadvantages that are important in considering which tasks you should prioritize when. 

The most important thing to remember and to understand in this game: The fewer commands you give to your humans, the more productive they are going to be.  Paradoxical, perhaps, but it's logic.  If you're frustrated because a job isn't getting done, it can only be because you've given them too many things to do any they are busy doing something else. Less is more, especially early on.  It's your job to tell them what's important, so you have to always consider that as you set forth.

Anyways, I highly recommend the game.  Most of the frustration at the game is undeserved, however there are a few things I find annoying.  Some of the sub-menus and shortcuts seem too buried and not instantly obvious to new players.  If you don't know where to look for important information, your game experience may be sorely lacking. This can be largely overcome if the player takes the time to familiarize themselves with all the diff buttons (there are sub-menus!).  Some of the windows (total tasks, buildings) are a pain to look at because it's a big jumble of icons.  If you know exactly what you are looking for it can be a lot more useful, but again this was just really overwhelming for a new player.  Additionally, unless this was changed (I didn't try recently because it was always punishing in the past), create secondary or adjacent outposts for the purposes of expansion is futile because of the way the AI handles raider attacks.  Suffices to say that there is no decent way to manage a proper defense once the AI can't tell that you have two outposts, so you need to be able to spread out without creating a new set of walls somewhere else or you'll curse the AI.  Lastly, I just kinda wish there was MORE to play through, but they are still updating the game and mods are out there so...possibilities are decent!


Tips
1) Like I said above, learn about your menus, info panels, and shortcuts. Click through that shit and actually pay attention to it and read some of it.
2) Hitting the ENTER button zooms you to your tribe.
3) SET FOOD DRYING to HIGH priority. The problem with the starving despite having a lot of food is likely due to lots of RAW food.
4) Once you start needing to make LEATHER, dramatically reduce the number of skins dryers you have and/or limit the number of dried skins you require at a time (15 for me), because otherwise you'll get shorted on Leather production.
5) Another possible cause of Leather shortage is from Tannin shortage. Tannin is only available in the Spring from Oak and Fir trees, and work areas are slow for me.  Memorize Oak and Fir and in the spring go and manually queue up a handful of Tannin collections nearby. Stock up or you'll be stuck hoping the trader has them.
6) Managing resource limits really is important, so actually take a look at them all. Do not forget to update them occasionally. EG: Clothing at 125-150% of your population (if you overproduce on valuable but useful things, they are great to sell to trader for whatever goods you need).
7) Don't let animals over-produce. Managing their limits is important to make sure they get slaughtered before they go through all the food.  You don't want your donkey's/horses dying because a pig explosion is ripping through your straw. However, if you understand how to predict and plan for a boom, you can boom and cull for some extra meat in the winter. I like to do this with Pigs.
8) Double clicking anything select/highlights all things like it in the area.  Clicking and dragging the green box around entities also highlights them all. If you drag over a group of animals (select all), you can mass assign all young to be captured and then the remaining adults to be hunted.
9) Understanding the importance of manual assignment over work-areas. Some work areas are only productive under certain conditions (EG Hunting requires animals in range, berries require it being in-season) that you can sometimes set these and then forget them, contributing to a great workload bottleneck sometime later.  Therefore, some tasks are best completed when the opportunity is there and you have the available workload.
10) Four tips to always having food (NEVER get comfortable with your food amount for more than a couple mins!). A) Manually selecting animals is my preferred method of hunting (hunting areas seems hit and miss for me because animals pass out of them). When you manually select, your hunters will follow them longer (be careful of this in winter and be mindful of how far you are sending them!) B) Fishing works to supplement if you make your fishing areas as wide as possible and then assign only ONE human to work a 3-4 tile area. C) When large/slower creatures or herds of larger creatures that wouldn't be safe to hunt alone pass REALLY close, select all or many of your men and command them to hunt one down at a time. D) Manually gather berries when they are ripe - I memorize the large clusters nearby and double-click to select all and harvest them.  I only gather locally, I don't OVER-gather because they will go bad anyways, but having a small amount during the summer can help save other foods for the winter when food is the scarcest.

More Nit-Picky Tips:
1. Some players like to prioritize only growing certain crop types based on the bonus, but I've found that this creates a HUGE labor bottleneck during that season.  It really is smart to diversify your crops, because not only does it help with labor distribution, but it prevents catastrophic losses *when* a disease inevitably sweeps through some season or two.  That could result in a loss of grain or hay, which could cause humans or animals to starve in the winter.  It can really snowball. It's smart to diversify :).
2. More things I always put on priority: Hearth, Mortar, Tanner, Crafter. Beyond that I only use prioritize on spot-building jobs of importance like walls or homes (population boom).
3. Adjust Animal populations every now and then. Let them swell, then cull them if you need food. Make sure you notice if they are multiplying too fast.

Lastly, I just noticed my near-end-game setup (playing Hard mode and have thus far found it easy) and it is rather amusing how simplifed it is. So I have 232 Villagers. 251 meat, 32 fish, 68 bread, 12 milk, more than enough of both clothing types for everyone. A wall and a functioning defensive system that encases nearly everything including my farmland. Basically I am really comfy and riding out this game until i simply unlock everything. I have 86% workload right now. I only have 7 tasks. The rest are miners, farmers, and my manual minions.",1570227603,1599559218,True,10,0,0.63255620002746582,2,True,False,False

It's actually a lot like Life is Feudal: Forest Village, except it starts much earlier in human development and stops where that game starts. It does have a nice research/skills track. 

The one big thing I see missing is the depth of the skills tree. There are all sorts of areas that are really missing. One big one is health - there aren't any skills like herbalism, etc., so when and how people get sick is not something you have any control of. No skills around shoes, not much around clothing, etc. In general, it's not very deep. It's fine if the game is supposed to end in the Iron age with steel, that's not a problem. But in reality, there could be so much depth. There is also no way (like a school) to educate children to make them more efficient as adults.

You can't control individuals at all. This is generally OK with me, but there are times when someone is right near something I really want done, and there's nothing I can do about that. It's also hard to figure out workload - there is a workload percentage, there isn't an interface to control all of the workload in the game at once to take care of that - you have to either just stop adding things for them to do until it goes down, or piecemeal change the work areas, etc. - and even that is unpredictable in terms of workload effect. And although you can set priorities for a since most buildings include producing multiple items, you can't set priorities for those items.

You also can't trade for a generic thing (like beads or any kind of currency) which means it really limits how you can accumulate to trade expensive items. You could decide, I guess, that you'll make some item the thing you'll accumulate, but you don't know whether or not the trader coming is going to have that thing. You also can't trade for skills points, which I think is a missing link. You can trade for skills, but they are so expensive that it's hard to accumulate enough stuff to trade for them until toward the end of the game. 

The raiders get more numerous and stronger, but there's no way to really have a combat strategy against them. One stupid thing - when you get later in the game, and people have to go further and further to get resources, like a mine, or to mine megalith, they will die of starvation - the game isn't smart enough to have them pack food for the journey. So it makes it hard to build population because people keep stupidly dying of starvation even when you have plenty of food.

Picky problems with UI: There are some things that are hard to find. Like you should be able to get to manage work areas from the manage menu, but instead you have to go to a work area, then choose ""Work areas"" to manage them. It's not easy to locate specific items - like if you've found a megolith a long way away, and set to mine it, you have to go search for it again to be able to prepare it for movement back to the settlement. 

So it's not the deepest of these kinds of games, so I probably won't spend a lot more time with it (I can clock 100 hours or more on good strategy games like this.) But if you like this sort of game, it's worth a try.",1599436933,1599515673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People just do whatever they feel like, prioritising stuff does not seem to work. You prioritise a building, and instead of building that they just build something else, just to taunt me. Sometimes they even manage to build the prioritised building last. 

When hunting a big animal like a mammoth they should send 4-5 people armed with spears and bows, but no, the game decides to just send out grandma armed with a butter knife. If multiple hunters were sent, they are not well coordinated; if one arrives the attack begins, instead of waiting for the rest of the hunting group and attack in numbers. Ofcourse if just 1 person attacks a healthy mammoth they will not survive that encounter. 

People die of starvation while there is enough food, and die of hypothermia while it is no longer cold. At one point in the game, when you seem to have a lot of people in your village, they start dying mysteriously while there is enough food, water and warm clothing. Resulting in an enourmous workload, which means: game over, everyone will die, since important tasks are no longer done.

Things are not efficient at all. People hunt an animal, someone else gets a sledge, butchers the animal, gets back to the village puts some meat in the food dryer and leaves the sledge with the bones and skins just there, so someone else has to get the sledge and put the bones in the warehouse, and another person is needed to get the sledge to the skin dryer or tanner. Sometimes they just leave the sledge in the forest after having butchered the animal and go do something else. This while the workload is an important mechanic: it is quite deadly when it is way too high, because tasks are not getting done anymore like food production and maintenance to the decaying buildings.

Expect realism to be off tho, as other people mention, your people will deside to gather fruit rather than defending their settlement or children beeing attacked by a mountain lior or something. 
There is no real control on what people do, you can assing a person to make a sword at the smith, but when the sword is done, he will leave to do what ever task you might else have. Leaving another person, taking over the smith to do the next sword, and so on, even if they are dying of starvation, they will still make that final sword!! :|

But besides them errors, the game still catches my eyes, i love the challenge and the graphic, the game is easy to get started with, the music is just there, i did turn it off after a few hours, since its the same song over and over.
I just love to build a settlement and wall it, to expand it and wall it again, there is something to walls i just love...walls.
Raiders will attack and you can never tell in with dirrection they are gonna show up, so the challenge is real :P

Anyway, good game, fun gameplay, nice graphic, some weird decisions from your people from time to time, but overall a good game...must buy (on sale) :)

First game I've seen that explores the Stone-age, Bronze-age and Iron-age well. Shout out to the developers for keeping up a decent amount of historical accuracy, which is really important in keeping the game from being 'just another city builder'. 

Pros:
- Unique time period & decent historical accuracy
- Well implemented and thoughtful mechanics
- A good balance between micromanagement and automation 
- Atmospheric graphics without being 'overdone'
- Nice relaxed game pace without being boring or repetitive
- Good simulation of the challenges of the distinct time periods

Cons
- Will benefit from more 'fleshing out' of game features & mechanics
- More diversity in buildings would be welcome
- Combat, diplomacy and trade needs building out to make more meaningful
- Would be great to have some wiki entries to learn more about life in the time periods

There is no challenge but the one that the game is not working and is retarded.
I am very disappointed that I've spent so much time playing it. I think that is because I bought it.
I think I should just test some pirate version to check its value before. Bad decision.

I put a lot of time into a settlement and everything worked fine until my population got to 180
Then it started to work like shit. I have 130 pigs but the people spent the entire summer with the task of killing pigs in the first panel without killing any animal. Like they had the first tasks to kill pigs the entire summer but did not do it
Of course in the fall when they had to harvest a ride came and they started to die of hunger like the fasting wasn't a common thing in those days
they had MC and they were used to eat daily
I had the pig population set to 50% of population
If they killed the pigs when the workload was 60% in the summer that mean that there should have been plenty of food : (130 pigs - 50/100 * 180)*3(meat per pig) = 120 meat
The game is so frustrating 
just take it from torrents and you will realize quickly that it does not deserve any buck 
Don't pay for it to play 20 hours of frustration and then forget about it

11-march-2020 :
I got the population over 200 but the pig number is still out of control
In the winter I have the pig population set to 75% (and I should have the option to set a number and that number should be respected) but the number of pigs is over 200
They are killing no pig the entire winter then in the spring the fields are full of pigs and the people are over worked because they have to plant grains and kill the pigs
Why the fuck they killed no pig while the task load was at 80%?
Then the harvest is low because they didn't planted all the fields 
Then the winter comes and again the number of pigs is too large (I want it to be large for the food but I also want them to be killed like the first thing in the winter) because the people again are spending time feeding the pigs and not killing them
This is just retarded and so frustrating 
The straw is not enough and the cows start to die
But when the animals die in the winter they just disappear 
They fucking vanish
The devs are spending time making the game pretty
There are basic things not working
If there will be no option to make a priority for everything including killing animals (some sort of them) and no option to set a number (any fucking number) instead of percentages that are not working (or the option to choose between number or percentage) the game is doomed for populations over 200 
Doomed and frustrating
Too bad for the work to be stupid on purpose

27 Apr 2020:
The game improved and I will start recommending it but there are some issues:
 - people are dying a lot of freezing or hunger or thirst when they are going to work far from the settlement - the game does not compute right the time when they should return and if they should go so far on a bad weather
- the usage of charts is redundant since they are not using them properly like people are returning with only one stick in the chart - that is retded",1555168077,1598731769,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

A couple additions I'd love to see in future DLC:
+ Support for multiple settlements using a ""Home"" designator tied to Hearths. Each has it's own traders/new humans/residencies
+ Chickens!
+ Landscaping/earthworks to level ground, dig irrigation+channels, etc

I liked Planetbase, it was simple, but not the type of game I wished to reinstall and play again. I did though, during the beginning of the C19, to occupy my mind...but I totally lost interest in it. So I finally decided to give a try to Dawn of Man. Basically, you start a tribe and bring it to thrive within a 30,000 years period, it’s much more complex than Planetbase. But this complexity is often caused by the horrendous AI and a very old-school mechanism based on morale...which is totally out of context here. In a time when humans had to take harsh decisions to survive, like drowning some of their owns, killing themselves at work, life expectancy in the 20’s, I doubt they got a zero “morale” state for carrying a stone on few hundred meters...or not having the latest linen outfit. But being a game, I understand it is “the way” to do it if you do not intend to make something new and original, for fast money, but when my human decides to carry that stone instead of using one of the multiple free sledges and carts around, that’s a serious bug. And the list of those bugs is very, very long, creating false challenges. The developers know about it since the beginning and they hardly made any improvements about it.

The game itself is great. Starting off with a small group of settlers trying to survive in the stone age you are tasked with creating a massive settlement. You must manage your settlement's needs in order to survive the challenges that the world has to offer. Making sure that your settlement has enough food, clothes, materials and shelter in order to face the harsh realities and threats of the world. Threats can include anything from wild animals to bandits and even the weather itself can be deadly. This game offers allows players to develop their settlement over time; researching new technologies in order to further growth and maintain the population. 

Graphically this game is good. It has smooth animations and unique building designs that make the game look beautiful. If you couple this with the games seasons and lighting, you can truly appreciate the sheer size of the settlement you have helped grow. 

I would recommend that users who buy this game also take note of the workshop content. The content offers special challenges and a variety of worlds that keep the game fresh. 

Overall, I would recommend this game if you are looking for a peaceful, relaxing and satisfying experience; a game that has good graphics and an easy to grasp user interface; as well as a unique experience every time you play.

It feels a lot like Caesar III sometimes, the city-building sim from the 90's, except much more immersive, and obviously with modern graphics. I feel like that's a logical step for expansion, in terms of game development. Maybe in a future update or expansion Madruga Works can let you send settlers to other settlements to conquer them. And this would unlock new buildings or features in your now imperial city-state. Yeah, that would be great.

Also-and this is important- I dont think Madruga Works should focus on historical or eurocentric history. Different humans domesticated different animals, so I think that should be reflected in the game. Also, since the time-scale here is geologic, one can easily argue for alternate evolutionary results. I.e., just how dogs EVOLVED as a result of domestication, who is to say that bison or mammoths couldn't have been domesticated?

Ah, also the paleolithic age is really, short, too. I feel like a lot of interesting early human behavior mechanics can be explored here.

The game gives a near-perfect summary of how technological advancements changed our lives and how we interact with our environment. 

You start out as hunter-gatherers, living day to day and entirely dependent on the bounty of nature. Over time, you learn to exploit the resources around you until, by the Iron Age, you have embarked on manufacturing systems fueled by the domestication of crops and livestock.

At game start, you will have predators and herbivores wandering through your primitive campsite. By game end, your activities will have reshaped the landscape, with wildlife species retreating as you encroach via an expanding settlement and agriculture. Where lions and hyenas were initially the greatest threats you faced, you will now be more concerned about marauding rival tribes of humans.

The game's tech tree is both informative and rewarding although some inventions (like the wheel and water well) aren't as significant as you might think. Whereas others, like the domestication of grain crops, are literally life-changing for your settlers. The tech tree is a bit limited and by mid Iron Age, you will have dozens of Knowledge points (the mechanism to upgrade your technology level) to spare but no new technologies to spend them on. Adding some new techs, and perhaps making others optional, would add some gameplay variety.

The maps are well-designed but generally very samey with not much variety in the amount and range of resources available. Having maps with different resource balancing (some food-biased, some metal-biased, etc) would again add variety and challenge.

The combat system is a bit clunky but that is expected with city builders as opposed to RTS games. However, the automation of tasks is an absolute joy, allowing you to set production limits either as numeric totals or as % of your population. The implementation of decay (food) and wear and tear (buildings, tools, weapons, clothing) adds another level of complexity to managing your resources and keeping everyone happy. 

Overall, Dawn of Man is an engrossing, rewarding and informative game that is well worth the budget price.",1597414653,1597414653,True,3,0,0.551070511341094971,0,True,False,False

So, great city builder, feels dynamic and permeable so you can move structures around without mad hassle.
As for the levelling up through the ages I found myself waiting in one age till I had enough to beast through copper and go straight to bronze. No point in copper age really as by the time you've got 60/80 people you have almost 100 points so you blow past it.
Great farming and gathering structure. Buildings also were all well used and balanced.
The PvE is a bit odd at times but you'll rarely lose a soldier if you setup a good point defence. Don't build walls. They're attracted to the gates and keeps. I usually triangulate or square off entry points with a walled bastion. 
After 100hrs i've completed it fully but still have a village ongoing.
Slow paced game, good if you liked; Forest Village, Ostriv, Banished, Ancient Cities..

I find it an excellent resource management game that's not too complex as to be overwhelming, but with just enough to do to keep it engaging, keeping it a relaxing and charming experience. Details:

I was quite  fan of Madruga's previous offering - Planetbase, and hoped this would be just as good and I have not been disappointed. It's a real treat to experience the stone age this way - the setting, items, and materials are all pretty much in line with prevailing scientific evidence of the progression of our species. The setting is definitely european temperate forest and the progression follows that.

The rather short tutorial is all that's needed to get started and you start off basically with a handful of people and a tent or two and need to build up your hunter-gather tribe's encampment and develop it into a settled little stone age hamlet, aspiring to the bronze and iron ages.

I have no real complaints. The gameplay, graphics and sound are all artfully done and I found no bugs so far. One little thing I don't like is the save files are stored in my home folder (on mac, documents on pc) which is really not a good idea. I have left a post for the devs on it.

Can I recommend? Heartily. It is quite a charming game, I adore my band of prehistoric humans, and I know it's only going to get better as the devs add more to the game as they seem to keep doing.",1597348531,1597348613,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Essentially you play through the ages from Cavemen to early society like Sumeria/Babylon era level society. Which is a neat premise, but from early game the presentation is really messy.

Animal spawns are wild and all over the place, wolves and bears just appear like machine gun fire around your camp, and games like Stronghold 20 years ago pulled off natural wildlife spawning that looked and felt legitimate. It feels very arcade styled and less like a survival builder kind of experience.

Research and tech feels like they are handed to you and even trying to mod doesnt feel like an accomplishment as much as  cheesing out parts of the game or waiting longer to achieve it. Just build and tear down buildings to get the points you need and go from rock to the wheel in a year.

Workflow is just abhorrent in this game. You just arbitrarily set how many workers around the map and the game desperately tries to allocate workers at random the various areas. You dont have a farmer, or a hunter, or a soldier, everyone fills that role and the production hiccups usually occur not because of lack of management but because the game is struggling to allocate manpower to that area.

No forward camps or outposts. If you build in a bad area/run out of resources, you can murder all 100 people trying to tell 1 worker to walk a short distance from your base to mine/hunt something. Trying to build necessities nearby to keep him alive will just force more people to walk that way and also die. Its just the worst worker management ive seen in a game and ruins the immersion and experience.

Everything else about the game just feels watered down, seasons, crafting, domestication, farming. Its there, but it just doesnt look right or feel natural. 

Banished is 5 dollars cheaper and is so amazing next to this. Its all pulled off far more beautifully and execute much better. Plus there is SO MUCH more to accomplish and creating a several thousand person settlement feels earned, lived in, and fantastic. 

Dawn of Man is in early access so I wouldnt say its beyond fixing, but the issues it has seem like core mechanics and not bugs or unfinished ideas.

Good: 
1. simplicity of the game mechanics that allows you to ease into the game without being overtly complex
2. compared to ostriv, banished & depraved, the difficulty level on this is easy (I played the easier mode)
3. resource distribution is fair and never too less
4. closest experience to a primal life (probably far cry comes second but that's more of a FPS than a city builder)
Bad:
1. very little in terms of mods/configurations
2. settings menu was buggy (display resolution change causes non-responsive UI if your display won't support the selected resolution - known bug but still present)
3. graphics do feel dated even though the game is relatively new. There's a dull, dead feel to the game buildings probably because the devs were trying to replicate the basic buildings of the age. This creates confusion while selecting buildings because they all look the same when crammed together
4. finding an animal to rear is so difficult, and the most frustrating experience

Cant select someone and tell them to do it either. Doesn't do anything. They never build the tools you need like knifes to kill their livestock (even though you've set the limit to 15 animals and they stay at 25-30) meaning you'll die of starvation and its your fault. They don't rebuild towers after a raider attack.

You can enjoy your colony sim in the stone age for most of the game.  The epoch the game covers is divided into six eras, Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, Late Stone Age, Copper Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age.  The basic challenge being not to get eaten alive in the early phases and later how to defend your settlement and feed a large population.  There are many different starting areas on a massive map so it should be satisfying to replay a handful of times.

It looks like I'm just over seven hours in and I'm about half-way through the copper age.  On normal difficulty there is no hurry to advance as the AI always matches your tech level but on harder difficulty the AI will move at its own pace so there is pressure to advance quickly.  In all this leads me to believe a single game has about a twenty hour length though I'm not sure if it has a true ending date or resolution or if a single game can be played indefinitely.

At first glance loading into the game it may not immediately impress but it has done a lot to enthrall me.

I definitely recommend Dawn of Man for fans of the colony/town/city-builder genre.  Even primarily RTS fans might find some fun with it.

However (there s always a ""however"") i think that should be implemented in some aspects to be more enjoyable and historic related as possible (IMHO):
First of all, the map feels empy regarding anthropic presence; adding more tribes or groups of men in the same map, letting you commerce directly with them, raiding if u want and subjugate or unite with them to create a much more powerful faction ( i know that in this way seems like much more a Prehistory: Total War, but who knows) could possibly be the diplomatic feature to make the game more fun and adds a lot of new situations and solutions that the player and his tribe can come up to.
Second point, you have done a really magnifient work on recreate the atmosphere and the environment of ancient times, however (as i said, always a ""however"") i ve noticed a warringly lack of social profundity in the game: not that much in the Stone Ages (Paleolithic, Mesolithic firstly) but starting from the Neolithic and much more in the Metallurgy Era (Copper, Bronze and Iron) were present in those tribes and then in the first settlements a real differences between social classes. I would love to see features in the game like the rise of a chief, unique structures for a chief like palace (please don t believe i want the dev to add something like an imperial palace or something like that lol, just a building or a series of them) or structures for the inhabitans that could help rise their average happiness (social building like a commune hall, a sort of commercial zone within a building or like that; real religious buildings like temples, altars and so on).
Third point, as a graduate in Archaeology and ancient history ( i ve done some exams as well on Prehistoric and Protohistoric times) i would love to see added in the game a unique building for the pottery, like all the other profession already in the game; cause the invention of pottery is, with agriculture and the animals domestication, the striking event of the Neolithic Era, perhaps could be fun adding the possibility of fully considering pottery as a object with his own trading value, greater or lower depends by the prestige of your settlement or something like that.
Four point, why do we have to kill all the raiders? Wouldn't be fun and intriguing have the feature to enslave them, use as a workforce instead of your own people in the hardest works like mining, chopping down trees, carrying monoliths and so on? For me, could be really a enjoyable features to add.
I hope someone will read this comment cause as i said this game gave and continues to give me some straordinary vibes and for sure i will be reccomend this title.

I found the game to have 3 phases:
1.	The survival mode, where you scavenge and struggle to survive; this early play is very well done.
2.	Post-Agriculture mode, this is where you can snowball and build a true settlement with farms and fields; this portion of the game is fantastic.
3.	End game were you want to build a second or third settlement; this is where the game completely falls apart and where I hope the Dev’s expand upon.
Two things kill endgame where most players want to expand multiple settlements:
-you cannot dived you settlers two or more regions of settlers, so all of their response times and travel times take the entire settled land mass into account. This leads to both your settlements slowly suffering. 
-the task system still needs substantial work once you approach multiple settlements. Certain sets of tasks should able to prioritize and have settlers drop what they are doing to complete. Such as: planting or harvesting. If you have a large population fall behind, it is extremely difficult to reestablish the population and resources due to how the task que priorities a large set of tasks.

Maintaining a prehistoric colony and evolving them to the iron age, what could go wrong?
I was expecting kinda a rimwrold-esq experience but boy was I about to be let down!

Firstly you have almost no control over what your people do, besides telling them to go here or there on the map and giving certain tasks a high priority. There is no kind of job selection system, or the ability to to assign policies. Like the amount of food people can eat, how much time they get off from working. It's all out of your hands. 
Yes I can see my people are unhappy or injured but i'm powerless to do anything!

Also the AI has an IQ in the single figures, you send a guy to kill a boar, he does so but instead of stopping for a few moments to grab some skin or meat he's like nah i'm off for a kip. 
The AI will then pick some dude who is totally on the other side of the map to come do the collection even though there are people closer?! What gives. 

And what's the deal with not being able to equip your guys with gear? According to the Devs ""The person will pick the best tool available from storage to do the job..... ""
Yeah that's only if the derp derp AI is controlling them. 
So if you mark the mammoth for hunting, yeah the AI controlled guys will grab the best gear before heading off, but because Mr. AI has drawn the team from the four corners of the map, they arrive at different times, attempt to kill the mammoth.... and get slaughtered like lambs to the kebab shop!

But if you want to manually team up say 5 guys to take down a mammoth they'll gladly head off and do it, with whatever tools they have in hand, err even a fishing spear! 
There's just no way of tooling them up before you go. 

Finally I found the game just way too easy, i'm still on my first play through and things like food have never been a problem and animal attacks / raiders are just an annoyance. 
I never get that frantic feeling that my settlement is moments away from certain death, which you should certainly get in the first half of getting established and definitely on a first play through.

Its a real shame as I do like the tech tree, building and resource diversity.

Besides the very beginning, I haven't felt any sort of ""crunch"" as far as food or resources. The amount of food I need is really low, and for the moment my village has run out of things it really needs, every hunt and every tree chopped down gives me far more meat, hide, and lumber than I know what to do with. I was clearing trees just for aesthetic purposes and had nothing to do with the wood, which I feel would be untrue to life, every log and branch would likely have gone to good use. Either there's not enough to build or the requirements need to just be far higher in order to keep the player from feeling to comfortable at this stage. I think most of the time these early humans were probably just looking for food and any free time to collect wood to produce excess housing or or ammenities would probably have been a relief, but I'm sure there was no time at which the neolithic man could be like: yeah, I'm fine for now. To help this maybe just increase the amount of food a population member eats, or set the animals and plants a little more scattered throughout the map to make foraging and hunting more costly.

but only kill one of them and head back to camp. a group of raiders using throwing spears take out two towers and a gate

Dawn of man starts you with a bunch of Grugs scrouning by in small settlements but with the development of new technologies you end up with a smal citystate.
This type of citybuilder is the slow relaxing type, while food can be a big problem at the start most of the time the game is very forgiving and technologies research can be very slow. So if you search for a rapid exanding gamestyle you might be dissapointed

The positives: Nice visuals, Good comfy tribal music music, you feel a sense of progress with almost every single tech develoment, updates impriving the game, most pc should be able to run it unless you're also still in the neolithic era and a sure improvement over planetbase

The Negatives: Some problems from planetbase have been inherited like wonky combat with humans. I really hope this can be fixed with updates: Maybe instead of being basic goons let them steal resources and children so you're really punished for lacking proper defence, Boost towers health and some variety would be appreciated like traps and make them reference certain invasions like the sea peoples where massive waves can come in for a near endgame challenge.

The meh: trade is very basic, don't get me wrong it's functional but nearby tribal trading villages on the map would be cool as partners/rivals. Again references can be made to real life where the stone age period can be the current basic trading while the metal ones can start to have coins and trade breakdowns inflating prices. Diplomacy would be interesting but not neccesary.

Here are some ways it would be great to see the game develop:

1. Demographics: On a certain level, the point of this game is to grow your little tribe/village, and yet so much of population management feels haphazard. I don't really care when I lose villagers to raiders/wild animals/illness, because I know they'll just be topped up with an endless stream of convenient wanderers from the wilderness. It feels very gamey, and makes things lower-stakes. Why do hunter-gatherers have better birth control than many modern people? I'd much rather be pushed to meet the needs of natural population increase. That would be more fun, more of a challenge, and more realistic. What if there were a ""life expectancy"" stat, and the player was rewarded for managing to have villagers survive to old age? What if that were necessary for some sort of cultural/tech achievement? I realise a totally realistic system here would require lots of dead kids, and I can understand that might be too depressing, so maybe magically allow them to all make it to adulthood. The point is it should MATTER if I lose a lot of villagers, and in the current system, it doesn't really. Also, perhaps you could introduce a researchable tech/cultural practice that lets the player set a target population level, and then send surplus people out as emigrants when they attain adulthood? This would also explain where the raiders are coming from!

2. Tech: I don't think any society ever has had a single village that managed to just singlehandedly invent their way into the Iron Age, and it feels very flat to do so. The tech system suits the paleolithic and I guess mesolithic eras well, but once you get to agriculture it's silly. It should rely much, much more heavily on trade/outside contact. Here's an idea: have some technologies be ""templates"" that must be acquired from traders/migrants, and then purchased with tech points in the usual way.

3. Dietary variety: currently it doesn't seem to make any appreciable difference what my people eat and drink (other than beer). There should be a reward for greater dietary variety, and some disincentive to just having meat and water or whatever. Ideally this wouldn't just be contentment-based, but also have an impact on health. Currently the great variety of stuff to eat is, from a gameplay perspective, mostly pointless window-dressing. The assets are already there; it would be great if they mattered.

4. Pottery: potters should exist as a separate crafting area from mesolithic on, and make not only water vessels, but also some sort of decorative/cultural goods that villagers like to have in their homes, and which can be traded.

5. Trade: Some goods should *only* be available from trade; maybe precious stones, maybe foreign foods to increase dietary variety, whatever. Currently as my village gets *more* complex I actually have *less* need for trade to plug the gaps, which seems silly. Maybe have it so that some random goods can be bought more cheaply than they can be locally produced, encouraging specialisation? As mentioned above, technology and culture should also be much more reliant on trade/outside contact.

6. Culture: my biggest beef, this aspect of world-building is severely lacking. It makes me care less about everything from the paleolithic on, that the culture is apparently just ""default"". Like modern people in reality still *consume* cultural products from the bronze age (Homeric poetry, the epic of Gilgamesh, monotheism). So, it's really disappointing to see them missing from the game; especially considering my village had the ingenuity to singlehandedly invent every tech artifact up to that point. Perhaps these are all the ancestors of engineers. It would be cool to see culture integrated with technology perhaps, as in ""cultural technologies"": monogamy, medicine (could even have a few levels: splinting, assisting childbirth, healing herbs, even primitive birth control) ancestor-worship, written law, etc. In terms of religious practices, maybe the worship of particular archetype deities could infer different bonuses/maluses? Or perhaps, let the player determine aspects of the village's cultural development, again with different trade-offs: warlike vs peaceable, pastoralists versus agriculturalists, free love vs. monogamous pairings, etc.

7. Work Roles/Hierarchy: from the bronze age on, priests, warriors, farmers, traders and nobles should perhaps be separate roles.

It felt like an early access game with sparse content and some major balance issues. But now, more than a year later, I'm pleased to report that the content updates have added some significant improvements. There are still some issues with the game, but it's now fleshed out and polished enough that I've found myself enjoying it for hours on and end and getting stuck in those loops of ""I'll just play for 15 more minutes"" that are so common for great city builders.

I've edited my original review to reflect the new changes, and added some new thoughts based on the additional playtime I've put in.

I love city building games and real-time strategy games. In particular, I've been waiting for someone to pick up and run with some of the ideas introduced by [i]Banished[/i], which was a good game with a few fundamental flaws that kept it from really being great. [i]Dawn of Man[/i] is (kind of) the game I've been waiting for. While it doesn't fix all of [i]Banished[/i]'s flaws, it builds on a lot of the great ideas [i]Banished[/i] had while also mixing up the formula enough to feel like its own game.

The gameplay loop is simple - you place blueprints for structures to build, create work areas to harvest resources, mark animals for hunting, and fend off raiders and wild animal attacks. When the game first released, the AI didn't seem to be great about prioritizing tasks, which could lead to resources decaying after remaining uncollected for too long. But that seems to have been fixed, so there's not much micromanagement required - you just define tasks for your people and they'll take care of the rest. It's nice to not have to do tedious micromanagement, but on the other hand, sometimes it feels like the AI does [i]too[/i] much for you, to the point that it can sometimes feel like the game is playing itself.

Probably my biggest complaint is that advancing through the tech tree is slow, and the method of advancement feels poorly designed and unrewarding. The primary way you gain ""knowledge"" points, which are used to unlock new tech, is by reaching milestones for having a certain number of specific buildings, or harvesting a certain number of specific resources, or hunting a certain number of specific animals. For instance, you get points building your first skull pole, and then more points when you've built five of them; for resources, you get points for catching 1/10/100 fish, etc. But you're limited in how many resources you can harvest throughout the year, because there are only so many berries to harvest and animals to hunt. Therefore, the fastest way to advance is to build pointless buildings that you don't actually need. But this in turn requires more resources which can only be acquired through hunting, at least until you've unlock animal domestication. Thus, for a large part of the game, your economy and tech tree are very reliant on hunting which means you're kind of stuck if there aren't any animals nearby.

Overall, I think there's still a lot of room for improvement in [i]Dawn of Man[/i]. I'd like to see a more expansive tech tree, more options for structures to build and items to craft to allow for a more diverse economy, and most importantly, some rebalancing of how you advance through the game. But with the updates it has had to date, it has already evolved from what I felt was a fairly empty and tedious experience to a fun little city builder that provides an enjoyable way to pass the time while listening to podcasts or watching YouTube. I'm still waiting for the perfect combination of [i]Age of Empires[/i], [i]Banished[/i] and [i]Cities: Skylines[/i], but [i]Dawn of Man[/i] is a step in the right direction.",1551935189,1596429147,True,0,0,0.522985219955444336,0,True,False,False

I actually enjoyed the game until it became a non-stop party of either starving or low on resources.  This isn't a micro-manage game it's a babysitter game.

Then you have the raiders.  This isn't frequent I'd say, so it's not a non stop thing but it always happens at the worst time (doubt that's a coincidence).  You can either have just taken down some walls to put up new ones (here come the raiders through the hole), or right as harvest starts (here come the raiders and suddenly you're a season behind), and with that you're starving again, and with that people are dying of starvation, and with that you're even more behind... finally.. you stop the dying... get back to static with a 10% loss in population or more........... HERE COME THE RAIDERS.  Once you reach the later eras, especially iron age, you better have put in tons of time just sitting around watching AI move around or it does become an annoying no way to catch up mode.

I enjoyed the idea of moving through the ages with nothing but what you can scrape by. Common sense plays a big part at the beginning because over-expanding or over-gathering materials can cause problems for you later (such as hunting down an entire population of animals, over-fishing your rivers, or needlessly farming out veins.

This is a survival/city builder game set between the stone age and the iron age. You start off with a few settlers in the middle of nowhere and must grow a small settlement in order to survive. You will hunt animals, craft weapons and tools, manage the expansion of your settlement and research new technologies.

So far, I am enjoying the game. I don't usually find city builders that easy to get into, banished for example took awhile to sink my teeth into but this game makes managing your resource gathering and crafting etc, much easier. There's very little micromanagement in the game, unless you want to do that. This is because the game offers you tools to direct your tribe members with without having to go through every detail. For example, place a stick gathering work area around nearby sticks and people will automatically gather and stockpile the sticks. It's very handy.

Crafting is a bit more hands on, you can select what to craft and how much of it you want and you might need to craft ingredients for other things first but it's still all very simple. The UI is great and you can keep track of what you have and need very easily. There's also never any player idling really. There's always things to do whether it be building tents to expand your settlement or moving work areas or crafting gear or looking for specific animals in the nearby area to hunt down.

A great little city builder game with good survival mechanics. Really well executed and definitely worth the price on this sale.

Now that I have played this game for some time, I have chosen to edit my review with further information.

I found I didn't really get any replayability out of it, once I had completed the 1st city hitting all of the milestones, I found that I didn't really enjoy starting over, which is odd, since that's kinda what you do in the campaign style city builders.  I also found that the late game was dull, pretty much just leave it on auto and they pause to kill bandits, then back to auto.

Would I still recommend it? yeah I kinda would, I got a good few hours from the game even if I probably wont play it again.",1594026397,1596234989,True,14,1,0.607757568359375,0,True,False,False

Dawn of Man might be missing a few features such as ocean or beautiful waterfalls, caves. Just play Dawn of Man Man because it is cool!!!!!!!!

Pros: Good graphics.
         Somewhat plenty of options.
         Good population to about 200 peoples.
Cons: Lacking landscape features
          Poor AI standards
          Your villagers stand idle sometimes.
          When in Neolithic or Bronze Age you must harvest your farms quickly and have plenty of meat or

I hope the game's development is not finished because if a few things were improved and added to this game it could be one of the great simulations.

The tech tree is poorly paced. It is really slow at first and then about 3/4 of the way through there is nothing left to research. All of the tools and weapons are the same things just made of 4-5 different materials as you progress.
I would love to be able to raid the raiders. My tribe got tired of being pacifist. The map is wonderful but devoid of any human life. I wish there were other villages to visit and trade with or raid. I would love to see siege weapons added to the tech tree in order to pillage other villages on the map. Why else am I making all these weapons?

July 19th review update: It's worth the 25$ and has more than the game Banished has to offer. The creators clearly aren't finished with this game, and I trust them to develop it further, thus making the current cost worth it. If they up and stop developing, I'd say it's probably worth it on sale.

+Very nice Graphics
+Lots of flexibility on how to set up your village
+A slight learning curve...I died (on previous patches) a lot at the beginning learning how to feed and care for my villagers...but I need this sort of challenge for me to get into a game
+The setting is AMAZING. Neolithic??? and as you develop you travel through time...(minor spoliers) multiple species of animals around you start dying out, eventually becoming extinct, while newer more familiar animals start replacing them
+That being said...the EDUCATIONAL aspect of the game. You learn a lot about what scientists believe happened in our early evolution

-Some realism is lost when Mamoths parade through camp
-There are some balancing twerks that are constantly made by developers...though this really isn't much of a con, just know that resource gathering/damage in battles etc may be unbalanced and changed in future updates
-it feels kind of lonely...then out of nowhere raiders come for no reason that to fk your sht up. it seems kind of random, though it does move the game forward giving you reason to invest in defenses. but I'd like an expansion on this.

+Please let us manage hunting better...like picking out specific hunters that become better as they survive hunts...and which weapons they will use...which targets they pick (like, younger/old targets instead of healthy adults, carnivores vs herb etc)
+Raiders could use more character...who are they and why are they raiding? can we raid back? Are they our species, or maybe a neanderthal? 
+A family tree and ability to rename our villagers...give us a reason to care about them when they die. Maybe a small page of major events that happened throughout their lives...like surviving an illness or getting thrown by a Woolly Rhino?",1589835737,1595188222,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is fun and very engaging. I have played several games already and have started a new one. This said, there are a number of things about the game I feel could be improved. Here are some remarks that are made in the spirit of positive criticism. 
1. Planning the village is difficult as there are no 'ghost' versions of the buildings. By 'ghost' building, I mean a blueish rendition that can be put down although the technology hasn't been discovered yet and won't be built until replaced at a later date but can act as a placeholder. This would enormously simplify the long term planning. I wish everything could be assigned a place from the beginning, even fields. To be effective, these ghosts could be put down over trees and other resources but only if the cleared ground underneath would allow for it.
2. The characters waste an inordinate amount of time walking to and from locations with partial loads. If sent to gather sticks, adults come back with one faggot instead of the three or two they can actually carry. The same is true when you send an adult to fetch meat/raw skins/bones; they come back with only one taken from a pile of a dozen or so. However, if they 'decide' to go on their own, they come back with their hands full. Similarly, the characters will cross an entire field to reach their assigned tile to work on, passing several other tiles that need to be worked on.
3. All fruit trees can eventually be planted, but not raspberries, blackberries, strawberries (all 3 grow like weeds) and blueberries (easy to transplant if the climate is right), nor can firs and oaks be planted (oaks are not difficult to plant as you only need to plant their nut). The result is that the characters still need to roam the forest in search of berries (also returning with resources you are currently cultivating) and tannin even though they must also contend with fields that need tending every season.
4. The greatest number of items you can highlight is 20, but a field counts 25 (5 x 5).
5.Hunting needs some polish. If you tag an animal to be hunted, the game will send a minimal number of characters, often resulting in their deaths. Two hunters cannot bring down a mammoth. This requires at least 7-10 hunters. On the other hand, if you select a large group holding down the H key and then order them to bring down a beast, they'll go as they are, some carrying loads of resources, others a spear or bow but no knife, none with any food making a long trip very hazardous. There is no 'prepare to hunt' function. There is no planning, often resulting in half the group leaving to go back to camp leaving the other half in a lurch. In real life this would spell death and often does in this game, too.

It's like at some point developers decided that making proper games just... doesn't worth the effort and started releasing a freeplay mode as the real deal. The problem is... it isn't. It's just a freeplay mode. You know, something you play [i]after[/i] you're done with the campaign. You can say that freeplay mode is where all the juice is and you know what? You'll be right, [i]but[/i] it's pretty much the same thing with saying that skirmishes in [b]Command & Conquer[/b] and [b]StarCraft[/b] are the most important things. Technically – yes, that's where you'll spend most of your single player time. But is it really fun starting with those? And can you really call a strategy game without proper series of pre-made missions with the unique story and conditions a real deal? Sure, some of us would probably recall games like Sim City. And again, technically it'll be correct. But the thing is – games like [b]Dawn of Man[/b] and [b]Banished[/b] (because yes, these two are pretty similar) are not nearly as complicated as [b]Sim City[/b], where you can get hours of fun just because of that juicy micromanagement. Games like this? They're much more simple. Like, you know, early [b]Settlers[/b], or good ol' [b]Caesar[/b]. And that's exactly what brings us to my question. Why can't they do it anymore?

I mean, [b]Blue Byte[/b] made a proper campaign for their [b]Settlers[/b] in [b]1993[/b]. [b]Impressions Games[/b] did it in [b]1995[/b], which brought their [b]Caesar[/b] to brand new level. Even clones like [b]Knights and Merchants[/b] and [b]Alien Nations[/b] (AKA [b]Die Völker[/b]) used to have it back in the days. But nope, when it's about present times, we can only have half of the fun. Because yes, [b]Madruga Works[/b] is not an exception and what we've got here? It's just yet another one of those “freeplay only” games. Which, let's admit it, often feel way too similar to each other. Too similar to actually bother. I mean, you know why [b]The SIMS[/b], despite all of its popularity, never had too much clones? Because when those started to appear, it turned out that nobody cares about them. There was enough [b]SIMS[/b] to keep people occupied. And even sexual content (yes, even [b]Playboy[/b] magazine tried itself in the genre) wasn't enough to make the difference. When it's about games, in which we're supposed to invest many hours, you either offer people the next big thing or people will just stick with what they already have. Because why paying for a new game, while you're satisfied with your current one and both feel almost identical, right? That's the problem.

When it's about [b]Dawn of Man[/b]? There's a very similar thing going on. Sure, prehistoric setting is charming. And if you like that kind of stuff as much as I do? It'll be pretty hard for you to skip this one. I grew up with the books like [b]Jack London[/b]'s [b]Before Adam[/b] and [b]J.-H. Rosny[/b]'s [b]The Quest for Fire[/b]. And, let's just say that this kind of stuff became very special to me since then. There's just something... awesome about experiencing humanity's first steps. And the fact that there are not so many games about that time period sure adds a lot of interest here. Unfortunately, you can't just sell setting. You need something to make people bother. And when it's about unique gameplay? Let's just say that if you've played [b]Banished[/b] not so long ago, you'll get bored here after only one hour. Yet another generic city builder with yet another generic set of buildings. That's pretty much it. Build more homes to make more people to join your tribe, gather resources, try to survive. You know the drill. Nothing new, nothing interesting. Even visually [b]Dawn of Man[/b] is nothing special, while [b]UI[/b] is far from being the most comfortable out there. Everything in this game is just... fine. At best.

Thankfully, it's not [i]that[/i] bad. Despite what I've said above, [b]Dawn of Man[/b] comes with a couple of nice touches. Three of them to be exact. First – the hunting. It's hard to imagine the prehistoric stuff without the hunting and thankfully, it's one of those things that [b]Madruga Works[/b] got totally right. In [b]Dawn of Man[/b] hunting is not only important, it's also unique and interesting. By pressing a button on your keyboard, you'll get access to the advanced view which will help you to determine the danger of your prey. Doesn't sound big, but trust me, it [i]does[/i] add a lot. Both to gameplay and the atmosphere.

Another thing is the seasons. Nothing really special, a lot of other games done that before, but in [b]Dawn of Man[/b] you'll actually need to preserve food for winter to help your people to survive, so... let's just say that seasons mean more time to sow grain here. Winter is a thing here (insert [b]Game of Thrones[/b] quote here). And, unlike games like [b]Beasts & Bumpkins[/b], which used to make you feel it too, you'll be able to properly prepare to it. Finally, in this game we have research tree. Some sort of mix between what we had in [b]Age of Empires[/b] and typical [b]4x[/b] stuff. Again, nothing really special, but it gives you a nice evolution feeling, so... yeah. Nice stuff. [b]Madruga Works[/b] even tried to add scenarios but unfortunately, that's where they failed pretty hard. In [b]Dawn of Man[/b] we got only four scenarios, three of which are just boring and stupid, while the last one is a dull and pathetic mess, where you should move a couple of units from [b]A[/b] to [b]B[/b]. Not enough? Feel free to check out [b]Steam Workshop[/b]. Because why bother making something while people can do your job for you, right?

So... yeah. You like prehistoric stuff and desperately need a freeplay city builder? [b]Dawn of Man[/b] will do. It totally will. There's nothing especially bad about it. It works fine, it looks fine, it feels fine... In other words, [i]it's fine[/i]. C'est [i]OKAY![/i] But if you've played a lot of such games before and just finished [b]Banished[/b]? [b]Dawn of Man[/b] will feel a lot like a waste of money. Because aside from a couple of cute little ideas? There's nothing really special about it. And it's really sad. You know? Unlike people in this game, at some point city building genre stopped evolving and started to move back. [b]Madruga Works[/b] ignored pretty much everything that people like [b]Impressions Games[/b] achieved since early [b]90s[/b] and returned back to [b]1992[/b]. When the first [b]Caesar[/b] was a thing. And it's really sad that almost twenty years since [b]Black & White[/b] people are satisfied with something as basic as [b]Dawn of Man[/b].

Defenses work fairly well, my only complaint is the difficulty in wall placement and the ability for raiders to path over terrain that seems to be impassable and devoid of walls. That said, if you manage to hit your defenses early upon their arrival, the tribe usually manages to take the raiders out suffering minor (or no) casualties.

The main thing I like about DoM is the AI; the way that the game gets stuff done without me having to directly tell it to. I just set out a few instructions and the rest is done for me - this makes managing a large population of individuals very easy.
The biggest issue though is the broken parts of priority, and the main flaw in the AI. One thing I always struggle with is maintaining a population in the copper age, without them all starving to death. No matter which route I take, from lots of farms set to high priority, to disabling repairs on as much stuff as possible, to enforcing tighter item limits than I had in the stone age, this is Always a problem. 
The issue is that my farms are almost always left half-harvested, or less. Why? They're all set to high priority, and they were always done fully before, even when my population was smaller. So what's happening? 
As far as I can see, the issue is that, when the game queues up tasks, it doesn't mark high priority tasks to be done first overall, only for them to be done first of the assigned tasks; of which, it only assigns a portion of them at a time. This means there is a long period between these tasks being done, where the ""harvest"" task just isn't queued up. At larger populations, this means that even more tasks are queued beforehand, and the problem snowballs. From there, people are needed to maintain a settlement designed for a larger population than is available, and you slowly decline into a famished, 200% workload mess.

When I mark things as top priority, I want them done before Anything else. Not just moved to the top of the queue, but queued up first too. Please.",1594660923,1594660923,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

This game could overwhelm you with information. Tooltips about crop yeilds, and which season they get planted versus harvested. How long it takes for a patch of trees to regrow; that at first your main goal should be getting through winter and keeping your food stores full, instead of building pretty things and indirectly causing famine. Instead it tells you none of this. Gives basic information and basic control (HUD & keybinding). What seems to be the ultimate goal is to get your people set up to take care of themselves. Sit back, automate your tribe / village / town s' seasonal workload. Study its patterns and adjust for season changeover (eg: straw harvests in autumn; expect workload boost at end of summer if you've planted it somewhere). When you can load up a save in the Iron age, sit back and watch them ""Live"" season to season at x8 speed without worrying if they will die out... You've ""won""

Defining ""historical"" moments for my tribes.

I started on this game with enthusiasm. First off, I love city builders. The concept here is neat, working your way through prehistoric times is a bit novel. The graphics look pretty good, but maybe not AAA status, but that's just fine by me.

As I played through a few hours over the course of a few days, I kept getting excited to see what I would unlock next and what milestone I would complete. The more I accomplished, the less rewarding it felt, and getting the last few items in the skill tree was fairly trivial. Here are some details.

- Surviving the winter in the beginning can be a challenge, but by the end, I could lose 10 people and not care. Even raids from other tribes eventually became just a nuisance rather than a real threat to my longevity.
- Certain materials can be hard to come by when they are newly unlocked, but with a large enough population, I was bringing in more resources than I could ever hope to use, and I had nothing to do with them. Constantly using resources for upgrades/building higher level resources only takes you so far, and there's nothing to be done with a surplus except store it. Trading becomes meaningless when you have more than you would ever need of everything.
- Domesticating animals is fun and exciting, hoping to build enough of a herd that they don't all die out at once, while not overpopulating. For me though, the game turned into a culling simulator, as I reached a point where destroying half of my animals every year was not enough to slow the growth. Then all my food started rotting because I had too much, but I didn't lose anything for it, so I didn't care. I shouldn't be able to get a free pass for such waste, and the long-run goal should scale up difficulty at least a little bit.

At the end of the day, I got a few fun hours out of Dawn of Man, but I sadly see little reason to play again.",1594063087,1594063087,True,107,1,0.894034802913665771,2,True,False,False

really NOTHING fits and they keep focussing on the wrong parts with their patches, if they improve something at all instead of downgrading good working stuff.
there aren't many games that i regret to have bought, but this is one of them, along with spellforce 3 and tropico 5.
THE GAME IS SIMPLY UNFINISHED! it's not even 50% finished...!
you have no birds (chicken, no?), no reptiles (crocs...?), no rodents (ofc no mice in the corn storage!), no cats (meow :<), no bees (r they pollinating by hand with makeup sticks?), ...to put it mildly, there's nothing. oh well okay there is from time to time a bird of prey flying through your screen, scaring you, irritating you.
then there is no medicine, altho mankind used herbs for millenia.
you also don't have shrooms, neither foodshrooms nor psyshrooms, altho mankind was taking extremely many psychoactive stuff back then, especially the clerus.
NOW, to the MAJOR FLAW:
not a single one of the time ages is correct.
ingame you get hillgraves in the paleolithicum, stonehenges in steel age. in reality, henge-massgraves have been the NEOLITHIC way of burying dead, whilst hillgraves were the next step, during bronze age.
then, ingame you START getting acces to the domestic animals, when in reality, mankind had them MILLENNIA before.
you will get horses like 10'000 years too late and then you still can't ride them, altho riding them was what man did long before putting carts on them.
then also, ancient egypt had an ARMY of thousands of chariot riders in the bronze age, roughly 4500 years ago in reality. ingame? pah, you can wait for the iron age until you get simple transport carts.
and then the tools... they are plain horrible. in reality, flintstone knifes are alot sharper then bronze, copper, tin & iron-knifes. if you believed that the devs would've cared for that, you're on the woodway.
the devs also seem not to care that ""the earthen oven for breadbaking"" was invented in the neolithicum, not in the (nonexistant) steel age and that it's efficiency got only SLIGHTLY improved since back then; which was first by a separated ""heatbox"" and later by a chimney that lead the hot smoke along the entire roof of the oven away, to make use of the smoke's heat.
BUT, HERE COMES TOP OF THE TOP OF ALL FLAWS:
the stamina system is 180° turned around from reality.
in reality, man started dominating because man has no pelt and can sweat, altho running slower. this had the effect that humans ran slower, but FAR longer distances, because with the sweat, humans cool down their bodies whilst heating them up, which animals cant, not even elefants who do not have pelts. so, actually, animals should run much faster then they do right now, but have only a low maximum stamina. and yes, this would probably feel slightly gamebreaking for the devs, but that's why Man HAD a Dawn AT ALL...!

summa summarum i can only say:
dear devs, go back to school, get your crap done right and THEN come back in 10 years with a FINISHED game.
right now, this is an expensive crookery.
with 150h playtime, i really tried to enjoy it.

PS: the divisors in the game aren't representing reality very well, everything should be multiplied by x10. amounts of harvest, amounts of ppl and so on. the area that the settlements need up right now are not comparable to reality. and i'm missing viking longhouses where animals just slept inside with the humans.",1567630807,1593884354,False,0,0,0.434782594442367554,1,True,False,False

I loathe all forms of learning missions, because they halt the fun of discovery. It insults my intelligence as I go cross-eyed with tooltips and pauses.
This game is self-explanatory enough to understand what you need to do. A tutorial is unnecessary.

My past experience with city builder games is limited to ""Kingdoms and Castles"". Very similar game in terms of resource management. I also am a avid micro-managing game player with the Age of Empires series.

But with just that experience, I was able to easily walk into a new game as a nomadic tribe, and have 9 villagers with a mildly sustainable economy.

This game plays slow. To give you time to decide what to do next. You can easily discover all the menus on your own. A nice touch was the ability to customize the ui menus for certain resources. Have all or no information. Then you can speed through the droll of watching your villagers get things done.

I honestly think the game is intended to be this slow because I would assume late-game content is lacking at the moment.


Villager management currently is not optimal.

Yes, there's an issue most players have with the responsiveness of villagers to tasks. It can be tricky to track if anyone is doing the jobs you give them. It doesn't help that they walk everywhere. 

Hunting can be crippling if you are just throwing wooden spears at an reindeer. If left unchecked, 2-3 of your villagers can be miles away from camp and they will be exhausted when walking back.

The villager camera is a interesting feature that I find myself using casually for immersion. 

You acquire Knowledge points by building huts, special production pieces like a tanning rack or tool shack. Points can also be acquired from storing large amounts of resources. You also get them from killing new animals, which feels weird to think killing a rhino means now I can use slingshots or domesticate dogs.

This style of game is among my favorite of all. This game does a really good job of giving you just enough things to micromanage without overwhelming you like some of its competitors. You get to decide how many things you will allow your people to craft, gather, etc, which is nice. 

Room for improvement: Raiders! They're boring, they never attack in any kind of force that is even slightly threatening. There is no point. You can't ""retaliate"" which has to be the biggest let down. Raiders end up being nothing more than a free morale boost and some free gear. 

No Purpose: This is the bane of all sandbox style games, and of course ""the journey"" is the point of these games, but there is nothing to do other than push into the next ""age"". 

Food: Dried out food the entire game? No cooked meat, no stews, nothing? Dried food from cave-man to steel weapons!?

What I feel the game lacks:
QoL speaking:
-Explain what exactly each tech unlocks (you have to go to help a search for it)
-Time track how many years you have survived
-Storage filter on houses
-Shortcuts to actions
-Consumption information, you have no idea how much will it cost to have an animal or human in your village

AI:
-When defending against an animal attack, your people will keep running to reach the danger source even if it's already dead
-Raiders could vary their behavior, they will ALWAYS rush to kill your people. What about targeting kids, burning things up, stealing and running, dividing into groups.
-Wolfs could have a chance to attack when you try to domesticate them

Other stuff:
-The crafter and food dryer are kept as a pre-historic, stick and dry skin structures until bronze age
-Work areas are... strange. You have very specific ones, and 1-2 very broad ones. You have ""pick sticks"" and ""CHOP DOWN ALL THE TREES IN THIS AREA"" or ""pick stones"", ""pick flint"" and ""MINE ANYTHING"" it'd be better if you could just place a work area and select which resource should be retrieved from that area if available.
-Lack of keyboard shortcuts
-I was never able to find another village, it would be nice to be able to attack for example, or try and sell something to other villages instead of playing passive all the time, waiting for every interaction to come to you
-The game doesn't do a good job at pushing you to go forward on more casual play",1552095502,1592836623,True,1,0,0.530386745929718018,0,True,False,False

How can you do such a good game and though ruin it so badly!!!

The game is to a certain extent enjoyable and potentially excellent. But they make the typical mistake, a management game without management tools, unless you want to do every fucking thing clicking:

- Animal limits are a nonsense. If I want only 20 sheeps, why do I f***ng have 38??
- ¿Why can't I choose a sex ratio? male goats and bulls produce no milk, PLEASE, don't make me search and kill between 40 goats.
- Prioritary tasks only make a disappointing effect. If I f****ng chose my crops ONE by ONE and set them to high priority, why in the 7 hells do people do other non prioritary tasks such as reparisons or collecting water and only 5% crops were harvested if the previous year in the same conditions 90% were? A more flexible priority system (low, mid, high, max) would help. If you let me ask, tasks prioritised by season and with a true effect would be sweet.
- AI hunting often fails to make a tight group of hunters and animals scatter unless you do ridiculously careful micromanagement. And they should run more as sometimes the herd has gone miles away by the hunting pack starts to march
- double Rclick makes people run to map points, but not to interactive objectives. It's ********* frustrating.
- Dogs are the most useless junk ever, absolutely uninteresting. They should somehow join hunting parties and not only defend with their poor statistics. The only time when they're more than an aesthetic addition is during enemy attacks.
- Sometimes villagers don't fill all their capacity with materials, making them insultingly inefficient, while other times they do, making 3 or 4 times better performance.
- UI tools are insufficient and not too accesible: 3 or 4 clicks to come to some of the juiciest info tools is too much considering the enormous amount of micromanagement that the previous flaws/bugs imply.

What bothers me is that the game is not that difficult, the top challenge is to coexist with the big flaws in the design. If you create a complex management game such a survival city, your tools and interface should have the highest standards and if you need time to program such tools, the game should be made simple enough as to be manageable with the existing tools while better ones are beeing developed. Otherwise, it ruins the fun.

The game is potentially one of the best and biggest survival city builders of all times, but it needs tonnes of improvements to be a fully enjoyable game.

SECOND REVIEW

After a not too deep but effective overhaul, the game is a lot more playable. Still lots of potential towars becoming one of the best games of its genre in all time, because of the continuous support.

It is still being worked on but the pace is way too slow. We desperately need new buildings, new trader mechanic (useless in late game), more challenging battles.. 

The issues with villagers walking across to their deaths to perform tasks has not been fixed all this time. You cannot make remote outposts because the NPCs are so stupid they will go to them back and forth for daily functions instead of using the facilities right in front of them, resulting in horrible lack of labor and even more ""walking deaths""

A lot has been improved since  this game came out but more  is left to be done. I fear, no i know that at this pace, it will never be finished.

Still, for 24$ you can get quite a few hours from it. And i suppose in very very late game you can just have fun trying to relocate your entire village to a new place closer to virgin resource",1591766274,1591766357,True,40,1,0.784553706645965576,3,True,False,False

Pros:
- Beautiful game visually

- Concept is so neat and really gets you excited to start (unfortunately gets old quickly)

Cons:
- It's core gameplay loop gets old. It's very repetitive.

- Advancing through the ages gets you ""better"" stuff, but not really ""newer"" stuff. You get stronger tools and weapons, but none of them are really all that different in style from the earlier ones. This is especially true for weapons.

- Combat gets old really quick. I just fast-forward through it. The devs should redo it.

- Too much tedious management. I can't believe I am saying I have to manage too much in a town management game. Managing is the point and all, but the AI is too dumb. The AI makes you micromanage more than you really should need to and it becomes tedious after awhile.

this  should still be in early access regardless i had fun playing the game because i was craving for a better banished gameplay i read a thread which summarize the update it needs i hope the devs read it at the community.

the upside is it looks like the devs still support the game after its release. i like the new update gives us paugh and transport post  which gives the game better gameplay i hope they continue until the game is considered complete 

one of the annoying issues i have is the ai response example when you prioritize work the ai should focus on that work and cancel all the other work until they finished the high prioirty work .

but the ai behavior is to finish all the current jobs before taking action to the priority so for example when you are at harvest season before they take priority for harvest they needed to finish all their jobs ending in loss time for the harvest costing you your long awaited crops which is very annoying banished ai is not perfect but it works they should make that their baseline 

so yeah the ai need work

The game, for what it is, is still an amazing experience that anyone who likes Banished style city builders will love. The only reason I'm even mentioning any of this feedback is that the game is pretty close to a perfect game, for me at least.

I've had pretty much the same experience as davjekar, as far as the AI goes. I'm still going to keep playing the game, I'll probably play it a lot more in future, but it can be incredibly frustrating. I've had a couple of scenarios now where my food has run low. I micromanage and get a couple of people to kill an animal near my base, which they do, only then they ignore the meat. Normally right-clicking on meat will force the person you've selected to pick it up (or eat it first if they're starving). In this situation clicking the meat does nothing. Then you go into a starvation loop and people start dying. Once you get into a starvation loop, forget about it, you're not getting out of that nose dive. 

It feels unfair rather than unrealistic. I generally love games like this where you can be crippled by the environment, but I at least like to feel like it's my fault. Not someone starving to death when there is a couple of Aurochs worth of meat lying on the ground slowly despawning.

Job assignment needs to be improved as well as how the AI works generally. I believe most problems with this game could be fixed with a change from ""Assign X resources to a general job"" to a system where you can assign specific numbers of specific people to a task.

It could even be unlocked as part of the transition to the Bronze Age as a skill and make sense within the context of the game. If a person is assigned to a builder role they will gain an efficiency boost at that but will lose efficiency in other tasks. Everyone can still muck in and do everything but they'll be better at what they spend their time doing.

It's still a very good game. Buy it, play it, you probably won't regret it. But if you're not the type of person that can deal with these types of minor frustrations, who's not willing to re-load a save and lose some progress, this may not be an ideal fix for you.",1591037910,1591120704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Believe me, I want to give this game a thumbs up, I really really want to, but I can't.

I tried quite some different play styles but in every case you run into problems where you just think - is this what the devs think what a good idea is?

Let's start with what's good:
The setting is quite unique and that you can progress through the ages is quite interessting and fun.
All different ages have their different aspects, different animals and so on.
Graphics are just fine and, at least in my case, the game always run pretty smoothly.

But what is with the gameplay itself?
Puh. It could be good, but it tries its best to be not.
Let me list just a few:
The game doesn't feature ""professions"" for your citizens. The only thing you got are little flags to set working spaces which define what should be done. But this works terrible and breaks everything else. You will see my point if you read further.
The way the game handle tasks seems to be kind of random, if a citizen has nothing to do they probably just get the next task in line. But this is a huge problem: Your people will walk way to long paths, will do one thing on the one end of your city, will then do something on the opposite end and afterwards maybe even further away. This leds to so many different problems. Sometimes they just starve to death or die of thirst, they will take much longer as needed for even the simpliest tasks and so on.

Your animals won't stay in their shed, so if they need to drink they may walk way to far away, this is a similair issue as above. On top of that, if your people want to interact with them, they have to follow them. If you're unlucky they will die on their way back home. If not, you still got a task which took way to long to complete.

The same can be said for hunting. On some plays it worked quite well on others they tried to hunt the animals to the edge of the map, most of the time then the animals fled and everything was for nothing and your people die on the way back home. If they succeed they were way to far away to get home and die too.
Often they make a hit, the animal runs away, they try to chase it and make a hit again and so on. This repeats until they die or count as ""fled"". Which can be also really annoying as they may stand still next to your hunter with nearly no life.
You can do otherwise by controll your people manually... which will result in massive micro management as soon as your city becomes bigger.

But that's not even the biggest problem of the game, it can be handled quite easily to be honest. But what really grind my gears are the raiders. Raiders will come to your city to destroy and kill everything what they find. That's not a issue for itself but the execution is a mess.
You can try to prepare as good as possible, once you step into the next age, you won't be able to catch up the production of better equipment, because raiders spawn quite often and always have the newest tech. On hard mode this gets even worse as they progess on their own and of course they only go for the weapons. It's not like there are other cities which you could attack as well, no, they just spawn from time to time and on the later stages you will face little armys. It doesn't matter how strong your fort is. They will rush through it like it was nothing.

And this is the point. The last third of the game is not challenging, it is just annoying, badly balanced and not fun at all.

Besides that all the ages could be a little bit more fleshed out, as they seem nice, but are quite bland.
Also more variants for the buildings could make the cities look less artifical and more organic.

I could list much more and would like to describe it in more detail, but as you already noticed I'm not a native speaker and just tried my best to write a review that reach as most people as possible. Thank you.

That being said, I want to love it and I want to give thumbs up. But this is not a early access game. This is what the developers sell as a ""fully developed game"" and that's a shame.

Really really think twice if you want to buy it, even on sale.",1590765893,1590766297,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Both games are ant farm city builders that ostensibly have a survival theme, but ultimately have limited challenge once you figure out the game and the mechanics.  So I guess if you need a game enforcing goals to your sandbox you might not like it.

What ultimately takes the game to the next level is the fact that food spoils and rudimentary combat.  In Banished you can sock away 20,000 food and never worry about it again.  In Dawn Of Man that food will expire in about two seasons.

It creates a rhythm where each season takes on it's own identity.  Spring and Fall are spent harvesting and Summer and Winter are spent expanding the colony.

Lastly, once or twice yearly raids and predators animals threaten your colony with attrition, picking off a lone colonist or making you miss a harvest fighting.

It has all the basics you'd want, a sense of technology changing your city, balancing population growth with meeting your needs, defending against hostiles.

None of it has much depth - the tech tree is pretty limited, your city only changes so much, you're very limited in the area of the world you get to interact with, there's not other tribes to build relations with, there's no events that require any creative thought.

There are a hundred and one ways to play depending on whether you want to build a population in a more primitive environment, create multiple little villages and send people between them, create a farming vs. hunter/gatherer community, etc. I've made several settlements and each has become unique from the rest in a way that keeps me coming back to the game again and again. 

A few thought for future development would be to maybe have a yearly market of sorts with more than one trader where you can buy larger quantities of items. Finite resources such as stone do eventually run out and, while you need these resources less and less so long as you progress your settlement, it does limit the construction of additional buildings or re-buildings if necessary. Second, an option to make the seasons longer would be great. Third, having all the fields become harvestable at the start of the summer/fall rather than 3-4 fields. Once there is a large settlement with several hundred people and multiple fields, the harvest task can't be auto-populated until a whole field is harvested before another group of new high-morale people can begin moving toward it.

After all this time I've finally decided to write a review seeing I now have a good chunk of time invested, so here is my honest opinion.

The game's just too one dimensional and managing labor becomes very very tedious when dealing with larger populations. The game just starts to breakdown and starts to forget pathways  or the existence of certain labor duties, and it's not because of work overload. Farming, the main source of a majority of your resources is totally broken feature in this game. 

It still takes forever to go through the entire harvest season and this season adsorbs your entire labor pool and can last till the end of winter to gather all the resources and by time you finally harvest the fields the process is ready to start all over again and completely drain your labor pool again, which would be fine if the yields weren't so terrible. You would figure adding additional farms and additional settlers would fix this issue, but you will be wrong! The game doesn't support more than maybe 150 farming. after you go over a certain crop size settlers will only find pathways to certain tiles and completely ignore everything else and wont plant crops in the majority of the farm tiles. 

This issue has broke the game for me. Farming which is a necessity for advancing progress in the game, shouldn't be a broken feature. Also, why have work sleds and carts if the settlers can't even load the most obvious resource onto these pieces of equipment?",1590152363,1590152363,False,0,2,0,0,True,False,False
858810,69586615,76561198285735959,0,8,811,0,799,1626227418,"I want to start by stating that this isn't a bad game, rather my expectations were a bit too high, I think.

I'll start of with the good:
- The idea of the project is very ambitious and interesting, and I really applaud the game and its developers for it. The concept of progressing through the ages on such a micro-manageable city building game is something I've been wanting to play for a while now.
- It really feels like you're going from a hunter/gather society to an early civilization with agriculture, animal husbandry, and some other tech too (keep this ""other tech"" in mind, it is also a bad point). The moment I finally had enough farms and people to run them, I felt a great sense of accomplishment, as hunting animals was a very limited source of food.

The bad:
 - Once you have that ""horay""  moment from agriculture, the game kind of dies down. Later techs, starting on the copper age, are essentially upgrades of previous techs. You go from copper tools to bronze, then iron, then steel, but other than that, new buildlings or mechanics didn't develop. The game didn't ""evolve"" in the way it did when you started agriculture or animal domestication, and I caught myself wanting to play Civilization more than once for that sense of technological revolution (even if you can't get down to the very micro level with Civ, which this game does well).
- Buildings. It gets repetitive after a while. Again, after you have a steady supply of food from agriculture and your village starts to rapidly grow, it starts to get monotonous. You have one type of human house, one type of stable for animals (but no pastures.. feels kinda weird to have the animals just roaming around in the settlement. Dunno how historically accurate this is), one storage for food, one for other materials, one for hay, a crafting building, mines for extraction, a chain of three building to produce metal tools and of two buildings to make clothes, and your wall buildings.
- World generation. It was a bit too hilly for me (maybe it was the map I played). I felt constrained (this word will come back again) regarding how I could build my settlement.
- Resources. I didn't find a way to get easy access to the resources, like ores. They would run out, and I would have to venture further out to build more mines. Fine, it's realistic. But when you combine it to the hilly map, it feels like a mess. I was also disappointed I could not build something like a stone quarry, or replant trees for more wood. You'll be using a lot of stone and wood, and you will be going kind of far out to get it. Annoying.
- Not many monuments you can build. I felt like this would be a bigger part of the game. Again, lack of buildings, and it made me feel constrained.
- Odd, blocky grid system. Prevents you from getting that aesthetically pleasing and even efficient village layout.
- Camera angles. Can't get too close, or too high, or face very horizontal/vertical angles. Again, it felt constraining. Maybe even claustrophobic.
- Honestly, I just felt alone. When I saw that huge map, I was hoping for other settlements, other factions to interact with. There's none of that. You're the only village in that map. ""interaction with other factions"" only comes in the forms of the very limited trading agents that sometimes stop by your village, or by cheesy the raiders, that just pop out of nowhere. Combine that with the limited camera angles and the hilly, monotonous map, and I felt really, really alone, even after my village reached 150+ people.

Conclusion:
Aside from map generation terrain, camera, and perhaps the grid system, I think the game does what it does well. I just don't think it does enough. I would like to see more mechanics, more buildings (even if it is three types of stone house layouts instead of one) and different settlements and manners to interact with them, especially after you enter the copper age.

There are some headaches in terms of villager efficiency noted in other reviews (only picking up a single item when multiple are laying around with empty inventory slots, need for micromanagement for all hunting aside from very easy prey which will still often run away from you at lower levels without dogs to help), but as your village gets bigger you find yourself worrying less and less about this and by current end-game (Iron age tech and populations) I had a population just over 200 and I really didn't have to micromanage even hunting aside from pre-emptively removing predators and responding to raids.  This level of micromanagement is actually less than I'm used to doing for other colony sim games (I'm a huge Rimworld fan) and wasnt' a dealbreaker for me.  One legitimate complaint I have is that tech progression is quite slow as it is primarily attained through an achievement system (collect 500 and then 1000 then 5,00 of a resource, kill X number of raiders).  In fact I usually found myself waiting around to accumulate more research points and later discovered the panel which shows you how much you need of any give thing to get X number of tech points.  I got to where I was doing things like making extra buildings just for the tech points.  You can also get them through trading at steep prices which I liked and though was balanced.  I just wish I could send an expedition, or complete a task (have X excess resources to help a neighbor clan type quest) or something else to advance it further if I'm able to spare man-power and resources to speed things along more when I'm otherwise doing well.  Finally, I was a little disappointed with the end game.  I got every achievement in the initial campaign scenario, maxed out my village prestige, was over 200 population, and suddenly not only had nothing else to do, but nothing special happened.  No story progression, no new map type unlocked, no features unlocked, no ""good job you won"", just a maxed out prestige bar and a fully automated village which I can now walk away from until the next raid.

That's several downsides up front, but honestly I enjoyed the rest of the game, and plan on at least another play-through or so.  There are different map types (basically longer winters in one, more raiders in another it seems) for more challenge, and a couple smaller scenarios to play out, so depsite the lack of greater scale progression I wanted there is replay value and some variation.  The game seems balanced, if not slightly easy on standard difficulty.  The techs and progression are fun and feel significant.  The way the game manages the AI works reasonably well and is functional even if it requires tweaking for optimization even after setting things up with the work areas.  I enjoy this kind of game and I wasn't disappointed.  I do hope they continue to add content and further incentive to keep playing after you get all the techs as it could be great game--maybe rival villages to raid or snuff out, a final long winter to survive, or attain enough resources to start a second village with increased difficulty built in but with accruing advantages from your other villages based on decisions you made.  Still fun though as is, still worth checking out on sale.",1589915158,1589915158,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its an interesting take compared to games like Banished (and subsequent copies like Forest Village) which use a job-sheet system.  Here you basically set zones for your people to operate from.  You can also take direct control (somewhat) of your people for tasks like hunting.  Additionally there's the chance you get raided which gives me vibes of old school city builders like the Caesar franchise.  The tech tree is an interesting addition as well, you don't have to stay in the stone age but can go all the way up to the iron age and even make steel.  If you're scared of the difficulty or have been pushed off the genre by games like Banished where surviving the winter is really difficult: don't be scared of Dawn of Man.  It's WAY easier than those games, I've played for 22 hours at the time of review and never had to restart -- my city is basically 22 hours old :)

Where this game really starts to show its cracks is in the same places as the games I mentioned above and others in this genre: the late game.  AI decision-making and core game elements really don't work well with hundreds of citizens and a large sprawling town.  Here's an example: when you get raided, you can recall your citizens to sit behind a wall and defend with ranged weapons.  Works well when you put up your first wall around your town.  However, because you cannot set rally points for raids, if you build an outer wall, expand across a river, or build a 2nd town (to grab resources for example), your people will just kinda run to random gates and you can lose dozens of citizens to a raider attack where you should have lost none or just 1 or 2.  I could go on, there's other mechanics that are greatly hampered by lategame issues like this.

With that said, it's great to have a dev picking up the mantle and improving on the genre with their own take and there are def improvements here.  I got it for around $15, and even if I dont play it again I'd consider 20 hours of enjoyment to be worth $15.  I really hope the dev continues working on the game and can spend time expanding the late game in both content and quality of life features.

They moved careful to the riverbank and watched the behemoth across the water from the cover of the trees. To their excitement, the mammoth waded into the frigid waters and began swimming towards them. As it neared the other bank, they volleyed their spears and stones at the beast. It bugled and trumpeted in outrage and pain and blood dyed the icy water red. It began to turn back toward the other bank, but it was losing strength. It expired and the people cheered. The body drifted into the shallows some hundred yards downstream. The people excitedly began harvesting meat, bones, and skin from the animal.

The early to middle stage of the game is quite fun, whilst your population is under 50, plenty of different types of species about and your only real enemy is your own organisation skills. Species becoming extinct through eras was a nice touch (as sad as I was to see the mammoths disappear). Domestication of animals and reliance on agricultural is pretty accurate to real human evolution and so imo I don't see that as a problem. Overall very happy, until the Bronze Age.

The very late stage game becomes a whole 'nother thing. Fine, reliance on agriculture becomes obscene. Fine, raiders become harder and in larger numbers. But there are certain elements that make this universally unbalanced. Cannot create separate settlements - huge map, no possibility of developing from it. This is the AI being frustrating. So one solution is to make a relatively large settlement to house all your people. Problem with that is when raiders come, by the time everyone has run into the settlement, collected weapons and got to the raiders they are exhausted and miserable. 5-10 hours of work can be destroyed by one raider attack in a blizzard. This happened to me in my recent game (I'd been playing this settlement for 40 hours) and lost a third of my populace. If separate settlements were possible, it wouldn't be so dire. This was the point I drew a line in the sand with this game. 
Some improvements:
- Horsemen - Why does this not exist?!
- Improvements on composite bows (maybe crossbows in the iron age?)
- Separate settlement AI
- Don't replace wild horses with feral horses, makes no damn sense and I thought my big domestic horse population was suddenly going to go extinct
- Secondly on the domestic animal bit, have cows/donkeys/horses live long so that breeding is actually capable of stabilising a domestic population. Every 5 seconds I was scouring the nearby landscape for new young'uns to steal. Real horses live 20+ years, sheep live 10.
- Have a combat slot, a tool slot, a clothes slot and then the standard 1/2/3 slots for carrying stuff in villagers inventory. Swapping out tools for combat might seem realistic but is an utter ball ache when raiders are metres away from your door.
- Have activities that can be designated for children only, i.e. tannin/stick/fruit collection, so adults don't get taken up by tasks children can do.
- Finally, and I cannot emphasise this enough, if you are capable of making a horse drawn plow, you are capable of making a horse drawn harvester. This makes NO sense and makes Autumn/Fall so damn anxiety ridden, cancelling absolutely every task just to have as many people in the field as possible, with 100 sickles just so you don't die during the winter. This by far was my biggest gripe and I would probably still play if this was included. I'll be checking the mods but I ain't holding my breath.

Dawn of Man is a great game with many wonderful things to discover for a new player, however, it has some very serious shortcomings that will gradually reveal themselves over the course of a playthrough. They make an otherwise wonderful game quite tedious and absolutely frustrating to play.

Before I mention the bad, I'd like to say that the developers have done a great job so far, and this is in no way a poorly developed game (apart from the issues I am about to highlight) nor have I spent an insignificant amount of time with it. With that said, I simply cannot recommend it. Even though I really, really want to go back and play some more, the points I am about to highlight are what stop me from doing so:

1. Efficiency: The biggest problem with the game that a lot of people have been complaining about is its clumsy AI. The AI is absolutely batshit stupid and it drives me crazy. I think the algorithm is similar to vanilla Rimworld, where colonists/villagers will only pick up one item in a large pile and ignore the rest if someone else has decided to pick up the rest (regardless of whether they are on the other side of the map). For example, villagers will hunt an animal far away from the village only to walk back empty handed when the deed is done, because someone else sitting in the village has decided to gut it and then CARRY ONLY ONE ITEM BACK FROM THE PILE because another person has decided to walk to the pile and pick up the rest. Half the village will end up having to walk to the carcass and pick up one item each. 

2. More poorly developed AI: In the middle of a hunt, villagers will sometimes get thirsty. Ok. You're hunting a bear. Drink later. Hunt now. But, no. The villager will proceed to walk IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE VILLAGE  IN SEARCH OF WATER BECAUSE THAT BODY OF WATER HAPPENS TO BE JUST A TINY BIT CLOSER TO HIM THAN THE RIVER NEXT TO THE VILLAGE.

3. Even more terrible AI: Battles are ridiculous. There are some exploits I have discovered because the raiders seem to only be interested in destroying things and getting themselves killed. If you build another set of walls outside your first line of fortifications, they'll simply attack those walls and you can shoot them with arrows from your towers in the meantime. Also, the safest bet is to leave the gates open because otherwise, a bunch of archers and people with pointy sticks will eventually just destroy your ginormous walls, gates and towers before bursting into the village. If the gates are open, your villagers can simply go and fight and kill the raiders. Otherwise they'll destroy things and you have to fight them anyway. So much for realism. Honestly, the one thing I actually end up doing during the raids is pressing 4 (8x speed) and letting my villagers handle everything by themselves with the gates open. At least on hardcore mode, micromanaging fights is a clunky mess of a situation because you can't pause the game to issue orders.

4. This game should be difficult. Even on hardcore, once you get to agriculture, craft good tools, the animals have all run away, and the only thing to do is hit 4, research the remaining techs one by one, fight the raiders in the way I mentioned above, and just wait until you eventually complete all the milestones. This gets boring. Fast. There is just no challenge in the end game and it makes me sad. 

5. There is ONE walking speed. Regardless of whether your villager is just wandering while idle, going to hunt a mammoth, or defending the village from raiders, there is ONE FIXED WALKING SPEED. It's ridiculous. Even if you right click twice, they will run for a short while before running out of stamina, but then revert to the snail pace that is their leisurely stroll regardless of the severity of the situation. Sure, they don't need to be Usain Bolt all the time, but at least put a bounce in your step when you're defending your goddamn village.

In conclusion, there are many, many great things about Dawn of Man. Accumulating knowledge points, storing up food for the winter, the diversity of the animals, building your village and defending your villagers from the elements - it's all glorious. I really hope the developers can take the time to fix the issues I have mentioned. I would love to play this game in a better state but at the moment, it is simply too annoying to bother with.",1589624351,1589624351,False,189,14,0.897000730037689209,11,True,False,False

To be transparent - I’ve always been a sucker for a good colony builder, survival, strategy game.
Although I just started playing and still figuring out the dynamics/game play.
So far I like what I see…

Like most games on steam - it has quirks and needs a few tweaks (but isn't that the point of steam)

Hopefully the developer is committed to seeing the game thru and doesn't abandoned it.

With those simple words I was well and truly hooked. This is such a rare and unusual setting for a game - especially a tribal city-builder / survival simulator - that it immediately appealed to me on some primal level, harking back to our (almost) Cave Man ancestors. [i]Where did we come from, and how did we get here?[/i] has always been something of a fascination of mine.

It's perhaps worth pointing out that, in my experience with this game, what most negative reviewers have ascribed to being faults with the game are in fact usually problems with their own style of play - their overall approach - or even more often simply a lack of adequate understanding of particular aspects of the game. Most negative reviewers have quite obviously just jumped to conclusions which are pretty inaccurate at best, or even just plain wrong in every way. Their loss... but don't make it yours as well. 'Nuff said.

[h1]Historical Accuracy[/h1]

Of especial importance to me was knowing that the game's ambitious setting had been deeply and thoroughly researched. I was pleased to find that DoM clearly does its best to remain faithful to both its setting and its subject matter, carefully balancing accuracy and realism with the need for immersive gameplay and maintaining overall game balance.

A good example of the depth of research invested in this game can be found simply by viewing the game's great concept art. Inspiration has clearly been drawn from many different historical and archaeological sources, together building a finely-detailed representation of prehistoric and ancient times set roughly in north-western Europe and covering some 10,000 years of human social evolution and broad technological advancement. The game's concept art is well worth a peek if this sort of detail interests you.

[h1]You are NOT a god![/h1]

You are a simple tribal leader - a respected Elder, perhaps, or maybe the accepted Chieftain - but you are [i]not[/i] their god. Live with it.

This may sound like a simple concept but it is one which some players seem to have a great deal of trouble getting their head around. Such players are clearly used to doing anything and everything they want, as and when they want, and expect to see it immediately put into effect and be carried out. If that is the type of game you like to play, the level of fine, god-like control you prefer to have at your fingertips, then please take my advice and [i]avoid this game like the plague[/i].

The degree of control in DoM is considerably more laid-back, much more removed from the end result, than is the norm in many games. You govern your people through overall guidance, tribal management and general leadership instruction, not direct commands to specific individuals for anything beyond relatively simple things. Generally you plan, manage, advise, suggest, encourage and cajole. You do not, for the most part, [i]directly[/i] command or dictate.

[h1]Overall Gameplay[/h1]

This ""[i]tribal leader - [b]not[/b] a god[/i]"" design philosophy essentially means that adopting the right style of play can make all the difference between ultimate success or failure.

You govern the tribe overall by deciding precisely what needs to be done, and you can [i]influence[/i] when it may get done through astute leadership (such as by suggesting priorities, imposing production limits, and carefully managing overall workload to free up more people for what you deem to be the urgent tasks), but your people are free to decide for themselves which particular task each will next perform, and indeed, when they feel able and willing to actually carry it out.

This very different approach properly rewards careful planning / forethought and subtle influencing, while punishing a lack of planning or insufficient consideration. It encourages you to govern and nurture your people with a fine velvet glove rather than rule with an uncaring iron hand, and to carefully balance their individual needs (such as food, drink, rest and even their spiritual needs) against the needs of your growing tribe as a whole.

If you fail to maintain that fine, careful balance throughout, your people can and will occasionally suffer for it, and sometimes grievously so.

[h1]Surviving through the Ages[/h1]

DoM sets out to cover the entire 'birth of civilization' from the primitive, semi-nomadic hunters & gatherers of the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Copper and Bronze ages, and on into the early Iron Age. The glory that will be Rome remains just a faint glimmer on the horizon even at the very end of this game, which may disappoint some players who would like to see things taken even further, but the journey as it stands is still well worth taking all the same.

Each Age brings with it new advances to benefit from, and new challenges to overcome. Each Age allows your people to grow and evolve their society and settlement, to become more efficient and productive in various interesting ways, and thereby in turn enable the tribe to support a larger population.

Growth - albeit steady, controlled and above all, [i]sustainable[/i] - is essentially the key to your tribe's survival and its continued progress & prosperity, as well as being the ultimate goal of the game. Trying to expand too fast can be just as dangerous as expanding too slowly, however, or at least may lead to its own particular challenges.

Technology also drives advancement. Almost everything your tribe does leads to the accumulation of 'Knowledge Points' (KP), from hunting different types of animals, or in greater numbers, to producing the weapons needed to do so more efficiently. This same principle applies to almost every aspect of your tribe's activities, and the two are completely interwoven: more people doing more things, especially new things or in greater quantity, means more knowledge will be accumulated, [i]ergo[/i]: population growth actually helps drive technological advancement, while employing better technology will in turn help to support a larger population.

As well as 'spending' KP to benefit from new technologies, your people can also barter for them with occasional visiting traders from beyond the known lands. Almost everything your people can produce or manufacture may be used in trade, either in exchange for other goods or for new technologies. Trading for as much new knowledge as you can afford is a great way to smooth your tribe's progress through the ages. It's even possible to turn your growing settlement into a manufacturing powerhouse of the ancient world, to the point where no tech trade offer ever goes unaccepted.

[h1] In Conclusion...[/h1]

At its heart, however, DoM is actually a deceptively simple game. Once you've learned the basics and have survived a full game without falling foul of any of the possible pitfalls, you will likely fall into either one of two camps - either you'll [i]mistakenly[/i] assume ""that's it, been there, done that"" and call it a day, or you'll have become so engrossed in the game that you just can't wait to try another map location, one of the game's specific Challenges, or maybe a different or more difficult scenario / game mod.

You may also discover that tremendous fun can be had from the many different ways you can plan, develop and grow your settlement, and from working out how best to fine-tune things for maximum efficiency as you steadily evolve your tiny starting camp into a huge, bustling, fortified Iron Age settlement.

For some - especially those with a keen interest in the game's dim & distant historical setting - DoM can become incredibly addictive and so represent superb value for money.

Worst case scenario? Roughly nine out of ten players agree that it's at least worth what they spent, hence the persistent 'Very Positive' overall rating on Steam, while the remaining 10% mostly fall into the negative category I mentioned at the start.",1581930868,1589392810,True,9,0,0.625708878040313721,2,True,False,False

I know that's a system that's old as dirt, but in 2020 and with other townbuilders out there it feels more or less entirely obsolete. I recently played a lot of Ostriv and, while extremely incomplete, it feels far more... alive than this. I can also place buildings at any angle which I didn't expect to be an issue until I tried building my village.

I don't actually care about any of my villagers here. They might as well not even have a name, but they do. They're all the same and I mean that in the harshest way possible. Nobody has skills, talents, wants, but they do have needs. Basic ones. I played on normal difficulty and the only issues I had were that I simply didn't have enough villagers to spam the map with fur huts. Getting and keeping food wasn't hard because animals will run right into the middle of the settlement and the moment you get seven adults, even a bunch of old geezers, you can wait until a giant beast runs through and just kill it. Have them go out as a group and kill the big creatures and you will never want for anything. I can't imagine hardcore mode is much harder. Since the actual creature and villager mechanics means that you can easily cheese the system you'll never actually have to bother with animal aggression. I hope, dearly, that a single villager can't stab a bear to death on ""hardcore"" mode, but I don't know. I actually stopped playing because I got bored. You do stuff, get knowledge, unlock some big, clumsy button that lets you click on tiny buttons when you select your single crafting building. I don't care about going through the ages because I can see the locked options in all the menus and it's just more of the same.

Make no mistake, this is an extremely basic game. I at least expected them to organize in family units or something like that, but nope, a single hut can serve a whole bunch of people all at once. Nobody cares. The only thing that affects is your migration and births and honestly you don't need that many people in the first place. This feels like a mobile game in the sense that it's about as deep as a puddle, but usually games make up for that by being as expansive as a lake. This is more like a small pond in the middle of a parking lot.

If you're like me in that you need a lot more complexity to make it worth your time then stick with Banished or try out Ostriv or something.",1589013688,1589013688,False,5,1,0.531991243362426758,8,True,False,False

But... the more time I've put into it, the more I realize it's not fully baked. This game should be in the Early Access program in its current state.

The difficulty of the game does not so much stem from the game itself, but from a distinct lack of control. You simply cannot control the pawns in the game well enough to really get things done. The systems are there - but they are malfunctioning and overly simplified, there's breadth but no depth in terms of what you can actually manage. And this being a colony sim, management is paramount.

All of that out of the way, the premise of taking a tribe through the stone age and into the iron age by building their settlement over time is great. I've been wanting a game like this for years. If, like me, you desire that - you MAY still want to pick it up, but be prepared for frustration.

I really hope that the developers continue to develop this game thoroughly. It could be a truly great game if they do. And should they do so - I'll happily change my review.

I'm heavily into Cities Skylines, and always passed on it.  Like most of us now a days, bored with the same old same old, looking for something new.  Picked it up and it's got me hooked.

At the start, the interaction is a little different than one might expect.  Makes the tutorials feel a little clunky, but they do indeed teach the [b]basics[/b].  You are expected to apply what you've learned to future parts of the game.   Kinda like, learning to copy/paste in notepad, and then having to figure out how to do it in all other programs.  The longer you play, the more intuitive it becomes, and by the end of the first hour after the tutorial you'll be a pro.  Another interesting and well designed feature is the 'info' bars.  Not only can you choose which one is displayed, add more, but you can also choose left or right.   You can have as little or as much info as you need, right where you want it, or are used to it in other games.  Also they can be added/removed easily on the fly. This whole feature is a big +10 for me.

Another feature that you will use a lot is the speed function. [1] 1x, [4] 8x, [SPACE] pause. Learn them, use them.

The only down side that I personally encounter, is hunting.  Rather then set an area and the amount of hunters  I want working it.  I prefer to do the army ant thing.  Gather 5-10 peeps and  slaughter a group or two.  This is cumbersome, as I can only see if they have the right tool, individually and not when multiple peeps are selected.  My counter for this is to use the 'Defend Settlement' feature.  Basically you hit the button, and all able-bodied weapon holders (where ever they are) get a weapon and assemble in the center of town, everyone else (like the kids, or no one that has weapon) goes and hides in the huts.  Now I can bounding box select them and go eradicate the pack of hyena's and bears that are just too close to my fishing grounds.  It's just unfortunate that I have to stop all other work to do so.   If we had a similar feature in use, but say a hunting party rally area, set it to 7, and hit a button to rally them up with out the others stop picking berries, and chopping trees, would be a refined polish.

I'm interested in seeing further into the game, as well as future content, additions and improvements.  As long as they don't implement micro-transactions, or money-grab DLC,  I think I'll become as invested to this as CS.",1588045959,1588045959,True,6,0,0.584638476371765137,0,True,False,False

The game ranged between slow (sometimes too slow) and challenging but never overwhelming. I was actually surprised how attached I became to my settlement which started with a small family of 6 in the paleolithic age that I got up to over 150 people in an ant-farm town in the iron age.  

What I particularly liked about the game is how well-automated a lot of the tasks are.  While you can certainly micromanage when things get slow, you don't have to dive into the details. You can assign tasks and areas where a job needs to be completed, and the settlement (and the individual settlers themselves) does a surprisingly good job automating the tasks and taking care of their needs so you can focus more on the strategy of how you want your set of tents to grow into a thriving town.

A special shout out to the artwork and the detail. There's such variety across the board where you don't feel like you're looking at the same 2 pieces of work unless you really dig for it. For example: there's different kinds of trees and grain and fruit. Sometimes you can get lost watching a family of bears as they go for a drink at the river. Does that bush of strawberries look tasty (it does!), well have one of your kids go pick them and bring them back to the settlement. 

I only have a few minor quibbles. The game can get repetitive at times, which is not surprising because I'm certain that was what life was like for these folks, but the occasional random events other than raider attacks or disease would be especially welcome. Even random variations like a particularly tough winter or a flooding river would have thrown some additional welcome bumps in the road. The raider attacks were fairly straightforward to manage, although I have to acknowledge I played on the most straightforward scenario where the attacks are more of a minor challenge and not the main hurdle in some of the more difficult settings. 

Overall, this game kind of reminds me of Euro Truck Simulator.  A game where initially you wonder why you're playing it, then wonder why you're enjoying it so much - a kind of zen-out experience. This is definitely a game that I will return to again because it accomplished something that I find increasingly rare in city builders - it made me care about my little community.",1587918931,1587918931,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

From the creators of Planetbase; Madruga Works brings you Dawn of Man, an Epic Survival/ city builder that will pit your skills against everything, Raiders, Wild Life, even Mother Nature… Will your Colony survive, or perish like last fall’s uncollected harvest?

Some key points that this game offers:
1.	Strong survival elements.
2.	Realistic Gameplay. 
3.	Creative Mode.
4.	Addictive, this beauty will keep you entertained.
5.	Indie Gem 5/5.

Gameplay & Controls:

The game is played with our trusty keyboard & Mouse, a wide variety of keys are programmed for the game to give us full control and numerous shortcuts to easily view and track the ins and outs of our colony. The game plays and runs very smooth, whether you have a new colony starting out, or a small armies worth of people.

The gameplay…. the fun bits; You start out with a small number of human settlers, two tents and a fireplace, and some resources. That’s it, from there you need to start tasking your people to start gathering the basics to start building; Sticks and Flints are two of the first resources you will go searching for. Sticks are used to created basic tools to start fishing and hunting, but as you progress you will learn how to craft much stronger equipment for your colonies, but you got to start at the bottom first.

As you complete tasks you earn Knowledge which can be used to unlock new technologies that furthers your colony. There are numerous technologies to unlock. 

Graphics:

For an Open World simulation this game is a beauty! The animals have been carefully drawn to represent real lifelike versions of them. The trees and other natural formations are another aspect that has been implemented remarkably well. Storms look absolutely gorgeous, those Lightning Storms fill the sky up with beautiful lights, deadly but beautiful nonetheless.

Blizzards, the start of each season, everything has been drawn and presented perfectly, giving the game a realistic beauty and atmosphere. Character models for your people is another looker, that combined with how unique each structure looks and operates. As you progress through the ages it clearly shows as you upgrade structures to more modern versions of themselves, giving your village that beautiful rustic look and vibe.

All in all, this is one gorgeous looking game.

Sounds:

Superbly done! Everything in this game has some form of realism attached to it, and the sounds just makes it so much more lifelike. Whether you’re chopping trees, fishing, hunting or rolling massive stone columns, there is a beautiful tone attached to it. 

The sounds are so compatible with their relevant aspects that they do far more than simply enhance your gameplay experience. It improves it, and triples it, you can easily lose yourself within this game, that is how well it has been made. 

Further adding to the atmosphere is the soothing background music, another terrific add on to this game. Whether your villagers are off hunting or mining the music really sets the tone for the game, making everything worthwhile.

Replayability:

This game will keep you busy for days, and then some; The fun only stops when you’ve had your fill. The game offers three campaign stories to play as, and four challenges that will really test your skill.

There are two creative modes that you can make use of to enjoy a more relaxed version of the game; so yeah plenty to do.

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers ahead:

Dawn of Man comes from the creators of Planetbase. It was that amazing little Space Simulation where we started with a small colony on a planet and from there it was up to us to make it suitable for our colony whilst expanding it. A brilliant game that kept us busy for a long time, it had regular updates, improvements and extras added to it to further our enjoyment in the game.

Dawn of Man is the next big thing, and oh boy it is not only big, it is insanely fun.
To put it simply, Madruga Works took everything that was great about Planetbase and created Dawn of Man with it, adding even more to it, making it a massive step up from their previous game, and this all in one go. Planetbase grew with time, but off the bat Dawn of Man is packed with all the goodness we need in a game like this, and that is not all. Regular updates and improvements are still being done to the game, so be on the lookout for constant improvements.

Dawn of man pits us right there, thousands of years before civilization was what it is today. We are left with a handful of people and resources and left to either wither away or make it. The game truly teaches you much here in terms of survival, one of its unique features being the decaying of resources, whether it is food, or materials collected from nature or crafted goods, almost everything has a lifespan, whether you use it or not it starts decaying. So, there is always that constant requirement to ensure the flow of your city is not interrupted, one bad decision can be the difference between life and death for your people. 

But that is what makes the gem such a gem, it is a must have if you are a gamer that enjoys this genre of gaming.

Hunting is not streamlined.  I cant seem to get my strong adults to form a hunting party, instead i have a mixed group of elderly, children, women, and tired people.  its difficult to take down dangerous mega fauna with two healthy adults and trailing behind slowly making their way are the rest of your hunting party, weak old and tired.  After a kill the game simply runs through its program of assigning tasks to the next villager available regardless of where they are at in relation to the task at hand.  Therefore, all hunters except one will walk away from the mammoth that they trekked halfway across the land to kill in order to fulfill assigned tasks leaving just one or two to harvest meat.

858810,67986699,76561198057147457,156,3,2349,0,2349,1587772746,"I want to be clear with this review: I do not dislike this game at all, I have extremely high hopes for it and I think the idea is wonderfully ambitious, but it needs far more work to be the game I, and many others, wish it to be. I have put in dozens of hours within about a week, and although it is fun and challenging and the concept is amazing, it all feels lacklustre and gets boring after a short while - which is why I am giving this a negative review (probably an essay rather than a review, be warned).

It was almost everything I was looking for in a city builder game, essentially Banished but with combat and a tech tree, but there are many things that need polishing or outright replacing in my opinion. I will begin with the tech tree. You advance through the paleolithic era to the neolithic era very slowly, which is understandable considering the historical context of these periods, in which we took thousands of years to progress from each; but reaching the copper age, you are able to essentially camp there for a short time, gather all the knowledge points you need, and then instantly advance to the bronze age and research all the techs immediately (and the same for bronze into iron age). I feel like there either needs to be a more dynamic approach to acquiring knowledge, perhaps just cut it off once you have completed an era, and only give enough knowledge to research the tech which allows you to advance into the next era, thus making the transition from these eras more realistic and challenging and natural. Furthermore, the scope of techs is highly limited, there are barely any new things once you reach the bronze and iron ages, just upgrades of previous buildings and tools. Historically, the copper, bronze, and iron ages saw one of the biggest technological golden ages of human existence, with the discovery of so many different inventions, such as writing and currency (which are not found in this game), and trade which spread across vast seas to distant kingdoms. This also brings me to another point - trade is extremely basic in this game. Trade should have a massive impact, both technologically and economically, allowing your citizens to purchase foreign goods and luxuries from other kingdoms in the game as a means to keep their happiness/morale from stagnating, but also by randomly discovering new technologies from other civilisations and, in turn, influencing said kingdoms. 

On this topic, I feel like the combat is totally primitive (excuse the pun), with ""raiders"" only getting better weapons and who fall before an onslaught of guard towers and wooden platforms. With the discovery of fortifications, raiders should ONLY be there to steal your livestock and pillage your farms, not run into your walls in a suicidal attempt to kill 1 of your citizens. With the introduction of the copper age, foreign kingdoms and large-scale trading and diplomacy systems should be added to the player's HUD. These foreign kingdoms should have good cause to ally with or invade you, and the invasions should be a much harder challenge than the sporadic suicidal raiders that are already in place. The copper age saw more and more advanced tactics being tested in warfare, not just charging at the walls and hoping to break through - siege engines, unit formations, generals, and many more things need to be added for the combat of this game to truly flourish.

Not only should there be cross-factional diplomacy, but also internal diplomacy within your own kingdom. The threats of raiders and starvation are essentially removed once you have farms, livestock, and a large enough population to work them all, meaning that challenge is gone and the game begins to stagnate. Even from the paleolithic era, there ought to be an Elder or tribal chieftain whom your people rely on for guidance and who gives the village certain bonuses or setbacks due to his specific traits/perks. Once your population grows to create a larger village, there ought to be more dynamic politics, such as a council of elders or political factions within your village who try to seize control and change certain aspects of your village's governance. This would be especially prevalent in the copper age and onwards, in which political factions could advocate for war with other kingdoms, creating public dissent if you (the player) did not follow their wishes.

Other improvements which should to be considered:
- Population growth is very strange, migration should not be the main way in which your population grows, especially not in the later eras, your birth rate should increase exponentially once you have a large population and steady food production, allowing for the creation of huge cities with hundreds or even thousands of citizens.
- Either remove the grid-based building system, or allow different shaped buildings, like square houses (PLEASE, round houses are so inefficient with space). It would held greatly in the placement of walls and so many other buildings if you had the freedom of movement to place buildings anywhere you liked to maximise your space and create compact sectors of your city.
- For the sheer amount of micromanaging in this game, there are far too few buildings for how many resources are in place. If you are going to go crazy with resources, you may as well go crazy with the buildings. There ought to be specific buildings for even the smallest things, such as potteries (allow us to collect clay as well as mud), bowyers, etc.
- Allow us to set people specific roles and jobs, like in Banished. 
- I greatly dislike the way livestock and tamed animals work in this game. Dogs almost die out after the neolithic era, rather than breeding to grow with the human population. Stables are also a very poorly thought-out idea, there ought to be fenced pastures for animals which are large and realistic. This would not only mean that the animals aren't wandering around your village (which is strange), but it would mean that raiders pose an actual threat to your livestock rather than your citizens, as they try to kill or steal your animals. 
- Find more uses for older resources once you reach later ages. Flint and bones and mud become obsolete in later periods, so it would be nice if they still had some uses after the introduction of metal tools.
- Please allow us to carve through mountains or flatten land, random bumps in the flatter lands can mess up buildings or farm placement.    
- Add different biomes, woodlands get very boring after a while. 
- Encourage players to explore the map more.
- There need to be far more random events which kill people, I don't understand how women don't die from childbirth at all but your people will frequently die to lightning strikes. Disease should be very common. 

Overall, I know my ideas are highly ambitious and would pretty much require an overhaul of the game, but the skeleton of this game has so much potential, and I would be willing to pay for this to be added as DLC if the devs needed it. Dawn of Man is a great game and an even greater idea, but it severely lacks depth for the periods it tackles. If even a few of these ideas were implemented, I would happily change my review to positive, but the game does not deserve it at its current stage. You chose to tackle an idea which covers 100,000 years of human history, so please tackle it correctly.",1587810407,1587810407,False,316,21,0.881295740604400635,0,True,False,False

Clan members that stand around doing nothing when there are tasks scheduled is one. Another is people NOT going to the nearest building on occasion when they are delivering or need something. I have had people tasked to chop down a tree and they start heading to grab a fishing pole! Or they walk right by a granary and head for one on the other side of a mountain!  Would be great to see small game you can hunt as well as the ability to set snares or traps.  Frustrating when you try selecting a decent size hunting party and have to search for the appropriate villagers to do so, you click them and send them to a staging area only to have them wander away while you search for more members of the party. Couldn't the devs have added a hunting party button that selects untasked villagers or at the very least make them stay where you put them!? Very frustrating early in the game when hunting is a higher priority.  Also the clan is very inefficient. They often only grab 1 item when their carrying capacity allows for more and they walk away leaving whatever laying on the ground so another villager has to walk ALL THE WAY over to retrieve it instead.  I also wish there was a way to easily select items the people carry and have them drop them. Why bother making spears out of better material if they insist on lugging around that bone or flint one for a few seasons? Again, the premise of the game is neat. Survival and growth are paramount to success but there are some really simple things the developers left out that should be fixed or improved on.",1587791631,1587791631,True,27,4,0.77393031120300293,0,True,False,False

It's a city builder set in the period from stone age to iron age, and the objective is not conquer anything, but simply to survive. The game has a progression system which I really like: You can unlock new technologies by hunting animals, gathering resources and constructing buildings, which feels like a appropriate way of modeling innovation in this period - after all, they didn't have science cavemen back then. 
The gameplay is rather slow-paced, but the technological progress always creates new opportunities and challenges and keeps things interesting. 

All in all, I had a ton of fun with Dawn of Man - there are just three thinks that bother me a bit:
- AI: The AI does a good job at assigning tasks to villagers, as long as you have only one coherent village. If you try to build a second village in a neighbouring valley, massive inefficiencies will occur: Even if the subsidiary village should be self-sufficient, villagers will commute long distances because the AI assigns them to tasks far away.
- Balancing: The player ought to be motivated to reach the copper/bronze/iron age because he wants to process metal, but I had the impression that bows are at least as good as swords. The progress to the copper age feels like a downgrade to me because bandits get stronger, but copper age techs bring only a small benefit.
- Do you know how in ""The Settlers of Catan"", you sometimes upgrade a settlement to a city although you don't need the resources, just to get victory points? Dawn of Man has the same problem, it encourages you to build buildings you don't need.

I'm saying it's surprising because the mechanics of the game are pretty simple and straight forward. You start off as a small tribe and your goal is to survive and build up to a sizable settlement. The game forces you to do careful planning and a healthy bit of micromanagement. Every human is valuable, especially in the beginning, so you have to make sure you don't lose people as you grow, and there are plenty ways to lose people. This, I think, is the biggest strength of the game -- it consistently provides you with intuitive challenges that you should expect to face when building a prehistoric settlement. The three obvious challenges are the harsh winter, the shortage of food and the aggressive invaders or wild beasts. These three challenges are ever present regardless of how far in you are, which maintains the level of challenge more or less even from the early to the late game. Still, there comes a point in the late game when you have built a perfectly protected city with lots of food, warm clothes, weapons and infrastructure, that you know that you have reached that glory moment and you start building a huge monument as your own little ""Wonder,"" and no armies of raiders or harsh winter can phase you anymore.

1) You cannot build forts.  I tried building a fort outside my main city to protect my farmland from raiders, but when you click defend button, villager just try to run back to the main city and ignore the fort.  I try to force them into the fort (towers/ramparts), but they refuse to stay there.

2) Raiders are stupid - they should be trying to steal your livestock or else burn/steal your crop, but instead, they slaughter the livestock and try to assault your well defended town without siege engines. 

3) There are no natural disasters other than occasional crop disease which only affect a small portion of your crop or lightning storm.  I would incorporate floods, droughts, locus attacks, plagues, etc...

4) You can only defend and cannot raid other settlements.

5) You cannot send out trade parties.  You have to wait for traders to come to your town and only trade what they have available instead of actively sending out your own traders to trade what you have in abundance.",1587507003,1587507003,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You carefully nurture your little village and work your way through the tech tree and as you get towards the end you start to wonder what the point is.  There is no win con.  Ah but this game has combat, right?  Well, technically.  Raiders come in the later half of the game, but the combat system is very drab. 
 It's just a numbers game - your swarm vs their swarm.  You'll inevitably lose a certain percentage of your population based on how big the raider pool is.  Control over your citizens is super awkward and not very impactful anyway.  Outcomes can be tilted in your favour by building defence structures, but only in a very specific and counter-intuitive way.  Villager tasks can be automated, which takes away some of the tedium, but in its place there is actually nothing for you to do.  So you end up looking around the map for targets of opportunity - wounded animals that wander too close to your village.

It really grabs you when you first start the game but loses your attention after some time. Overall, the game is very promising but not sustainable at the moment. 

Points that needs improvements: (only the ones that comes to mind first)
- Starting maps and actual locations are irrelevant. You select seaside but there is no seaside in the game.
- There are few maps that you can play.
- There is nothing to do once you find all technologies besides exiting game. 
- There are too few achievements overall. Once you complete them, you dont want to play as much as before.
- Most of the map is useless. You will keep your people in a fixed radius all the time. There can be in game rewards, so that you can send your people far away and do a quest.
- May be players can search and find raiders' villages and attack them too, enslave animals + people.
- Of course more abilities, technologies, scenarios, buildings needs to be added
- Town folk behavioral bugs needs to be solved.

The middle of the game takes a turn for the worse. At this point there really isn't much to do. You basically sit and watch your population work on fast forward. There really aren't any mechanics available or strategy to the farming concept in this game.  You set the number of animals to keep for each type and your population does the rest. The animals go randomly into the barns for the winter, no way to match up a breeding pair or anything else for that matter.  It would at least continue being interesting if I could actually farm. The animals run wild around the settlement during spring, summer, and fall, which is annoying. An update to the game would not be that difficult, they already have the mechanics to select what can go into each storage building. An add on to select what animal for each barn and fencing to pen them would help save the game for me. I also would like to select animals for slaughter, instead of the population just doing it.  As well as what animals are going to breed for the next years stock. Which could add another aspect to game as you would need to occasionally capture new bloodlines in the wild and slaughter the farm stock accordingly to keep the genetics healthy. There isn't anything to do with the animals other than capture them to start and set a number to keep. Being able to manage farming is the only thing that could keep this game going for me at this point. I do not know if I will get thru the middle of the game to finish it.

I will have tens of people die in waves from hunger when i have massive stockpiles of food, the AI gets stuck on tasks and does not choose more critical ones. the same is with cattle, they will die easily because the AI refuses to feed them even though i place actual hay stacks near the stables.

The Good:

I love the idea of advancing a village through the ages...I think this is a theme that should be revisited and perhaps expanded to a Bronze-Iron Age City-State scale.

The resource management is much like Planetbase, which can be difficult to get at first but you get into the swing of it as you go...sort of reminds me of the Dwarf Fortress days.

The tech tree is an interesting idea that makes a lot of sense, and it was good to see it implemented to slowly develop your people into a civilization.

The Bad:

The villager AI is...special.  Maybe it was designed that way on purpose to make it somehow more ""challenging"", but it is way more annoying than anything to the point that it takes away from the experience.  

You can do everything right just to have your villagers decide they want to commit societal suicide because they are too stupid to prioritize EATING over chopping down a tree.  

They will literally walk by food to go pick up a stick even when they are starving.  

Needless to say once your tribe goes in a downward spiral of death...there is no undoing it...you have to reload an earlier save, because it will take you too much time searching the map or looking at your task list to cancel everything except food.  

Even better yet certain key tasks will continuously go into automatic mode that you have to constantly disable in order to keep it from distracting the handful of survivors..who again are too stupid to understand that the pig I gave them is for killing and then eating even after I told them to kill it.

The same thing happened in the sister game (Planetbase), where the space colonists were too dumb to eat...made you wonder who let them on the ship to Mars.

I understand these are primitives...but even primitives understand FOOD.

I really do think the designers need to add in some code that makes the villagers prioritize SURVIVAL before doing any other menial tasks, which would make it more immersive to the context of the time period being covered and from a game play standpoint...WAY LESS annoying.",1587025461,1587025461,True,1,0,0.491071432828903198,0,True,False,False

- When you fuck up you get a death spiral with big setback in your population, but not so much that your game collapses totally and you quit, this aspect is perfectly balanced

Cons:

- Graphics are a little to dull and gray (For realism? I don't think the real world is this gray.)

If you hunt mammoths you are going to need a large party and it is going to take casualties. The transition to agriculture was not immediate and required hunting and gathering to supplement it. Things like this are spot on. There are a lot of neat things, like the fact that if you hunt all of the prey animals in your area the predators get desperate and start attacking you. 

The one big gripe that I have, and others seem to have it as well, is that the point of fortifications seems to have been entirely missed by the developers. Fortifications, even palisades, came to exist in every single culture that could make them because they were crazy hard to get through. But raiders in this game will manage to do it with a few spear throws. In the real world fortified villages always had an advantage which was multiples of the cost of fortification, and this is an advantage you will not have in this game. It is always frustrating to have a game that does so well early on and disappoints in the late game. I have seen some people begging the devs to patch this, and a patch it would be considering how broken it is, but I haven't seen that they are working on it. So perhaps we must settle for a broken late-game. 

If you are wanting a fun sim that will almost put you into the place of our ancestors up through the neolithic, then I highly recommend. If you want to progress beyond this and explore the tactics of fortifications then there are other games that do better, since in the real world walls weren't made of construction paper.",1586751589,1586751589,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Storms are fairly tame events - killing a person only once in a great while But, a storm stops the speed up of time. 

Sometimes unsure why it's not making something - it should tell you what you need to finish with some highlighted object or something. For example I didn't know I needed mud to update a building. So, when I upgraded my entire town, the people all destroyed their houses but then didn't start building the new houses until much later when I figured out I need mud.
