I am quite experienced in the genre by this point, and this game had me hooked in seconds. Not only is it incredibly stylish and charming with its visuals, but it just feels great to play. Even in the base version, there is a decent amount of customization when it comes to UI (the Guilty Gear skin definitely made me very happy). Aside from the classic ""free play"", the other game modes provide a rather unique and fun way to enjoy songs you might not be familiar with; ""AIR"" naturally stands out in this case.

Now, despite having the potential to actually be one of my favourites, you should be wary. For one, it's online only, even outside the ""online"" modes. When I bought the game, the servers happened to be down at the moment I decided to open it for the first time, so I couldn't even play it until things were fixed. Awful first impression that was! I actually refunded until I was sure everything was up and running again. I was stubborn and willing to give it a second chance, but that would have been it otherwise. Another thing is Clear Pass. Especially for a game that is not free-to-play, I hate this. Personally it seems negligible enough, but that's not the point. This game will already get expensive if you're hardcore enough. Anything akin to a battle pass has no place here.

It pains me that I can't shout to the heavens to just ""shut up and give them your money"". It came real close to being what I would consider pretty much perfect. Indeed, if that doesn't deter you, then you are in for probably one of the best rhythm game experiences there is.

If the developers ever decide that they don't want to support this game anymore, or shut down the servers, you no longer get to play this game.

Additional Thoughts:

(RIP S4 League)

Very good entry into the DJ Max series. Tons of great songs in the base package. Most of the DLC packs are also worth getting, although i recommend waiting for a sale.

I do have some issues with certain things that this game does but even then i would still recommend it.

minor gripes are:
- Results screen is kinda lackluster in design.
  > while it gets the important information out of the way with no problems, it feels kinda empty still.

- Themes are limited.
  > I have no problem with how they are just it would be nice if the themes applied to more then just music in other menus / screens

- Songs are not tracked unless you clear them.
  > Sometimes you just wanna know how many times you tried a chart without passing it. 

- Timing speed thing gets in the way.
> Not even optional. you cannot turn it off.
> Distracting during play.

Major Issues:

- You can no longer fail on Normal/Hard charts in freestyle.
> Not even sure why they did this for. Game feels weird when you know you should have failed but dont when your life bar hits zero.
> It's not optional. you cannot turn it back on.

- The ""SEASON/BATTLE"" Pass system
  > contains mostly cosmetic/avatar items. except with season 10 they changed how the Pass system works to also include gameplay content within it. 
  > its FOMO. meaning theres no way of getting the items you miss if you do not clear the pass. this now includes the song they include with the new passes if you choose not to buy into a season
  > basically killed my interest to constantly play the game as i would have. 

- Always online required. 
  > Yes, I get its to prevent cheating and score tampering. But it would be nice not to worry if the game stops getting its servers supported in the future. I would also play this on my steam deck if i didnt need to worry about being connected to the internet.

The gameplay is smooth and feels good with fun to play patterns on both keyboard and controller. Each song also has background music videos which really makes playing every song feel fresh, with unlockable stuff to go after to reward playing.

There is a also huge amount of content, with over 500 songs now across all the DLC, each with 4 different button modes and up to 4 difficulties per button mode, so a song could have up to 16 different patterns to play. There's also regular free play mode, mission mode, ranked and open online play. There's just so many different ways to play, whether you're an absolute newcomer to vertical-scrolling rhythm games (like I was) or a talented full combo chaser.

The price tag may seem really overwhelming at first, but during sales you can get really significant discounts, and the amount of songs you get in each pack, as well as profile customization, is pretty good value for your money when picking up the new DLC.",1706102609,1706102609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game literally kicks you out of it if ""it sense irregular behavior"", mostly are just connection issues.
Otherwise, I do think it's kind of okay for you if you are a rhythm game newbie and have never experience any flagship arcade rhythm game (e.g ; beatmania/SDVX/DDR), especially those that have keysounds for each and every song. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Updated after the game added back fast/slow indicator.

At the moment of writing this piece, the PS4 has not yet receive update for V extension 5 or the indicator.

The new indicator is not like the one you get in the vanilla game on PS4, but it's basically the one in 2dx.
That is, unless you actually lower the speed and look down and take a look at the ""MAX %"" indicator you probably won't notice it's existence at all.

Hands down, the old one (the vanilla one) is just better.
But I guess they can't get it working on PC so this is the best you can get.

With this essential feature coming back, it's finally a actual working game (sort of).

Still, if you can buy the PS4 disc version, try to get that. The PS4 version has no live-service bullshit, no DRM-lock bullshit, game works offline and you can play local multiplayer with your friend. 

Playing the PS4 version, You don't have to worry about all those plus the following. Sometimes you cannot boot the game because it cannot connect to the server; sometimes you get stuck on a result screen because the game cannot sync properly with the server; sometimes the UI gets messed up because the game did not sync properly with the server; sometimes your in-game achievements got messed up because the game cannot......

You get the idea.
All those live-service bull-crap.
If crappy server failed magically, then you get the middle finger.

You can argue, at least when it works, it does work.
But that's not a compliment.

ANYWAY.

Now the game ranks the SC patterns seperate from other (Normal. Hard, MX) patterns. Well, does it work?  

Kinda.

Just a little example: 
Memory of Beach 8B SC, 3 star, Ladymade Star 8B SC 7 star.
How come 7-star is easier than 3-star?! Maybe the rank works backwards.
NOPE!
A 12-star SC pattern IS more difficult then an allegedly claimed 3-star pattern.
But a 15-star SC pattern won't necessary be harder than a 12~13-star SC pattern.
It's all over the place! 

This phenomenon outlines the biggest flaw of the game. It lacks consistency. 

The quality of the patterns or charts, and the music in the newer releases are VERY inconsistent. 
Quite a lot of patterns released in the V Extensions(1~4) are just key-spamming garbage, e.g. Plasma Sphere in V extension 3(I play the MX chart once on PS4 and never want to touch it again).

And quite a few new music tracks (post portable 3 & technica 3) can be categorized in the following 3 genres: straight run-of-the-mill bombastic ass, ""elevator music"" and ""stream BGM"". 

Even people who haven't studied music should notice the drop in the quality.

How does it compare to those flagship music games, like those BEMANI games, especially 2DX and SDVX?
Well, collab charts still don't get ANY keysounds (like, not even a simple tamborine SE ).
It does have a hard mode hidden in the Mission Mode (those Don't Make the MAX 1% missions, which is basically the hard mode on Black Square), but there's no way you can practice it because there's no such settings available.

But, you don't have to play like 15~20 USD a month (unless you are into those live-service ""bonus"").
And you don't need a dedicated controller just to play the game.

So this is basically, the more ""pro"" music games for novice players.
It's much easier to pick up, and it does have some curve balls throwing at you and gives you challenges.
But it's no where near the flagship experience.

You can say, the game makes you FEEL like a DJ.

And if you have any problem with my opinion, then,

You are nitpicking and biased, I win, bye bye.

Original post:

I platinumed the PS4 version and I purchased all major DLC there, except the two related to Rayark because F them, don't expect me to pay for anything that has less effort putted in than doujin BMS contents.  

For new comers, 

TL;DR: buy the PS4 version so that you don't need to worry about crappy server and XIGNCODE3.

I strongly recommend the PS4 version over this one since you won't be worrying about no being able to play anything because NEOWIZ is having troubles with their crappy servers. In terms of the contents, the exclusive songs on PC are mediocre at best, and most of the SC patterns add to the PC version aren't impressive either. 

Speak of pattern design, people seem to complain about the cytus pack a lot lately. But the truth is, the pattern design quality has already started to decline since Technika 3 pack. Most of SC patterns in the PC version are not more difficult than the MX difficulty, for some instances they can even be easier (e.g. ANALYS 8B SC, HAMSIN 8B SC, Nightmare 8B SC, Stalker 6B SC). The cytus pack got criticized because it crossed the line, plus it doesn't have keysounds. 

What about being able to play with a keyboard?  
Don't worry, if you're not good enough to handle MX difficulty with a DS4, you won't be able to handle the same or the higher difficulty with a keyboard either.

Last but not least, XIGNCODE3.  
It's one of a kind and it's one of the worst. What I really worry about is if it introduce any security problems after being installed. Unlike other kernel-level driver made by Intel or AMD or Nvidia, this thing will not get security patches even if somebody make an exploit out of it and that's horrifying. To avoid accidents, I made a complete backup in advance and install the game in a Windows guest, so the obvious Gotcha that I could think of would be somebody found a way to sneak inside the VRAM or the PCI controller through an exploit.",1577402265,1704120948,False,0,0,0.548259735107421875,0,True,False,False

This game like previous DJMax series is great. This is assuming you liked the game play from previous versions (minus the DJMax Technika series as I feel it is great series on it's own right, I feel like it's a spin off of the main series). Nothing too drastic has changed on the actual game play, just the scoring system, the fever automatically activates unless you're in mission mode and possibly online battles but I don't know since I never played online battle in any of the DJMax series.

No, I have nothing really bad to say about this game (when it works) besides these 3 things, that for the first time a DJMax game has made me frustrated before I even play the game.

#1: The game requires constant online access to even play the single player mode like Free Play, Mission or accessing benign stuff like changing things in options or to change notes, gears, ect.
But at least the performance doesn't suffer unlike playing Diablo III single player.
However one day this game will no longer be supported and who knows if the developer will release a final patch to let us play this offline for single player mode but I wouldn't hold my breath.
I would have thought thrice before getting this game if the description on the store page stated always online connection required and it also would have save me the problem dealing with #2.

#2: It uses Xingcode3. Some may call it a rootkit, a spyware. I call it an abortion of a anti-cheat system that frustrates legit players. Besides that, the amount of dealing with Xingcode3 with errors are frustrating to the point where the game is less frustrating than dealing with Xingcode3's shenanigans. I had to deal with 2 different error types when I was on my Steam Deck (via Steam OS) and now that I got my gaming PC, It is giving me hell on that possibly due to it. I don't know since every time I research errors for this specific error, I can't find it. 

#3: Now I've tried Valve to find a fix but they told me since I can get an error message in game, it's out of their hands and I must contact the publisher/Developer. Which then the website they gave me links to this site here. https://djmaxrespect.com/cs/index.html and after I filled out everything the site then tells me that the site is down due to maintenance and I tried every day for almost a week now and the same thing happened. So then my next option is their Discord page which I have to create a account for that I never wanted (due to that CCP has funded undisclosed amount towards Discord and we don't know what they have access to or have CCP members on the board as it's unknown to the public).
So I tried to access to their Discord but it seems like they're no longer accepting new members and I'm not going to set up another account to get a hold of them, as their track record is pretty spotty right now.

The only way I'm able to play this game is through my Steam Deck but I can't get steady 60FPS as it stays 45 to low 50's and it's not a steady as the frames is varied pending on what MV is playing. Here I was hoping to play this on my Windows gaming PC with 4k and steady 60 FPS but I got no joy and support is well lacking.

I owned many variant DJMax titles from PSP (I no longer have), PC DJMax Trilogy with usb profile stick, Vita Technica Tunes, I still have only because of KARA),  and the PC version of Respect V. However I regret buying the complete edition due to the headache involved. Only reason I bought Respect V is because I couldn't find my USB profile stick for Trilogy but found later only because I can't play this game on my Windows 10 Pro, but hey, I still can play my Trilogy just fine.

I doubt that I'll buy any more DJMax series for a while now due to lack of support (as in trying to contact them without jumping through so many hoops, just to find out the web page is broken and when they post that you can get help on their discord but can't access it. 
Look, I usually try to find out fixes through web boards, Google-fu my way to fixes that been posted but I haven't found the error that I got and getting help from the Developers are a joke.


TLDR: Game is great when it works (and that you don't mind that it's required to have constant internet connection to even play Single Player) but IF the console version allows keyboard then you're better off on that platform IMO because it works. 
If you have the PC version and if the error isn't what most majority have and semi unique then good luck to you on getting a fix or even letting the developers know about it because the avenue that they stated to find them isn't working or just broken. Don't make the same mistake I did by purchasing the Complete Edition. Even if it works for you today, somewhere down the line it stops working, you may be SOL.

Edit:
Well by stoke of pure luck, I found out what that mysterious message in Korean was. The game will not boot if there's no controller plugged in. Now I don't know why it requires it since all die hard DJMax players always used keyboard or 3rd party accessories for the PC version (including the defunct DJMax Online/O2 Jam). It could've been that I bought and started the game on the Steam Deck and somehow the configuration carried over the controller fixation to Windows. 
Anyways I will now recommend this game with a caveat.

1: If you believe this game will not become virtual binary paperweight when this game is no longer supported. And that you believe that Neowiz will patch this game so not to require always online to play for our single player content (which majority of us only play anyways. statistic wise) then read on further.

2: If you really really like the previous edition of DJMax in any sort and not bought this game, then buy the complete package when it's on sale. If the above mentioned did not happen at least you know you got it for steep discount and the OST is the one thing that they can't take away from you and plus real DJMax players must have at least one OST in their collection and for the audiophiles it does come in .wav format.
FYI, when you buy the complete package, it will not come with future updates and OST. However you still can get them at a reduce price. Also the default skin is the only one that works for me as all the rest will tell me that it's corrupted and it will switch to the default skin right afterwards. I haven't checked to see if they fixed it since the season 10 ladder match.

3: You, like your wallet like to live life dangerously, with no uncertain hesitation on supporting what you love, and what you love to hate.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

best rhythm game ever made, blows osu! out of the window. it is keysounded, you feel like you are actually playing the music and not just clicking artificial patterns made by some dude in his basement that thinks more things to click=better experience and then blurts out charts that dont really vibe with actual music. lots of content in basegame (can easily get at least 100 hours out of it and thats when you ignore most of the shit you can do) and dlcs are actually fairly priced (if u want them - just get them on sale and/or in bundles, ignore dlc that only adds skins), theres just lots of them which may paint an image of a greedy dev. most icky thing about dlc purchases in this game is the battlepass, it doesnt affect the experience that much but it sucks nonetheless.

only other thing that sucks about this game is the anticheat/drm that wont let you play offline (not present on ps4 ver, you can play offline on console).

the soundtrack is absolutely legendary. great variety, its not a rhythm game that focuses just on weeb sounding stuff.

charts are AMAZING, the overall feel you get while playing them is immaculate. keysounding ftw

iirc there is literally over 250 tracks in the basegame and like at least 4x that amount of charts. you are literally getting like at least 4 games worth of content in one package, without any dlc. and then dlc is there if you want even more. dont buy it if u dont need it (and u probably wont need it for at least few dozens of hours)

The DLC choices and charts feel better than they have ever been, and the original tracks in the base game are still fun after hundreds of hours. It is a fantastic time to be a DJMAX fan right now.

REVIEW EDIT 2022: They actually did it!! If you slept on this game because of some of the reported timing/keysound delay issues, they have been GREATLY improved with this recent patch!

An essential rhythm game finally back on PC. Early access was a nice idea; the devs have been pretty responsive patching so far, and the tracks are really varied. Lots of play styles and charts, and more updates (including ranked multiplayer) to come. Can't wait for the DLC to start popping out.

A lot of people mention timing issues, and I see the effect: you do have to hit a tiny bit early to register solid scores, but this hasn't been too tough to adapt to, with most of my scores even for MX charts in the 99% range. Turning Vsync off seems to help this problem a lot and now I don't even notice it. (EDIT: See above, they drastically improved this as of mid-June!!)

(Also, it's 2020; I don't know how people can still complain about clearly labeled anticheat software. XIGNCODE is fine, really not sure how this is still an argument.)",1577649093,1701417451,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Has all the bells and whistles you could want as a PC player for a paid rhythm game played on keyboard. Good optional depth too (speed, change how game plays & lanes look, etc.). Not a fan of the artist selection personally, but if Korean and US music appeals to you, then you'll be right at home. Very wide variety of genres available here too (rock, lullaby, vocal pop music, etc. instead of just EDM). UI, visual direction, and presentation is very slick.

Only gripes gameplay wise is that on high lane speeds screen suffers significant screen tear even on high fixed framerates. A better v-sync option would've been beneficial. The difficulty selection & visualization is poor, represented by a line with dots instead of a generalized number like 99% of other rhythm games use. The game doesn't really explain SC difficulty either, or why its harder for its class compared with similar star songs. Song navigation is also extremely primitive with few sorting options and no fast way to navigate. The game lacks an obvious ""life bar"" for whether you'll pass a song or not as well, which is confusing for the highest difficulty songs.

DLC policy is frankly kind of ridiculous at first glance, but in reality is par for the course for these kinds of games. Sound packs are how these games stay afloat. If you don't want to pay artists for the music you play, or at least want a strict budget option, I honestly can't recommend this. The default music selection is 90% generic filler. Pretty much just mainstream sounding crap and deep as a puddle in terms of quality. It appears all the good music is in the DLC. I'd look elsewhere for all in one type games (ex. Muse Dash) or free alternatives (which I won't name here) if you want specific and higher quality music.

Finally, I can't recommend this game as a Bemani player. That is, if you already play arcade quality rhythm games at home and can afford the live service + a dedicated controller (IIDX Infinitas, SDVX Exceed Gear Konasute), there is really no point in playing this title even to supplement them. Let alone to replace them. At best DJMAX is poor mimicry with different music. I'd wager you'll spend just about the same amount of money in the long run.

在譜面難度（主要説説4Key，游戲中的4B譜面）方面，感覺頂端難度的譜面以本人目前的地力能勉强抗下，硬要説的話大概是osu裏4*上位的譜。單拿sc難度來講，星數基本上能夠與譜面fc難度挂鈎，爲什麽提到fc呢？因爲在判定這方面來講，freestyle模式中最高判定（Max100%）的判定區間相對比較寬鬆，大概是om中OD8下黃300的判定區間，因而想要達成fc還是可以靠一定的糊力來達成的。至於譜面的整體質量，因爲還沒有將所有的sc譜面都刷一遍所以暫時無法給出評價，不過sc14級以上的譜面不乏逆天縱連和高速子彈，對於我這種爆發力不行的人來説屬實吃不消。至於sc以外的各種難度的譜面，我認爲基本上做到了在提供bga這種演出表現基礎下讓新手也能有動力玩下去這樣的水準，無論你是用手柄還是鍵盤進行游玩，都能有不錯的體驗（側鍵如果不用設置好的鍵位接不會斷combo而是以Max1%的判定計入，一定程度上給沒接觸過這種東西的玩家一點鼓勵：接不住不用硬接，你做的已經很好了！）
聯機方面，首先需要説明的是djmax這個游戲需要[b] 全程聯網 [/b]（是的，就算玩freestyle模式也得聯網），所以對網絡質量方面沒有信心的玩家謹慎購買！在綫模式分爲天梯排位和公開房間兩種，天梯我稍微打了一下，排到的對手基本上能力對位，不過玩的不多就不直接下定論了，目前自己的排位體驗還是不錯的；公開房間我認爲是這個游戲的一個亮點，因爲[u] 每個玩家可以在一首歌下選擇自己喜歡的鍵數以及譜面難度進行游玩 [/u]，是的，不用擔心房主選的歌自己打不動，自己選一個適合自己的難度就好。如果你這輪不想打或者說這首歌的最低難度對你來説也太難了，那麽可以切換成旁觀模式看其他人打。我認爲這是音游的多人游戲模式最好的狀態：每個人都可以享受到游戲的樂趣（點名批評osu多人游戲裏炸房的行爲，無論是出於什麽理由這樣總會讓人覺得不舒服）。另外，[u] 通行證購買者可以游玩房主選的任何歌曲，即使你沒有購買這首歌所在的那個DLC曲包 [/u]，對於錯過打折或者仍在猶豫是否購買dlc的玩家來説可以通過購買通行證來“白嫖”歌（當然你需要一個已經有這個dlc的房主，這塊怎麽整就靠自己想辦法了）。
以上是我作爲一個有一些音游基礎和游玩經歷的玩家的身份的評價，總而言之djmax還是值得購買的，在我眼中聯機這塊加分不少，譜面質量我認爲主觀占比較大每個人評價大概都不一樣，所以僅提供參考。如果你想體驗下落式音游，那麽djmax會是一個不錯的選擇。",1701091755,1701091755,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Imo you're paying for the game itself and the pre-packaged songs, which imo is definitely not worth **50** dollars.

The gameplay is fine, as someone who's competitive in rhythm games, it's pretty okay. My only issue with it is when a lot of the elements are very distracting, like the animated lane and note skins. But I really like the style and the animation in the opening cut-scene is amazing.

This is definitely more of a semi-casual rhythm game and not a competitive one, I get the feel that it's kind of trying to be meta with some of the modifiers and ranking system, But I really think this game is really more visual appeal and fun rhythm game instead of something more competitive.

As for If I recommend it or not, I don't know, it really depends on the person. For 50 dollars? no, on sale? well sure. If you're looking for a competitive, difficult, and fast pace rhythm game, this is probably not the best option, but for more casual rhythm game players (which I'm assuming most people are)  you should probably check this out.",1700956046,1700956046,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game have about 160+ song in it and it will keep increasing as the season changes

The core gameplay are basically DJMAX but with a twist called side track, it's basicaly total Button + 2 side tracks ( for example 4b play will be like 6b because if the side track so 8b play will use you whole hand because 8b+2) but overall its really fun and i keep dumping more hours in this games

the game have a lot of dlc for sure but im ok with it because how much content you can get from the dlc itself and the production quality behind it. and it's still cheaper than most of the mobile rhythm games if you count price per song

This game is online only some people hate it some people don't
for me personally im ok with online only with anti-cheat and tight online check because its basically the thing that keeps the game alive because the PS4 Version is very dead

The game have 4 game modes : 

!. Freestyle mode that basically just choose the song and play to your best. You will spend most of you time here because this is the core gameplay of DJMAX, grinding for achievement or training your skills

2. Air mode is a mode for people who just want to play a random song from a random rotation even if you dont own the song DLC you still can play it

3. Mission mode is self explanatory. Complete challenge from very easy to borderline impossible because how hard it is

4. Online mode is separated into 2 modes. Ladder match is a 1v1 ranked match for player who want to test their skills especially accuracy and normal march is 7 player casual online mode where you can choose a song for you and other people to compete with

AIR mode replaces the Arcade mode (I miss Arcade mode), its not the best thing, but its a OK new addition to the game. With it being more focused on online/multiplayer modes, the Online mode is really fun to play. Online Open matches are easy to join in and doing Ladder Matches are a Fever Trip to play. Ladder Matches are some of the most Intense games to do, you never now what will happen during a Match. The songs this game offers are the best, from old legacy songs to new originals and even collaboration songs from other popular rhythm games, there is a song and genre for everyone to play here.

If you like Rhythm games, you'll love DJMax. If your new to Rhythm games, You'll love DJMax. The game is very customization both in difficulty and visuals. Theres a good track list with the base game and the DLCs simply add more songs to play and try to Max.

Theres an online multiplayer with a ranking system if you're interested in that, I personally have not touched the online portion besides the other mode, Air Mode, where songs rotate out every few minutes and you can leave a comment for other players to read durring that song [kinda weird but it fits as the game autoplays while u type]

You can set the scroll speed, you can add a fade to the notes, if you hate yourself you can hide the notes completely to attempt a blind run. From what i can tell all songs have a video attached with it and if you find the video too distracting, you can either turn the transparency for the board down to block it out or you can simply turn them off completely.

TL;DR: Whether you are good or bad at Rhythm games, you can tweak the difficulty to your liking, base game has a great pool of songs to start and theres plenty of content for all partys. 8.5/10",1700643328,1700643354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Original review: During the free weekend way back, I was gonna pass on buying as it seemed like Yet Another vertical scrolling rhythm game to bang keyboard keys to.
But then I tried playing using a controller - a Dualshock 3 in my case.
DJMAX's charting plays phenomenally with a controller. I like rhythm games designed around unique peripherals (dancepads, guitars, etc), and I had a ton of fun playing DJMAX with my DS3. Bought the game at the end of the free weekend, and have since gained an appreciation for the game's presentation and content.

Also keysounds are really neat - every button will play a sound from the song, such that playing on time makes you feel like you're actually ""playing the song"".
But be warned, keysounds demand that your setup has minimal audio latency - no wireless, no enhancements.
There's zero calibration features either (note output is not a calibration!), so hopefully your monitor is low-latency as well.

First is the steep price barrier to the game and the multiplayer experience. So many songs are locked behind DLC, as well as an ingame ""Season Pass"" that not only contains cosmetics, but I also found a song in my list that was locked behind this season pass which comes out quite frequently. Furthermore, friends can not access your DLC songs in a multiplayer lobby, and on top of that, there is no indicator of which songs they actually have access to, which creates a huge headache when trying to chill and play with friends when you have to constantly ask them ""hey can you play this one?"". I bought the game for a friend to play with hoping to show them some songs that I enjoy playing and the multiplayer experience was just really lacking with them being paywalled.

My second problem is the lack of a practice mode. Most great rhythm games I've played have a slowdown and skip to the portion of a song for training. It is extremely frustrating to try and push to more difficult songs in this game trying to sight read sections that are moving too fast to parse while just smashing keys trying to finish the song. It doesn't feel good to beat songs in this way, but no help is given to the player to learn the songs better.

I enjoy the game quite a bit, but I cant reasonably recommend it to anyone that's looking for more than a casual solo rhythm game.",1700461064,1700461064,False,4,0,0.542051076889038086,1,True,False,False

Pros:
1.Decent music library. Personally reckon it satisfies my taste more than Ez2on.
2.The art and the MVs made by themselves are extraordinary. They can probably win a prize for their BGA if they participate in BOF (if with a good piece of music)
Cons:
1. Expensive, for both base game and DLCs as well as season pass. Prepare to empty your wallet every 3 months!!!
2. UI and display. As there are very few competitors in this domain, DJMRV is a little bit lazy in improving UI when still using the design mode from 10 years ago, wasting your precious time on scrolling through a vast list of music. Also, not enough support for more recently popular display resolution (though I know in this case many artwork pieces need redoing, the price deserves such improvement)
Misc:
1. You receive loads of kawaii emojis in game and also those fanmade ones if you are in a forum or groupchat of DJMRV
2. DPC(DJMax Pattern design Competition) every year which is one of the very rare case in all rhythm games since it is embed in game and players get to vote for them by giving marks after playthorugh.

Some tips:

* Turn on ASIO if your sound card supports it, it cuts down audio lag drastically
* Do the calibration in the settings
* Turn your monitor brightness up for better visibility
* 240hz monitors definitely give an advantage, with clearer visibility (less jumping)
* Use the zoom buttons to zoom in a bit and get better timing
* Use a mechanical keyboard
* Take breaks.  Take many breaks.  Sometimes it's better to go a few days or even a week without playing.
* Play 6 button songs as soon as you can.
* Turn off the background animation for the 2-3 songs that have too much strobing, it makes it easier to see the notes",1679786343,1697649848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Evidence: https://imgur.com/Tl3Fbvm (Source: from djmax team's maple story dlc news stream)

As of today from the dev's stream about their maple story dlc news, the exclusive songs that locked behind season pass will be free for all players after 3 seasons including their respective season. The devs have listened to our complaints about this monetized practice, though they still continue this practice but at least the songs will not be disappear forever after the end of its season, the songs will be served more like an EARLY ACCESS. The only downside of the players is we have to wait 9 FREAKING MONTHS for the songs but hey free songs are always a W in my book, if you can't wait that long, buy the damn season pass to support the devs and the artists.


Old review:
This game is kinda complicated for me and I bet a lot who played think the same way.

Pros:
- 150 songs base game (decent amount although with that price tag, you kinda wish there would be at least 200)
- A great variety of music genres, from Asian to Western songs, from the pop. rock, rap songs to electronic, dubstep
- Charts are beautifully crafted especially in 6 buttons and 8 buttons mode.
- Online match have 2 modes: ranked and open. Ranked is stressful but fun, open matches you can play with your friends and beat the sh1t out of them :))))
- Key sound notes
- Amazing ORIGINAL soundtracks especially in the Extensions DLCs (recommended 10/10 have to buy)
- Beautiful and slick UI and you can custom the UI to your preferred theme.
- Vibrant and colorful BGAs 
- Controller supported from Normal to Maximum difficulty except SC difficulty (which makes sense since SC is only for keyboard play)

Cons:
- At full price, overly expensive from its base game to the DLCs 
- A lot of BGAs are in 4:3 display ratio due to its MVs are very old and not being remaked for modern 16:9 ratio display
- NOTE: this game runs on XIGNCODE3 - an anti-cheat/ online DRM. It's truly a slap in the face for a single player experience 95% of the time
- Some songs don't support key sound notes (E.g Cytus and Deemo DLCs packs)
- Air mode is just......meh, the comments show on screen are all pre-recorded and not live. It doesn't track your scores or your combos so why is this even a thing??????
- Overpriced season pass that gives you nothing but cosmetic items for....a rhythm game??? which nobody would look or care anyway because they're too busy beating your a$$ in a ranked match

Conclusions:
This is a great rhythm game but has some fundamental problems such as online DRM and a questionable price tag. Even so, I love this game for what it is and I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME HELP MEEEEEEEEEE. I genuinely have a lot of fun playing it and this is one of the few that give that triple A feeling due to its huge support from the devs and its community

P/S: - Buy this game and the DLCs when it's on sales which happen every few months so wishlist it because the price will go down from 50% to 80% discount with the base game a 80% discount which is a more reasonable and cheaper price.
- Check carefully which DLCs you are buying because there are soundtracks, gear skins and song packs that are blended together pretty badly and easily get confused. 
- If you are going to buy the DLCs, buy the EXTENSIONS DLCS first no matter what you won't regret it.
- And for the love of GOD, don't buy the unlock songs pack because you will eventually unlock all of it the more you play (it's a progression system), why would you want to spend more money to PLAY LESS, think about it.
- If you only interested in 4k/4 buttons mode and not 5B, 6B or 8B then DJMax might not be the game for you since there are a lot of other competitions that have Mania style gameplay and you will missed out like 80% of what the game can give you.",1690874149,1693566395,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Additionally, most rhythm games I've played are free and fan-made, so DJMAX Respect V is one of the few rhythm games I've spent money on.

DJMAX Respect V was previously on Xbox Game Pass and I was immediately sucked in. DJMAX is easy to pick up if you're new to rhythm games, especially with both keyboard and controller available as inputs. I think this is important because it's very easy to try diving into a rhythm game and get dejected by a skewed learning curve. It can either be too easy or too difficult. The main reason I found DJMAX to be worth buying is because it is easy to start but the skill ceiling seems incredibly high. I can't confirm the veracity of that statement because whatever the skill ceiling is, I'm not even close to it yet.

Compare that to Stepmania (a Dance Dance Revolution clone) for example, where the increase in difficulty tends to involve adding more steps until you cross the threshold from something that is fun and challenging to something too intimidating to bother learning. I'm looking at you, 30+ rated Stepmania charts. That said, I acknowledge a lot of the complexity from those insane charts comes down to the open/fan-created culture for Stepmania's charts: ""Let's just see what's possible lol.""

DJMAX doesn't have this problem because you can choose between 4, 5, 6, or 8-button versions of the different charts. When you are nearing a difficulty plateau, you can decide if you want to tread into the most difficult 4-buttons or try something new with easy/mid-difficulty 5 or 6-button charts. If taking that leap was too much, you can always step a few steps back. There is always a fun, challenging difficulty available to you (or at least there will be for a very, very long time). You can get tired of using a controller and switch to using a keyboard or vice versa. After you've been playing a while, it's always fun to enjoy some songs that you can max combo easily as a non-challenging way to unwind.

DJMAX offers a lot for a rhythm game, and I haven't even touched the Challenges mode or competitive online play. However, I have dipped into the ""Air"" mode where you pick the number of buttons you want to play and a difficulty range and the game just plays one song after another. In a sense you are playing with others who can type in chat, but it isn't competitive. This is yet another mode that is great for either relaxing (picking a low button count or low difficulty range) or trying something more difficult without fear of failure (you can't fail in Air mode). And you can adjust your difficulty range/button mode after each song (but you have to change it before the next song automatically starts ~20 seconds later).

On Xbox/PC Game Pass, I made it to level 60 or so before the game was removed from that service. For scale, I'm about level 25+ in Freestyle (my favorite mode because I love to play with myself eyy) over the 8.5 hours I have clocked in at the time of this review. In reality, I've probably played over 40 hours of DJMAX so far.

Disclosures about my experience with this game:

A few days after this game was removed from Game Pass, DJMAX was on sale for $10. Even though I could have cross-saving and all of that other fun stuff buying the game on the Microsoft Store (maybe?), I'm a cheapskate so Steam was the place to get it. Getting DJMAX at a steep discount and knowing that DLC for this game also goes on sale was the best decision for me personally. 

If you've played this game already on another platform (Xbox/PS/non-Steam PC) you cannot transfer your saved data. If that is important to you, stay on the platform you're already using. It was less apparent on the Game Pass version that DJMAX is a game-as-a-service, which I have to admit I loathe. The Game Pass version did not tell you about the current season or tell you about which profile customizations you can earn (or attempt to earn with a season pass). The Steam version does, and that annoys me. But it's not annoying enough to ruin the game.

This *does* mean you can't play this game offline, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. These are the reasons I don't work in game publishing: I don't understand how any of this ""season x,"" ""battle pass,"" ""enhanced live-gaming whatever-the-fudge,"" crap works. I was playing a moment ago and it appears that a season pass adds playable songs to your library, but don't take my word for it.

For hardcore rhythm players (that for some reason haven't played this game already), here are some details that may irk you about DJMAX V Respect:

-Combo leniency: this game really wants you to keep a combo. There have been instances where I know I biffed it by screwing up my timing--badly. But because I somehow still hit the buttons in the correct order, I kept my combo. Your overall score will still reflect your poor accuracy, but you still get the combo that feels unearned. However, this is mostly negated by:

-Note accuracy scoring: like most rhythm games, your scoring is based on accuracy, displayed by MAX n% for each note. You can get 1% accuracy on a note and keep a combo but your score will not impress anyone, especially yourself. Accuracy is measured in multiples of 10, save the 1% which I feel fits into the game's philosophy of being forgiving while being accurate for players that care about that.

-Key sound feature*: DJMAX has a feature/setting named key sound, that assigns musical sounds/notes/elements to the button you are supposed to hit in time. This feature can be annoying for players struggling because you can literally hear how bad you're playing, but it's a fun feature that increases the feeling you are actually playing the song. When replaying your favorite songs, you can hit extra notes to add sounds to the song that aren't actually there, which can be fun for making songs your own as you master them. Hitting extra notes doesn't affect your combo/score as long as those added notes don't interfere with the notes that are required.

*key sound is not available in all songs

-Background animations (BGMs): These can be extremely distracting or annoying (even if the BGM is cool). As expected, you can easily disable BGMs entirely.

-Freeze/hold notes: notes that require the button to be held down for a longer duration are scored with what some would consider extreme accuracy. If you hold the note longer than its required length, your accuracy is automatically reduced to 1% for that note. It can be a fun or annoying mechanic based on your mood.

In the end, DJMAX Respect V has enough content to be worth its full retail price. I knew that when I was playing it ""for free"" on Game Pass. However, I'm stingy enough that I waited for the right, giant discount to buy it. Although I occasionally have a waking nightmare about the day I can't play this game anymore because it's publisher/developer stops maintaining it (or the internet is out), it's worth it. 

If you love rhythm games and the full retail price is a drop in the bucket for you, get this game! Otherwise, wait for a sale and pick up this incredibly fun, time-suck of a game.

Unfortunately, the publisher for this game has a really awful record of just shutting down the games on mobile and letting all their users that spend money on it with no way to play the content they paid for, i think is reasonable for people to get angry that this might be the beginning of the end for this game.

The music and game play is amazing, but what sets Respect V apart from the rest of the genre is the amazing plethora of options. For starters, every song has 4 input options, in 4, 5, 6 and 8. (A few songs will throw in another 2 buttons in every mode, for heavily synthesized notes, but it's only a handful.) And there's at least 2 difficulties for each of these input options, with most having 3 or 4. If like a song, but the note layout is stale, there are two sets of modifiers you can apply. Some will switch which track the notes appear in, some will adjust the speed of the notes until you make a mistake. You want the screen to lose resolution until you mess up? Yeah, that's a thing too.

You can freely change the speed of the notes, even during the song. If the song's Background music video is too distracting, you can turn it off. You can move your note track to the left or right side of the screen, if you don't like the default center option.

There's a range of UI options you can pick from as well, even though the default is sleek. You can change the note appearance, track design, even the main menu. For me, I come from Deemo and Muse Dash, so seeing that there's collab UI and themes for both of those games was very neat. I occasionally pop on the Guilty Gear stuff too. The only things that don't have a changeable aspect is the song selection menu, and the multiplier activation sound (but there are unlocks for this in the battle passes).

The online is great too, a ranked mode where you can get your ass kicked by the guys who have been playing this game for years, and a casual room where you and some friends, or strangers can play the same song together. In this room mode, everyone picks their own UI, difficulty, and modifiers, and while you play, you can see what everyone picked as you play along.

There's a mission  mode that has pre-made conditions for you  to play through. Like ""play these three songs but the notes  fade away halfway through the track."" There's also a list of in game achievements not listed among the steam achievements that give you new music and UI elements.

There are only two things I dislike about this game. 1. No crossplay with PS4/PS5 as that version of the game is just ""DJMax Respect"" and not ""DJMax Respect V"" so if you have any friends with t his  game on PS, you can't play together unless one of you gets the other version. 2.No local multiplayer in Respect V. Despite the PS  version having it, there is no option for that here.

Pros:
+Tons of tracks in base game, lots of DLC 
+Variable difficulty with different key layouts
+Can customize avatar, frames, even the look of your game through DLC and earned rewards
Cons:
-Some things cannot be earned and can only be purchased (But that's the norm now)
-DLC purchases can get expensive if you're a completionist
-I never seem to see any collabs with other franchises I'm aware of other than League of Legends

The fever system always adds energy to the gameplay and makes racking up thousands of combo points feel great as you tear through the song regardless of the base BPM. I love the various styles of input from 4 to 8 button and the variety of skins are a cute cosmetic to unlock as you play.

This PC edition of the game brings with it a little controversy. It uses the Xigncode3 anti-cheat software that gets a bit too familiar with your computer and limits the game to being online only. If you're willing to take that risk you will get a decent library of songs featuring a smattering of tracks from across the various DJ Max franchises plus some new songs for this entry.

I haven't invested in it myself because it needs neowiz servers to be online to launch so there's an expiration date on how long you can play this game. Once they go offline, this game is unplayable.

Playing a half of a guitar melody along with the approximate up-and-down pattern in the melody then switching three times per second to different drum sounds, vocal rhythm, chimes etc. on the same keys.

My updated list of issues with Respect: 
[list]
[*] The always-online DRM
[*] Songs being locked behind DLC packs, most of which I only want 2 or 3 songs.  (Just like when I used to buy CD albums.)
[*] The full combo sound cannot be muted, like the fever sound can.  Why?
[*] The usual Battle Pass system, which forced me to spend $15 to get a clear sound that's slightly less annoying than the default one (I didn't care about the other unlocks).
[*] Honestly, some of the re-mappings of songs have really upset me because they were fun on PSP and now they're gone or don't feel right.  Some of the reworks were for the better, but a lot of the time I prefer the original and go back to it.  I wish there was an option to switch over to the original version(s) of the songs in a ""Legacy Mode"" or something.
[*] On a similar note, I want to be able to set all the original BGAs for songs.  I know that there's ""secret"" BGAs that randomly will play the original for a few like Never Say, but I want those at all times.  I actually heavily dislike the new BGAs (sorry whomever created them) to the point where I don't even want to play the songs.  This is especially true for Dreadnaught, which I can't even play anymore...the original BGA is what made it and it just feels off without it.
[/list]
Overall, I enjoy it.  DJ Max is a series that I love very much for the song selection, note sounds on hitting buttons, and the general feel of playing it.  You play one difficulty level and/or button amount then try another and discover new parts of the song.  Often, you're playing multiple parts of the song at the same time, swapping between hands.

DJmax has a variety of nice songs (unlike musinx, where you mainly get chinese pop songs and techno music) and it's more real with the score (musinx is very permissive and getting A and S is very easy)
The interface is user friendly and there's a lot of content overall
However, there are a few things that I've seen people complaining about that are still not addressed and resolved
The combo animation causing your eyes to bleed whenever you play, it's infuriating how distracting it is and it could easily be resolved by just placing it above the console (musinx has it either that way or in the corner of the screen)
The DRM is really sketchy and it caused many people to uninstall and not recommend the game
Reading the Terms and Conditions was really weird, I felt like getting flipped off, it doesn't feel like they respect our money

The option to allow you to change the track speed on the fly during the gameplay? Amazing. The option to choose between 4,5,6 and 8 button play, each with its own difficulty modes? I love it, it adds so much to the progression and learning curve!

Also, it has so much content. Tracks (including songs from the previous games of the series), cosmetic unlocks, challenges, online ranked play... and Air Mode, which is kinda pointless, but you know, it's there!

Where other rhythm games try and do something new with the rhythm genre, DJMAX just does scrolling notes really really well, with loads of variety of music, difficulty settings, and patterns. Music ranges from metal or hard rock to K/J-pop, electronic, and just weird rhythm heaven-esk experiments. All are accompanied with an animated movie that are often kind of a trip. 

The skill ceiling for the game is super high, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a ton of content for the semi-casual player (like myself). I dip in every few weeks for a few hours, and I've slowly worked up to playing a lot of songs on 6B medium (occasional hard). It's incredibly rewarding to not only conquer songs I distinctly remember trying and immediately quitting out of, but to then go a step up on the difficulty and repeat the struggle/success cycle. 

My favourite part of the game is the quality of some of the note patterns. While not all the songs are for me, there are a good number that are both A) bangers and B) have perfect note patterns that really pull you into the music.

--- For new / struggling players (from a not great player):

I highly recommend avoiding 4 button mode, and instead try 6-button as early as you can as the patterns become more engaging and interesting and it's that interest that will keep you trying and learning and getting better. 

Customise the game to make it comfortable for you. The UI is customisable, although some options will be locked behind achievements or require DLC. Turn up or down the note scroll speed. When I started, I would tape a little arrow/divider to my monitor that split the chart near the bottom to help me learn the muscle memory of which hand is which (especially as the colours are the same for the two inner tiles). 

The game heavily penalises missing multiple notes in a row and doesn't really penalise hitting buttons without a note present, so if you are learning a new song/difficulty don't be afraid or embarrassed to mash out some of the intense sections just so you can finish the song. Every time you play it, those sections will start to make more sense and eventually you won't be mashing anymore. 

Pick & favourite some songs that you really like that are too difficult for you to complete comfortably. Even if you're just barely (mashing) getting through them, continuously pushing yourself to try harder songs than you can reasonably play accurately will drastically improve your skill in other songs more suited for your currently skill level. 

DLC's a bit pricey at full price, but regularly go on sale. Just get the base or deluxe version and then pick up DLC down the line. You can listen to previews of songs in DLC you don't own via freeplay, use that to decide which packs to get/skip. 

Have fun! Push yourself to try and fail harder songs, but also make sure to keep some comfortable favourites you can just jam to and keep the good vibes going.

The licensed songs (i.e. ESTi's work with Yukika) make the purchase well worth it in spite of less expensive alternatives. There's also something for players of the older games to enjoy, as some older songs received BGA updates.

For what it's worth, even as someone who doesn't play ranked anymore in rhythm games, there's a lot for me to enjoy. You can challenge yourself with Missions, or just relax in Air mode when breaking your combo in Freestyle might otherwise infuriate you.",1687528460,1687528460,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't say that I can justify a full price purchase considering the amount of DLC content and its prices, but that's up to the individual. On the single player end, you get an arcade and mission mode. Fairly standard for rhythm games but one mechanic that stood out to me was in the online ranked mode. You're put into a 1v1 best two out of three win scenario. The scoring system is based on accuracy instead of bigger combos unlike other rhythm games, which makes for a more ""back-and-forth"" type of gameplay. Instead of relying on hopes and dreams that your opponent breaks their combo before you do, you can focus on your own efforts to keep a good accuracy and not be punished with a loss by missing one note. This make for more close call matches to happen, making your wins that much more satisfying and your losses that less salty.

You can unlock ""songs"" by leveling up, but leveling up take so much time, you have to play 5-8 songs just to unlock 1 new one, and despite what you may think, mission mode doesn't give you that much exp either.

The beatmaps are really unintuitive, not lining up to any particular flow or instrument in the song. The lower difficulty settings are also excessively boring, but the next step up is always too fast.

The game doesn't really have an intended progression path. It just dumps you into an alphabetically sorted list of songs. You can play easy to start but if you're as bad as me you'll still Game Over on many ""Easy"" setting songs. I wish it had a string of specific songs to bring someone like me from zero skill to skilled. Atleast enough to enjoy the rest of the list.

Also importantly, the music only plays if you hit notes, and when you hit them. I actually really like this, if your timing is off you can hear it sounds wrong. And you don't get to hear the music proper unless you hit the notes with good timing. 
But if you're pretty bad at these games like I am it means you won't get to enjoy the music. I like the feature and it shows how much work they put into each song's map. But without some campaign or something to slowly ramp up difficulty, it means I'm left hearing messed-up music and Game Over-ing over and over.

Finally the music selection was not what I expected. From the trailers and material you sorta expect a lot of electronic genre, house sorta, etc. But there are more pop-music-like songs and frankly not much I liked. Also they lock a lot of songs behind progression, and charge money to unlock them if you can't grind out progression. Atleast one of the bangers they feature in the steam trailer was locked behind progression because I couldn't find it.

I can't recommend this to anyone with low skill like me.",1685910692,1685910817,False,0,1,0.421725213527679443,0,True,False,False

Lots of different music and fun charts.

There are a few things one can complain about, but by far the biggest issue is the fact that this game has massive sync issues on default windows. Some people say it's not a big deal. ""Just sight-read"". Yeah, no. Being able to slap your keys to the beat is the very reason these games exist in the first place.

The good news: You can fix it.

The bad news: It can take hours of fiddling with windows (depending on how merciful the machine god happens to be, and how good you are at solving tech issues). You have to install an ASIO sound driver, configure it, then go into the game and sync both, the chart flow AND the judgment timing. It's a pain in the butt, and you will likely go well past the 2-hour refund window dealing with it. You have been warned.

After that, it's pretty much smooth sailing.

For reference:
I use FlexASIO, with in-game timings set to 60 and 10, and Nvidia Reflex On + Boost (not sure it even does anything).

The new songs in the Extension DLC packs are great and worth the munnies (when they're on sale).
I used to love OSU! (playing Osu!mania) but after recent changes it went to the gutter for me (unable to adjust speed anymore sucks). Good thing DJMax never scrapped that feature. Uninstalled Osu! and never went back lmao

Sure, it has A LOT of tracks that might not suit your tastes (as for me, I only like at least 40% of all of them), but you'd find yourselves playing the ones that are a banger over and over again from time to time, so it's worth it if you buy it on sale.

My only complaints is the Xigncode, DRM, and online-only although I understand they want to protect copyright and all.

Some people may enjoy this, but it has the weird ""hold a key and continue to play the game outside that key"" thing that was used on like maybe 4 beatmaps total on osu before 2020, like every single map. This isn't a strict negative but i fucking hate it. I personally prefer the tried and true method of pure single-key flow, with holds interspersed as appropriate. Skill issue? Almost certainly. Do i still fucking hate it? Yes.

Even putting that aside, the maps are all choppily made, approaching 0 flow, notes scattered haphazardly with no regard to what preceded nor what will follow. In the base game there are maybe 3 or 4 maps I loved, 3 or 4 maps I liked regardless of how good they were (the LoL ones, 60% of the reason i played the game to begin with) and like 60 ones that were shit and i played because i felt like i needed to, in order to get my money's worth.

But if you just want rhythm game gameplay, try some free alternatives like osu!mania, etterna, or even stepmania first .

DJMax has a very polished UI, and while alternatives like osu!mania can be modded to a similar level, it will take some effort.

Main difference is 'key sounds' (i.e. hitting notes plays elements of the song instead of a set sound effect, for a more interactive experience), which can be off-putting to rhythm game players, but is mostly appreciated from the existing player base.

Settings are extensive, including offset timing, note speeds, keybinds, and audio buffer size. A very nice feature for veteran rhythm game players is the ability to change some of these settings like note speeds IN-GAME.

The base game offers decent visuals and good amount of songs that would potentially attract lots of novice players. What about veterans? I don't think so. This game fails to fulfill the cup of teas for veterans because there are insufficient amount of hard patterns to enjoy with only the base game. The majorities are locked behind the DLCs and they are way too expensive. They are not even worth their values. Even if you get them, I am certain that you would throw them away after playing couple songs so it's going to be an utter waste of money. The best choice is to turn around and go play OSU Mania or Quaver. They are both free.

Plus, the latest DLC songs give a lot of BGM vibes so it's ambiguous to tell that these songs are actually optimized for the rhythm game. It's like ""why am I hitting notes for the background music?"" Inspirations lost from this point, so it's nuh-uh for me.

The charts... are atrocious (I'm talking about the charts from the latest DLC songs). Most of them are legitimately piled with copy-and-paste, repetitive and unscrupulous patterns from top to bottom that can blow you away in twenty seconds. Devs are getting paid for making that, you know? Such an insult to the prestige of commercial VSRG.

The quality of charts started going downhill since the first Extension V DLC. Sad to see the good songs ruined by terrible charts. It feels like the devs lost spirits on charting patterns.

[h1]Performance Issues, random framerate drops[/h1]
It randomly stutters in the middle of the game, especially during online and ladder match. It barely happens on freeplay or missions. The slight stutter is already catastrophic enough to ruin the entire gameplay here and devs should know it very well, but they eventually neglected this issue for years.

1. Probably one of the best looking rhythm games out there. The visual design is great with a ton of unlockable customization options that allow you to change your notes and play area and even the main menu UI/skin.
2. This one's subjective, but there's a lot of good songs to play here, especially if you invest into additional DLC packs. There's a lot of the songs that I like, but that's my taste -- look up the song list before you buy if you want to know what you'll be getting!
3. Game is super responsive and runs at a high framerate despite all the visual stuff! I'm running this on a GTX1080 and a Ryzen 5600X at the moment and I have not experienced a single performance issue running it at 1440p.
4. The game has multiplayer! You and your friends both have to have the DLC purchased if you want to play the songs from them, which kinda sucks, but otherwise, it's a nice feature. Each player has the option to freely choose their playstyle (the game has 4, 5, 6 and 8 key options) as well as the difficulty of the chart, which is great.

Now regarding some of the other things, I really have a bone to pick with this game.... Here they are.

[strike]1. KEYSOUNDS. This is by far the worst part about this game for me, although, I realize I might fall into a minority here, since a lot of people like them, but I HATE keysounds. They make no difference if you play good since you're just hearing the song as it would sound normally and if you play bad (like I do) they just throw you off because they make the song sound horrible. Worst part -- there's no way to disable them. I find this really upsetting and it definitely takes away from the experience for me. Having the ability to disable them and/or replace them with a generic ""click"" sound was something I was really hoping to find in the game, but unfortunately, it is not. [/strike] As of Season 9, there is now an option to disable keysounds, thank god.

2. Timing adjustment options are horrible. There's a weird option in the settings that allows you to change the offset in increments of 3ms (?!) but that's about it. When you actually play the songs it provides zero information how late or early your hits were. There doesn't even seem to be any sort of calibration mode where you can test your inputs for audio/input lag or any sort. Luckily, the game seems to be timed pretty well and I haven't had too many issues, but there were a couple of songs that really made me want to check the timing. Alas, I couldn't outside of just blindly trying to adjust the offset and seeing if I do better after the adjustment.

3. Health bar in Freestyle Mode is upsetting. It's very easy to fail a song in this game if you are as bad as I am, which is fine, but please give me a way to disable this so I can practice the goddamn song? Failing me on it every single time won't help me improve. Sure, make it so as that my score doesn't get submitted to the leaderboards, or whatever, I don't care - just let me play the song so I can practice it. That's how it works in multiplayer by default, why can't I do this in Freestyle mode? Maybe I'm an idiot and I missed an option for this? I dunno man.

I bought this game with some DLC during the sale and for the price that I paid I don't really regret it. The price of the game + DLC without the sale is a little steep and considering the game goes on sale for 60-70% off, I'd definitely recommend against buying this at full price and waiting for a sale in case you didn't manage to get it during the winter sale at the time of writing this!",1609175266,1683386984,True,3,0,0.511270344257354736,0,True,False,False

Beatmania, Guitar Hero, Osu mania, every idol rhythm game, f***ing Piano Tiles; the formula of ""press button when note comes down"" is as old as the dawn of rhythm games, but I don't think it's ever been played straight (with no other gimmicks) as well as it has here.

There's no pointless story mode, no convoluted scoring system, no unlockable difficulties, or any of the other trivialities which weigh down otherwise fine games like this. It's just you vs the song, the frantic but controlled clicking of your keyboard a marker of your skill. This isn't to say the game offers no additional content; you've got Air Mode (which you'll never use), Mission Mode (which you'll barely use), and an Online Versus Mode (which you can use between 20-00 KST), but it's clear that the focus here was on making the core Freestyle grind as smooth as possible. All the features you'd ever need are there: note speed, customizable keybinds, offset, good song sorting, background dimming, hard as balls charts, etc.

If you're a veteran rhythm game player this is nice to hear. If you're not so familiar to the genre it might be intimidating, but DJMAX Respect V offers a really nice range of chart difficulties. Don't be discouraged if hard maps seem impossible, this is a game where the difficulties actually mean something, as opposed to a large number of rhythm games where true ""hard"" is limited to the last difficulty category. There's always a lot of charts which you can confidently full combo as a sign of your progress, a lot that push your skills to the limit, and a lot which seem absolutely impossible. In general, with up to 16 difficulties across 4 playstyles, most songs in the game will have at least one chart which feels right for you.

I've described DJMAX as having both the best and the worst song selection of all time. If you're not a veteran of the series (I was not), and especially if you are coming from Japanese rhythm games which are mostly filled with EDM, anime, and Vocaloid songs, the music here might come as a bit of a shock. A lot of songs, especially ones from older games, have some atypical charts with incredibly jarring keysounds. There's a big focus on older hip-hop and R&B, listen to something like ""Get Out"" on Youtube for a typical example. With time I've learned to embrace the difference, and some of the DJMAX OGs have become my favourite songs today, but it takes some getting used to. I obviously can't say for sure if you'll like the songs here, but what I can say is that there's a bigger [b]variety[/b] of music in DJMAX than in any other rhythm game on the market today (without mods). I don't think there's a single person who won't find a song they love here, just accept there will plenty of songs you think are garbage though :) If you're looking for a song select closer to the aforementioned Japanese rhythm game style, the V Extention DLCs and a lot of the Collab DLC have got you covered there.

Ending on the topic of DLC, you'll see this game has [b]a lot[/b]. Most of it is not new music, make sure you're buying the right thing (every song pack comes with a sick new UI so don't worry about missing out on visual flair). I think it's worth it, especially if you're finding the regular song selection is no longer cutting it for you, but please don't buy it (or the main game for that matter) at full price, everything here regularly goes on sale for 70%.",1681622939,1681622939,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Sure, over 150 songs are available in the base game to unlock and play but if you want not only all of the base songs unlocked right away but also every DLC pack, it is gonna cost you aprox $800 AUD ($533 USD) if you buy them all separately. Sure if you buy the bundle it costs 20% less but still... that is a lot of money for the full experience. Luckily, you can play the DLC tracks for free playing ranked matches but you can't chose the song or difficulty, and song selection is random.

Buy the base game and play it. The base game has enough content to keep you interested for hours and hours. However, if you want any of the DLC, wait for a sale because the base price of the DLC'S are not worth it

Bateu a carência e a saudade de guitar hero, e eu quis achar algum jogo de ritmo que lembrasse ele em alguma coisa, e resolvi pegar, mas com medo de não gostar por não conseguir jogar.
Inicialmente eu tive a impressão de que não me adaptaria, que esse fosse aquele tipo de jogo que vc precisa de 10 mãos, com 50 dedos em cada. Mas felizmente se vc tiver só 5 mãos com 20 dedos em cada já consegue. kkkkkk

O jogo possui diversas modalidades, e são bem personalizáveis pra todos os níveis de habilidade nesse tipo de jogo. Eu ainda prefiro jogar com 4 notas, mas quero me adaptar a jogar com mais, e o jogo te possibilita isso. Ele é difícil mas tem uma curva de aprendizagem que te possibilita evoluir.
Mas acho que o ponto forte do jogo aqui vai pra qualidade do som e a responsividade e integração das notas nas músicas.
A qualidade do som, das músicas, das notas, é tudo muito limpo, é bem agradável de ouvir, e além disso, quando vc aperta alguma nota, ela realmente toca, seja uma nota certa ou uma nota errada, o que vc apertar vai tocar, então vai deixar realmente bem interativo. A sensação de realmente jogar no ritmo da música, e sentir que vc ""faz parte"" dela, e não tá ali apenas pontuando é algo que eu sentia falta ultimamente. 

Enfim, acho que esse é um jogo de ritmo pra todos. Tem diversos ritmos musicais dentro dele, diversas melodias bem diferentes pra curtir enquanto joga e se sente dentro da música, diversas modalidades de jogo e diversas configurações pra todos os níveis de habilidade.
Se vc gosta de jogos de ritmo, só vai! A diversão é garantida!",1680405207,1680405207,True,3,0,0.548387110233306885,2,True,False,False

My main gripe comes in their touted ""online competitive"" mode, which is pretty much just nothing but bots. 
 And the bots aren't even very realistic.  In even the bronze tier, where it tells me I'm in bottom 2% of players on ladder, and usually facing opponents who are ""ranked"" lower than me, I have yet to face an opponent who didn't max combo literally every song, regardless of difficulty.  I mean, c'mon, I don't have a problem facing bots in games if there aren't enough players for matchmaking, but it's really annoying when they don't even tell you (also looking at you, Marvel Snap).

Anyway, aside from that it's a pretty competently made game, if not a little basic.

DJMAX RESPECT V is a rhythm game that offers players a wide variety of songs to select from and allows you to play with several different numbers of buttons.  There's more to it than that, but I'd like to keep the in short section brief.  

In short, the base game offers a variety of songs, however, it is much less in scope than what you would get if you bought the DLC that comes along with the game.  Furthermore, you are limited in what songs you can select at first because of a level system that was implemented into the game.  As your level increases, more songs from the base game unlock, offering you new songs to play.  I'm not too fond of this system, as it leads to a player who is impatient to inevitably buy the ""Unlock all songs"" DLC that they offer.  The DLC as well are fairly steep in price for what you get and Neowiz has added in seasons and ""season pass"" systems into the game to further monetize the game.  I'm not a huge fan of this.  The game offers a great amount of customization, but a lot of it you have to unlock first.  While it might seem like I'm rattling off a long list of negatives in this in short segment, there are plenty of positives to go along with them.

Pros and Cons:

Pros:
+A wide variety of music to play, with a wide selection of genres to choose from.  Please note that not everything included in this game will be to your liking.
+Great customization options, once you unlock them.
+As with most rhythm games, the music itself must be extremely good, and this game has some of the best music that I've heard in a rhythm game.
+Offers online Open Matches and Ladder Matches so you can go head to head with players from around the world, or your friends on Steam.
+Offers a wide variety of options to help mold the game into what you like, including remapping keys to changing the offset and judgment timings.
+A lot of the tracks are keymapped, where as you play, you add parts to the song.  Basically, each key is mapped to a different sound which plays when you hit the key.  When you play the song and hit the keys in time with the notes that appear on the beatmap, the sounds that play add to the song already playing to provide an even more in-depth feel to the music as you play.  Note that not every song is keymapped in this fashion.

Cons:
-In order to get the most out of this game, you pretty much have to buy the DLC song packs, all of which are fairly steep in price.  You can usually get these DLC on sale during the major Steam sales for a good deal, and this is what I would recommend doing for most of the DLC this game has to offer.
-The game has introduced ""Seasons"" into the game, along with Season Passes (equivalent to Battle Passes from other games).  The Season Passes themselves are free, but they also give you the option to buy the Premium Season Pass, which gives you more customization options.  In addition to that, they've also started offering Clear Boosters, which boost the number of points that are added to the Season Pass whenever you clear a song.  All of these things makes it seem like they are trying to milk their playerbase out of as much money as they can.
-Not every difficulty is available on every song for each button mode.  Songs seem to have random difficulties assigned to them and have maps charted to them for just those difficulties.  Each number of buttons also has a different difficulty selection.  What this can lead to is a lack of playable content for those that either are really good at those number of buttons, or for those who are just starting out playing those number of buttons.  This point goes hand in hand with the next con:
-There is no 7K mode.  7K is one of the most popular key amounts in other rhythm games, yet this game doesn't offer 7K.  While I understand that this series of games usually do not offer 7K, I just find it odd that they don't offer it.
-The achievements.  Here's where things really start to get on my nerves.  First off, there are achievements for online game modes, which means once the online service is stopped, these achievements are no longer able to be gotten.  Furthermore, some of the online mode achievements are fairly difficult, which could lead to some players not getting them.  There are also achievements that either demand perfection from you, or demand a large amount of your time.  One such achievement that demands a lot of your time is reaching 999,999 combos.  In Freestyle mode, the combo you get in one track carries over into the next track you play and keeps doing so until you miss a note.  Basically, what this achievement wants you to do is literally not miss a note for well over 100 songs in a row.  While this can easily be cheesed by playing an extremely easy song with a high combo over and over, it just comes down to tedium.  There are also achievements that ask you to get a MAX COMBO on every song in the pack, which can also be very difficult if the easiest difficulty of a song in the pack isn't the actual easiest difficulty the game can offer.  There's also achievements for the overall score you get (every difficulty on every key number counts towards this, but replaying the same song you just played and gotten a score on does NOT count towards increasing this score unless you get a better score on said song).  Basically, this forces you to play a lot of the other key numbers in order to be able to increase your max score so that you can get these achievements.

While I do think that this is a great addition to any rhythm gamer's library, there are caveats to this.  The first is that I only recommend this game if it is on a discount, and I only recommend the song pack DLCs if they are on discount.  I would also only get this game if you plan on playing it a lot and you've actually heard some of the songs on offer with this game beforehand so that you know that there are at least a few songs in this game that you will enjoy playing.",1674290560,1674297035,True,37,2,0.788330376148223877,0,True,False,False

Highly recommend to buy the game and older dlcs while it is on sale for best experience.
This game gets 70~75% off discounts quite often, like 6~8 times each year. So pretty much whenever there is a major sale season for steam, this game is always on sale.

Base game itself currently has 180~190 songs, so you can play for long time even without dlc if you enjoy this type of rhythm game.
But dlcs surely do extend the fun of this game even further. 

If you liked the base game and want to try out some of dlcs, my personal recommendations are as follows: 
V Extension 1, 2, 3
Muse Dash Pack
Chunithm Pack
Cytus Pack
Deemo Pack
Technika Tune & Q Pack

So if you are going for more discount, buy the game as a bundle.
Delux bundle and Collab bundle highly recommended.",1674142820,1674143530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very good rhythm game overall.
Songs are well-mapped
Very well polished in a lot of areas.
Most songs are keysounded, which makes playing them feel a lot nicer.
Lots of very nice original songs made for DJMax from previous games.

Cons:
Most of the previously mentioned original songs are only availeable as overpriced DLC
Always online. If the servers ever go down for good, you no longer own this game.
Xingcode 3 anti-cheat and DRM, extremely invasive.
Base-game has an arguably low amount of songs for the price.
Regional pricing has made buying the game and/or the DLCs in some countries a good way to not be able to pay rent.


I want to recommend this game, it's been very fun, but it's really hard to look at Neowiz and just not think they're being greedy. 
DJMax Trilogy was originally the game that got me way back into rhythm games a long long time ago, so this franchise does meet a lot to me, and unfortunately it has always been like this. It's just a bit sad, really. Worth noting you can't easily play DJMax Trilogy legally anymore, due to that game's DRM, and it wasn't even always-online.

If you must try DJMax Respect V, try it on XBox's Game Pass, if you have the chance.


But in the end, I can't say DJMax Respect V is worth buying. Maybe I'm just poor and DJMax is just that fancy restaurant I can't afford, the one where the food tastes good partly because it's nicely cooked and partly because you spent 80 bucks on that dish, so really you *have* to enjoy it.",1673714718,1673715267,False,43,6,0.793107509613037109,0,True,False,False

Cytus 1 has so far been my only real rhythm game experience and I found no game with music like it that has hooked me since. So when I found out DJMax Respect had a Cytus AND a Deemo pack, I brought it. DJMax has since then became my go to rhythm game of choice and has reignited my passion for Rhythm games in general. 

I love a lot of music in this game, aside from giving me more Cranky, T+Pazolite and NeiN to listen to, it has introduced me to ampstyle (RIP my friend), Boogy Voxx thanks to the Muse Dash pack, USAO, MYUKKE and all the NB Ranger songs. On top of having gameplay that doesn't give me a pain induced aneurysm (Looking at you, Osu and Voez) and a load of UI themes meaning I can listen the banger songs on my home screen as well is cool as fuck. 

My only complaints are that I hate I can't turn off key sounding. I know you weirdos hate it when a song doesn't have keysounding but some of us want to be able to enjoy the song without our own fuckups being heard and therefore throwing off my concentration. Also, I hate for solo play, you can't play most of the songs until you unlock them through level ups so I can't practice songs like Black Cat outside of multiplayer. Fix those two problems and I think this is a perfect rhythm game for people who just wanna slap buttons to the beat to. My only wishes right now is another Cytus pack that ports the Cytus 1 songs (let me play Libra Me and Gate Of Expectancy please) and maybe a collab pack with Vocaloid, just maybe.",1673678554,1673678554,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- This game has a special kind of note called ""side note"" which takes 2 extra buttons. So 4K becomes 6K, 6K becomes 8K and so forth. with keyboard you will be fine, but if you are playing on a controller (such as IIDX or SDVX cons) then you're fucked, and you can't even turn off the side note which is absolutely bullshit.

- Judgment system in this game is wonky. The judgment is very loose in this game which I don't like but I guess it's subjective matter, but the problem is if you play matchmaking in this game and when you run into tiebreakers, the game will turn on ""hard judgment"" and the judgment becomes much more stricter, yet you cant turn on hard judgment to practice. Now you are so used to the normal judgment and when you play tiebreaker the game literally destroys you with strict judgment.

DJMAX as a franchise in its own continues to be one of the strongest ""vanilla"" scrolling highway rhythm games out there and the music selection and gameplay in RESPECT V continues that legacy as it has to be one of the best I have ever played.

However, most of the good music is locked away in DLC packs which require you to spend much more then you need to. At A$70 you'd figure that the game would have a ton more to offer in terms of content but really it's lacking for the base game and most of the songs are locked behind progression (which is not necessarily a bad thing, but encourages players who don't want to play the same thing over and over to buy the UNLOCK SONG PACK.). If you really want to get as much as you can out of this game, you'll have to spend an extra A$100 to get a decent chunk of songs that will keep you satisfied.

The large amount of money that needs to be spent just to unlock the majority of the game is not helped by the fact that the game has Online-only DRM. What happens to all your cash when the servers go down? Redundant, Useless, Burned in a pile with everyone else. It's disgusting to see a game which very clearly doesn't need to be always-online built in a way where it has to be. The game also has the dreadful XIGNCODE 3 anticheat (which is not even mentioned on the store page!!!) which while not as bad as something to the likes of Denuvo, it certainly hinders performance to a noticeable extent.

Alongside this, NEOWIZ's business model for RESPECT V's longevity has been disappointing. There is a battle pass now that constantly blares in your face to check it out and costs a really dumb and stupid A$22 for one season's PREMIUM TICKET. Every time a season start's there's always a pointless 10GB update which doesn't seem to contribute anything to the game. All of the seasons introduce nothing but cosmetics and nothing in gameplay. Maybe a season will release alongside a new DLC pack but will never be the result of the season pass. It's frankly kind of disgusting to think that this can be allowed and continues to happen in a rhythm game of all things.

As per the actual game itself, it's quite good. The gameplay has to be one of the most fluid and easiest to pick up I’ve ever tried. I do have a few nit-picks like how the UI (especially after the battle pass being added) is particularly mediocre, there is no mouse support in the game, so everything is keybound. The game is built for controller support so I do have to give them that, but it can become annoying sometimes especially with a cluttered menu that could be much easier to navigate with a mouse.

I enjoy that most Gear with the exception of a couple DLC inclusions are keyframed rather than a sprite that runs on 60fps, meaning that even on high refresh rates there aren't any weird desyncs where the gameplay is 144fps, but some animations are 60fps. I also enjoy the accessibility in Gear as there are a few with both shapes and pills for notes, but this also segues to my next point.

The game isn't exactly clear on how to unlock things. It's great with the amount of content you can actually get without paying a cent, but in terms of helping you figure out how to get there? It isn't exactly helpful. The songs in the game are unlocked with every level up until LV.99 which is somewhat straightforward but is not easy considering after 28 hours, I believe I am still LV.40. On the other hand, miscellaneous stuff like Icons, Plates or most importantly, Gear, is not exactly clear on how to get them. For example, The TAPSONIC Gear requires you to get the corresponding achievement for clearing 60 6K songs... but never tells you this? On the Gear selector it simply tells you what the gear looks like and what it's called, and nothing else.

To sum up, this game is great, and is most likely one of the best Stepmania like games on steam. But the way that NEOWIZ conducts its business with this game is making me feel complete sorrow to anyone that dumps all of their money into it.

If you want to get the game, buy it on sale, and buy the UNLOCK SONG PASS on sale. There is not a single other thing you are required to have and there is a great chance that once the servers go offline your money will go to waste anyways. Please try to limit your spending on this game.",1607341197,1672304412,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Switched from Osu! to this game and only thing that bothers me is that you're locked in with same couple songs from base game and DLC. Osu got new songs daily by the community. I guess skin is another thing, you could completely reskin the entire game if you wanted to, but in DJMAX you're stuck with gear and note skins. Not saying thats a bad thing, the skins DJMAX offers are still look better and feel better than any i've played with in Osu! idk if any of this makes sense. Even with the price and all the DLC's this game is still worth buying. Osu is free but DJMAX overall has better feel to it. Go play both.

Reasons to buy this game:
-Playing songs that aren't 4k
-Cool presentation

Reasons to not buy this game:
-There are many other rhythm games for cheaper on steam that offer way more in my opinion. While I'm happy-ish for what I paid for (I bought this game at launch), I keep coming back to osu mania for my 4k fix.
-It's extremely large for what it is. Without the DLCs (though I think they still might be downloaded locally?) The game is 55 GB as of this review. That is larger than pretty much every game in my steam library except like 3. I get that every song has a movie with it, but maybe we could have the option to only download the movies when you play the song (maybe delete the cache after a while?), and have an option to download all the movies for a smoother experience (or even choose to not have movies at all?) For a game I only occasionally boot up to play a few maps, it takes up more space than my entire osu installation with THOUSANDS of songs in it.
-Annoying DRM. It makes it take longer to start up, and it doesn't let you play offline. What if I had a steam deck and I was out and about? Guess I'll cry about it.
-Having to unlock songs. Why on EARTH is the ""unlock song pack"" $10 ($3 on sale)? Why should we have to unlock songs at all? Rhythm games are a pick up and play genre. We just want to pick a song that we like and get going, but a large amount are locked off and require you to play. It's something that annoys me to no end in Deemo and Cytus. I bought the game, let me play the songs. Locking gear and noteskins is COMPLETELY fine, because it's cosmetic. Locking songs is just terrible. It feels like a cash grab decision considering the fact that you can pay to unlock it.
-Not all songs have charts for all difficulty and key combos. Look, I know it's a lot of work, but it SUCKS when there's a song that I play in 6k and go ""ooh I like that"" and switch to 4k to see if I can play a harder version of the song (because I am significantly better at 4k) but it just doesn't have a harder chart. It's especially depressing when it only has the first 2 difficulties, because they're way too easy. I get it, it's just such a buzzkill though.
-It's nothing new gameplay wise. Yeah, it's just like basically every other key-based rhythm game. It doesn't offer any unique new gameplay styles like you might find from ADOFAI or Spin Rhythm.

Preference things:
-This game features keysounding, meaning when you press a button it will instantly play, meaning that it will sound like YOU playing it. While some enjoy it, I personally don't. Even while getting MAX hits, it feels off and it's extremely distracting. There is a ""sound buffer"" to assist in it, but jankiness will continue to pour out, even if the game sees you as playing ""perfectly"". I would love if there was an option to disable it outright.
-I didn't like many of the default songs. There are a sizable, maybe 20ish songs that I like included with the base game, but for a rhythm game (especially since I paid almost full price at launch) that's not very many. This is purely up to taste, but I much prefer the soundtrack of other rhythm games on steam overall than this game.
-There's a lot of DLC. The base game is fine, but man it costs so much money to get all the DLCs even on sale. Other games are far more generous with DLC, though I do understand why they do it like this, just buy the packs that interest you. I don't want to have to research which packs have songs I like, I just want something like what muse dash did and give everyone some familiar rhythm game songs while mixing in originals to learn about all wrapped up in one DLC.
-Side tracks. They are an extra 2 buttons added to any mode. So it's not really TRUE 4k, it's 4k + sometimes you have to press Left and Right Shift or 6k + sometimes you have to press Shift. It can be annoying, I wish I could have the option to turn them off, since I prefer to play pure 6k.

I don't think this game is bad or buggy (though it doesn't seem well optimized for lower spec machines), just maybe not worth most people's dollars. If you just play 4k, don't bother in my opinion. The charts can get tricky at the absolute top, but it's like easier than ~3* osu mania maps. I really enjoy playing 6k, and that is EXTREMELY rare to find in osu, so I'm not too mad about my purchase, though I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from doing it.",1669704138,1669704450,False,0,0,0.491982519626617432,0,True,False,False

Lots of options for how to play that make the game either more approachable or challenging depending on what mode or speed the player chooses. Can easily be played with a controller or keyboard as well. The base game has a decent selection of songs.

Some downsides, which are admittedly going to be valid deal breakers to a lot of folks:
[*]The anti-cheat which requires an always online connection.
[*]The cost and amount of DLC, even if they go on sale frequently.
[*]There is a season pass system that adds a lot of limited time to earn cosmetic flair.

Despite these downsides, I still enjoy plucking away at a few songs here and there and would recommend this game to both longtime and new rhythm fans.

This reminds me of the good old days of DJMAX Portable 2 and DJMAX Trilogy (my 2 most played DJMAX games).
I love that the keynote sounds are actually part of the played song (sounds and sometimes even vocals).

The game has a huge and great selection of all kind of songs (K-Pop, Rock, Trance, metal, etc.). The base game alone includes over 160 tracks each with their own music videos and patterns in 4/5/6 or 8 button mode (there is no 7 button mode). 
If you use a keyboard you will need 2 extra buttons for the side notes which occasionally appears in certain charts. 
On a controller the sidenotes are are mapped on the analog sticks or turntables by default.

Not all songs are available from the start. You get experience points after finishing a song and unlock more tracks as you level up.
Of course, you can unlock new gear and notes, but this time around they are cometics only. You are also able to unlock avatars, plates and titles for your DJMAX profile. 
Unlocked music videos and artwork can be viewed under Collection.

The Collection mode is additionally keeping track of your stats and ingame achievements as well as displaying how far or close you are to reaching said acievements and it's associated unlockables. 

The other Modes are:

[b]AIR[/b]
Playing a random song or use auto play and just listen to them. 
While playing in AIR mode you can not get a game over regardless of how many notes you miss. You can also write messages (not real-time) for other players in AIR mode to read.

[b]FreeStyle[/b]
Basically pick a song and play.

[b]Mission[/b]
Playing songs with certain clear conditions (e.g. cannot miss more than 3 notes, reach certain combo count or score, fading notes, etc.). 

[b]Online[/b]
This consists of two modes: Ladder and Open matches.

The [b]Ladder[/b] mode are 2-player games to climb ranks. Both players are playing the same button mode with a pick-and ban phase.

In [b]Open[/b] mode you play with up to 6 other players. The host picks the song, but you are not bound to play the same button mode or difficulty chart as the other players. This is a very enjoyable online mode.

[b]Ranking[/b]
This is for viewing the leaderboards.

There is no Arcade mode. It's definitely not a deal breaker and some won't even miss it, but would have been nice if it was included. 
Unfortunately, this game is an always-online game due to it's anti-cheat program. So those with an unstable connection might not be able to enjoy this game.

Still, I can highly recommend this game for veterans and newcomers alike.


How great would it be if we could get songs from Superbeat Xonic or Final Fantasy VII in the future?
And please add some of the missing songs from previous games like Beautiful Girl by DJ Keri. Thanks.

Konami's Sound Voltex, Beatmania, and others have caught my eye, but the locations to play at the arcades are few, and the ones that do exist seem to have internet issues -all the time-, preventing people from saving their scores with the E-Amuse Pass. 

With DJMax, yes the game is expensive and yes it's on Steam and yes you have to be online to play it, but if you're installing it on a computer chances are that more times than not you're connected anyway (at least more than the arcades I frequent, sheesh). That, to me, is a moot issue. As for the price? There's a few arcades within a 150km radius that charge a little over 20 euros/dollars (they're about the same at the time of me writing this) each time you go in. If you frequent said arcades several times, you've already exceeded what this game costs and then some. That's how I see it. 

What I like about the game is that you can play it however you want. Console controller, keyboard, one of those gamo2 controllers, etc will all work. The selection of songs isn't bad either; you'll find some hits and some misses in any pack. I will echo what others have said though and tell you that it is best to wait for a sale to buy the game and/or DLCs you want.

If you're a beginner looking to learn and have fun, this is a perfect game. The timing window for ""max"" is easy in this game compared to similar games.

Not only is this a good game to start on, but the difficulty goes far beyond what most players will ever be able to achieve. You won't run out of room to grow with this game, unless you become a music game god lol. If that's the case, you will still probably come back to challenge the hardest patterns in this game, as there are some very very very difficult ones. (nightmare, 4b sc for example)

Imo the best thing about this game is the availability of 4, 5, 6 and even 8 button/key modes for all songs.
If you get bored, you can always try a different button/key mode.

The only downside is that ranked play in this game has a really steep climb as you get higher. Due to the easy timing window, other players will 100% perfect play every song. The last song of the match has a stricter timing to prevent ties.
Also, you will cry when learning tighter timing windows in other games like EZ2ON REBOOT.

However, in 100 hours of gameplay, I've only touched ranked a few times. It's fun, but not the main draw to the game. The issues with it aren't really a big deal. And if you're gonna play ranked seriously, then you're probably good enough to perfect play most songs anyway :)",1664872657,1664872657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

my main gripe about this game is alot of the songs feel amaturish, which is ok they deserve attension too its just there is alot of songs that feel that way, at least in the base game [ i havn't baught any dlc packs for this as i judge the base game first and determine by the base game if the dlc is worth it], looking past that alot of the songs feels bad, the songs that are good can sometimes be ruined by the keypresses an example would be that i played a song that was soft and more ballard like but when i pressed the keys it sounded metallic as if banging on a metal pot or something, that completely threw me off as they were in stark contrast and thus ruined the experience for me. 

For people new to rythmn games or only played them with the phone or the VR this will be a learning curve so the lowest amount of buttons is 4 [phones it tends to be 3 depending on the game of course] most of the songs seem to be dance-like or electronic sounding like someone just slammed there face into a keyboard whilst using a music program lol. some songs are great though and a friend of mine who has been playing this for a long while insists the dlc packs are worth it as they are better than the base game music, my argument is ''why should i buy dlc music just to listen to some good songs to play too? surely there should be good quality ones in the base game too?'' but i am very critical so lol 

Pros: Fun, Has multiple button options [4,5,6,8], it has an AIR mode that is like playing the game during a live stream [?]. there is alot of songs even in the base game. very smooth gameplay i experience no lag

Cons: the music feels amature and hastily thrown together, most of the music is dance or electronic and trance, not many slow soothing songs to play casually to, learning curve [if you play osu! then this would be more your thing], the key presses sometimes make a sound that is in contrast to the song being played which is off-putting and ruins the experience of the song.

I was like 'sure, why not'. What I did not know was that he let me play the hardest song in the game and see how I'd do. I cleared the song to his astonishment. I asked what the game it was and that is how I discovered DJMAX. It became one of my most played games on PSP.

Wait, another vertical scrolling rhythm game?
DJMAX is a game that had a very big following and could have reached mainstream if it was released on more platforms earlier. That decision came rather late. Relatively recently DJMAX made it to PC, that is with DJMAX Respect V. DJMAX is a vertical scrolling rhythm game with several button modes. You can start with 4 button play, progress to 5 buttons, then 6 buttons and eventually end up playing 8 buttons. Apart pressing the regular buttons there might appear a slide note from time to time, there are two slide notes (mapped to Shift keys on PC) and they add little bit more complexity to the game. Since this is a game that was meant to be played with d-pad and buttons the song charts are made the way that it is possible to play them with these - players used to play rhythm games meant for keyboard play may wonder why there's just certain combinations used in the charts.

There are long notes in the game that you need to press as well, just hold them and release them on time. Each note be it a regular note or long note are being judged - you get judgment from 1% to 100% depending on how close to being on time you were. The timing windows are actually huge which makes it easier to hit a note (if you miss by a chance you can just press it again to still hit it).

The timing in the game is very lax (feels even more lax compared to the PSP games). It is the combo, as in many Korean games, that counts the most with you keeping max Fever going. There is a Fever bar that fills with each note confirmation, when it gets full you need to activate it to get a 2x multiplier. Then you continue to fill it again. When you fill it and activate it in time you get a higher multiplier for everything (3x). The maximum multiplier you can get is 5x which will stay for as long as you manage to fill the bar and activate Fever in time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLVkDC9uI70

Each song has a difficulty shown in stars. It ranges from the easiest 1 to the hardest 15 for the 'playstation control' charts. There is another scale marked SC which is meant for keyboard play and starts around 3 and goes to 15 as well and will introduce a playstation player to more patterns and chord combinations making it even way harder - a PC VSRG player will find these SC difficulties more familiar. Note that a SC 3 charts is more like playstation 8 in terms of difficulty.

There are several modes in which you can play, there is Air that lets you play a randomly chosen song or just watch and comment on it. There's Freestyle mode where you can pick any song you want and get the best score. Then there's Online play where you play against other players either using a ladder system or just playing for fun. Lastly there is Mission mode in which you complete a set of songs with certain modifiers or conditions.

So much music
DJMAX offers a wide range of music styles. Many of the songs may be new to non-rhythm game players but there is a lot to choose from and the music is good. For rhythm game enjoyers there are DLCs from previous versions of the game including Technika but also from other rhythm games like Chunithm, Deemo, Muse Dash, Groove Coaster etc. The base game gives you over 150 tracks (there are free tracks added from time to time). All these songs have music videos that you can unlock and watch in the game as well.

DJMAX has style
Korean games tend to look great and DJMAX is not an exception. It looks simply great. It has a great style, and not just one. You can unlock more skins and also customize the look of in-game when you are actually trying to read the charts and pressing buttons. Not many games can rival the look of this game.

In order to unlock customizations including songs you need to fulfill certain criteria. There is a lot of achievements to get in the game and are neatly presented to you. Some may seem impossible to get but when you get them you will feel rewarded. There is no other game that motivated me enough to actually hunt the achievements!

Not everything is great...
DJMAX is a great game that offers a lot to the player but unfortunately there are few things to note. First the game uses anti-cheat Xigncode which requires an internet connection. There is no way to play the game offline or with a bad internet connection. Second thing to note is that the game is very expensive. To this date the total of the game including DLCs would total for me to 388EUR. It is for a lot of content though but there is even more content that is behind a paywall. Each season you can get 'free' stuff, even a skin if you finish all steps. That you can only get if you get a battle pass though. You can even pay for it to automatically unlock at the end of the season. Means throwing a lot of money at Neowiz.

The last thing I'm not fond of is the fact that Steam achievements expect you to have those expensive DLCs. Perfecting this game means a lot of money spent.

Verdict
You can clearly see that DJMAX was created with love. It has everything players could possibly hope for in a rhythm game. It is beautiful to look at, offers 150+ songs of various genres, has different button modes and game modes and gets many DLCs with more great music. So far it may be the only game coming from a different platform that runs without any issue on PC. Unfortunately the game needs constant internet connection and is rather expensive.

I can highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to press buttons at high speed.",1663779583,1663779583,True,3,0,0.560293138027191162,0,True,False,False

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
Overall amazing rhythm game with a great soundtrack and massive skill ceiling. Not a game where you will become amazing within a week and that's whats fun about it. SC is a difficulty/pattern that plays so much different to the other difficulties. The game is constantly being updated with content and a Dev update on their YouTube, the game has heart into it, and it shows with it's Music, artwork, playerbase etc.

In my opinion though, mission mode is not very fun. It's INCREDIBLY challenging, but not just because hard song with difficulty, they had modifiers or other effects that make the song play/look/feel different, some of the missions are minor, where as some are incredibly ridiculous with their difficulty, so it doesn't feel like a game mode where you can play to beat all the missions in order, it's more of a game mode where you play whenever you get better and see if you're good enough to beat the mission you got stuck at, only to get stuck on a different mission. Some people may enjoy this however, it does give you a place to test yourself or a goal to work towards, But for me it just feels unnecessary 

If you're a fan of rhythm games regardless of how they are played, you'll get a ton of fun out of this one!

[b]Cythus/Deemo Update[/b]

The DJMax franchise finally coems back to PC with DJMax Respect V! The series being one of the most beloved rythm games for the PSP (Portable series) and PC (Trilogy) and with numerous arcade titles such the Technicka series. While the series was left rotting due to the change in times and the decline for rythm games on the mainstream area, it still keeps an ample presence in the rythm game niche genre.

[h1]Real Review[/h1]

Okay enough of sugar coating.
The game is great, has lots quite a bit of original music and their videos as well as various licensed artists. While the PC version (this one) is lacking in content compared to the PS4. It complements this with various additions for online interactions.

[h1]Everyone is Gonna Die:Updated[/h1]
Negatives...
The game on release suffered many hitches and slowdowns due to the Anti-Cheat implemented (XIGNCODE3) but most of this issues have been resolved with the latest updates. Becoming more enjoyable and with slowdowns.

Only Negative I have is the cost, but if you value Rhythm games, and you have played on Arcades, then the cost per Song is way better.

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]
Play the game with a computer made in the last 5 years with a dedicated GPU. A capable CPU is you want to stream, and with a SSD or fast HDD. And if you want to go for SC beatmaps, try to use a keyboard as close to N-key rollup. Otherwise you might not be able to perform as great as you would.

[h1]About DLCs and Cost[/h1]
Starting this we will go on the Cost and DLC quality.

[h2]First of all, Cost:[/h2]

While the game is quite expensive in comparison to ""free games"" like osu!mania and, etc, etc. One of my greatest issues with those is that the beatmap chart quality was always awful, while not true for every signle song, it was normal to find it on a Button Number one didn't like or wasn't used to. So even finding a good chart was rare, and when playing online, it was always the same old songs and charts.

As for DJMax Respect V? All those issues are gone, all songs are excellently mapped, you can choose what Button Number you want to play on, the speed for the note drop, and much more, all even when playing Online with friends or randoms. With enough song variety and style variety for it to not get old.

[h2]DLCs[/h2] [i](Currently with, Extended V, Emotional Sense, Trilogy, Clazziquai Edition, Black Square, Deemo and Cythus)[/i]

The game has been out for almost 6 months now, and we have had 4 mayor DLCs (Ext-V, Tri, CE and BS), 2 minor DLCs (ES and GC), and various other cosmetic DLC up for grabs (they are totally optional, but good if you want to support the game or Visual Effect artist, [i]*cough* RDR *cough*[/i]) and with more DLC to come... Those already available on PS4, but possibly another Ext-V? And while not yet ever announced, there is still Portable 3, the phantom DLC which is aid to come in the future.

With the newer additions of Deemo and Cythus song packs, the number of machinegun songs has increased, but still the mappign is wonderful. Too bad there is no full soundkey mapping, but still not bad.

With 104 songs available as DLC as of right now, this pushes the game to have over 250+ unique songs, and hundreds of beatmaps available. Its not a terrible purchase (hurts on the wallet, but I don't have a single arcade on my city, so might as well just buy the DLCs). 

As for DLC Rankings...
- Extended-V
- Cythus Collab Song Pack (Song variety and great songs added)
- Deemo Collab Song Pack (Calm songs with tons of maps)
- Black Square (Difficult songs and some nice ones)
- Trilogy (Old classics that are just great)
- Clazziquai Edition (Some more licensed music but good in general)
- Groove Coaster Collab Song Pack (Do note, its all high BPM songs)
- Emotional Sense (If you just want to have the missing Trilogy songs for your game)

[h1]Anti-Cheat: XignCode3 Addendum[/h1]

What is XignCode3? A DRM and AntiCheat used in DJMax Respect V
Official info at: https://web.archive.org/web/20200818134331/https://www.wellbia.com/home/en/pages/xigncode3/ (original link was killed, but Archive.org has good backup)

[h2]My Thoughts on Anti-Cheat[/h2]

While many, MANY, other players are pushing for XignCode3 to be removed due to it being a ""malware"", ""root kit"", ""I just don't want it"". And while I do understand some of those concerns, it varies from game to game on what features of the Anti-Cheat are used by the game developer. In the case for DJMax Respect V, this only applies to this:

- No Botting for perfect games (Anti Macro)
- No Impossible Scores (Anti Cheat, No Cheat Engine nor Debbuging)
- No Memory Scanners nor Edittors (HeartBeat)
- No fake game owners nor fake DLC purchases. (Online DRM, verified on external server)

I have tried to verify in multiple ways, but on my observations, it DOES NOT HAVE ANYHING SIMILAR TO A ROOTKIT. While it scans memory on startup, the game is very smooth and responsive, without any hitches. And CPU/HDD activity matches for a video/audio decoding routine.

So if you are having issues while gamming, if your PC suffers while playing 1080p video plus fast firing multiple inputs at the same time, this game is not for you.",1587115194,1661316700,True,2,0,0.53271031379699707,0,True,False,False

The re-addition of the SC difficulty brings a new challenge to old songs that have pretty easy charts which gives some older, easier songs get the rejuvenation they deserve.  If the game and it's contents are too pricey, do not worry; the game and its dlc can go for as low as 75% off during big sales.

Easily accessible, and yet provides decent challenges that keep you engaged for a long time. Most of tracks are curated good enough as well, giving you tons of joy while playing(or you could say 'listening') the game.

DLC pricing policy, however, may be burdening, as the game currently has numerous separate packs for additional contents. They mostly have great musics and keynote compositions for what it's worth, though(grab them on sale if you can). Fortunately you can try those songs in open match if you have a clear pass(which grants you an access to all tracks that the host have).

Occasional stuttering and note-skipping are also part of the downside. It can get frustrating to go through the entire track, only to see your game stutter and miss your notes. The issue's not that frequent, but it can be a glaring trouble to say the least.

That being said, it's still the best rhythm game I can burn my free time on over and over in my book. Nothing beats the satisfaction coming from breaking your own records every time you improve. Double the fun if you have friends to play with.

Before I decided to get this one, I checked if my gaming laptop can run the application properly and it turned out that the requirement had been met. Certainly, I successfully installed and began the game. However, I found that when it comes to charts that I need to hit multiple keys simultaneously, the app doesn't accept the key inputs properly though I use a 26keys-rollover-model keyboard. This phenomenon irritates me especially when playing difficult charts, which often have crazy chord patterns. 

I tried to solve this problem by changing in-app settings or installing the latest GPU driver, etc. but ending up with wasting time. To make the matter worse, the Steam platform did not accept my refund request because the total playing hour exceeds two-hour limit. I sent the request for many times and insisted that the reason I played the game for over two hours should be taken into account, but the only result I got was rejections with auto-generated messages.

- ASIO support is implemented, which basically eliminates delay issues;
- DRM is still a thing and you will need internet connection to play the game at all.

============================================

Update Jun 18:

- Filled in the EA compensation survey form, with no response whatsoever
- Wrote an e-mail to the customer services manually, with no response whatsoever

Guess Neowiz will never resolve the situation. Fuck me right?

============================================

Update Mar 12:
This is a great way to say ""F you"" to your early access guinea pigs.
Your pricing policy is absolutely a great idea, charging EA testers twice as much as retail players, phew that's new.

At current state, the game is improving upon itself.

- Audio latency is still an issue, but already much better than day 1. If you're playing on a microswitch controller like Virgoo Fever / EzMax, it will be even less of an issue.
Implementing latency adjustment would be appreciated.

- XIGNCODE 3 is still cancerous.

- The comeback of SC charts are definitely welcomed.

============================================

Original rant @ 2019/12/20:

The game is basically unplayable at this time point. If you didn't notice a huge timing issue, you obviously haven't played the game at all and just decided to smash the like button.

AIR mode is pointless. Despite telling you ""auto-play would disable some rewards"", disabling it doesn't give you any XP. In a game where grinding is important, this is kinda a waste of time.

The XIGNCODE3 anti-cheat/piracy module is cancerous. It has problem with Proxifier and many other programs, scans your system without prior notice.",1576774312,1659091467,False,2,1,0.508215248584747314,0,True,False,False

Ignore those complaints about load times. Must be either slow PC or hard disk. Running it from Adata XPG SX8200 Pro and it is fast. Still great since my earlier Early Access review on December 2019.

Pros:
No crashes after more than 30 hours (2560x1440, 144FPS, FXAA 8x).
PC version.
Highly optimized.
Loads of songs (At least 150 tracks. Lost count).
All sorts of music. Most of them are great.
Higher difficulty for same song.
4B, 5B, 6B and 8B (buttons) mode for even more difficulty.

Cons:
Got my hands pain for Level 8 music onwards (not a con).
DLCs will kill your wallet. Most of the tracks are great though.

Gameplay: The actual gameplay is pretty simple and nothing that makes it stand out from any other rhythm games. This doesn't make it bad as sometimes simplistic approaches are also the best. You do have the additional options of changing the gear & notes you use for cosmetic purposes. The game may not be for everyone as there is no alternative to change whether the notes will be upscroll or downscroll: as this is set to downscroll mind you. First issue I had is immense hand cramps due to the default keybinds being set to A,S and ; @. Left and Right Shift for optional sliders. I was able to easily adjust to the controls although it didn't have any comfort level to it whatsoever. Also, in harder difficulties this keybind WILL fail you as you're unable to simutaneously press 3 or 4 notes altogether. Meaning you're forced to change the keybinds to anything that will prevent that, my keybind for this for 4B (4 Buttons) is S, D & 4 5 on the numbers keypad to your right. It's a lot more flexible and comfortable to grind through songs. For any other buttons like 5B, 6B and 8B I haven't tested to try how good or trustworthy they are.

Music: Honestly the music is a hit or miss. There are varied genres of music like RNB to rap, rock to dubstep/trap, mainstream pop and video game music to anime songs. A lot to work with although a fair majority of them I am particularly not fond of out the 120 songs the base game offers you. I can't speak for everyone as music preference is entirely subjective, nonetheless I still find my way to play every songs I can for the sake of wanting to. Mainly for the sake of grinding or practicing.

Game Modes: OH BOY- where do I even start with this? There's a few select game modes that gives the player a lot to work with instead of solely focusing on ""Free Style"" which is the main game mode most players lean towards to: playing whatever songs you can unlock. There are 3 game modes, Air Mode, Online (Ladder Match and Open Match) then Mission Mode. I will be speaking of their purpose and how I felt when using these game modes.

- Air Mode is just a way to chill out and play through songs the game has available with the community. Even if you don't have DLC it's there to appear and give you the chance to play them. There's a chat box and you can send messages to the lot of people if you don't wish to perform, and in all brutal honesty. I still cannot see the purpose of this mode at all, there is no way to actually converse. It's mainly just listening to music and everyone saying ""GGs"" whilst spamming hearts. I don't know how much closer you can get to that. I never used it much because it felt the same as Free Style, just an added audience who act like bots. (Sorry)

- Online (Ladder Match) is basically you ranking up to the leader boards to test your ability as a rhythm gamer. Which is far from beginner friendly nevermind the fact that it is far from being fair. I without a doubt think this is only for players that have played this game for years or so to gain consistent accuracy regardless of any song and their difficulty. As accuracy is what actually determines whether you win a match or not. There are a lot of tiers too I'm not going to get into because I'm frankly not skilled enough in the degree that the more knowledgable side of the fanbase does. I'm just often met with players whom have clearly spent more hours and/or I fail miserably due to never have seeing a song before; which ends up all being DLC songs  I will DEFINITELY not fucking buy. HOLY SHIT. CHECK IN THEIR STORE, as of TODAY in stores the bundle for the ""COMPLETE EDITION - DJMAX RESPECT V"" it is 344,13 euros it has a 20% price currently which does not excuse anything. Maybe the hardcore fans say otherwise and it all also depends on regional prices and most of the people who own the ridiculous shit are likely more on the fortunate end of the spectrum. An added bonus is the company has claimed they're doing nothing to change of the pricing. :Toma: even the base game is 50,00 euros which I wouldn't expect of a rhythm game at this quality and what it offers. Could be due to the licensing of the songs but overall, it is such a trek. I may be going off topic but it does matter in terms of Ladder Match. I'm not spending an absurd amount of money only to PROBABLY not get a guaranteed chance of winning as it all depends on my actual skill set at hand. Nevermind the fact alone of going against high tier players who can get a 99% or 100% and still be a low tier like me. I am willing to spend hours on a game to get better at my own pace but the ranking system doesn't give you the room to grow and reach your potential. This will likely drive a lot of new players away or anyone getting into the groove of rhythm games which is unfortunate. I'm not determining that everyone will think this way but I'm merely thinking of the perspective of beginner or intermediate players who wish to play rhythm games casually or challenge themselves. ANYWAYS, don't get political over the prices and how people should spend their money. Regardless if you bought it or not, I can't deny that to me this is a LOT and many rhythm games I know of don't have this insane pricing. I bought this on a sale, if it weren't for that I'd not spend my money on this at all.

- Online (Open Match) is.. yeah not much to say. You get to make your own lobby or join a lobby of people but most of the time they're locked by a password and usually filled with Korean players. You'll need like a lot of friends you know of in the game if you really wish to put this mode to use. I don't have anything against global players, it's more like I'm just put at a disadvantage I can't even play with anyone regardless of where they're from. So yeah that's it in a nutshell.

- Mission Mode is what it says, Just missions you have to do that you can unlock more of throughout the game that is likely a good practice for newer players in general + it pushes themselves to improve. For the likes of me, I got bored of it easily as I already could FC songs on Hard or Maximum in a good few hours into the game, thus forcing myself to play songs on Normal with songs I don't like. It destroys the purpose I felt like it was trying to do, It didn't feel rewarding either when I did do them. There is some missions that require you to play in 5B and 6B, maybe 8B even? But I can't confirm that. I thought after seeing that, it may give me something to work towards to and the answer is no. It didn't. I tried it and couldn't find a way to somehow enjoy playing as a newbie to the added buttons. I think on PC it's a lot harder, BUT console is different. Since I have actually played this on a demo many years back on PS4. I can say that 5B and 6B is far much easier to use and play with. I have yet to try this again since I usually just stick to finishing everything with 4B on keyboard before ruining my muscle memory with using a controller. Anyways Mission Mode, it's not the worst but whatever it is trying to aim for. It's doing a bad job.

This concludes my very opinionated review of the game no one asked for, but I am at my wits end of this game and bored to death. :) I have a love and hate relationship with this game, I still am grateful I got to experience this anyways.",1657841913,1657841948,True,0,2,0,1,True,False,False

Base game has a good amount of maps for the price (Around 150 or so) - especially if you purchase this while it's on a deep discount.

Judgements are very lenient compared to similar games which is good for the dopamine but if you're looking for a very pure and accuracy-driven approach you may want to look at things like Quaver or Etterna. 

The maps have very good support for 4/6/8k modes whereas some other offerings tend to be quite lean on the 6/8 modes. Music variety is -fairly good- but that is very subjective. The actual quality and visuals of the tracks is excellent regardless of personal taste.

DLC is a mixed bag and rather expensive when not on sale, but during sales they tend to go ~70% off which makes the purchase cost for a dozen songs much more palatable. Again please remember you can get thousands of maps for free on Etterna or Quaver.

---

Probably the weakest part is that the auto-offset functions don't work as cleanly and can't be set on a per-song basis like in Quaver. Strangely, because the game is so lenient with judgements (which can't be changed even in freeplay), the somewhat inadequate offset tool may not matter that much.

---

Greatest strength is the overall map quality and patterns used, as well as visual representation. The upper end of difficulty isn't as ludicrous as in other free alternatives because this is primarily a port of a PS4 game and many tracks use patterns that are designed to be able to be completed on a controller. For example, maps won't use patterns that would require you to (on a controller) press left and right on a dpad simultaneously. 

V introduced an 'SC' difficulty which is designed for keyboards, although this is not available for every song - it takes the place of the ""hardest"" difficulty for the songs that support it.

---

All in all, very good value if bought during a sale, and a premium feel presentation-wise.

The Game Over screen is also extremely fast and sudden like your typical arcade rhythm games. No forgiveness, when you're out, you're out. If you're new and keep failing, it's going to continuously make you frustrated.

Okay! With that out of the way, this game is fantastic. I ended up using my Korg Nanopad2 with it, and the beatpad pressing action is extremely satisfying. Check out midi-to-keypress on Github if you want to sync up a midi instrument for free. To anyone saying ""ohhh if you can't do it on a controller/keyboard, it won't make a difference with a special button pad,"" you're wrong. Like really wrong.

If you're a fan of Bemani/IIDX games, this is a must-own. The songs are really good. Lots of interesting genres and a ton of good WTF tracks too.

[*]Though there's a wide variety of music genres, there's seem to be an over reliance in some genres more than others.
[*]The game is fun until you realize how much your fingers hurt (shut up, I'm getting old).
[*]Punishing in some minor aspects (say good bye to your big number combo if you do a minimal mistake. Oh the rhythm was hard to take? Sad).
[*]That one is hot, and there's none of.
[*]Not gonna lie here. This game is not seizure friendly. I don't even suffer from seizures, and some music videos are really too much (small correction here. You can kind of town down the video's light, but some still a bit much).
[*]Too much content to pay for. The base game is already good. But if you want the whole DLC, it's gonna hurt your wallet. Even with discount (get most of what you can on discount though).
[*]Whys is there a season pass? >:v

Just play osu! or something similar, not only are there good map layouts, and actual hard songs, but its FREE and there's thousands of songs made by the community to play without the need of purchase DLC.

I moved my May 22nd review from 2020 to the comments to make room here. I wasn't planning to change this originally, but past few months have change my stance on recommending this game to other players.

With the latest update introducing fmod, the sync is virtually unnoticeable as long as you have capable hardware. Mix that in with keyboard input latency patch from few months ago, I can finally recommend this game to others as a good rhythm game.

But what made me change my stance on this is how we got to this point, not what we got. To keep it short, there was a burst of anger within official discord few weeks ago when the limited edition DJMAX keyboard sales went horribly wrong on the Korean side. And, yet again, they were mostly quiet about the issues and banned massive amount of people from their server.

From this, the users finally erupted: They wanted more transparency from the devs, as well as better management within discord server.

Few weeks after, I'm always seeing the questions being answers, and bugs always being looked into (even if it might be hard to fix, or won't be fixed due to limitations). The mods are always engaging in some form with the players. They addressed some main concerns that users had for DJMAX. This is something I didn't see often back in 2020 where the mods were very silent and not communicative unless there was a game breaking bug that they knew for sure they can fix.

The only downside to the positive changes at the moment is that most of the talks are happening on the Korean side of discord (as the only active community-side moderators are Korean). However, I can say with confidence that the communication issues from 2020 seem to be gone now.

I don't know what the future holds, but so far the devs have been more open towards interacting with players which is nice change I must say. I ended my original review 2 years ago with ""It's a game with amazing content, somewhat poor execution, and close to 0 customer service."" I can say for sure now that DJMAX is a game with amazing content, decent execution that's getting patched every few months (for the better), and devs who are willing to communicate with players to make it an even better experience.

It's been 2 long years. But now I can say this is something I can recommend.

Original Review:

TL;DR: I'll most likely keep on playing the game, but can't recommend it to other people. (May edit posted below)

There's lot I want to talk about the current state of the game, but I'll only pick out few of the current PC ones.

Pros:
- Open Matching is geared more towards the casual play of the game, so that people can just enjoy playing regardless of their skill level
- Ladder Matching is probably one of the better, if not best, executed ranked mode for any rhythm game (that involves PvP)
- Quality of the songs/videos is top notch, especially with the new addition of V Extension pack

Cons (only going to pick out a few that I think is top priority atm, and not the personal 'I would like to haves'):
- For a rhythm game, the sync is off. There are many theories to why this is happening and speculations on how to fix this, but the bottom line is that sync issue exists. Option to 'change the sync' actually just changes when the note drops, and may cause de-sync between the background track and the keysounded note.
- Games fun to play when it works. Constant steam issues preventing players from booting the game, players dropping from ladder/online matches due to server issues, frame drops at times and even freezing.
- Due to family sharing, players can share the base game to anyone deemed their 'family'. This allowed some ladder mode users to create additional accounts and smurf on ladder (player-base is already thin, and this is just adding oil to the fire for some players).

I can overlook some of the things stated above; but the lack of responses from the team who created this game is where I have to draw the line. Some of the cons are things that have been spoken by players for some time now but the developers aren't communicating to the players on what they are working on (minus 'we're looking into sync issues' maybe once or twice on English boards) nor responding to the questions that players have. This is now basically a pattern where the devs are silent on user's inputs, and stays silent until someone trashes the boards or the discord so they have to step in and clean it up (and sometimes, they only clean up the mess rather than cleaning up + providing feedback). This has been an ongoing thing since the Early Access days (funny how they called it Early Access when they weren't communicating to the players)

It's getting to a point where even the top Korean players are discussing boycotting the game because any feedback that people provide just gets sucked into black hole. I personally still like playing the game but already seeing effects of it happening: people are dodging ladder matches (really can't get any games except meeting same 3~4 people) and flooding into open matches instead, some players are already discussing jumping ship to another game, and I already have few friends who refunded the game.

If they just said something about sync in official post, or even attempt to acknowledge problem exists within the current game, then players can decide whether they want to ride it out or jump ship until things get better. But nope. We're just left in the dark.

As someone who put in way too many hours into this game, I can't recommend anyone else to pick up the game. If you're okay with a rhythm game that doesn't even feel like a decent pc rhythm game and with a dev team who stays silent on anything that happens, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, stay away and find an indie rhythm game that at least cares about providing feedback to its players. It's a game with amazing content, somewhat poor execution, and close to 0 customer service.",1587563572,1656096436,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,10,True,False,False

[b] Positives [/b]
+ Good variety of content and songs spanning the series' lifetime and new original ones, fitting many different tastes. Hardcore fans and Casual fans will both get their fair share of great tunes.
+ Mission Mode had some gameplay features from different games that I found interesting and creative (converting the Technika gameplay to Respect V gameplay? wow)
+ Air Mode lets you try out songs you don't buy/have yet
+ The gears are a definition of eye candy (with good animations on Fever trigger) and the themes are quite visually pleasing.
+ Good for aspiring casuals to train on patterns since the judgement is very lenient. Can also get a little difficult with SC (Super Crazy) difficulty charts.

[b] Negatives [/b]
- BAD optimization and performance, especially compared to other keysounded VSRGs on Steam*
- Always online DRM, when the original PS4 game can be played offline.
- Some songs are not keysounded at all, (this is present on some collaboration packs) If I wanted to play a non keysounded game I might as well move to community made games.
- The content you got on base game is more weighted to old DJMAX contents, so prepare to buy the Deluxe Edition if you want newer stuff.
- There's a lack of certain latency related options to make your accuracy better like NVIDIA Reflex support
- You can't turn on hard and maximum judgement mode in Freestyle. (You can only get that on certain missions or in Multiplayer matches)
- Only the SC difficulty charts are made for keyboards. I wish there are low - medium difficulty charts made for keyboards.
- Many songs lack some difficulty options, creating a weird hole as you scroll down the song list.
- Battle passes in a paid game complete with the FOMO it brings if you're really lazy? Ugh. Even though it's cosmetic I just have to make this point a negative. Sorry folks.

A precaution: This game is non wallet friendly for completionists. Newer players to the genre might be surprised on how much you will have to buy to enjoy the full course, especially when they're starting out from the community made rhythm games. Welcome to the world of commercial and professionally made rhythm games!

* Everytime I play songs in this game, at some point the framerate will take a hiccup and then the song goes haywire with the song/keysound sync, making it unplayable.

You practically have to memorize the songs without the speed modifier if you want to complete those challenges, it's that bad.

[h1]No Internet? Too Bad[/h1]
-Not being able to play offline is a deal breaker for me. I mean I get it, it's to prevent cheating and protect leaderboards and whatnot, but inconvenience is a thing. There's nothing worse than finishing a song and then something happening internet wise and my score/results doesn't go through. I'd understand if it was some online multiplayer only game that required internet at all times to play, but it's DJMAX. The game that I played in the past when riding trains or taking it easy at home.

[h1]Our Difficulties, Our Rules[/h1]
-This is one of, if not, the only rhythm game I played where songs have their own specific difficulty settings to choose from. Maybe it was always like this since portable but I don't know why it's still like this. Most rhythm games I played keeps it simple. You pick a song, and you pick one of 3-5 difficulties. Some games only have 3 and some have 4 or more. But the most important part is that ALL or at least most of the songs have these difficulties available. DJMAX Respect is all over the place. Some songs will only have Normal and Hard, some having Normal Hard but then only letting you do Maximum if you change your mode to 6 buttons, and there's even a song that doesn't have maximum. It just goes from Normal, Hard, then straight to SC. I'm sure maybe they have their reasons for this (maybe because having the easier songs with harder difficulties would make it difficult to make notes that go with the song), but it's really inconsistent and bothers me when the songs I love is too easy and the other ones I like go from hard to SC (which I can handle some of them but it might be a different story for others).



[h1]SC Recommended lol...[/h1]
-Why do they say on the loading screens that they recommend SC difficulty if you're on keyboard? Yes, playing on keyboard isn't difficult, but not everyone puts an immense amount of time into rhythm game(s). Players have different reaction speeds/skill and while they can be improved with practice, you can't practice efficiently if you're a new player constantly trying to do the hardest difficulty and getting game over seconds into a song. It takes time to get good at games like this, and it's almost as if they think all of the players who got this game are already really experienced at rhythm games.

Like I said before, this game is good for what it is and I had a lot of fun. But I really can't recommend this to others. I could have mentioned the fact that half of the background videos of this game during play is incredibly disorienting and forced me to turn it off to actually play the music well, but there are other rhythm games that do the same (though for this game it's the worst I experienced so far, which sucks since a lot of the animations/videos are really good).

|=| What a lot of reviews complain about |=|
The anti-cheat. It truly doesn't effect anything. That's all I have to say about that. If it effects you somehow, sucks to suck.

The season passes and cosmetic garbo. What they don't mention is that the game never tries to shove it down your throat or force you buy anything. I already bought the DLC, and I don't feel any obligation to purchase the season pass... so I don't... pretty easy. Not even very tempting, its just... there.

The price. Ugh, get a job, look up the r/beermoney page on reddit, something, like my god, it doesn't cost that much. Yes, when its not on sale, the price is a bit unruly, but its on sale often, and is worth the money spent. 

A lot of reviews say the game is ""too easy"". I think this is because people spam keys, since it doesn't technically have a penalty at the lower difficulties, and then think ""oH bOy ThIs GaMe Is So EaSy"" I wouldn't just out right say its ""easy"". Every game similar to this genre scales in difficulty. This one, scales pretty far. If it's ""too easy"" then you must be getting Max Combo on 8 key SC difficulty right? Oh... No? Well... then it must not be very ""easy"" huh -.- And if you CAN do that, and are still saying its too easy, then try getting a life, maybe going outside, getting some fresh air, grab a coffee and meet a women, walk that poor neglected dog, find a job, work 120+ hour weeks, drive yourself into a self destructing depression and end up in the hospital, rethink life decisions, marry girl from coffee shop, find a new job with a reasonable work to pay ratio, get your own house and then try playing the game again. Shouldn't be too easy anymore.

|=| Now my issues, I guess? |=|
When the track speeds up during parts of certain songs it's not a very smooth transition. Keeps you on your toes though.

Some tracks don't always follow a sort of rhythm or beat. The majority of songs aren't like that but a few are so off beat that it's easier to complete muted.

The difficulty scale doesn't always make sense? Not that it has to be 100% accurate but for examples sake (purely just an example, I don't really care enough to write down what songs I found this to be the case with), say you can do various 10 star difficulty songs with ease, then a 6 star song shouldn't be difficult but in some cases, it is... if not harder.

There wasn't much of a tutorial, I mean, sure there was for the actual game-play, but then it just kinda throws you in and I had to figure out the menus and stuff myself. Not a big deal but when a person starts playing this game, wouldn't it be better to have the menu on freestyle or missions? Not everyone who bought this game has played and knows what's where and what to do and on that note, this game generally is not the most newbie friendly. Hints constantly saying ""SC is the recommended difficulty for PC"" is just... stupidly misleading? I can't even fathom completing an SC song yet, it's not cause I'm awful at the game, I just haven't been able to drown hours upon hours in older or related title before coming to this.

And finally, why I think overall it's worth the money.
I have dabbled in similar games (community driven ones), the game-play isn't something new or unheard of, but aesthetically the game is very beautiful. On top of that, not having to scour the internet, download music packs and songs that I probably won't like, and then wait for everything to sync, has already made this purchase worth it to me. You load it up for the first time, you get a large variety of genres and everything you want it there, no issues. Yes sounds like a lazy reason to buy this, but I'm not broke and what other reason is there to buy a rhythm game? If you aren't looking for aesthetic, ease of access, or cosmetics then shouldn't you just stick to the free stuff?

I hope this review can be of some help, if for whatever reason you feel it's necessary to comment about something you didn't like in my review then I suggest taking it to someone who actually cares because I sure as hell don't :)",1651419463,1651419463,True,1,0,0.425558686256408691,1,True,False,False

Hands down it is my favorite music game that doesn't require a dance pad. I even went as far as to buy a $300 arcade style controller when this game came out on PS4. Between the controls, the songs, and the feel, you'll be hard pressed to find better experience available in North America.

That said the DRM check for this game is ludicrously insulting. You absolutely **MUST** be online to launch the game and it uses a DRM software that has a rather dumb history with regards to privacy. This is just as bad as the DRM check was for DJMAX Trilogy, which required a special USB dongle... and that's my only legit complaint. 

I've logged hundreds of hours into this game and it's been sort of the cornerstone of my weekly streams. The colab packs they've put together have given me exciting new ways to play songs from other music games without worrying about ""stepmania tier"" charts. 

Get it. Get it now. Don't delay. As I write this the base game is on sale for $15. A steal at twice the price.",1578039060,1651180834,True,0,0,0.549755275249481201,0,True,False,False

I have been playing this game on and off since Early Access when it first launched roughly 2 years ago.  At first, I was showering this game with praise as it is the only DJ Max game left that most people could have access with on PC.  I can't say much about the PS4, PSP, and/or PS VIta since I no longer own DJ Max games on those.

But seriously now... Xsigncode 3?  I understand they want to squash the hackers on the leaderboards, but for the most of us that play casually, this is a bit too much.  I would like to give my subjective input about the this game.

PROS:
1. Large library of songs from different DJ Max games, saves the headache from keeping certain ports of the game just to play a few favorite songs.

2.  I can host and play with my friends that don't have the DLC and just the base game.

3.  DJ Max has been around for many years with a strong fan base.  Even as far back as EZ2ON days

CONS:
1.  Probably the biggest one is the XSignCode 3 anti cheat, the most invasive anticheat software you could have picked for a simple game like this.  I feel they only did this JUST for competitive ladder, to which most people just play open lobby (privately with friends) or Freestyle mode just to have fun.  This is purely overkill.

2.  Unless you are a DIE HARD DJ Max fan (I would consider myself one), the amount of money you spend to buy the song pack DLCs can get expensive.  Especially that if it only comes with 1 song that you like, you get a bunch of unpopular ones with the rest.  Its best to just play with friends that can host a lobby that has a larger song list to choose from.

3.  Understandably, this game REQUIRES online access to play.  There is no offline mode, therefore, when this game does go down and the devs no longer support the game.  All the money you spent on DLCs, THEMES, and SKINs.  Your sh*t out of luck.

Thoughts?:

I might sound hypocritical when I love the series, but hate what the devs are doing with the game.  I truly want to support this game.  But with the current direction and state of the game.  I feel it has become a double edged sword.

On one hand, It is the most up to date DJ Max game there is officially so fans can enjoy the series and songs they loved playing.  There is history to this series.

On the other hand, The amount of money you invest into this game potentially will never return if anything happens to the online service.  Will there be an end of life patch once this game's life is about to end?  I'm not sure, as DJ Max Trilogy suffered this same fate which most players with USB Dongles have no way to access their games to play again.

The Bottom line?  Ultimately, if you are a long time fan with the series and decide to overlook the bad sides of this game, I can highly recommend it to you.  Unfortunately, for a majority of others, it is a one sided love/hate relationship between you and the developers of this game.

I hope this helps some of you make the decision to play this.",1580262049,1651102997,False,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,True

This game has potential to implement some new gameplay aspects, but they throw that potential away. You can see that ""various"" gameplay from mission mode, but it's limited and locked to very few songs in the game. Now the best thing they can do is milking our wallets with f**king useless and endless ""Season Pass"". The endless season pass provides just anime-style decorations and nothing has been added or changed in the major gameplay part since the first season (the game is at season 5 while writing this review. yes, that means they've released 5 rubbish passes in total). Matchmaking is meh, just win 2 out of 3 songs and get some rank points, get a decoration at the end of season, rinse and repeat on the next season. and whats AIR mode for? a new interactive screensaver?

Many QoL improved features still have not implemented into this game (such as mouse supporting, more random options in freestyle mode, in-game combo/judgement pos. customization, early-late indicator, etc.), and the game is using a horrible anticheat which consume your PC resource and effect your gameplay sometimes (like framerate dropping or stuttering). Moreover, internet connection is required even you want to play a song in single player mode.

This game has its strength in various song genres, but lacking of gameplay aspects makes me just run this game when a new songpack is released, try new songs for an hour, and leave it in the library for a couple of months until another songpack is coming.

Price: What may deter people from this game is its pricing including DLC. I got this game for 15 bucks during a sale, its normal price isn't the most friendly so I recommend getting it during a sale. Its DLCs aren't much different, if you're planning to get DLC, then make sure to choose ones you are actually gonna play (mainly ones with songs you like and will have fun with) 

Gameplay: It's very good as long as you have a computer that can run the game at an acceptable performance, you may have to lower some graphics settings if there are FPS drops, you don't need a very powerful computer for this game (just look at the minimum specs or be close to its recommended) The game can be played with keyboard or controller to fit the players style which is nice, unfortunately its hardest difficulty SC is mainly created for keyboards and kind of takes away the diversity aspect. As a keyboard main I have no problem for this, but if you are controller user it can really be a bummer.

I decided to make a review now because I noticed this game's getting a Mostly Negative reviews mark on its Steam page and I honestly want people play this game even if there are other free alternatives out there. Really the point of rhythm games, in my perspective, is to have fun and enjoy the experience, especially if you have a huge love for music.

With the first song, I instantly realized; [i]you[/i] are the one playing a crucial part of the song. If you time your notes poorly, which this game is not forgiving with, the song will sound bad. If you miss a note entirely, that note will not play in the song.
This is [i]terrible[/i] if you like the song or are trying to listen to it in order to hit notes. It ruins any enjoyment you might've had in the song, turning it into a battle against the game to make it sound right.

I mean, you guys can make use of Steam's default DRM and Anti Cheat (VAC). The fact that it can't be played offline irritates me as the PS4 able to play offline. It's not like your whole life would having constant internet connection in the countries like South East Asian countries, as I myself always kept few offline stuffs for offline use and flight trips.

Aside for this, contents are great, music are great, nothing more can be said. DLCs are near complete with DJMAX Technika Tune, DJMAX Technika Q, DJMAX Ray, and Tapsonic titles missing but the majority of the DLCs have been ported pretty goodly. Only my concerns if this game stopped servicing, all the DLC can't be played offline and would be pretty useless unlike the PS4 counterparts.

Would I recommend the game? If you're a fan of DJMAX game and don't have console, I'd slightly recommend it. Honestly, I'd recommend the PlayStation version more, but if you want to take it, go on. It's what you like after all. Sadly steam don't give an option to give 6/10 rating.

You can definitely play this without any DLCs, because there are some free bangers from collab set
For example: get jinxed, pop/stars and 3 guilty gear songs (I never knew I needed them in my life, but apparently I did). 
There is a huge selection of original songs too, so you won't get bored.

First, The mission mode has a steep learning curve that can frustrate newcomers; players who happen to pass are only rewarded icon and banners for these intense missions.
Second, the clear pass in a way defeats the purpose of paying for DJMax as well buying the DLCs. For instance, I had already bought a DLC that includes all of the songs, UI theme, BUT ONLY SOME OF gear of the respective theme. The rest of the content that corresponds with the DLCs can ONLY be accessed via clear pass. To add insult to injury, a premium subscription is required in order to get most of the customizable content (UI, gear, clear sound, fever sound, EVEN the judgement design) The free tier only provides mostly profile cosmetics ( icons and banners). And if paying for access to content ONLY to end up drilling through songs to EARN THE PREMIUM CONTENT YOU PAID FOR wasn't enough,  those content are COMPLETELY UNAVAILABLE once the SEASON for the clear pass is OVER. For rhythm game that has to be paid for it should not be treated as if its free to play, like Fortnite. If it wasn't for the fact that I was focused on the music and gameplay, I would have IMMEDIATELY requested a refund because of this sleazy pass feature.
One thing, however, that has made me most concerned with the legitimacy of this game is the UNNECESSARY measures Neowiz goes to prevent online cheating and piracy on DJMax. Of course, I was told that using cheats was against terms and would break the agreement and I have noticed a program called Xigncode3 would initiate when I start the game. Still, I was curious about what Xigncode3 does and decided to research this program, only to discover that this program SCANS MY DATA TO PREVENT CHEATING. The EULA never told me that an anti-cheat system would READ MY PERSONAL DATA to check for cheating/hacking programs. 
As for piracy, the game uses an online DRM system to circumvent infringement. The problem with this is it FORCES players to STAY ONLINE IN ORDER TO PLAY. This can be a major inconvenience for gamers who are used to single playing. 
To summarize, DJMax holds great potential, as a PC rhythm game, thanks to its songs, but its held heavily by a SLEAZY subscription pass, INVASIVE and UNECESSARY anti-cheat/piracy practices , as well as its unfair distribution of extra content.

I think DJMax Respect V has shown me that keyboard rhythm games are fun. I have had a history with vsrg games before such as stepmania, but for some reason those games are hard for me to enjoy. If you told me this was a series that has had a history since 20 years ago, I wouldn't have believed you.

What makes me enjoy the game?
Could it be the music? The charting style that the game has? The amount of the content it provides?
The music in this game is excellent and the charts this game provides even at the high levels are extremely fun. You get the base game and you have pretty much a lot of content, over 100 songs! But expansions and seasonal updates come out breathing new life into the game every so often adds even way more content to the game. The game (with expansions) currently sits with over 400+ songs; most of them being original to the DJMax series along with many songs that are from collaborations with other games.
You can open up mission mode to find the capabilities of what the engine can do in a pretty innovative fashion.

This game is still getting content in the future with some expansions already announced to be in the works. If you are looking to find a fun rhythm game, or trying to get into a rhythm game, I think DJMax Respect V is a pretty good choice.

The bad:
> Always-online required (I get that it's for the anti-cheat system, but man we can't play if the servers are down and/or they pulled the plug in their game's servers. Neowiz has a history of shutting down games with no option to refund past purchases)

As a result of that, I can't quite recommend this game. It requires you to use analog sticks if it detects that you're playing on a controller; since I don't have those, I have to remap everything with joy2key and use my actual keyboard for menus. There's no mouse support in the menus either, so I'm constantly having to reach for odd buttons (F10 opens the options menu, for instance). It's a pretty big annoyance when the problem could have been avoided by letting me remap just two inputs.

Also, even though being always-online offers a few cool features, the fact that the game won't run at all while offline is pretty unacceptable. 

Finally, there's a double-whammy of difficulty balance that makes the game hard for me to recommend to anyone who isn't basically already a pro at rhythm games. For starters, this game is just really gosh-danged hard. I'm no pro, but I've played my fair share of rhythm games over the years and I'm having a hard time completing most songs on their lowest difficulty. There are very, very few songs that a true beginner could actually complete. Secondly, those few easy songs are all kinda similar; they're generally slow, simple, sugary pop songs.

I'm aware my hour count may seem very low in this game, but I am not new to this genre or even this style of game. A little over a year ago I got heavy into 4key through OSU! Mania after years of dedicating myself to Guitar/Clone Hero and deciding I wanted to try something new. In that year I managed to crack at my peak, Top 68k globally and 10k in the US ([url=https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15195525]My Profile for Proof[/url]). So this review comes entirely from my experience with OSU! Mania compared to this game.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
If you have any interest in downscrolling rhythm games this is the game for you, easy and intuitive online modes, multiple ways of play (4k, 5k, 6k, 8k), all the charts seem to be VERY well done and vary widely in difficulty welcoming all skill ranges. [b]IN MY PERSONAL OPINION[/b] this game far exceeds the quality of OSU! Mania and is an absolute no brainer, [b]9/10[/b]

[h1]More In-Depth Thoughts:[/h1]
Though games like Clone Hero, OSU! Mania, Stepmania, and Etterna are free giving them absolutely no barrier to entry and a much wider variety of music to choose from the value of an extremely well put together premium game can't be ignored. OSU! Mania for example, the one I've far and away played the most of, has 4k/7k as officially supported ranked difficulties but they are still at the end of the day side modes to the far more popular OSU! Standard. This means it gets updated far less often and major changes to the system are rare. Which is why a decent portion of the community migrated away to Etterna. However, something like DJMAX has been worked on by the same studio for years with downscrolling being their only focus, thus the system feels and looks tighter. I've never met a person on planet earth who likes Mania's release timings on long notes. This game not only doesn't have that issue but also makes LNs more interesting by adding a second type known as Side Tracks. I personally found this quite clunky in my first hour or two and it's still 99% of the time the reason I drop an FC (or MC in this game) but the more tracks I played the more I enjoyed this addition (Try KD/A if you want a really fun example of the mechanic in action without the difficulty being so high it feels overwhelming). Changes like that as well as how much more transparent feeling the scoring system is and many other features such as the ranked 1v1 online mode and really enjoyable single player content make this game a massive value proposition for more than JUST the free play feature you get in most Rhythm Games. The biggest knock against this game compared to a free alternative is the song variety (lack of representation of certain genres like Jazz and Metal which can often be some of the most fun genres in 4k) and the fact most songs don't have every single difficulty meaning a song you really enjoy might be inaccessible due to being out of your skill range or un-fun to play for the opposite reason. The DLC is VERY expensive (Holy Shit it's $127.07 ON SALE for the complete collection) but you get a pretty decent chunk of new songs with each pack so it doesn't feel as bad to buy them piece meal, and the base game (on sale for $15 as of writing this) is really jam packed with songs as is. Additionally though we might be lacking overall in genre representation the songs that are there are mostly original to this game and are all extremely well charted. Mania tended to have same-y repetitive patterns due to the way the community self regulates and standardized itself. This game isn't afraid to change up a specific pattern within the same song or experiment with more unique implementations of pre-existing patterns. Though it makes sight reading a little more difficult at my level of play it also makes tracks more fun and even makes lower difficulty content still interesting to play (again I point to KD/A and it's usage of Side Tracks to emulate the dance moves that go with the song, something Beat Saber also did with the same song). This game will for sure be my go-to for 4k gameplay for the foreseeable future if not forever, as I consider also trying to learn something like 6 or 8 key once my 15* clear rate goes from 2 to every track available in the game. Anyone with even the slightest interest in Japanese Arcade Style Rhythm games has no reason to not at least try this game, you won't be disappointed.

[h1]Closing Thoughts:[/h1]
This review is longer than every other review I've ever written combined and multiplied by 2 and it's on a game I currently only have 5 hours in. If that alone isn't enough to tell you how passionate I am about it and how good this game is I'm unsure how to sell you on it. I just recently bought an XP-Pen Tablet to start learning OSU! Standard (based on Elite Beat Agents/Ouendan) and have all the sudden found myself rediscovering my love for 4k after feeling a massive burnout and planning on taking a break from it. That tablet probably won't see much use in the near future and I honestly couldn't be happier.",1643455865,1643455865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Before I go off, I will have to say that this game has an amazing user interface,. All the interactions and menu animations are absolutely gorgeous. However, this does not change the fact that this game is just a worse version of Osu!mania. The song selection can not even begin to match the massive user generated DATABASE Osu! holds. Any song and any artist will probably already have a map on Osu! if you seached, and if it's a popular one there's probably 3-4 maps already done by different mappers. 

Quantity isn't the only advantage Osu! holds over this game, they hold an advantage in gameplay/map quality too! Having a system where anyone is allowed to upload their own maps and everyone can play them means that the community determines the quality & promotes the popularity of the maps. Simply put: popular maps are popular because they are good and liked by the player base. This game however, generate their own maps and have their own internal quality control. This provides a solid base-line for map quality, but it cannot attain excellence. There can only be so many ""excellent maps"" in such a small sample size that this game provides, meaning Osu! beats this game soundly in quality.

These are just some of the things I've got off the top of my head. It may sound like I'm shilling for Osu! but I really did enjoy this game. Just not for the price.

Music: 3/5
Graphics: 4/5
Story: ?/5
Gameplay: 3/5

Would I recommend? 
Just play Osu!

The game itself has the most polish of ANY rhythm game I've played, huge song selection most of which are wonderfully charted. 

As a controller only player I am ecstatic that the impossible key combinations are all only in SC charts, and every song in any key mode (4,5,6,8) as long as it's in normal/hard/maximum (all difficulty options) is all playable with a controller (ie all the patterns included are possible). This is a huge problem for me in all other rhythm games as they make no distinction to the player whether they're on controller or keyboard and lump all the patterns together including impossible charts.

As for the strict online only part, I can understand why. As piracy is a huge thing and this is probably the best way to mitigate and counter piracy. In this day and age (in 2022) we should have a permanent internet connection anyways so this should not be an issue at all. 

The other thing is that it's relatively expensive without a sale, so do wait for a sale before purchasing!

TL;DR 
Pros:
-THE Definitive DJMAX game
-Huge amounts of songs
-Controller impossible charts are all SC difficulty only 
-Most songs are wonderfully charted 
-True keynotes allow players to inject their own flair into songs
-Beautifully animated background videos (and a collection to watch them in)

Cons:
-It's expensive

Cheers, and hope to meet you on the ladder or in game if you decide to buy the game!

The game is an overall charming revival of the series, with a varied song selection and surprisingly thorough charting principles on the ""easier"" songs so that nearly everything is a blast to play. The game encourages players to try out a variety of modes with different chart difficulties so that the game continues to remain fresh across the same songs. I wish more free content was added to the game throughout its lifespan; however, what we have so far is certainly a package worth recognizing.

This is a solid rhythm game with good charting across a variety of formats. There are some things you should know before buying though:

- Songs are grouped by which past game they were ported from, which means there is no sensible grouping by genre or aesthetic. This means it is extremely likely that the songs you find appealing will be spread across various DLCs.
- While the formats are labelled as 4k, 5k, 6k, and 8k, all modes actually also have two ""side tracks"" similar to Sound Voltex's FX buttons. I found it odd and unexpected that the 4k mode uses 6 buttons.
- You cannot rebind ""side track"" inputs on gamepad, even though you can on keyboard, so you may need to do some awkward gamepad key mapping to get your preferred input method to work.
- Nearly all songs except for collaboration songs have key sounds, which cannot be turned off. This specifically means key sounds that are taken out of the original track and then timed to your inputs. I really dislike this, because a rhythm game shouldn't be made easier by muting the audio, and yet that's what this mechanic achieves in practice.

All that said I do enjoy the game, but it sure is pricey and I don't think I'd feel the same if i hadn't got it on sale.",1640845136,1640877028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have logged ~100 hours in this version, WAY more on the PS4 version, and play a LOT of other rhythm games across all platforms - please take this into account when I give my thoughts and opinions on this game.

Good:
+ Great, diverse soundtrack. From slow orchestral songs to upbeat bops, I'm sure anyone would find at least a dozen songs that they'll want to play every session. And this is made by a Korean, so there's a lot of songs with Korean lyrics too. So Korean speakers or K-pop fans looking for something fresh might enjoy a lot of the songs
+ Great UI (in and out of song). UI elements are both stylistically-superb and functionally-relevant, menus are relatively easy to navigate (esp. by rhythm game standards), etc.
+ Large range of difficulty. Not only do songs have different difficulties, but there are different button modes: 4 button, 5 button, 6 button, and 8 button. So beginners and experts will find somewhere to start. AND the different button modes has the added bonus of accessibility, so it's a win-win!
+ Lots of content. Lots of stats to look at. Lots of things to collect... almost to the point to it being a bad thing
+ Online mode. It's a mode. Online. With friends or ranked. There's a lot to do. It's so fun and robust that you start to forget that few rhythm games even have online
++++++++ There's a Girls Frontline pack. Abandon laifu AND waifu. Obtain raifu

Bad:
- LOTS of paid DLC, though I am more sympathetic about this. I don't think this is really a cash grab - there is just a lot because most of the DLC is from the original PS4 that came out 3 years before this game. Some people might say, ""well if you already had the charts/songs on PS4, just include them in this version for free;"" but there might be some re-mapping or re-licensing that they might need to do for the PC version, so idk. Regardless, it is a lot of money to spend to be current. As someone who spends a lot of money at the arcade, this isn't a huge dealbreaker. But if you want a PC rhythm game experience and are broke AF, you might want to stick to stuff like Muse Dash or Beat Saber.
- Air mode is very lackluster. It feels like they wanted to go with the whole live play experience (remember GH Live?), but they didn't fully commit. You'll play it once and never again
- Season pass and FOMO content is very toxic. Normally, I'm on the fence on this one, but there is a LOT of paid DLC in this game. 
--------- To start this version of the game, you ""Press any key to pay respect."" But in the PS4 version, you ""Press X to pay respect."" The PS4 version of this game is by far superior to the PC version in this regard.

Tipping points:
~ Most of the songs in this game feature keysounds. Keysounds mean that if you hit a note early or late when playing a track, the note in the song will play early or late respectively. Some people love this, some people HATE this, and most people feel whatever about it (think O2jam or IIDX). If you HATE rhythm games with keysounds, you will not like that about this game; but there are a few DLC packs w/o them (i.e., Deemo, Cytus, Nexon packs... off the top of my head). Conversely, if you LOVE keysounds, you will be disappointed with some packs NOT featuring them. And Neowiz isn't very transparent regarding what will or will not feature keysounds
~ PS4 functional and DLC parity issues. Neowiz did a lot of changes (and even nerfing) to the PS4 version to keep it on par or lesser with the PC version, especially at launch. And as of this review, starting with the Nexon pack, all collab DLC packs will be PC exclusive. This means that the PC version is the definitive version of this game, but who knows what will happen if Neowiz moves back to console.
~ SC charts. If you're coming from PS4, please note that SC charts cannot be played on a Dualshock controller due to how the Dpad functions. Inversely, this ONLY applies to SC charts - any other chart can be played on a controller as they are up-to-par with the PS4 charts.",1640800160,1640800160,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a good mix between old and new.

It did take me a good amount of hours to get the game running how I needed - sync issues between audio and video, game not liking my audio output device for some reason, low framerates or performance issues. A lot of things could go wrong with the game and found little info out there (besides perhaps the official Discord server which still seems quite active). I take it all rhythmic games will need a couple of tricks here and there to have them running smooth, and may always be a solution.

Game modes are enjoyable, especially since the Arcade mode was replaced with Air mode (which is basically a radio station broadcasting songs and you jump in to play them at your desired difficulty). Free Style and MIssion modes are still there, and Online (Versus) mode was smooth when I tried it too - maybe the matchmaking takes a bit longer occasionally but my experience was good.

Lastly, while I'm not a fan of the season pass model, it is good that at least the game does not go into p2w path - at least not from what I've seen. There are several unlocks for the season (4 is the first one I play) and they are only cosmetics. For the rest, it's just your skills.

If you're a DJMAX fan, you probably already have this game and are enjoying it, but if you're not and you're looking to get into DJMAX, prepare some cash buffer because if you like rhythmic games and are willing to push through the initial learning curve, this game will be your new obsession.",1638864530,1638864530,True,3,0,0.562311887741088867,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't recommend it to others due to this. If the company goes down or they shutdown the servers, so does your access to this game and you better say goodbye to your money. What a crap DRM.

I really hope someone brings justice to these anti-consumer practices.

Update 3-12-21:  Despite the above issue, I kept playing on 2020 and logged 135 or so hours on this game cos it was fun despite the terrible drm situation that hasn't been addressed yet. Most likely they will keep it until the game dies.

However, at the start of this year, the devs added season passes (named clear pass) which basically killed my interest in the game. Free track is lame, cosmetics items are impossible to obtain after a season and you can't ignore this feature as it's shoved in your face everytime you boot the game or complete a track in freestyle. I'm sorry, but if you make this game a FOMO ridden crap I'm not interested. I don't want to feel like this game is my job. 

The only game to my knowledge that has a decent battle pass system is Deep rock galactic and in said game the pass is: a) completely free b) cosmetic items not obtained won't disappear, you'll be able to obtain them in other ways later c) can be ignored except for the victory screen at the end of a mission (anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes long), which is shown for like 10 seconds.

First getting this out of the way; online-only has never bothered me with this game and I've never been kicked due to a spotty connection. YMMV, of course.

As for the game itself, the graphic design and art direction are just absolute eye candy. You'll spend as much time staring at the animated backgrounds in menus as actually playing. Countless music genres and styles to choose from. I have almost all the DLCs and there are around 30 songs I've never played nor plan on playing since they aren't my cup of tea, but the variety EXISTS and you'll still be prodded into discovering new songs in Online mode.

If you come from other rhythm games, be advised that the timing window is on the lenient side here, and there's no way to know if you hit the notes early or late (thank Konami for suing other rhythm games into cutting features). Chart difficulty on higher levels makes up for the timing window, with the most difficult songs being kind of reminiscent of O2Jam's mashy style of charts. Also the big majority of the songs are keysounded. Those that aren't are mostly the licensed tracks, which is a shame but it's understandable that licensed tracks won't provide MUCA with all the source sounds and bites for the track.

Probably the very best paid beatmania-like rhythm game on PC as of 2021.

As a last word of warning, developers behind the DJMAX series have been known to completely ditch their mobile online-only games in the past and leave them unplayable, rendering all your purchases lost. This game has been going strong for 4 years on PS4 and 2 years on PC, so beware if you plan on keeping this forever or the admission price is a sacrifice on your wallet.",1637993200,1637993328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is, dare I say, nothing that quite compares to the robust quality of this rhythm game in the music game genre. I bought Respect on PS4 years ago and fell in love immediately. There is so much to work towards, so many great songs, and plenty of options on how to play. A rhythm game with actual progression? What? And it's fun? What!?

Also, because I feel like it deserves recognition, the graphic design of this game is insane. I could sit on the main menu themes forever. Whoever is in charge of this game's art direction is an absolute god. 

$60 can be pretty steep, because it most definitely is when looking at all the expansions for this game as well.

Honestly... The charts don't feel good to play in my opinion. It feels like the notes are placed arbitrarily through the tracks and they shuffle between the melody, rhythm/drums and other aspects of the music too frequently. Just personally it's not for me... There are other games that do the same thing but better... Again, in my opinion. The charts just don't feel great to play.

Also, I know that side notes are ingrained in the charts as a mechanic in the game, but it's something that adds frustration to me as a player who is used to 4/6 key play and it actually being 4/6 keys not 4 (+2)/6 (+2). I guess I'm just not used to change.

This game adds a different depth of play to the rhythm genre with extra mechanics to increase the difficulty; some players may like that challenge. Personally  it's more bothersome.",1635777292,1635777292,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

There are free alternatives out there, but they sometimes require going to forums from 2011 to find song packs, the visuals will be for 480p screens, or if nothing else that the song charts are made by rhythm game enthusiasts who have 16 fingers. 

With around $26 (the current sale price for the Deluxe Edition) you get something like 200 songs, all with videos, key sounds (the notes actually play the sound from the music), and note charts for 4,5,6 and 8 button playstyles ranging from beginner to insane. You can pick this pack up and learn with a gradual difficulty ramp from beginning to end.

The base game won't let you down. Just buy, or add it to wishlist and wait for discount.

DJMAX is an arcade-style rhythm game, where you [b]follow the commands on-screen and mash buttons to the beat[/b]. Each command corresponds to an actual sound in the song, so you're essentially recreating the song in real time. On the flip side, broken music is in itself a punishment for shoddy play.

As of June 2020, [b]the base game contains 167 songs, about 130 of which are worth revisiting[/b]. The rest are forgettable, but I can't name a bad song. Each song comes with at least 6 charts (8 being common) spread over 4 distinct input modes, with varying difficulty. This sheer volume of content makes the game [b]easy to pick up, but insanely hard to master[/b] - it takes maybe 2 years of daily practice to clear all charts out there. Also, each song features its own unique music video, some of which are hands-down exquisite.
Some early reviews point out that the game's audio isn't in sync with the visuals, but [b]the audio sync has since been reprogrammed; now it works fine[/b]. I play many respectable rhythm games and have no timing problem with this game.

For the other packs, it REALLY depends. DJMAX is known for having groovy music and polished visuals, but to be fair, many songs in the ""retro"" DLCs are kind of forgettable.

DJMAX is filled with personality and style. The colours and interface pop out at you in a way that’s not entirely jarring, but not subdued enough that you can’t appreciate the art and aesthetic it’s going for. The game also has quite a few unlockables, from profile cards to different skins you can use to freely customize your approach notes and the bar thingy I can’t quite currently name.  

While I personally don’t find a good chunk of the maps to be anything too difficult than what a lot of avid rhythm game players are already familiar with (this is honestly probably due to the songs used), the ones that do hit— hit pretty good. I’d say this game has a lot to offer in regards to content from all the maps being charted in 4-8B, the challenges, to online play (and tbh there’s no use playing multiplayer unless you’ve unlocked at least all the base game songs— which takes quite a while to do), that it might be a little daunting for someone looking for a casual experience. 

Similarly to a lot of people, I have a hard time fully recommending this due to its online-only experience. For someone looking to get the steam deck and be able to play this game on the go, this is a huge disadvantage. Pricing-wise, this game is also extremely expensive. Getting the base game with all its DLC would cost you a pretty penny, so I’d wholeheartedly recommend just getting this game and its DLC when it goes on sale. 

Overall I’d say this was a good experience regardless, albeit much of its shortcomings can possibly be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.",1635146619,1635146619,True,2,1,0.53407055139541626,0,True,False,False

My review is more to address other problems I see mentioned in the other posts. There are absolutely cons to this game, and I would say they're as follows:
-Price dissuades anyone but diehards from buying it.
-Always online can make a bad experience for those with a shoddy connection
-I don't have an issue with 4B but you absolutely may have trouble finding MP matches with other button settings.
Outside of those, I really wanted to address the complaints regarding Xingcode and the such. Yes, it is included in the game, yes it's probably just as ineffective at stopping cheaters as battleye and yes it is kernel level.

What you really have to let sink in though is absolutely every single current game with multiplayer has anti-cheat, and it's all kernel level whether they advertise it or not. Your alternative is folks like myself will write a kernel level hack that will be undetectable, or worse, you end up with GTA's online mode that's so lax it allows your IP to be exposed to other players.

While this does mean that there are exploits to Xigncode to control someone's computer, that person has to install a virus that directly targets that game onto your machine.

Song selection: So, you know when you're watching an anime, and a big ol hip hop dude walks in the room, and they REALLY want to show you this guy IS hip hop, so a composer that's never written hip hop in his life now has to make a backing track for this character, and it is so painfully generic, and not memorable at all....Someone made an entire game with that, but with the occasional K-pop track sprinkled in. They showed me some mercy, and put in three guilty gear songs. Two of which are good. 

difficulty/note patterns: Weird how there's alot of songs that have one star difficulty ratings, and then jump straight to seven stars or eight star. Smallest jump i've seen is a one star to a six. Weird how these are the only two options, yet some songs get four. Some songs on their normal difficulty feel like hard songs. There's an issue with some note patterns. Patterns i'd deem absurd. There's alot of really jumpy patterns that don't feel like they follow the rhythm of the song, rather, they're doing their own thing. Some songs in this game, once they start have zero breaks to help you breathe or get your bearings. Just a non stop assault of notes. Not even a hold note to show you a little mercy. These feel the sloppiest because I got no sense of what they wanted me to do at all. Typically, good note patterns feel like im either playing AN instrument, or just following the general melody of the song, and some songs do this, but i find a little around maybe 1/4 songs DON'T.

-Ranking system means nothing. 
There's only two grades. A and B. It's really satisfying to be told you got an S or a SS or even just an A+ or something, you won't find that here. When I fail I kinda want to be told how badly. There are songs I barely made it out alive, and some where I felt ""I did okay"" only to be met with the same B rank. Why even have it at that point?

-Notes make noise: Not a fan of rhythm games where when you hit a note, your note makes a UNIQUE sound. Typically in other rhythm games its a simple drum beat or tambourine, or missing a note just results in muted note. In this game, it's sometimes a unique instrument but its sort of playing alongside the original. The end result is, even if im scoring 100%'s MY note still plays out of sync with the music and it just sounds horribly awkward. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn this off.

plus sides:
The menu is stylish.

[b]DJMAX RESPECT V[/b] is the latest rhythm game from the DJ Max series that has been releasing games since 2004. This title has a lot of content to get through in the base game alone and goes above and beyond what you expect to find in a standard rhythm game. Despite so many things going right for this title, the one red flag is a constant need for internet connection which raises some issues for the future of this game...

[h1]✔️Pros[/h1]
• Loads of skins to unlock for the notes and charts
• Focuses on the precision of hitting notes
• Loads of songs from multiple genres that all include music videos
• A lot of content and things to unlock
• Different modes including mission, Online, and freestyle modes
• Varies difficulties along with 4, 5, 6 & 8 button charts

[h1]❌Cons[/h1]
• Requires constant internet connection (even in solo modes)
• No practice mode to nail tricky charts
• High difficulty curve as you start improving and moving onto harder songs

[h1]🕹Gameplay[/h1]
[h3][b]DJ Max? Never heard of it[/b][/h3]
Admittedly, this is my first experience with a DJ Max game so if you're a veteran of the series then I doubt you'll need much of an explanation of what this game is. However, if you're new to this game like I was, let me explain how this title differs from other rhythm games.

[b]DJ MAX RV[/b] is unlike other traditional rhythm games I've played in the past (I admit I've only played Guitar Hero), it focuses heavily on hitting notes with precision. Every note you can hit gives you a different amount of points based on how precisely you hit it, from 1% (wasn't even close to hitting the note on time) to 100% (hitting the note perfectly in time with the beat), this instantly gives the game a bigger skill gap between experienced players. To strive for completing a song without missing a note is one thing, but hitting every note perfectly is insane for some songs.

Another small aspect that you might notice about this title is the game doesn't punish you for hitting buttons where there isn't a note, so technically you can just spam buttons mindlessly to pass a song. However, as previously mentioned, you'll probably get a worse score if you don't at least try to hit the notes in time, so for competitive matches, spamming isn't an option at all. Now, why don't we talk about difficulty.

[h3][b]How to give yourself Carpal Tunnel[/b][/h3]
[b]DJ MAX RV[/b] isn't shy to put you through your paces and destroy you with ridiculous charts that will probably kill your wrist. To say that this game has a high difficulty curve is an understatement but that doesn't mean that the game only caters to players who are willing to put in the time to learn this game. The game rates difficulty on a star scale, 1 being the easiest and 15 being the hardest for those who want to experience carpal tunnel. Getting better at this game is difficult and the game doesn't really help you with it either.

One major gripe I have with this game is there isn't any sort of practice mode where you can replay a section of a song to nail a set of difficult notes, which was a surprise considering how difficult some of the songs can be. The only way of 'practicing' is to play it over and over again and brute force yourself through a song till it finally 'clicks'. This is only really applicable to higher-difficulty songs, but it's still a problem I face when trying higher difficulties outside my comfort zone.

Another great aspect of this game is the multiple different button modes that you can play, 4, 5, 6 or 8. The best part about it is there's nothing pushing you to aim for 8 buttons, if you have the most fun playing 4 buttons then you can just use the 4 button mode only, you'll have a more compact board than the other buttons, but still get high difficulty songs to play on.

[h3][b]So... Much... Content..![/b][/h3]
If you were expecting a simple rhythm game with just a tracklist of songs to play through trying to get the new high score then you'd be dead wrong. There's freestyle mode that is your standard, choose a song to play on whatever difficulty, online which offers open lobbies and a competitive mode, countless things to unlock (music videos, artwork,  etc.), challenges to complete, mission mode, and an air mode.

[h3][b]TURN THE MUSIC UP[/b][/h3]
It seems like the DJ Max series in general does a lot more than your average rhythm game, with an extensive tracklist of [i]""...over 150 unique songs...""[/i] in the base game alone, which offers a wide variety of genres along with each of these songs having a music video in the background, that range from a live concert of that song to people creating music videos for these songs specifically. It really does feel like this game goes above and beyond what a rhythm game should strive for.

[h3][b]Error: You aren't connected to the internet[/b][/h3]
One aspect that worries me above everything else about this title however, is the fact that the game [b]requires you to have constant internet access[/b], this raises multiple red flags. At some point this game could just be shut down and no longer playable at the flick of a switch, the base game is expensive enough as it is let alone if you dive into DLC territory. I'm unsure why I need constant internet connection even when playing songs solo, but the fact that it's there should be something you think about before even thinking about purchasing this title.

[h1]🖥️Graphics[/h1]
Not exactly an area that you tend to look for in rhythm games, if anything you're only expecting a clean chart that's easy to read notes off. However,[b]DJ MAX RV[/b] offers a lot of flexibility and customization with your chart allowing you to mix and match different chart skins and different styled notes. Although this isn't necessary by any means or gives you an advantage, it's nice to have a unique style that makes everyone's chart look different.

[h1]💭Closing Thoughts[/h1]
[b]DJ MAX RV[/b] is something special, it's clear that the developers put in a lot to make this game good and it clearly shows. Even if you just get the base game there's still a lot of stuff to do before you even consider getting the DLC (which there is a lot). If you're new to the game there is quite a difficulty curve to get through, but once it eventually clicks you'll love the game even more. Even for the veterans who have played the countless releases before this game, I think they'll love it as well. The only downside is the constant requirement to be connected to the internet which I can see being the breaking point for some people since the game could be switched off at any point. Overall though, a fantastic rhythm-based game that I almost feel ashamed of for not knowing this series existed for years. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some tendons in my wrist to start snapping...

I'd say this figuratively, but with the context clues I've picked up from the long-running music artists and the ""Lore"" in certain videos, this might literally be a huge and constant passion project and bless them for it.

This is as much an art project as it is a game. Some of the videos, some of the interface options, a few of the menus even, are absolutely beautiful, which makes it strange when placed next to doodles of PS1 or DS styled graphics. There's entire anime intros for background videos, then there's some doofus farting in his laboratory in the next. There's high profile artists like Marshmello and licensed League songs right next to a Fruity Loops Studio experiment made for the PS Vita 10 years ago made with their favorite midi instruments.

I've just never seen such contrast in quality and consistency. It's charming in a way but it kind of leaves half the game kind of undesirable to the casual player. It's true many of the songs are not originally catered to the western audience but also many of the songs are just not fit for a rhythm game, personally speaking. A large amount of them are very short and filled with strange jazz or dubstep fills, switching practically randomly between instruments. I'm playing more improv than I am rhythm half the time and as a consequence it doesn't feel good trying to learn those songs.

I do really enjoy the variety of difficulties however. The variable number of buttons and the extreme range of difficulty from simple to impossible is really nice. Online works pretty spotless too from all the time I've spent with a few friends.

Might be rambling a little but there's quite the rabbit hole to this game. Also the price point is a bit steep, this is a sale-only game for me for both the game and especially the dlc.",1634403860,1634403860,True,6,0,0.597619473934173584,0,True,False,False

Otherwise, an extremely polished game with a massive amount of songs all charted for 4 - 8 key. There are some audio latency issues that were fixed for me by running the game in windowed mode and making sure vsync is disabled; once that's sorted it plays perfectly.

If you're only interested in 4 key, I'd wait until this game is on sale as you won't find anything more challenging than Stepmania and its various offspring can offer - though there's some quality charts here to play for sure, it's not quite worth paying full price (at the time of writing) in my opinion.",1633742772,1633742772,True,6,0,0.607530772686004639,0,True,False,False

DJ Max is all about precision, and it won't fail you for randomly flailing on the keys like most other rhythm games. You'll only fail if you miss the notes entirely (don't get me wrong, on harder songs you *will* fail). However, hitting the notes as precisely as possible is how you'll net the highest score possible and getting a true 100% is very difficult even on easier songs until you get a ton of practice.

There are few songs I've played, mostly through the campaign, that I've actually liked. Most feel sorta disjointed, like the notes you play are weird sound effects added on top of the song, rather than being part of it. There are definitely songs where this isn't a problem, but it's distracting on the ones where it is.

Then there's the kicker! My couple of complaints wouldn't bother me as much if I could actually play the game. With levels that the screen swings from side to side, parts of others going missing, and general layout, I unfortunately get motion sick. Of course it seems I can't turn those effects off, so I just have to power through it. It was a mistake to try though! I've basically given up on being able to play, but I can no longer get a refund because of my hours.

Really simple things such as giving each note a different color, having lines to separate the notes in the chart horizontally, and having timing marks on the chart, are absent. Learning a new rhythm game is like learning to read a new language. Playing one well relies upon being able to read that language fluently. This game's language is harder to learn than others with zero benefit. There is no style or hook for this learning curve. I'm no stranger to using nothing but spacing for timing. But this one is just a plain vertical chart. It's just bad design. Sure, after 2 days of playing an hour each I've started to be able play 6 and 8 note charts more fluently, but I've still got a ways to go when I'd probably be able to play 5 and 6 star songs full combo by now if it just differentiated everything better.

Most of the music is butchered and just not fun to listen to while playing. This is one of those games where you are actually playing the music. Before the song starts or even during the song, you can freestyle and hit keys to play your own music of sorts. Play out of time and you'll hear the part you're playing sound at the wrong time. Press the wrong key and you'll hear a totally different instrument or note play. Now that's not awful on its own. It's actually pretty neat. What's awful is that your key presses play sampled notes of whatever instrument is playing in the song. But they aren't the sample of the music at that particular time. It's the same sample over and over and over again. So if you have a piano part for instance that's the same note 3 times in a row, you can pick out immediately that it's just a sampled piano playing repetitively and sounds nothing like the original mix of the song. I don't know about anybody else but I like to actually listen to the music that I'm playing in a rhythm game. Also, not all of the songs are this way, but from the dozen or so I tried most of them were that way. And the ones that weren't were way more enjoyable to actually play. It'd be extremely easy to allow you to just turn this feature off and listen to the original mix of the song.

The best part is that when looking up stuff about this game to try and remedy these issues, I find forum/reddit/comment posts from other people bringing up these same issues. And almost always they're just met with elitest pricks replying ""that's how it is and how it should be"". ""Get good"". The usual fare. Not understanding in the slightest that lowering the skill floor does nothing to the skill ceiling and that they've been acutely stockholm syndromed.

And all this gatekeeping for $50?! Not worth it by a long shot. No practice mode? Not even just a no fail mode? Steam DB has this down to $18 on sale in the past, which is a price that might be worth it for this. But even if it was free there's still much more fun rhythm games out there, as the issues with its music are built in and un-fixable. And isn't that the whole point of a rhythm game? 

E: 10/4/21 and this is on sale for $18 again. Most of its DLC as well. Definitely wait for a sale.",1632207756,1633419379,False,92,43,0.656220614910125732,16,True,False,False

Sure, the graphics of the game itself is pretty darn nice and every song is well made with their own background videos and hit sounds to go along with it which makes it feel more like you're actually playing the game, but it all goes crumbling down when you want to maybe customize things or check some of the song packages only to realize ITS LIKE 80 EURO PER GOD DAMN PACK. If you haven't realized it already so are ALL the DLC's currently for 164 euro's, which IS ON SALE MIND YOU. I thought Muse Dash was charging a lot for their DLC songs but this makes Muse Dash look like a charity compared to this. Oh, and as I said about customization.. yes, there is a lot of things you unlock by just playing the game and leveling up I get that, you even get a few songs as you level up, but it feels like 80% of the game is locked behind DLC at first glance. They even have a damn ""battle pass"" which costs an additional 13~ euro to get access too, just to be able to get some skins to customize your notes. What a joke. I wouldn't be this harsh on a game if it wasn't THIS expensive to just be allowed to play it.

I will most likely keep playing this game every now and then even if the timings are really weird and I don't think my usual arrow skin playstyle exists in this game, as well as songs being super easy for me because I play too many rhythm games on my spare time, but hey, I spent way too much money on this so I might as well make use of it.",1633355221,1633355221,False,0,0,0.444449573755264282,6,True,False,False

So I learned the basics there and wanted to switch over to a normal 4 button rythm game.
And so one of the pc-based games I found was this. DJMAX RESPECT V.
I already heard a lot of mixed reviews about this game but with it being over a year (nearly two if you count in the EA) since it released, I thought many of the problem have been fixed... Well... no...

First of all: For rythm games I have a janky setup where I have to get the offset to about 310ms... Yeah I know... Yup...
Put me on trial and burn me like the ""witches"" centuries ago...
The problem: The game only goes up to 300ms. ""Boo-ho. 10ms. Just get used to that"". 
Well... I tried. But the game was still way too offset. It kinda felt like I had to have around 400-500ms...
By no means is that (the additional 100-200ms) a problem with my PC or setup but of this game.

Anyway, next problem: The sound. The audio sliders only go from 50% to 100%...
I really hate the hit sounds (especially because they are so offset) but I can't turn them off/ even further down.

Next problem: Keybindings. I think it's stupid that we can't set multiple keys for one action.
My left pinky finger hovers between control and shift and its akward to hit the correct button sometimes...
(Not the biggest problem but still...)

Next problem: The songs. I went through them and didn't find anything interesting (neither in the easy difficulties, nor in the higher ones).

I'd normally wait a bit longer, but for anyone who's on the fence while the sale is ongoing, I figured I'd give my thoughts:

DJMAX Respect V has been a lot of fun in the short time I've played it. The presentation is very good, and it just feels and looks premium. The keysounds when you press a key and the background videos playing make playing it a lot more fun, and a cooler experience. Music selection is pretty solid and plentiful.

One important aspect is the charts. While you can find quality charts in osu, no doubt, a lot are not that great. Here things are charted excellently.

There's plenty of different options for different skill levels, you can play with 4 keys to 8 keys, across a few difficulty options. The good thing with paid games like this is each mode and difficulty gets a quality chart, so you can play your favorite songs no matter your skill, whereas with community made charts, you may sometimes find yourself unable to play a song because its only been charted at a very high difficulty level. While it doesn't necessarily affect the difficulty, you have a ton of options in terms of note speed.

As far as modes, there is a live mode where you just play through songs and can comment and view other people's comments. Pretty relaxing. Free play to do whatever, a mission mode, multiplayer: both casual and competitive options. 

There are two big downers IMO:
- Always online is super lame. Not a huge problem for me, but just on principle it's pretty wack for a mostly single player experience
- No practice mode, which is kind of baffling.

Otherwise, game is good. Definitely recommend checking it out while it is on sale, probably would give it a solid nod even out of sale.",1633282028,1633282028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game menus are very clean looking, really great and unique visuals for each track as well with the ability to adjust brightness or turn the BG video completely off.

DJMax also gives the player the freedom to choose control settings between 4-keys to 8-keys and adjust song speed within each track as you're playing. 

It is hard to think of a con yet for this game, although I've only had around 14 hours. If there was one thing that would be nice, it would be the option to use Mouse to select things on the screen, it is entirely keyboard controlled but this is probably to accommodate players that use DJMax controllers. A practice mode so I could practice the trickier charts would also be really nice to have.

I would like to also address some things regarding negative reviews that I saw to help anyone who's on the fence about the game. The game does not play notes ""out of sync"", the beat or notes out of sync with the music happens because the player's timing is off.

Since there is no way to disable hit sounds, and the developers confirmed this will never be added, the community answer to this issue is to play on 0ms and learn to hit everything early.

I have decided to give this game another shot after over a year of reviewing it and then no longer having played it afterwards. While most of my review is still valid (some parts even more so than before - especially with all the new song packs packed into DLCs), one thing I can for sure say has been improved is latency. The game received some additional settings you can tweak to compensate for your audio latency and I have to say, it's very effective in practice - about a year ago, in many 8-10 star songs I've averaged something about 97% accuracy, which was brought down mostly by me getting out of sync with audio in certain more complex sections of songs, causing me to miss horribly. Now I'm getting over 99,5% accuracy in many of these songs, and I can clearly tell latency has been improved all around.
So, one of the biggest issues about this game has been improved, but outside of that there's not much else. I still can't recommend the game for the price, but if you're considering getting it on sale, it may be worth a consideration. Just be ready to splurge more bucks on DLCs with extra songs, if you want the full experience.

[b]Review[/b]
An excellent and fun rhythm game, which I can't say it's worth the asking price of $50 (or $75 if you want all songs), hence why I can't entirely recommend it. If you asked me, I'd say ""$30 for a full package and this review would be positive"". $75 is more than even some AAA games, which is why I'll try to judge this game like an AAA game.

Why is it excellent?
- 150 songs (170 with DLC) is nothing to scoff at, that's quite a lot. With a very wide range of genres, I think everyone should be able to find songs they truly like. I especially like the addition of Marshmello's ""Alone"", I wish there were more songs of this kind from labels like Monstercat, Disciple, Proximity etc. Seems like a somewhat easy way to increase the song library while bringing in more players!
- There's a lot of songs from previous DJMAX games too, a neat nostalgia element for those who haven't played a DJMAX game for years, like me. [strike]Even though there aren't any songs from PORTABLE 3, which is the game that introduced me to rhythm games...[/strike]
- The new AIR gamemode, even though it's basically ""random songs with ability to chat"", is a simple yet great way to listen to DJMAX's library trying to find songs you like.
- Each songs has 2 or 3 difficulty settings available, which is great for newer players in particular, that can start learning slow songs and then gradually increase the difficulty over time to improve.
- I'm digging the art style a lot. I'm bad at describing such things, if you want to see it in action, just search for some gameplay videos.
- Online multiplayer is, I believe, [strike]a new deal in DJMAX and a very welcome addition in this day and age[/strike] (I was wrong, thank you Kakurady for correcting me). My experience in multiplayer has been flawless so far. There's ranked mode, in which you play against different levels of AI before getting a rank, after which you get to play against real players. Queues might take a minute or two, probably depending on the time of day you're playing rn.
- Can be played with a keyboard or a controller. I personally prefer the keyboard, but the side note mechanic makes me think giving controller gameplay a shot might not be such a bad idea.
- Supports Family Sharing. Given this publisher's ferocious copy protection measures, this is something worth mentioning I guess... [b]EDIT 12.04: Within 2 days, there will be an update that will no longer allow you to share DLCs via Family Sharing. Excellent job, publisher, you're actually making it even worse![/b]

Why is it bad? In no particular order:
- When playing multiplayer, if you're playing a song that you do not own via DLC, you will be forced to sit through and just listen to it instead of playing it. At least right now, DLCs make up under 15% of all available songs so it's not such a huge deal right now, but if more DLCs come, it might become one.
- The game requires you to be online to play, which I believe the only reason for that is being a part of game's copy protection. Cmon guys, even the universally hated Denuvo DRM allows you to play offline!
- The game comes with an anti-cheat. Which usually isn't a bad thing, but this game uses XIGNCODE3, which has been proven to dig extremely deep into your system and basically spy on it by gathering extensive logs, compromising its security. You have been informed (of course by me or by yourself, because the game doesn't care enough to tell you), do as you wish with this. 
- While the game allows you to adjust note speed and background dim/brightness in each song, it doesn't allow you to force these settings upon all songs.
- The volume of certain songs is different compared to other songs. There's also no way to quickly adjust volume without going into settings or dropping the system/output volume entirely.
- There's no option to change the position of the ""playfield"" on the screen in AIR mode (which I don't see why it would be a problem when chat is disabled) and in multiplayer (I'd rather have my playfield on the right rather than on the left)
- No option to completely disable SFX sounds, which will throw off everyone who has to use negative offset to compensate for their audio's latency.
- Numpad Enter cannot be bound to anything. If you manage to play 4K/5K/6K like me, which is by using 1/2/3 numpad keys, you might find this problematic.
- Doesn't support 16:10 displays - if you're still using such a display, you'll be forced to a lower resolution (my brother's example: he's using a 1680x1050 display and he's forced to play in 1280x720). I know DSR/VSR exists, but these features tend to add extra input lag, which is the last thing you want in a rhythm game.
- As I was informed on the official Discord server, there are some other issues, like unconsistenly long loading times (the game takes its sweet time to launch too). Apparently, this has been reported and acknowledged by developers, but months later hasn't been fixed.
- VSync enabled by default for some cursed reason. Yes, it fixes tearing that's visible in a lot of dynamic BGMs but at the tradeoff of input lag. Some players might not even be aware they're hindering themselves!

There's probably more which I might have forgotten about, but I'll edit the review once I do.
Most of these ""bad"" things I have mentioned are minor and will not affect everyone, but amongst these issues there are some that even free games like osu! don't have, let alone this game with an asking price of $50.

Post Release Update:
After playing countless hours, I can still say, without a doubt, that this game rules even harder then it did in EA. Since then, the devs have added a ""battle-pass"" equivalent to the game which lets you unlock additional rewards such as player icons, emotes, themes, and more. All progress made in the battle-pass can be obtained by either playing in online mode, free play, or by playing missions. This is deffinetly refreshing as you are not gated to doing only online portions of the game and are awarded for just playing how you want.

My only gripe would be DLC cost. While the content may be good,  DLC will net you between 7-20+ songs and can be very pricey if you want to jump all in. I suggest waiting for a sale if you would like to get the DLC and to only obtain the song packs. Do not get the gear packs confused as they just give you an additional skin and nothing more. 



Early Access Review:

This review only reflects what I've currently played in the Early Access and includes:
-Air Mode
-Freeplay
-4 Button, 5 Button Modes with difficulties up to SC
-Playing with a PS4 Controller
-Playing with Keyboard Controls (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SWITCHING TO THIS AS IT IS HELPED ME GREATLY IMPROVE MY SKILL VERSES BEING USED TO THE PS4 CONTROLLER LAYOUT)

If you are familiar with Beatmania, Guitar Hero, or pretty much any rhythm game, you will understand the basic mechanics: Press a button to the note/beat in the song and get a high score. While I have been a fan of DJ Max ever since the PSP releases, I can say that the early access version only shows a PERCENTAGE of content that the rest of what the franchise as a whole offers. Despite a few of these shortcomings, DJ MAX RESPECT V promises a great experience for both old and new players with weekly updates and a responsive development team to criticism and recommendations via their official discord.

First, what does this game offer you in EA? Well, you have access to Air Mode: a Nico Nico Douga-esque experience where you can play a variety of songs based on their BPM (Beats Per Minute) with a (limited) chat box for those in the same lobby as you, and Freestyle mode: pick any of your unlocked songs and play them in various button and difficulty modes.

Songs are unlocked via leveling up and completing some challenges in your collection menu. To level up, you gain experience from playing any of the aforementioned modes, while some of these challenges range from 'Do X Amount of 4B Songs' to 'Get 50,000 Combo in Freestyle' which aren't incredibly hard but can seem intimidating for new players. Because of this, I DO NOT recommend the Unlock Song Pack DLC as it dampens the experience of honing your abilities and retaining what little sense of progression there is in the EA.

Whether you have previously played DJ MAX RESPECT on the PS4 or are a newcomer, there has been several content updates every Thursday as of this review. These updates usually consist of hot fixes and 2-3 new songs added per week. I don't expect this to be a normal thing, but the new music seems very EDM-focused and is very much in line with the style of DJ MAX which is loud sounds, bass drops, and synths galore. So, this is very much so an UPDATED version of DJ MAX RESPECT. 

I recommend this game mostly as a fan of the series and for what the future content alone promises. I will update my review once the game is out of EA, but if you like good music ranging from classical, rap, rock, and EDM in a game with TIGHT and RESPONSIVE controls, then I HIGHLY suggest giving this game a go or at least looking up some of the OST/Gameplay on Youtube as it truly is a banger.",1578541626,1633185642,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you liked any of the DJ Max Portable games, or Trilogy this will feel like the definitive version, I personally didn't play any DJ Max games other than Portable 3 and Trilogy and I can say with ease that I will never touch either of those when songs from them are added!

Edit; On the official discord, there is an answer about Portable 3 being added:
"" It's probably gonna be the last one.. but.. I mean it needs a lot of work and really needs some time to take care for, such as remixes and stuff.
 We are going to make it, and we know all of you want it, so we will do it.""

+ Good song selections with variety in genres
+ challenging
+ DLCs with more songs to choose from if you get bored from playing the same songs over and over

Negative:
- No practice sessions or any type of practice mode
            -Not really noob-friendly
- requires internet connection (Major yikes)
- DLC is good but they sometimes come with hefty price tag
- current anti-cheat program likes to crash your game every now and then (not very often but it happens)
- Season Pass, but this is something you can avoid as it won't severely impact your experience

Comment:
Despite the lack of noob-friendly content, if you put the time to learn the game, you'll eventually get better just like any other games.  Unlike many reviewers I'm not a hardcore rhythm gamer.  The last time I played a rhythm game before this was Guitar Hero during PS3 days.  This is my first DJMAX game as I've never played or owned any of the console version of this game.  My first experience of DJMAX was from Technika 2 that I managed to try at a local arcade before they took it away years ago.

With SC mode coming back, an extremely difficult mode, which is pretty much ""Master"" mode, it will need a keyboard to clear, as it uses all buttons on the keyboard in ways that you could never do on a Dualshock. 

Base game has over 100+ free songs and hundreds more in DLC (can get pretty pricey but definitely worth the cost.) Online is very simple, and its easy to hop into rooms and play with people from all over the world. There is also a ranked mode which pits you against the best of the best to see how high you can climb for banner rewards to flex every season. (I wouldn't try this mode unless you can consistently hit 99%+ on most charts and Button modes, you can pick what mode you wanna pick at lower ranks, but when you get higher, you'll have to pick more than one, and at the highest rank you are forced to play all button modes)

Speaking of seasons, each season has its own Battlepass (I know, I know stick with me for a bit) which lets you grind for banners, icons, and occasionally Combo skins, judgement skins, and UI skins. Its extremely grindy, but the last week of the season gives everyone x4 exp, so its very easy to finish even if you don't play everyday.

I was wondering what they would do after they gave out all the PS4 DLC, but they are still giving us new songs and charts to play with. If you are looking for a new PC rhythm game to get into, or are wondering if its worth getting even if you already own the PS4 version, I highly recommend DJMAX Respect V!",1576737969,1629719721,True,52,1,0.763839364051818848,0,True,False,True

- Almost everything from the DJMAX Online era to now is here (but most of it is DLC)
- Gameplay is familiar
- The DLC and the missions they provide
- SC difficulty.

Cons:
- YOU. ALWAYS. NEED. TO. BE. ONLINE. Thank the anti-cheat they use in this one.
- The price tag on normal occasions, both on the base game and the DLC.
- AIR Mode; specifically, the game doesn't tell you when you've had one playthrough of a song in AIR Mode (relevant for some unlocks), so you'll have to guess when the game actually ""awards"" you one playthrough.
- DLC releases between this and the PS4 version aren't usually aligned, so if you own both, this one gets priority. Sucks if you own both versions, ngl.

Generally, if you like the DJMAX series, I do think that RESPECT is a must get, although I will say that it isn't worth its normal price tag, so wait for the base game and the DLC to go on sale first. For the songs under the COLLABORATION tab, some of them aren't keysounded, and while that personally does not bother me, I have a feeling it's a problem for other people. It is a big plus that the Guilty Gear, GROOVE COASTER, and Girls' Frontline songs are keysounded, though, but if it helps, just remember that CYTUS, Deemo (to some extent), and CHUNITHM don't actually keysound the songs in their respective games. Lastly, I wouldn't recommend buying gear and note skins; it's not like they add much to the gameplay anyway other than a new look.

EDIT (8/21/21): I don't know if anybody's pointed this out before, but there's two things about this game that I absolutely despise: 
1) There is no option for you to practice HARD JUDGEMENT in any way. It appears in Online Mode if you hit tiebreakers, and on some missions (particularly in the DLC missions), so it's dumb that this game doesn't let you practice it (save for the songs in Mission Mode that actually use it).
2) Speaking of Mission Mode, especially on DLC missions, the game NEVER tells you if HARD JUDGEMENT and/or RANDOM (sometimes both) are active for some songs. You'd think that the game would tell you since it mentions it on most of the missions in the base game missions, so why on earth are they not mentioned???

This doesn't change the fact that I love this game, but if you're going to put a LOT of time into this, these are just some warnings you have to be aware of.

amazing game for people who like music/rhythm games with precision grades. the hit window/precision is much generous than the previous games (Portable series on the PSP, Online or Trilogy on PC).

pretty much the ultimate version if you loved the series since 2004, has songs from almost every DJMAX (base game has 150+ songs if I'm not mistaken + 150 more on DLCs). replayability is off the charts. 

the songs range from pop to EDM to classic to rock/metal, insane variety here. gameplay is smooth, interface is super clean, can be played with a controller (NM, HD and MX) but harder songs only on keyboard (SC). the difficulty curve is quite easy at first but gets steeper with higher level songs/charts. 

also has online mode, with open lobbies (7 people playing the same song on any mode/level) + ranked (1v1 competitive with a bo3).

recommendation: if you enjoy this type of game, buy the base game and play it until you unlock most stuff, if you enjoy the gameplay, buy the collab songs for harder songs (groove coaster, cytus), easier stuff is on (clazziquai dlc), feeling nostalgic = emotional sense dlc... I mean, all DLC are good content wise, I suggest you watch some youtube videos to see if the songs/charts contained in them match your taste.",1621405521,1629518607,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

First off, the pros. The base game here has soooo much content if you like rhythm games. There's like, almost 200 songs to get through leveling, up until level 99 or something. And every song has a huge number of beatmaps- 4 button, 5 button, 6 button, 8 button, and usually 2-4 difficulty levels per song. There's so much to do! Not to mention the Air feature, which while I think is kind of stupid, it gives you another place to practice as well as see random gibberish typed out by people mistakenly hitting the enter key while playing a song. I haven't touched the Rankings or Multiplayer stuff and I still have 25 satisfied hours, with plenty more to come as I just play these songs over and over again. I'd say this is an excellent tool to get into or practice your rhythm game skills.
My two qualms though: First off, Mission Mode. A neat idea, playing a set of songs with an objective you need to do, like not missing X amount of times or hitting Y amount of score. But in practice, the missions get real awful real bad. Headache inducing movement, insane ""Chaos"" modifiers that send the game into overdrive, and gauntlets of challenges in a button combo (Seriously who plays 5 button, it's so wacky) you're not used to. I guess it's something that you can slowly work at, but I feel like some of the challenges are very unreasonable unless you're absolutely insane at rhythm games.
Other issue, cost. This game is not cheap, and all of the DLC is very expensive despite how long this has been around. On top of that, as of writing this I'm not sure how recent the ""Clear Pass"" is, but that's an extra $20 for a couple of extra emotes and themes- themes being something that doesn't exist in the base game to my knowledge, you need DLC for that. It's almost insulting how much they expect people to pay for that, battle passes in a rhythm game are stupid as is but charging $20 for the privledge of getting a useless banner is just... it's low, man.

All in all, if you're interested in rhythm games and you found this during a nice sale, I totally recommend it! Maybe try it out for two hours and see if it gets with you, it's pretty different from mobile rhythm games but is very rewarding once you get into it.",1628399962,1628399962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DJMax Respect V has that ""premium"" kind of feel I cannot really describe. This is the first installment of the DJMax series released on PC. I would say the game is suitable for all skill levels, whether you are beginner to rhythm games or a veteran, this is a 100% BUY.

[h1] The good [/h1]
- Over hundred songs to play (including unlockable ones), they are fully keysounded, so it feels like you are the one playing the music.
- 4k, 5k, 6k, 8k modes, modifiers to make the gameplay harder. Although I do not recommend sticking to 5k if you are used to 6k, it is confusing.
- MISSION MODE - tons of quests to complete, but it is more challenging.
- AIR MODE - lets you play even the songs you do not own, but you must get very lucky, because it is randomized.
- ONLINE - play with other players in Open Match, or compete and climb the ranks in Competitive Mode.

[h1] The bad [/h1]
- Some songs have a huge difficulty spike, but honestly, aren't we all used to that by now?
- If you really want to play ONLINE Open Match with other players, you most likely will not find many people to play with you, because you probably bought just the game alone without any DLCs. You cannot play DLC songs in Open Match, even if the room master has them. You also must have them in order to be able to play.
- The game only runs online, therefore, if your internet happens to have technical difficulties, you will not be able to play the game at all.
- As I mentioned above, this game has tons of DLCs. If you are trying out the game, do not buy the DLCs yet. Do some research if the songs and the stuff contained in the DLC are really that neccessary to get.

[h1] Final verdict [/h1]
Worth it, including the DLCs (??? if you want more songs in the game I guess). It plays well. There is really not much to dislike about this game, it feels good to play. I don't regret this buy. Plus the 65% OFF the original price during the summer sale is a SMASH!

- $60 for a suped up PC rerelease of a 2017 PS4 game 
- dummy expensive DLC
- terrible battlepass (added last month as of writing. It is the worst battlepass I have ever seen)
- perhaps the worst anticheat I have ever experienced.

- Wifi up? well you can't connect to their servers so you still can't play lol

For reference, I am an active percussionist, and work with music quite often. As such, I have dabbled in other rhythm-based games, like Guitar Hero, Muse Dash, and Groove Coaster.
This is one of the more popular rhythm games in the entirety of Steam, so I decided to give it a shot. This is mainly a review for those who have little to no idea about rhythm games.

PROS: 
-A metric ton of starting music. Seriously this game has a lot of music without DLC, add that in and you got a decent bit to go by.
-Lots of genres. There is most likely one song that will ring with someone, and honestly, trying them all out is a good way to find something you might like. Personally, I love the Guilty Gear collaboration which came in for free.
-Highly Customizable. This is the one that I think DJMax is the best at. There are lots of options to change your controls, and customize where you want your board, what you want your board to look like, what you want your notes to look like, and many other things to make it your perfect style.
-Variable Difficulty. Not everyone is a musician or rhythm gaming genius, so DJMax has a good bit of easier songs, and a difficulty star system to let you know what you are getting yourself into. Besides that, if you ARE looking for difficulty, every song has a 5 button, 6 button, and 8 button layout option, combined with different difficulties for everything. Personally, I hover around the 8 to 10 star range with 4 button or 6 button layouts, but at first I was WAY worse at this game. The missions help to slowly guide you into mastering the game little by little, and even though I was very against 6 or 8 buttons at the beginning, I slowly began to dive deeper in difficulty. It pleases everyone.

NEUTRAL:
One thing to note, since this is a Korean based game, a majority of the community is Korean, so just keep that in mind when you start playing.
Also, there are a few mainstream songs by Porter Robinson, Marshmello, and other big names, but the majority of these songs are either very underground, or made specifically for this game. Also some songs are SUPER weird, and (in my subjective opinion) are not very good. Looking at you Kung Brother. But I suppose that's due to the fact that many of these artists are experimental AKA not mainstream artists, which do bring some really cool and unique ideas to the table, for sure.

CONS: 
-Expensive. Seriously, add all the DLC together in this game, you are looking in the HUNDREDS. Outside of the default songs and the V Expansion bundle, every single expansion costs additional money, and can run you $20 each. Compare this to Muse Dash, which, after one DLC purchase, you never have to worry about buying DLC again. And there's a LOT of these DLCs for DJMax, and are borderline locked away unless you shell out some cash. Buy the DJMax Respect V Complete Edition when it's on sale, and you already have a ton of songs there, but still is important to note, as these DLC rarely go on much of a sale at all, and are locked away for those who don't want to pay.
-No practice mode. You pretty much never get a chance to practice these songs unless you play on AIR mode (which selects songs for you). This is a HUGE killer to me, because maybe there's a specific part of a song I want to practice, but it's just blocked off aside from actual play. I'm seeing people rectify this with the fact that almost all the songs are only 2 minutes, but that's still something I find annoying.
-Little competition for my skill. This is a bit of a me only thing, but a good 30% of these songs are impossible for me to even play, and a high majority of the community when I go into online mode are playing it like a practiced Moonlight Sonata. It's hard for me to find people at my skill level to play with, which kinda sucks, because then it's mostly just solo play, and the competitive mode is too hard for me to even attempt a competition against someone.

SUMMARY: It's one of my favorite rhythm games, but isn't without it's caveats. The price may sway some people, so I would recommend buying it on a sale if you are interested. Has lots of cool and great songs only available through the game, but is very difficult if you want to try to really challenge yourself.

Pros:
-This game and its DLC go on sale often. Definitely pick it up on sale if you like rhythm games. 
-The DLCs add songs from previous DJ max games as well as other rhythm games. They also include their own mission packs and unlockable cosmetics.
-lots of optional collectibles including note shapes, play area designs, profile icons, comments, profile art panels, etc
-most unlockables can be obtained through playing songs in freeplay and season passes but some can come from unlocking achievements, clearing missions in mission mode, online versus mode, etc. So you definitely get rewarded for exploring the options.
-game has a fair amount of songs and if you get DLCs there are SO MANY songs from various genres. A couple DLCs also come in bundles to get them together cheaper, such as the dj max technika 1-3 DLCs.

Cons:
-In order for this game to be playable I had to troubleshoot and find that going to the source files, right clicking the .exe file and finding the run as administrator checkbox and checking it removes an annoying reoccurring random few seconds of lag spikes issue.
-other than achievement hunting air mode seems arbitrary. You just pick from a rotating list of songs and if you want you can throw the game into autoplay and leave comments with other users. It's the mode that pops up first on the menu and is the least relevant.
- most achievments are vague and you wont get most of them without reading the achievement list first and many of them are locked behind DLCs.

This PC version of the original PS4 version of Respect equally expects its players to know what is going on. All of the collective knowledge from previous DJMax games are compiled in this one singular game. Again, this game is MADE FOR FANS. I HIGHLY suggest that you play the tutorial, and start with 4B Easy mode, and work your way up. I also highly suggest you play with a PS4 controller/Keyboard (Whichever you prefer.), as Respect and DJMax, as a whole, was made with the PlayStation button set in mind.

As someone who played the original DJMax from its infancy (Yes, both the first PSP edition and the first PC version, and no, not Trilogy.) I can say that DJMax Respect/V is a warm hug back again to the PC. 

I will be honest, I did not see Respect heading for a PC port, but I was pleasantly surprised when it did. A lot of the PS4 version components and aspects of the game were carried on to this version, and I am very pleased to see it. However, there are things that NEOWIZ added in this version of Respect. Right off the bat, I noticed that Arcade Mode was replaced by Air Mode. Arcade Mode has been, and always been, the staple of DJMax games. Air Mode feels like said mode, but radio style; you don't know what song you're getting next.

And now the tracks themselves. It's very pleasant that they still let you start with some songs from Respect, PC/Portable1 and Portable2. However, its a nice surprise to see NEOWIZ add in new songs from artists such as Marshmello, Porter Robinson (Both Worlds and Virtual Self tracks, but not Nurture :((( ) and K/DA.

DJMax Respect is very lax in terms of timing judgement. In prior DJMax games (namely, the PSP ones) timing judgement is very strict and to the letter. Respect/V, fortunately, is still very lax in terms of timing, but you can always change the timing offset in the settings, should you choose to challenge yourself. 

The new difficulty they added, Difficulty SC, are for those who are proficient with the keyboard (I'm looking at you Trilogy players). Its a very challenging mode in itself, and I'm very glad NEOWIZ added this, as its very much a callback to both DJMax PC and Trilogy.

The DLC as well are present. What struck me however, is that most if not all the PS4 version DLCs are much more cheaper on this port when its on sale. If you have not yet bought any DLC from the PS4 version, and you decide to get this port, I highly suggest you buy those here. You wouldn't want to pay 20 bucks for content that never goes on sale, do you?

Now let's talk about Online Mode. Oh god, YES. This is what they did so right. In the PS4 version, if you don't have PS Plus, you basically get cucked. You don't get to play online matches. Nothing more, nothing less. However, Respect/V allows you to freely play two modes; the classic 1V1 ladder match and Party/Group play. What's very great about Respect/V Online is that it never runs out of online players (Respect Online is a friggin desert my dude, don't even try). Ladder Matches is a very great addition to the Online mode, as it is incentive and motivation for players to keep playing.

All in all, I think that this version of Respect is really well done. Its a shame however that some of the modes from the PS4 version were cut and nowhere to be seen. But we have to do what we are given. Respect/V continues the theme of paying respect to both the players and creators by simply including an entire demographic of players who are and were familiar to one of its past games' mechanics. 

Lastly, DJMax is still very much, a niche title in the west in terms of the rhythm game community, but is very well-known in the Asian demographic of players. If you are reading this, and you live in the west, share this game's existence!

Keep on pressing folks. Press X (or Space!) to pay RESPECT.",1624785032,1625700628,True,48,1,0.779688656330108643,3,True,False,False

There really isn't much to say, it has great songs, well-made charts, a lot of variety in music & unlockables, and a ton of consistency. HOWEVER. You probably already know about this game's TERRIBLE DRM. It's always online, and it scans for modified files while the game is running to make sure you're not tampering with the game. And due to the DRM, if you plan on playing this via Wine on Linux or Macos, it's not gonna happen. This is purely Windows ONLY, no matter how much fiddling around I've done to try to make it work with Wine. However, it does run well under a virtual machine, so long as your computer can handle one.
It really breaks my heart on how locked down this game is, because I love every second of playing this game. It's a real, genuine pleasure. But Neowiz won't be budging any time soon on making the DRM any less extreme, so if you're on Linux or Macos, or if you just don't like companies treating their genuine customers like serial criminals with excessive DRM, maybe skip this game and play DJMAX Trilogy on Wine instead.

[spoiler][strike]我用中文寫是不是還比較多人看= =/Might be missing the main audience by having this written in English, whatever[/strike][/spoiler]
For anyone who doesn't know it's a.... Well, [i]kinda inaccurate[/i] port of the original PS4 game and the main point of this review is comparing the functionality of both.
If you don't even know what DJMAX is go seek some help from Wikipedia and YouTube before reading this.

[h1]PROS[spoiler]?[/spoiler][/h1]
1. Brand new SC (short for SuperCrazy) difficulty exclusive on PC
However not every song comes with it, besides that even songs with it don't have it in every mode, for example if you're not confident with your ring fingers and play on 4B forever, you're only gonna find a quarter of the songlist having their SC chart available.
Also keep in mind that as everything other than SC was initially designed for PS4 controller and remains completely unchanged here, they are sorta.... dull to play with a keyboard, so you might end up having even less ""desirable"" charts here than you do on PS4.
2. Could be much cheaper depending on your region
3. Online mode for up to 7 players together instead of 2 on PS4
Plus being on Steam makes it way easier to socialize with your online friends.
4. A ranked mode for competitive play
Although it gets frustrating real quick unless you're one of those super try-hard players and have no problem getting a 99.80% or something.
5. 5 exclusive songs including 2 League of Legends collab songs.
Something I'd rather not have; All of them are full songs a.k.a. long af, along with terribly made charts.
[spoiler]I for one hate them to the point that every time I see them it feels like they're polluting my songlist[/spoiler]

[h1]CONS[/h1]
1. [b]Bugs, glitches and all kinds of performance issues[/b] inevitable at this point
I'm 100% sure it's not my computer's fault as it runs most major titles smoothly, but when it comes to this game it can even freeze frequently at the song select screen.
Also I don't know if it's a China-only issue but I randomly fail to sync savedata like every 10 minutes.
2. It's gonna take at least several months to get back all the previous DLCs that already exist in the PS4 version, which means there're like 150 additional songs missing currently
3. Local 2-player mode got removed so you can't chill with your roommate/boyfriend/girlfriend
4. 8B mode feels super counter-intuitive and agonizing on keyboard
Still you can plug a controller and use that anyway, but since SC is impossible to do with controller that's literally the same experience as PS4 plus all the bugs.
5. A renovated mission mode where all the 10B charts got yeeted

[h1]TL; DR[/h1]

A) don't own a PS4™
B) value your online friends more than friends irl

There's a LOT of content to this game, and unlike certain community-created rhythm games, (not naming names, but... you know,) all of that content is high-quality and accessible to all levels of skill. While the game is a bit steep in terms of price, especially considering DLC, it's absolutely worth the money considering how well-crafted this game is. I will say, the game's tracklist can be a bit odd; there's a weird abundance of songs that don't really feel like ""rhythm game"" songs. (There's Bossa Nova and Disco in here, for whatever reason. I'm not complaining, it's good for variety, just... I need to push buttons FAST.) That said, the tracklist is also pretty massive, and there are some fantastic songs in there.
It's a little annoying that the online ranked mode doesn't seem to be... populated? The placement matches pair you up with players that are obvious bots, and considering you need to do 5 placement matches to get a rank, it can get a bit annoying. Even after placement, I had trouble actually getting a match. Still, this is a rhythm game, the online modes are a bit secondary, so it's not a huge gripe.
Audio/video lag can be an issue: even with the audio buffer at minimum, the time between a keystroke and the keysound is about 90ms. This isn't too much of an issue, considering that most songs are keysounded; your brain can pretty easily adjust for the delay. However, a good few songs aren't keysounded, including entire DLC packs, which makes the delay a lot more apparent if you're using the sound of your keystrokes as a guide. It's annoying having to remember which songs aren't keysounded, then having to go to the settings and manually adjust offset every time you want to play one without noticeable input lag.

I would really buy this game full price if I can but I'm poor.

On a serious note, while it's a bummer that you will have limited enjoyment if you don't have the song DLCs. But for a casual player, this is a good rhythm game to get started with so you can also practice and play with multiple button modes.

8B mode has the good stuff but I sometimes hate the fact that some songs doesn't have complete difficulties but I kind understand that due to the nature of the song.

BGAs from Deemo and Cytus DLCs surprised me since I don't really expect great ones and I was wondering how they will execute it but even if those are slightly static photos, they made great execution.

Looking forward for more DLCs and will try my best to get all of the song DLCs little by little.

Part I: Addressing the issues

Before I actually review the game, I want to address an issue with the review bombing that this game had to go through. Please, hear me out before forgetting about this game due to these negative reviews. The situation is different from how it might look at first glance. Yes, the price went down after release, but it happened for a reason. There is a difference between Early Access and Released title pricing. When the game got released, the pricing got recalculated for different countries/regions. Moreover, Neowiz has already stated that they will fully compensate everyone who bought the game before the release.

Now, another issue is about XIGNCODE3. It is an anti-cheat that this game is using, and a bunch of paranoid people is hating on it because it scans your system. Please, do your research after which you'll realize that a lot of anti-cheats work in a similar way. The developers of XIGNCODE3 are clear about how their anti-cheat works, and there's nothing spyware-like in it. Now when we got this out of the way, I can finally talk about the game itself, and oh boy it is a good fucking game.

Part II: The positive aspects

The game is really underrated. Maybe it is because of the negative reviews. Maybe because it is expensive. But in my opinion, the game is worth its money as it is one of the best (if not the best) VSRG(s) out there. Here's why.

Let me start with the most important - the music. It is really good. You have a variety of different genres, and all these tracks have their individual feel. There're high chances that a person playing this game will find the music they love there. I actually listen to DJMax OST in Spotify. Most of the songs are made especially for this game, and all the notes are key sounded (meaning each note has its own sound and you actually make the music while you play it). Maps are also really well made and it is a pleasure to play through them. You actually feel the rhythm there (a lot of popular games fail at this like osu! or Beat Saber which lack this feeling).

The design. I am speechless there. Like seriously, big thanks to the design team. This game is visually pleasing, the design is so good. The space theme for the online part of the game. The graveyard for old games. All the different themes for each mode (4B, 5B, 6B, 8B). Everything. And don't say that the design (or graphics) isn't an important part. It fucking is.

The quality. Everything feels premium. It is a pleasure playing the game that is so well-made in terms of quality. Developers actually tried hard making a game good in all aspects. Having different cover for each difficulty of a song and other little aspects like this one really make the game good.

The content. I have never thought that collectibles are something you want in a rhythm game but I actually love how each song has its own plot, characters, and MV. It makes the game alive and enjoyable even when playing solo.

Part III: The negative aspects

Online. As I said, this game is quite underrated and it doesn't have millions of players playing. You will face bots in ladders when there aren't enough players. Though don't get me wrong here. The game is not dead.

Issues. I personally faced an issue where the game is literally unplayable when you first start it. All the animations, videos and the gameplay itself were stuttering. The game is supposed to run in Fast VSync mode but I had to enable it manually in NVIDIA Control Panel to fix that stuttering. This is not normal for a game with such a price tag and is the worst part of the game. Another issue I faced is that the game lacks local multiplayer though the UI literally implies that there should be such an option (and PS4 edition has it).

Song choice. I have played a bit of DJMax Trilogy (the game is really weird btw and lacks lots of things like brightness control, BPM information and so on, but yeah, it is the game from 2008) and realized that a lot of tracks in DJMax Respect V were borrowed from previous games. I will be honest, I don't know how much is actually borrowed and how many songs are new, but this is something I didn't really like and felt like pointing out (though it's not a problem for people who haven't played previous games). You have to pay quite a lot for the DLCs which is a minus on its own and when you pay so much for them you expect to get OG new content~

Part IV: TL;DR

This is the best VSRG game I've ever played (among non-arcade rhythm games!) though it definitely has its problems. I hope this game gets more attention and developers will continue supporting it and listening to the community. In the future I will make an update to this review stating if the game support is decent

Part V: Support of the game
I don't really want to spend time on this part, but I think that enough time has passed to actually make an update. Summarizing:
1. Problems I mentioned were not fixed. Sadly, they all still remain in the game and you are the one who needs to fix them
2. Online is still bad, but did not get worse
3. Game is still getting support which is good and that's why I'm not gonna switch the review to negative. Still, it is sad to acknowledge that this game went the paid DLCs way. I still think the game is one of the best in non-arcade VSRG market, but it is way too pricey. Developers definitely love money and do everything to keep the money flow high.

points deducted for bad sustainability in media practices (including complaints from other reviews regarding privacy issues, and game server access + connectivity). i'm still going to continue to play it and buy packs. djmax respect v is a great game to play with friends who have it already, and a great introduction to actually decent rhythm games available at your home, on demand, but sucks if you suddenly don't have internet connection.",1621588443,1621589353,False,2,0,0.526353299617767334,0,True,False,False

An amazing game to explore the VSRG genre regardless of experience, as well as a must have for any experienced VSRG player. 
It's worth every cent, and so are the DLC's which not only give you songs, but themes, noteskins, and mission sets specific to the DLC. (the DLC's go on sale occasionally as well)

Yes it costs money, and some rhythm games are free, but the people working on the game actually get paid (unlike the free community run alternatives that don't always even get permission from the artists) and the quality of the keysounded songs and well made charts can't really be compared.

The online features are  fantastic. in both multiplayer lobbies with your friends, as well as the ELO based ranked queue, both feel so clean.

Respect V is an expanded yet definitive port of the PS4 game, bringing back the franchise to PC after the shut down of Trilogy and Online. This game is a compilation of tracks, bringing a major library of songs from each part of the franchise but also bringing new and fresh tracks to the table. The game at the moment has songs from Portable 1-3, to trilogy to literally all three Technika games, but along with Respect's own list of songs plus collaboration with other games and certain and labels. As of May 2021, we now have almost the majority of the franchise even though we're missing a few songs from DJMO, and a few event songs from the Technika series. This brings a total of 400+ songs if you have all the DLC.

As mentioned the game is a port, but it brings a lot of new gameplay features sacrificing a few small things from the PS4 version. The game now brings SC patterns, SC patterns are charts that are designed for keyboard, basically movements that can't be done on a controller. Easy to Maximum dificulties remain the same or have changes, but they can be played really well on a controller regardless. Meanwhile, Arcade mode is replaced with AIR. AIR Mode is a game mode designed to be played endlessly yet receiving rewards by playing songs that are in rotation through three different channels. Each channel has songs with different dificulties, and all of the songs are available including DLC tracks through this mode. This game also has Ladder Match which is basically your ordinary ranked mode but other than all of that there's nothing else new other than also getting a battle pass.

In overall gameplay it plays a like a Mania, you have playstyles from 4,5, 6 to 8 buttons having separate and different patterns between eachother. Only downside is that 8 button play doesn't feel like it since you're playing around with a Side Track styled system while having Side Track in 8 button anyways. EZ2ON has real 8 button play, and even though the judgement window on EZ2ON is more strict it feels more rewarding than 8 Button DJMax. 

The game doesn't really feel rewarding, it feels more forgiving and relaxed than other games. The judgement window feels smooth and peaceful, leaving you with better accuracy and scores in comparison to other games. This game can be really easy to get Perfect Plays once you get really good, but in comparison to others, expect your accuracy to be from 99% to just 95% or lower (little joke, but you'll realize it the more you get better in the genre). But overall the game play is solid. I forgot to mention the game has auto fever in comparison to all the other DJMax titles, you don't need to press any other button to fever since it does it on its own for better combo and scores. 

Downsides and personal complaints:
The game has hitsounds to the brim, until you get to see songs like Alone, songs from League of Legends, and even a lot of the collaboration songs excluding Cytus and Deemo don't have any hitsounds. The lack of hitsounds ruin the purpose of the game, where a lot of the instrumentals used to feel natural by hearing the inputted sounds rather than having no noise. Hit sounds in this game feels less natural than EZ2ON's system. While a lot of the songs and missions have hitsounds, one thing I noticed is how long notes don't have sounds, leaving half of the songs not fully coded with those hit sounds. 

The game is online only, and lacks local multiplayer features. The PS4 version is offline and has local multiplayer, but the PC version is completely strict and has an anticheat leading to a straight up Online Only DRM. This DRM is really strong, preventing macros and modifications into the gamefiles and it's really annoying since you're going to need consistent connections to play the game and save your scores. Your account is completely tied to another account leading to save files being server sided and all of your DLC's are also server sided. 

Family Sharing is no longer permitted. The game no longer allows family sharing due to two hackers dealing with Ladder Match and ruining the fun for players who play the game borrowed in the first place. At first it felt okay restricting DLC sharing but then they decided to restrict the game share leaving a lot of players having to buy their own copy anyway. 

Battle pass system is a nightmare. While it sounds ideal to pay for a battle pass to unlock seasonal content into the game, the leveling in between tiers have become worse. It can take you more than 15-17 songs to reach to a certain tier, and the easiest way to level really fast is through Ladder Matches. Now what's so bad about the leveling is that you usually earn 1k per ladder match, now the experience has been drastically reduced and it's now much lower if you don't have the pass. Owning the pass for a small boost is a joke, you barely get an amount for owning it as a bonus and the only good thing about the pass is that if you don't own DLC, and other players do through Open Match, you can play their songs for free. Speaking of that, it's now technically a paywall when the PS4 version had that for free, and the PC port is also restricted from that. You get a lot of fun little cosmetics, but I think the battle pass system is a complete chore due to the fact that its ridiculous on how much you have to grind for it. This whole system is a joke, and even if you love the game a lot you can always blame other companies for going through this route to cash out. 

Other than that, the game is really fun and well done. Sadly, the game is a major investment in which if you're a veteran or a newcomer, you're better off getting it on a sale. This game is stupid expensive, and I personally prefer having to buy all the major songpacks rather than also getting collaboration packs. It's an amazing game for newcomers to the Mania genre, and it's definitely worth picking up despite a lot of its flaws. I personally bought this game without having any knowledge or skill for Mania games, but after a few years even if I'm not that amazing it's good to keep on playing. 

As for the PS4 version, while they're supporting both games all I know is that it's slowly being ruined.

This is an accuracy-focused VSRG (vertical scrolling rhythm game), but a good entry to start with for beginners; the timing windows are somewhat forgiving for this breed of rhythm game. There's four button modes (for most songs), so you can start with whichever mode is most comfortable for you, with the keyboard controls being freely configurable. If you're coming to this from IIDX/SDVX, most of this game should come naturally while going for full combos and perfect plays but there's still plenty of challenging note charts despite the forgiving entry level. Various rhythm game controllers also work with DJMAX.

The music is mostly Korean house, R&B, and light K-pop, but there are also several worthwhile licensed tracks, trance/techno/DnB based songs, and some J-pop. This installment draws it track list from various games across the series and they're still (as of March '21) releasing song packs for the game. If you want all the music DLC, the bundles are a better deal overall.

NEW STUFF BELOW:

At launch, the game had two multiplayer modes: a perfectly adequate lobby mode where the host would pick a song for up to six other players to casually play through and a bare-bones ladder system that almost no one played except the top 10-to-15% of players. The season pass update actually provides REWARDS for playing the game in general, but the revised multiplayer ladder awards the most progress towards unlocking them.

The new ladder rankings are a function of rewarding skill and adaptability. The lower brackets only require you to opt into one button mode; you will run into a lot of 4B and 6B-only players in the beginning. But the higher you go, the more button modes you have to have enabled to advance into higher brackets. Consequently, the best of the best can play all of them. Expect a lot of close matches in the vein of DDR.

The material rewards for simply playing, whether you get thrashed in PVP or not, are more unlockable items such as UI frames, menu themes, players titles/icons, banners, and lobby emotes (a new feature). Overall, the crunch of the game is still the same, but they've added some more flavorful incentives through the season pass (there's a mix of free/paid items) if you wish to complete it.",1606584248,1620931613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm still not ready to give a review and wish that I didn't have to say yea or nae to the game.  I wanted to warn others about the DRM and even suggested that steam add that classification. (I'm marking it not recommend for the DRM and that it may be seen more - wait until it's onsale and beware of what is pointed out)   What I can say about the game so far is that it's nothing like Technika's controls, I knew that coming in having asked the community. Even buying the Technika pack doesn't change that but there is a mission where they emulate it I was told. 

The difficulty seems way high - this might not be a problem. A song older song I knew has a rating that is moderate but I thought I knew it and could do it.  NOPE!  Again, I'm not saying this is bad, just be aware, you, may need to start at the lower difficulties and work your way up as well as if you knew songs with a different control scheme, you probably don't know them as well as you think now that they are redone. 

Also, this game highly more GPU intensive than you'd think.  It's just video (which you can turn off) under a simple interface of a rhythm game right?   Yes, but no.

But I've put in countless hours in this game and have fallen in love with most of its songs, even the crazy weird ones (of which there are many).

For anyone wondering what the difference is between this and the PS4 version, the big change is the inclusion of ""SC"" charts for most songs which are designed for keyboard play. 
 As this was originally a console release, most charts are built for controllers or in other words, using your thumbs; SC changes all that.  Otherwise, arcade mode has been replaced with Air mode, which is basically playing a roulette of tracks while people spam messages all over the screen (but not the chart, so don't worry) and while you can unlock some stuff here, your performance doesn't carry over to freestyle.  Freestyle is pretty much the same as are the missions and unlockables.  Online modes include open match where it's just casual play, and a ladder system which is emphasizes accuracy over combos, but don't come into it with this as your goal - matches are few and far between if you're not on the South Korean clock and you'll be competing on MX tracks faster than you think (still fun, but you really gotta be on top of it).

The huge difference, though, is I find the PC version to be much less forgiving.  My first plays were a bit of a challenge as I was barely scratching A ranks on songs I easily put an S on in the PS4.  However, while I initially struggled, I've now charted S ranks across the board and even managed to max combo songs I never could before.  I've always said the genius of this game's charts is in how well it trains you to just zone out and run on autopilot and my opinion hasn't changed.

That said, for everyone looking to play this game with a controller, do yourself a huge favor and get one with a fantastic d-pad (in other words, NOT an Xbox 360 or One controller... omg it's so bad I had to unplug it and hook up a DS4).  Otherwise, for PS4 vets, you can now play with keyboards and that means, if you care to, you can engineer yourself a custom pad for this if you are so daring.

Overall, you're getting one of the best rhythm games out there and one of the OG pioneers of the genre.  Yeah, it can get quite expensive and you are indeed buying a lot of old content, but if you stick it out and pick up the song packs on sale, you will have one of the largest and most varied archive of songs from DJMAX's entire history.  I mean, I begged for a very long time for them to put Feel in here and I finally got it, so if a favorite of yours is missing, it will probably show up sooner or later.",1615533938,1620244625,True,2,0,0.481181502342224121,0,True,False,False

I read that they were planning on adding calibration, but this game has been on PC for quite some time now. It's really strange how such a key rhythm game feature wasn't included on release and hasn't been patched in yet.

If you have it, I say stick to the not-as-up-to-date PS4 version for the time being as at least it has some form of calibration on there, even if it's bare minimum.

If proper calibration was added, I'd instantly switch to recommended. Especially if they get early/late display added back in again from original PS4 release, but it sounds like there's some weird patent or legal issue going on with that feature.

A great entry point into not only the DJMAX series but also VSRGs in general - this is one of the most beginner-friendly games of its type.

Coming from IIDX which had lots of awesome rave/trance music, I was expecting to be disappointed with DJMAX Respect's soundtrack.

I should also note that I suck at rhythm games - I only ever got to 3rd dan in IIDX and typically peak at medium difficulty - but there's lots of content for beginner-level players that will keep you busy for a long time and help you constantly improve. The achievement, unlock and customisation system is also fantastic and provides lots of targets to shoot for that keep you playing.

The PC version is more up to date than the PS4 in terms of content, mostly the online multiplayer features such as AIR feature, online battle and chat system adding more fun to the game as if playing at the arcade. Using a keyboard was weird for me but it was interesting (still tricky) as the majority the time I've played with PS controller. Though I had to set my keyboard language to Korean since it didn't function properly when it was set to ENG which was weird.

I played this version with the controller and noticed that getting a good grade was a tad easy that I feel this game was made for casuals and the feel of the challenge was lost a bit. Not it's a bad thing but it what made DJ Max is, stupidity brutal to get perfect grades. 

I have not bought any of the DLC for Steam ver since I can't physically own this game and I don't spend that much time playing many games on PC but I have noticed some bits missing from Steam ver. As of today of writing since the recent update, I noticed there were some update songs in the RESPECT line are locked behind Steam logo for some reason where's I got them for free on the PS4. Seeing this I feel that I would get less out of this spending any more money towards this along not properly owning the game where the PS4 ver I can. It's a shame since I can play this on multiple PC's if I'm somewhere else like overseas.


To sum it up, the Steam ver is more active with more multiplayer gaming and can play with keyboard or controller for those who are PC gamers but the PS4 ver is where you actually own the game you can just play your own pace that has a tad high difficulty level and your investment would last in the long run if Steam were to shut down.",1618873961,1618874118,True,1,0,0.520085334777832031,0,True,False,False

Firstly, It's a marvelous game. The best music game on PC. The gameplay is absolutely perfect. Nothing more to add. It's just the best in terms of gameplay.
However outside of the gameplay there are a lot of problems:
CLEAR PASS!
This is unacceptable. I do not tolerate this system in a game that costs this much. Blocking content behind clear pass is absolutely disgusting and just the sheer idea  of this has destroyed this game for me.
ANTI-CHEAT
This has been from the beginning but it's a cancer that is there and will always be. It's like that really stupid cousin that your mom told you to play with.
ALWAYS-ONLINE
One day NEOWIZ will close the servers and you and I will not own this game anymore. Once more, the idea that something is not really my own destroys the pleasure of gameplay I would get.


So, yeah. It's not like I don't recommend this game. The gameplay is fantastic but the problems I adressed are so big that only thinking about them destroys fun for me.
NEOWIZ made a big mistake adding the CLEAR PASS to the game and like many other fans of DJMAX series I want them to know that it's a terrible idea that destroys their almost perfect game.

DJMAX RESPECT V (this game) is a PC port of the original DJMAX RESPECT on the PS4. It is a keyboard rhythm game in which you hit notes to music. The PC and PS4 versions are 2 separate games. The PS4 version is designed for a PS4 controller, while the PC version includes all PS4 charts plus hundreds of SC patterns that are specifically for keyboard. 

DJMAX RESPECT V has a few licensed songs from Marshmello, Porter Robinson, and League of Legends, 7 player online mode, and air mode.

DJMAX RESPECT PS4 has arcade mode, 1v1 online and you both have to have PS+, local multiplayer, offline play.

Now that's out of the way and there is no confusion, let's start with this review. I played PS4 DJMAX since June of 2018 and put an absurd amount of hours into it because I loved it. Once I found out it would be getting a port to PC I was incredibly excited. Early Access was a little rough, and the music sync and scoring issues were really bad, but most of that has been fixed now. You can play at 240 fps, which is really nice. Although it's just a port of the old game but with added patterns for keyboard it became even more fun. It's got a great selection of songs I listen to at work or in the car too. After I first showed my friends this game, they all wanted to play it too.

Here are some features of the game that might help your decision in buying it:

Around 175 great songs in the base game (almost 400 if you buy all of the DLC) at the time of writing this.
4 button modes to choose from: 4B, 5B, 6B, and 8B.
Thousands of patterns to play so you never get bored.
A range of difficulties from the super noob to the ultra expert.
Leaderboards if you care about being the best.
Tons of missions with specific requirements to pass.
A collection mode that keeps track of all your stats and includes gallery images of concept art and songs and Music Videos for every song.

THIS GAME GOES ON SALE A LOT! If you are worried about the price tag (which is a lot for a rhythm game), don't worry. The game and all of its DLC usually go on sale during new DLC releases, which is usually 3-4 months. You can expect the price to drop over 50%, which is definitely worth your money. If you really enjoyed the base game I highly recommend the DLC such as V EXTENSION or BLACK SQUARE. Also, I have written a guide here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2362889860
It describes every unlock, gameplay tips, basic mechanics, and more.

Overall, this game is definitely worth getting once it goes on sale. Of course no game is perfect, but this one is a classic and hopefully becomes even more fun after more songs and DLC are released :)",1617411332,1617411332,True,17,0,0.658851027488708496,0,True,False,False

But it is a huge amount of content and has something worth playing if you're a fan of rhythm games, and/or the ""classic"" (DDR-esque) style of music game presentation with notes that flow to a target.

It's a good soundtrack, plenty to like here, especially if you've ever played and enjoyed any DJMAX game in the past, besides Technika, maybe, it just doesn't translate the same without touch.

There are some good and some bads right now for this game comparing it from the PS4 version of this game.

PROS:
• MORE songs than the PS4 version (10+ new songs) 
• Air Mode (Ill explain it later.)
• More Charts
• 8 Player Online (When it comes out)
• KEYBOARD.

Cons : 
• Partial Controller support (Cause of early access)
• No Mission (Cause of early access)
• No Arcade (Cause of early access)
• No timing offsets (Cause of early access) 

The early access is to test the bugs out currently. The game is 100% playable in its state. Though what it looks like the level cap is 99 on here but on the ps4 its 999.. Things are still getting added and its a great game over all. Worth it for the money before the price increases. 

Air Mode is a mode where you do songs back to back, Its comparable to Guitar Hero Live TV mode and DDR Nonstop Mode. (DDRMax to DDR X2) except its endless. As of the latest update you cannot save your score on Air Mode. But sometimes i like to leave air mode on while afk so i can farm up levels and unlock all the songs.

 What makes DJ MAX the best Rhythm game ?

-a Clean user interface with sharp design and high resolution graphics
-Gameplay that is adaptable to all playstyles, encourages growth and doesn't punish creativity
-Arguably the best soundtrack for the amount of songs
-7-player LIVE multiplayer matches with the most supportive online community

 With an EXPANDING Library of nearly 400 Songs,
 What DLC should i Get??

a tip for DLC, if you're looking for 'specific songs' check those packs
on their description page to see if the tracks are listed.(a lot of songs have
been moved around). Keep in mind the ""Gear"" and ""Note"" Expansions are for cosmetics
only and DO NOT INCLUDE SONGS.

Expansion Pack bundles will save you a little bit more money, and usaully they are 
good/complementary pairings.

Here are my DLC Recommendations in order:
DJ MAX RESPECT V (Base Game)(you need this to play the game)
Clazziquai - the best expansion, VERY talented musicians included here
Black Square - this is the 2nd best expansion and can Be bundled with Clazziquai

Deemo - this is an expansion based on a Piano based rhythm game which has an amazing soundtrack
 including the BEST SONG IN THE GAME (don't believe me, look up 'magnolia' by M2U)

beyond those the next expansions i would recommend would be in this order:
Technika 3
Technika 2
V extension
Emotional Sense
Technika 1

 About the Technika Expansions, i was originally confused by this because these are 
'Touch-screen' games... well they simply took the tracks and made them as playable
charts on the game, which is Good cause now you can enjoy the songs in the familiar format
instead of the Gimmick that was the 'Touch-Arcade'

 if you have any questions just post, i will try to answer as many as i can! and if you're into
music games, go on and buy this game.",1615992877,1615992877,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Just a little disclaimer, I'm not the biggest rhythm game player and I only played a bit of Osu! and some android games on emulator, so I have no huge experience of other games of this kind, except for Love Live School Idol Festival on which I spent a few hundred hours.

To keep this short:
+ Really well made and fluid
+ Interface is brilliant, mixing colors and animated drawing, never saw a better UI
+ Until now I only played about 20 hours, but there seem to be a big difficulty curve and insanely difficult tracks that I can't touch without immediately failing (maybe because my keyboard is not adapted for rhythm games)
+ A great amount of musics with a level system making you unlock new ones (so please don't buy the DLC unless you are a hardcore fan wanting to support DJMAX)
+ Some really easy musics and a tutorial, so it seems really beginner-friendly

-/+ XINGCODE3, the anti-cheat engine which seems to cause problem with some people

- No offline mode, is for me the biggest downside. Why would you want a constant online mode if you're playing a rhythm game. I understand that it would be important for leaderboards and ranked matches, but aside from that, there really should be an offline mode available in which your progression would not be saved
- I understand the 4B and 6B layouts, but the other ones seem a bit off in my opinion, especially the 8B mode where the notes are displayed on a whole side of the track (3 left or right lines) instead of having a dedicated line. But it could be difficult to keep up if there were 8 lines, even though LLSIF had 9 (but easier note-layouts)
- Had to redownload the game completely after pausing an update

I'm quite satisfied by the game this far BUT can't recommend it because of the lack of offline mode. As stated in other reviews, if a sequel comes out in the future and the servers get taken down, the money you spend will be void.",1582898763,1615835805,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a substantial delay between hitting the notes and the sound they make.
For easier songs this isn't much of a problem, but once you ramp up the difficulty and have to hit a lot of notes in a short time frame, the audio becomes messed up and disorientating.

There is an in game setting for audio sync, but that only changes the timing of the notes appearing and doesn't fix the audio.

Underneath is an amazing game, but I can only recommend the PS4 version",1615826941,1615826941,False,6,0,0.504016518592834473,6,True,False,False

I owned and played every DJMAX game prior to this including Tapsonic and the original MMOGs.
PSP/PSV era leaderboards were plagued with cheaters since everyone had cwcheat.

DJMAX Trilogy came with a stupid USB stick, but it eventually got cracked anyway, DRM is pointless but I agree theres a need for an anti cheat for all multiplayer games.

Review starts here
Cons
There seems to be about 60ms of input delay.
Obtaining all the content is extremely expensive outside of a steam sale.
Some of the best and most challenging songs are DLC like in the Black Square pack.
Collab DLC like Deemo are not hit sounded which is just lazy and unprofessional.

Pros
Satiates your nostalgia. Most charts are the same as what you would have played on DJMAX/Portable/Technika/Tapsonic
Has cute gears(game UI) and bonus artwork to look at.
Has weird collab events sometimes?

Final Opinion
If you don't play multiplayer, your biggest worry will be the high total cost of the game.
Visually and aurally, DJMAX is the most visually impressive vertical scrolling rhythm game franchise to exist.
The background videos all have of a higher standard of quality compared to its competitors.
Konami's background videos in Beatmania don't really come close to what Pentavision has done over the years in DJMAX
Also the notecharting in Respect is better than all the 4-8k maps that exist in Osu!Mania/Stepmania because Neowiz pays salaries to testers to playtest their stuff, but in online communities like Stepmania/Osu!/Beatsaber, charts can be ranked just because its a popular meme and can be complete garbage. 

Worth every cent!(only if its on a sale)
[Please wait for a sale]
[seriously please wait for a sale before buying this]

EDIT :
Since DJMax respect was originally released as a PS4 game, most of the old notecharts are designed to be cleared on a PS4 controller or on a Playstation Portable/Vita's button layout. Needing you to occasionally spin the left and right analog stick sometimes
There are some charts that are extremely difficult to play on a gamepad though, for example pressing the left and right arrow keys at the same time on a controller is usually impossible for most older controllers. 

Anti combo break equipment have been removed so getting the Lord of combo title may be more difficult if you choose songs too difficult for you in your run and get caught in a retry loop.

Luckily the game supports using a DS4 or XBox controller, however the UI does not adept to this. Another noticeably absent thing is a ""test"" screen for the audio offset, so you'll have to free-ball it. Also, some songs actually miss what for me is one of the signature features of the DJ MAX games, namely the note playback (your buttons playing parts of the songs). This is fairly noticeable, and mostly happens on third-party//imported songs.

The base game includes some nice songs by itself, and other (and older) songs are available in [i] mostly [/i] prices that are worth it. The team adds more songs from time to time, some free, some under existing packs. So in general, if a song pack includes a few songs you like I'd recommend considering it.

Over all a nice new entry in the series, which I'm glad is (this time around) simply released on steam and easy to obtain (looking at you, DJ Max Trilogy).

Terrible port. Side track, L1/R1, and L2/R2 notes don't translate well to keyboard. Background videos utterly tank performance. Air mode is completely pointless and ultimately defeats the purpose of playing a rhythm game. Who wants to have distracting comments on the screen, or have the game start autoplaying while you type in chat? Who asked for this? Yeah arcade mode in the PS4 version was useless, but it at least made some sense.

Always-online DRM sucks, PS4 version doesn't have that. Anticheat that isn't even necessary because cheating in a rhythm game doesn't even hurt anything but leaderboards, in a game where 99% of the time people focus more on accuracy than score anyway. There's also way too much DLC. Song packs are fine, but when you're making me pay $10 for SKINS? That's just not happening.

I'm so glad, because I have so much fun with this game. I even got myself an EZMAX Arcade Style Controller from Gamo2, which I heartily recommend. I was into Beatmania IIDX back when it was new, and this scratches that old craving. I don't like the idea of paying a subscription for IIDX nowadays, or puzzling my way through Japanese online purchasing websites in order to do it, so DJMax is where it's at for me.

PROS:
- Generous tracklist of about 150 tunes out of the box, with another added 200 or so as DLC. Wait for a Steam sale for the DLC, when the average cost-per-song dips below 50 cents each.
- Difficulty is very customizable, with 4-Key, 5-Key, 6-Key, and 8-Key modes, plus usually three or four charts of different difficulties (Normal, Hard, Max, and SC) within each mode. Your grade on each unique chart is saved separately. Unlike the PS4 version, you CAN sort the songlist by difficulty, so you don't have to search around for charts at your level.
- Keysounded, so you can definitely hear the difference when you're grooving and when you're not doing so well. (Although I hear that at least one DLC pack is not keysounded, so read the DLC reviews before you buy.)
- There is a timing adjustment option, but I find I don't need to adjust it with my rig. I do recommend using Microsoft drivers for your Realtek sound devices tho, because of audio lag issues with the Realtek drivers. The judgement is very lenient compared to most rhythm games, which I actually like... it makes you want to push for the harder charts.
- Lots of options for the way you want the notes and interface to look. Change how you want the background animation to show through the playing field, at what percentage transparency. Play with the field on the left, center, or right of the screen. Adjust the speed on the fly with a fairly high granularity (0.1).

CONS:
- No mode to slow down charts to study or practice them. Is that no longer a thing in these games?

-------------------------
INITIAL REVIEW:
Unfortunately what would be a great game is hampered by the fact that it frequently hangs and crashes. I tried it on three different gaming rigs on a wired fiber connection, and had the same issue on all. Whenever it tries to do the following things, it will hang or crash 20% of the time:

1) booting the game
2) loading a song
3) updating results at the end of a song (BTW: kiss that full-combo goodbye, it never happened)

I suspect that the problems may stem from issues related to the developer's insistence of ""always online"" DRM. Even if it's not, it's a terrible idea, when a significant portion of players have no interest in the online or competitive features of this game.

If you do buy the game, don't make the same mistake I did -- Don't suffer through restarts if your game hangs -- Steam will refuse your request for a refund if your playtime is a minute more than two hours.",1606686232,1613183209,True,0,0,0.498640924692153931,0,True,False,False

[h1]The Good[/h1]

This game is great no doubt about it from the blazing tracks to the addictive gameplay. Totally worth the money to spend as you get lost for hours trying to get better at the game as time progress. Trying to unlock certain skins and songs for the game while at the same time honing improvement. 
Excellent mode choices (air, freestyle, collection, online, etc...) that keeps you from boredom:

Air - A great small unique mode that lets you play songs live while reading others comments. Like a epic mix between podcast and livestream.

Free mode - Have fun trying to max out combos or play whatever song you like

Online - Battle against others in to seeing who gets the better score.

Mission - Play a collection of songs while having challenging tasks to do such as achieve certain score or being above a certain success rate percentage.

Collection - See your in game stats as well as look at art and see your achievements.

Sounds great but that's not why I wrote this review.

[h1]The Horrid[/h1]

Anticheat <- This is such a crappy anticheat that kills potato pcs as it constantly uses the cpu to check you're not using any suspicious programs. It likely works but truly makes the game hard to play on pcs with weak cpus. Causing likely stuttering and other in game issues.

Expensive DLCs -> I myself have most of DJMAX dlc. I'm fine with purchasing as most of the songs in the dlcs have been in the past game and only to replay these tracks with new SC difficulties as well as a HD Background seems awesome. But for the price tag when not on sale can seems really not worth it. Mainly because of the amount of songs per pack. 

Servers -> Because you always need to be online and connected to djmax servers if they go down then say goodbye to all the money you wasted on this or even the hours you put into it. Once this game is forgotten it's game over as all of your game progress is saved online to the cloud.

And really any other small issue would be here too but this isn't even the reason I'm writing this review either it's because of this

I pay for the dlcs and i bought this overpriced game what the hell is wrong with you seriously. Now your just doing highway treason with making us also pay for a fortnite battle pass to access cosmetics that we won't probably naturally get in game. You just rid worth it progression now for us to pay premium to unlock said progression awards.

For things I disliked about DJ Max Respect:

1. Some songs (and lately many) are not tune notes. This essentially drive the game toward Mobile Game level. So, It's no longer rewarding to press buttons accurately for those songs since missing a note timing will not affect the music.

2. The Introduction of the new Long notes (Left shift and Right shift, default keys) is nice, but this contradicts with the Number of buttons stated in the Mode. 4B with 2 shift keys is essentially 6B gameplay, and so on.

Notes travel across the screen towards a fixed position. Hit the correct button (keyboard or controller) at the right time in order to accumulate points. When I've described this game to people who have not played rhythm games before, they often react with, ""That sounds easy!"" Of course, this sounds very basic on paper, but the reality is that the level of dexterity, hand-eye coordination, reaction time and, most importantly, sense of rhythm required reach a very high ceiling. Ultimately, none of that matters if the music isn't good enough to keep you wanting to play.

There is a huge variety of music present in the game, even without counting the DLCs. Name a genre (without getting overly specific) and there is most likely at least one track in that style. It is this range that will ensure that there will be a handful of tracks that you will enjoy. Fortunately, there is an in-game [i]favourite[/i] system that allows you to single out these tracks for easy access.

While I have been an enthusiast of rhythm games for the past couple of decades, I am no expert of the genre and its many technical aspects.

This game will provide more long-term entertainment value for me. 
I absolutely love the artistic choice that the game has! The style, the UI design are so stylistic, I love navigating the UI interface of this game! 
One of many complaints about this game is about the anti-cheat, I for one don't care and it never affected my experience. Additionally, some people complain that it's too easy, that may be true to seasoned veteran IIDX or SDVX players, but for people like me, who don't have access to many arcade rhythm games in my region who has only played either osu!mania, Stepmania on PC. This has been a great experience for me to get out of my comfort zone to try out 5k - 8k and master my accuracy!
All in all, this is one of the best rhythm games on Steam. Buy it! Rather than spending it on drugs or something short-term that only satisfy yer for a while.

I'm a prominent level creator in the rhythm game community and I've authored one of the most comprehensive and detailed rhythm game level creation guides out there.

With the heavy price tag on DJMAX, you are primarily paying for something that few other rhythm games can pull off successfully: keysounded quality level design. Keysounded notes make it feel more like you are actually playing the music and ""performing"" it yourself. The quality of the level design allows you to really appreciate the music you're listening to. They have a fantastic selection of levels of all difficulty levels, from the very basic to the reasonably difficult.

Should you get this game? If you are reasonably familiar with rhythm games and you like the idea of a polished quality game, you will learn quickly why this franchise has such a cult following. It's got a couple of technical quirks such as not being able to play while offline, but I personally find these to be mild issues overall. The song list is small compared to most other rhythm games, but this is the cost of having a beautifully curated selection.",1610359419,1610359419,True,6,0,0.575889766216278076,0,True,False,False

DJ Max is a rhythm game with a familiar setup. Depending on your mode, you either have 4, 5, 6, or 8 tracks with falling notes for you to hit. Luckily for beginners, DJMax Respect V is a love letter to the entire franchise, in that it contains the vast majority of songs from games that came before, only a couple of which have previously been given a proper release in the US. Respect V is an enhanced version of Respect, originally released for Playstation 4 a few years back. With the base Respect V game, you get all the songs from DJ Max Portable 1 and 2 (two early series games, many of them which appeared in DJMAX Fever on PSP, the series' first US release). You also get a collection of tracks composed specifically for Respect.

All together, there's over 150 songs for the base game already, although close to 100 of these need to be unlocked as you level up. DLC is available to nearly round out the entire DJ MAX library: Trilogy, Technika (1-3), Clazziquai, Black Square, Emotional Sense. A few later games are not adequately represented yet, but since there's still a steady stream of updates and DLC, that could only be a matter of time. There are also DLC songpacks for crossovers with other games, like Deemo, Cytus, and Groove Coaster. And then there's the V Extension pack, which gives you another collection of newly-made songs. Many DLC packs also have extras like gears, missions, and even UI themes. The UI themes for past game packs are quite nostalgic, as they emulate the look of the previous games, complete with bringing back old menu music. That, along with the many references like achievement and mission names, make the DLC a special trip down memory lane.

Respect V's Air mode gives you the ability to drop in and out of play pretty much at will, you'll play an endless playlist and the tracks will be autoplayed whenever you do not wish to play. This is good for when you want to start playing quickly and don't really care about what you play - you do get to choose your button mode and general range of difficulty, but the song selection is more or less out of your hands.

Freestyle is the ability to play any unlocked song. Here you can raise your overall score, unlock album images, accomplish in-game objectives, beat your highest scores, and increase that all-important combo counter.

Online mode consists of either ranked battles where you play best-of-3 matches to raise your tier, or free matches where you play any songs you like with others and ranking is not affected. The ranked battle system is pretty fun in my opinion.

Finally, mission mode has you trying to clear specific challenges - and they get pretty serious pretty quick. 

Those familiar with DJ Max games will recognize certain flaws: in 10+ years of DJ Max, it appears Neowiz still lacks a truly experienced/native English speaker on their team. You'll find odd grammar quirks throughout, and this even extends to achievement descriptions that are ambiguous. DJMAX also has a history of not being the most technically polished game series (one of the gears in the PSP Fever game actually froze the game whenever you attempted to use it), although I have not had this game long enough to know if it's a problem. One of the current worst things performance wise is if your computer doesn't meet minimum specs, you will experience the elements of the song and video getting out of sync with each other. Which might not be a big issue, except the game seems to take more resources than it should need. My Surface Pro 3 struggles to keep up unless I turn off the BGM. Looking around on the discussions, performance seems to have gotten worse after updates, so there's always the hope that it can get better again.

Despite the flaws, this game is still a wonderful celebration of DJ Max, a fantastic entry point for beginners, and an incredible value for anybody (especially on sale). I highly recommend it.",1609618773,1610051544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The game is fun, lots of music to choose from if you are willing to get some dlc on top. However there will be songs for you to unlock. The dlc are mostly for people that have played previous DJ MAX franchises and like certain songs (like me, i love clazziquai and technika 1-3)
- Overall performance is solid, though i ran into some light issues with load times after 3 days of playing. I verified my game and it seemed to fix itself but super odd. - not a deal breaker for me though. 
- There are a variety of modes to play, you got your standard online with friends, air mode that is kinda like a radio/play as you go (lets you experience new songs that you might not know you've liked) and less competitive. 
- There is ranking for all the competitive players
- There is also a mission mode for you those who want a challenge. 
- They do collaborations with other games like Girls Frontline, Cytus, and Chunithm. So some of the songs from these collabs might be relevant to you. (DLC)

Overall I've always loved the DJMAX series from when I was 16 playing the arcade to now (24). 
If you love music, kpop, edm, ani-pop, and a little bit of classical remixes, then this game is for you. 
However, dlc is a little expensive if it's not on sale so keep that in mind.

IF you are planning for DLC, take some time to look through the songs and see if it's right for you.
Clazzquai - mostly chill songs
Black Square - a little more dubstep-kinda theme
Technika 1-3 - from the original arcade. - all songs are in the associated packs.

- A decent amount of songs with the base game
- Many different line types for different skill levels
- I can actually play it on my potato computer
- Multiplayer does have a decent playercount
But, there are still a couple of cons, mostly with the songs.
- Songs are locked behind a leveling wall, forcing players to either cheese it with air mode, or spend way too much time playing the same songs over and over again.
- More than half of the songs available in the game are locked behind a paywall.
- Sometimes, the game hiccups and I lose my inputs.
- The game does not like it when I double click the same note, weird considering those notes appear a lot. Although, that's more of a potato computer problem.
- My biggest gripe. YOU NEED INTERNET TO PLAY. God, i wish i could play this game on the go, or in the air, but It needs connection at all times. Go figure.

I've played quite a bit of rythm games, notably FlashFlashRevolution (since 2007!) and Stepmania and consider myself to be pretty good at them. Difficulty was not an issue, I usually find it quite boring to have to play through easier songs to get to a level that suits my skills.

While I'm usually very open in my musical tastes, I found none of the songs available were particularly good or exciting. I would often zone-out while playing, either because the song was not to my liking or too easy. I did enjoy the Guilty Gears songs but even then, I would have preferred more engaging renditions; For instance 'Holy Orders' is my favorite but I would have much rather preferred playing S.S.H's cover!

I find notes very difficult to ""read"". This did make the game a lot more difficult to play, but not in a satisfying way. My personal preference is clear color codes for notes that match the beats, i.e. different colors for beats, 1/2 beats, 1/4 beats, 1/8 beats etc. In this case, the colors seem to change based on lanes and / or whether those notes will provide ""fever""? I'm honestly still not sure. It made songs with more notes a lot more difficult to read and I couldn't get a good sense of the beat based on the notes spacing alone.

I do appreciate how polished the game feels. I love the menu animations and the presentation of it all. I like the way the game is made, but not its content.

All in all, I kept playing the game to give it a chance but I ultimately did not enjoy myself with the base pack. I don't feel like purchasing additional song packs would change my mind... And I don't feel like spending more money on a game I don't like that much.

I would advise people to look into the songs the game has and watch a few videos of gameplay to see if that's something they would enjoy. I think it's a good game, it just wasn't for me.",1609542504,1609542504,False,7,0,0.60418999195098877,0,True,False,False

I was pretty used to controller based rhythm games so I got into it pretty quick, but it never really felt right, kinda like it needed to be on a keyboard. Lo and behold, I thought my wishes were answered, but...unfortunately not.

Let me start off by saying this: DJMAX Respect V is not a bad game. Far from it, there's some really fun things about the game. A rhythm game that uses samples and plays along with you, instead of just muting a track on and off, is a really neat concept and makes it really satisfying when you hit a long string of notes and it sounds perfectly in sync. The amount of music, while a little repetitive, feels decent for the price, and they're adding new songs every once and a while.

So why don't I like this game? One word: lag. I have done seriously everything I could think of to try to eliminate input lag on my system. Reinstalling my graphics drivers, using a different monitor, reinstalling my entire OS, using different keyboards, even trying the game on a different computer, and the same behavior: severe input lag when playing. To make sure I wasn't going nuts I hooked up a metronome to my sound card and made sure the music and met were in sync, then tried to play listening to the sounds of my keyboard and the met only. The results? Max 60% scores on every single note. I repeated it multiple times, with different songs which used different BPMs, and I can't figure out what was going on. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I whipped out my phone and recorded some slow-mo footage of me hitting the key on my keyboard and watching when the note lit up, and compared it to another fantastic rhythm game: osu. There was noticeable lag on the DJMAX recording. Trying to mess with the audio delay settings makes the chart in sync, but then the music is completely messed up, because the samples are playing at the wrong time, which basically ruins the game for me. I want to feel like I'm playing the music, not just tapping along with a chart.

Maybe I'm just unlucky with my setup, considering other people don't seem to have this problem. Searching online, especially scouring the r/DJMAX subreddit came up empty for me, as if I'm the only one who has this problem (or others have just learned to deal with it). Until this is fixed, I can't recommend the game, especially when the game costs at minimum, $50. There really should be better compatibility at that price point.

A fantastic rhythm game that is brought down by a single flaw: input lag. 4/10.

EDIT: If anyone has the same issue and sees this, please let me know. I'd like to hear if you had anything that improved performance. I REALLY want to love this game, I think it's honestly one of the best rhythm games out there, and I really want to continue playing it and buy the DLC. I just can't though until this is fixed, or until I figure out what my problem is (it really should be fixed in code though, Neowiz).",1598659766,1609285319,False,4,0,0.474393516778945923,0,True,False,False

I was initially discouraged when I was first exposed to DJMAX, and felt as if the game was too hard. Now 100 hours later I am sitting at an average of 10* max combos in patterns. Missions are for those who want the true challenge -- but are still a bit difficult to me. (20 missions cleared at time of review).

TL;DR: osu!mania and other f2p titles in this genre=quantity over quality. DJ Max Respect V=quality over quantity. osu!mania/f2p=free. DJMRV=Expensive. 

osu!mania is a great equivalent to a game like this, especially given the limitless content and it being free, but it's easy to see why people prefer this over it. What you get here is premium; the animations, timing, song/skin/controls customisation... It's all top notch, with songs even having custom tapping sounds to make you feel like you're actually ""playing"" the music. You can also control everything using your keyboard, and for a game like this, that is super helpful. Despite all this... The price is a hard sell, especially when you realise how many DLCs this game has on it. Muse Dash does a really good job in its genre of rhythm games, being a variant of Taiko, but its DLC is only 40 dollars and it comes with everything, as well as future releases. Respect V on the other hand sells practically every new release as a DLC, meaning you're spending about as much as you'd buy an expensive indie game for, just to expand what's here. I'm also not the biggest fan of the music selection right out of the gate, so I am already here wondering whether I should bother to upgrade... I think this structure to marketing this game is predatory at best, and makes me, the user, feel scammed. 

This game comes with very nice unlockable content, as well as graphs that show off your overall performance. These sections of the game are done super well and push you to play more for the completionist factor. Compared to a lot of other games like this, I'd say this is where Respect V shines - the overall UI displays this information neatly, clearly, and aesthetically, oozing quality and improving overall enjoyment factor.

The multiplayer is a bit rough around the edge when it comes to options. I can't see any kick feature, it isn't the most obvious who wins after each match, and there is no logs that show the history of your placement - like there is in osu. The upper hand that this game does have over osu's multiplayer is that you can see others playing on the side. While not practical for play, it is neat, especially if you're streaming the game. Also each player is allowed to play any difficulty and key number they'd like, so if you're not so good at the game, people will still bother to play with you because they can adjust their side to be harder. This is a great feature and makes multiplayer a lot more active than most games like this. It's hard to know how this factors into points, but I assume that the harder difficulties and keys will net you more points - as it should be.

Overall, the product is good, but is weighed down by an expensive entry price, and a hoard of DLCs. If this really is your thing, I'd say buy the base game on sale, and expand as you run out of content, and only buy what interest you. Even then, there are options out there like Step Mania, Quaver, and osu!mania, and they're all free. While the product you get here is definitely more polished than any of those, they are at the end of the day free, and if you're already questioning whether you should buy based on price alone, I'd say passing is your best option.

EDIT: On sale the DLCs aren't that much if you remove all the gear/unlock packs (cosmetic/passes for songs you can unlock for free), and the original sound tracks (Not maps for in game, but song files), you are left with a still expensive, but manageable DLC list for all the extra songs currently available. There is quite a lot here for around 50-100 dollars depending on which ones you want to buy (Deemo/Cytus pack don't have keysounds, so some say to skip this, and Technika packs aren't officially listed, and most people won't have these songs for multiplayer anyway).

The game is also an always online game to prevent cheating in a niche genre that almost no one cares about and to more efficiently harvest your personal information

Just play Musedash instead of you are looking for a solid rhythm game
The songs are better, the note sound effects aren't insanely jarring, it doesn't have invasive software attached to it, and you don't have to be online to play your single player game

This is terrific experience from top to bottom. First, while not always crucial in rhythm games, DJMax Respect V has a brilliant aesthetic. Each menu, each device skin, every UI input is designed to function as a whole so the process of selecting game modes and music is enjoyable. In a game where you might spend hundreds of hours playing, it's nice to have colorful, lively animations and nuances to keep everything feeling fresh. The videos in game are all fun and the variety within the tons of songs you have at your fingertips is huge. Song selection wise, you have great tracks in the base game and then a TON of really well priced DLC packs which expand the game exponentially. Each pack brings new UI themes, new animations, new songs and they are, for the most part easy to enjoy regardless of whatever music style you might prefer. I like harder edged techno/EDM stuff but even the lighter tracks are fun. Game modes range from playing solo sessions for high scores, playing online, partaking in challenging mission modes (and some of them are doozies) and in packs like the Technika packs, entirely different ways of playing the core game. I cannot say enough about DJ Max Respect V, it was great on the PS4 and even better here. It runs like a dream and it is continually being supported by the devs unlike some of the competition.

The game's many, many different difficulties and button layout/variations give you a lot to practice with and many songs to play. Soundtrack is also super diverse and catchy; many different genres and each song has a unique animation in the background. It also has some nice UI customizations. The fun of the game is how simplistic its tremendous challenge is and slowly becoming adequate enough process your ever faster key smashing.

That, and playing with the keyboard feels really nice, and the ability to play at 144hz, which has helped me read the faster pattterns much easier I feel like. One thing that does absolutely bother me is this xigncode garbage, I hate that I have to be online just to play it, which is where the ps4 version wins. Also, it kinda sucks that they removed the ability to play songs you don't own with friends anymore if they owned them. I guess you could play air mode to play those songs but it's not like you get to choose... Idk, I really liked buying a dlc pack a friend didn't have and we'd play online together going through each song. Anyways i'm pretty average at this game even though I've spent hundreds of hours on the ps4 version lol but transitioning to keyboard took a little getting used to on top of the long break I had from the game.

That said, this is still the best crafted rhythm game I have played in years. There is a ridiculously large amount of content in this game with new music being added fairly regularly.  

The range of difficulty is also incredibly vast, starting with very simplified versions of most songs requiring only 4 buttons (plus two more that are seldom used and are optional when they appear) up to ridiculously difficult 1:1 transcriptions of the music requiring 8 buttons (plus the extra two). Starting out, the game will feel sort of bad because it can be quite difficult and much of the music is actually produced by pressing buttons. If you can't play a song well, it won't sound good. On the flip side of this, when you can play a song well, most of them sound great and the satisfaction of knowing that it sounds good because you're playing perfectly is incredible. Some other rhythm games using booing crowds and jeering announcers to reinforce that you need to improve. This game needs only let you listen to the music you're producing through a poor performance.

Each song has it's own animated (or live action) video that plays in the background during the song giving the feeling of playing a music video each time. Most of them are really well made, but some of them are absolute unapologetic garbage that should be immediately turned off (which, luckily is an option on a per song basis). I think, honestly, one of their video designers must hate people with epilepsy.

After 48 hours, I'm only just scratching the surface of this game. I have mostly stuck to 4 button mode, and I still have not played about half of the songs in the game. I suspect it will take me hundreds more hours to be good enough to play competently in 8 button mode, and I think I'm going to have a blast on my journey there.

It gets pretty challenging but is rewarding, and the whole note sounds system works really well. I would say this might be a little daunting if you're new to rhythm games but I think even completely new players can have fun with the lower difficulty 4key maps and improve. Not all the 8key maps necessarily have the highest difficulty for every track, which is also nice since it doesn't gate everything there. Definitely do not want to play this on a laptop keyboard though, you'll want a mechanical keyboard or at least a membrane keyboard with some taller keycaps since this requires a lot of hand/finger independence, and you'll need to use your wrists for some of the harder stuff.

Pros:
+ Various, catchy tunes, and international languages of music add for more diversity
+ Intuitive, interactive and smooth gameplay
+ Optimized for all control schemes
+ Eye-popping visuals
+ Various difficulties include different tempo, amount of keys and difficulty themselves. There's something for people of all learning curves.

Cons:
- Expensive investment: base game and all DLCs, even on sale, is a commitment. But this goes for most, if not all, rhythm games

While this game is overall very polished, has a good music selection, and a variety of difficulties to play, there are some things I hope they can improve on. Keep in mind i'm coming from a ""tryhard"" background in rhythm games with 4 years of 4key experience. If you enjoy rhythm games casually you will most likely enjoy this game. $50 is a very steep price, I got it during the winter sale for $40 and still am unsure about that price point.

First off, there is one thing i'd like to get out of the way. Chart readability. This is more apparent during high level play with high NPS. There are so many combo flashers and ""fever"" multipliers everywhere, combined with huge combo font, that it is really hard to read notes sometimes. This is more apparent when you miss one and then your combo starts building up immediately showing x2 x3 x4 x5 in quick succession. There are no options to turn any of this off. You can dim the BGA, although I would consider that a standard feature for rhythm games.

Second up is difficulty. Like I said earlier, there are many good songs with multiple difficulties to play. However, most songs do not have maximum or SC difficulties available, making the pool of songs for high level play relatively small. This might not be a problem for you if you play a variety of key counts. I am almost entirely a 4 key player so this is more apparent to me. Note patterns are not very well rounded, I noticed a lot of streams, jacks, and vibros across different songs, but nothing else besides that.

Next up, the air mode. I'm not sure I entirely get the point of this. You play a queue of songs while randomly picked comments from other users appear on the right side of the screen, giving the effect of an audience of viewers while the notefield is moved against the left side of the screen. The scores set in live mode are not saved, and when you go back into free play they are not shown (In my case I checked a song I had not previously played).

Finally, customization. This leaves a lot to be desired. You cannot move the notefield position at all, (it sits a little high on the screen for my liking) you can't adjust the size of the notefield, some VFX cannot be turned off, note speed is relative to each song, sound effects volume can only be lowered to 50% minimum, not allowing you to turn it off.

I know this review seems negative, but I really don't hate the game. It's very polished, has no technical or crashing issues, a decent song lineup, and 4-8 key play. If you are a beginner/intermediate VSRG player and find this game for 30 bucks, go ahead and grab it, you will probably have a lot of fun. From my perspective, it's still limited in some areas. This could all change due to the game being in early access, and it definitely has a solid start.",1576875746,1606633388,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Let's keep it simple so I can get back to playing.

This is the absolute best version of my favorite rhythm game of all time. 

I've been a fan of this series since the PSP games back in the day, and this game contains every single song I have loved for so many years, along with so, so many more. The base game includes a huge amount of content, between songs, unlockables, missions, online play, and the new AIR mode, which reminds me of the LIVE mode from Guitar Hero LIVE, but done a bit better. This mode is cool, since it allows you to try out DLC songs for free occasionally (the selection of songs is random on AIR)

The DLC is expensive. There's no getting around it. However, the way that it is parsed out means you never HAVE to buy all of it. It's separated by the game the songs originally appeared in, so, say, if you love Black Square, but don't like the Clazziquai Edition tracks, you'll never be forced to buy those. It's very modular in that way, and new content is being released constantly.

The sound quality and graphical presentation is clean, sleek, and gorgeous. The online play isn't the most active, but it is very stable and a huge amount of fun.

I don't know what else to say. If you like music, buy it. If you loved Beatmania back in the day, you probably already own it, but if not, BUY IT. Wonderful game, wonderful port, wonderful music.

The games are fun from where I originally played DJMAX during the PSP era playing Portables 1,2,3, Clazziquai, and Black Square. Majority of the music are instrumentals, English, and Korean (of course, because they made the series) in different forms of music genre.

This game is just giving me a nostalgic feeling. The higher difficulty settings brings it a challenge and fun to the game and music. Every beat you push brings dynamic tunes, just like the PSP. And the note mapping looks and feels the same (in a good way), so muscle memory comes to play and making it an enjoyable experience once again.

From the looks of it, DJMAX Respect V compiled most (maybe all in the future) of the songs from its PSP predecessor, Technika, and original songs from DJMAX Respect in PS4. I mean, this game IS originally from PS4. The music from Portable 3, Technika, Clazziquai, and Black Square is missing in the roster, which would mean they'll become a future DLC or a free content. Correct me if I'm missing more details.

DJMAX Respect's music video has been rendered high quality, unlike the PSP games to which are pixelated before (Except for Clazziquai, which is [b]THE BEST DJMAX for me![/b])

The game has 4,6, and 8 button modes, if you're so bold and daring to play that many. If you're using a controller like me, L2 and R2 comes to play, just like the classics.

[strike]
[b]Words of Advice:[/b]
[list]
[*] I advice you to play this on a Playstation controller, since it was intentionally played like it. Unless you're the ones who played DJMAX Online and O2Jam, then go crazy with the keyboard. 
[*] Advice from the PS controllers that the R2 doesn't seem to function so you'll miss a beat when the R2 comes in.
[*] Use headphones. This is a rhythm game!
[*] Adjust the speed of notes coming down to what fits you.
[*] Follow the tutorial so you can understand the game better.
[/list]
[/strike]

I don't think you need to see the list since most of them have already been resolved. Play however you want!

The game is in early access and hopefully will bring more old but gold content. I implore you to give this game a chance. This will give you a more discovery of music genres you'll favor. And for those who have played the games originally, play this as well. You'll be reminded of everything you have experienced in this game. I know this review is bias but to hell with it; I grew up with the series.

the song list is amazingly huge, spanning over two PSP games and a bunch of brand new (and great) tracks, and if you get the DLC, you get even more options (i personally recommend getting V EXTENSION and TECHNIKA 3). i'd recommend buying the song unlock DLC just because grinding every song out to play normally is a paaaain.

gameplay is fun and easy to pick up, and judgment is generally not strict in the slightest. speed mods stay the same across all songs, you've got a bunch of different noteskins and 'gears' (your playfield) to change up, you have 4 different choices of modes to play (or 2 more if you end up getting far in the game's MISSION MODE), it's all really really nice.

It's really fun! There's some really great music and the charting is pretty good. If you're wary about playing a keyboard music game, you'll be surprised. It works really well. I love the in game aesthetic, and it's awesome that it doesn't have an FPS cap, which you don't even get with IIDX (infinitas & PS2 versions all require a solid 60.) Really fun for a IIDX player.

Things to improve:
I'd like if more songs reached into higher difficulties, I haven't unlocked much yet so there's likely more, but at the beginning I'd really like if I could play harder charts. The higher difficulty ones that are available to me now are pretty fun, I just wish there were more.

I tried playing using a IIDX controller (Phoenixwan, from Gamo2) but it bugs out as soon as I plug it in. This is the only game I have that reacts to the controller being plugged in, so I don't assume it's an issue with the controller itself. While keyboard play is quite good, I'd really like to be able to map the IIDX controller.

this game and the price are actually worth it even for Standard edition as there are actually still tons of music and customization you can unlock by playing the game and clearing mission / achievement. the difficulty are far more divers and balanced, you won't encounter a level 18 that felt like it should be level 19. air mode is also enjoyable as the mode also plays DLC song, so I can play Ruti'n in Air mode, there are 4 button types 4,5,6,8 each have their own high level way (I still cannot play 4B on maximum despite I can clear 6B) and the judgement is counted based on percentage though I felt this game judgement are less strict compared to DJMAX Trilogy or maybe due to the timing sync with me. but that's the good thing I won't sugar coat everything as some of minor trouble about this game is the audio buffer. put the audio budget setting on low then the audio won't sync, put it on normal then its occasional out of sync, put it on Huge then its clear but will cause the game to take a bit of time loading new song in freestyle, this must be due to this game is build in Unity. second minor problem is this game require you to stay connected to the internet, I wouldn't say its mainly due to standard mode (Air and online) and quick update on Freestyle combo ranking, but also to prevent external modding (adding custom song or game overlay to even cheating) third one is very nitpick, I encounter a bug where the Airmode that i've played is not counted into the Achievement quest, so I stuck in 3rd Air mode Quest despite have played Airmode over 30 times",1602771554,1602771554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember when it first came out as DJMAX Online in South Korea, I was a kid-in-a-candy-store. Over the years, rhythm games in general lost popularity, perhaps due to unforgiving difficulty and graphic visualizations. DJMAX in particular lived on in various platforms but keeping its integrity from cheaters was difficult as with many other games at that time. In those early days, Intellectual Property was not even a thing and hackers were unaware that stealing IPs can crash both the game and the company. Keeping the legacy in other platforms such as PlayStation barely kept it alive.

AIR mode is a trap, made me buy two extra DLC's because I stumbled upon songs I liked on it.
(basically a mode that lets you try out songs picked at random)

The DLC's I bought came with their own main menu themes, which was great. Not sure if ALL the DLC's are like this, if they all do come with their own themes, that would be awesome.
(they also came with their own noteskins and stuff)

Online mode has you fighting bots on lower ranks because no one plays online anymore at lower ranks. When you DO find a real human to fight with, you get rekt because then you remember the game is filled predominantly with koreans who can basically Max Combo the hardest songs in their sleep.

There are also online Open Rooms you can join where you can play with people without affecting ranks, but do too well and there's a 90% chance the host will kick you off the room just for being too good. So, try to miss at least one note on these rooms so you don't hurt their feelings. You also need to have bought the DLC if the host chooses a DLC song, or else you're stuck in Observe Mode twiddling your toes.

You also now can't disable the FEVER sounds like you could in Trilogy, you can now only lower it to 50% which annoys me since I just want to enjoy and hear the damn music by itself exclusively without those damn exploding sounds on EVERY DAMN FEVER. At least it doesn't have the whole audience screaming and clapping sounds like on Trilogy, but then again, you could disable it on Trilogy anyway unlike on this one.

Also, everytime I play it, I'm always reminded by the sad fact that this is PENTAVISION and one day this game will disappear forever just like how DJMax Technika Q was shutdown without any sign of further offline support.
(can't even play this one offline at all like you could in Trilogy, it's basically following in DJMax Technika Q's footsteps, which is a bad sign)

Play it while you can before it inevitably dies forever too.

Look, I can come to terms with always-online DRM on PC since this platform really is the most pirated out of all of them BUT PLEASE, I know this is wishful thinking, but if time comes and you finally pull the plug on this game, PLEASE give it offline capabilities. DJMax Trilogy is already 10+ years old and I STILL play it to this day (well mostly because of the longer gear space, actually that's another thing, why is the space for the notes shortened even further it's like 30% of the space is being consumed by the gear skin itself like WTH).

This game is art to me, and like all pieces of art, I would want it to last for as long as I would live. Seriously, please don't let it die the same way as DJMax Technika Q did.

PS: I also find it funny how the theme of the game is on a graveyard with epitaphs showing the names of the now dead games they've shutdown in the past, it's as if they knew they're doing this and they're just rubbing it in.

The gameplay itself is accommodating to players of all skill levels, and the process of starting out as a beginner in 4B mode and slowly practicing and mastering your way up to the hardest difficulties in 8B is extremely fun and rewarding.

..............aaaaaaaaaand it's very expensive, but DJMAX was never a mid-tier rhythm game anyway. The concept of a AAA rhythm game definitely sounds weird, but when you think of it, this game has a ton of effort and polish put into it. From the keysounding to individual BGAs for every song, as well as UI animations and many tracking features for a rhythm game.

The song setlist is comprised of original Respect songs as well as a selection of legacy songs from the Portable series of DJMAX games. Other songs are available as DLC packs (but again, they're prohibitively expensive) and they contain from additional songs for Respect V, collaboration from other rhythm games, as well as legacy DJMAX song packs.
Genre wise, the variation is complete, from your usual EDM varieties, to rock, hip-hop, pop, and even RnB and jazz. There's something for everyone!

In terms of gameplay, notes seem to be perfectly synced but this may vary per build. Performance wise, this is *not* the fastest running rhythm game by a long shot. Due to the amount of UI elements it has going for, it may hurt your FPS. I also run from stuttering issues and RTSS FPS limiting seems to cause a few crashes. So, you actually need a pretty decent rig to enjoy this game a bit, which is kind of a shame.

The game has multiple game modes to play:
- Air mode which allows you to play *any* songs even ones that you haven't purchased (good for a test drive), however they are on rotation so you can't choose what song you have to play
- Free mode which allows you to choose and play songs that you want, as well as a continuous chain/combo allowing you carry over the previous combo you have from the previous round, stacking up to 9999999 (there's even an achievement for that)
- Mission mode which challenges the player with a fixed set list and conditions to fulfill, good for training and easing into the game
- Online mode which has open matches and league/ranked matches
It also has stat tracking and profile card customization via Collection mode.
In terms of lanes, it has your popular 4K mode (4B), as well as 5B, 6B, and 8B which uses 2 ""effector"" buttons similar to Sound Voltex. The default keybinding is weird though so you probably want to adjust it.

I mentioned the price quite a few times in this review, and it really can't be ignored. AAA pricing for a rhythm game as well as DLC packs that cost from 10 dollars to a whopping 30 dollars is very eye watering. However, considering the polish this game has from the individual MVs, custom UI, and gear skins as well as additional missions, and the base song library which comes up to roughly 1 dollar a song, it's a pretty fair pricing. Still, it's a lot to ask just for a rhythm game and I highly suggest you buy this on a sale.

Speaking of which, they aren't cheap. At all. But if you really love the series, you wouldn't mind giving them your shekels you haven't spent in what? ten years without DJM? So go for it.

The gameplay is smooth and delicious. The soundkeys are back for vengeance (except on some collab songs, bummer), and they're here to f your perfect score, enjoy your 99.99% jud b*tch.

Unlocking songs is still a ""chore"" if you don't like to play games, and it even gives you the option to unlock them all for some shekels, go be a good goy if you hate playing your games like a normal human.

The only problem I find is that as of the current update there are no Portable 3 songs available yet and to get all songs available it's either you buy access to all of them or unlock them all by levelling up to max.

Well-produced rhythm game; albeit it is a ported remastered version with some newer songs.

Good music & some really good collabs.

Cons:
DLC prices are expensive and a scam; IDGAF if it was from the limited edition, 29.99 USD for what amounts to extra cosmetics and not gameplay does not feel worth spending money on. There is also unlock songs which is meaningless because you can unlock all the songs by playing to 99 or using AIR mode to play/listen to songs, but at the end of the day every new pack gets prices fairly expensively which I understand is necessary to pay artists etc. but after a while especially if you're considering buying the game and wanted to play more songs, you have to choose between what, 8 DLC packs all ranging from 10-25 USD. That will add up to a whole new game, and while they do release some free songs, they tend to be more sparse. (For reference,  they add in LOTS of DLC songs to keep you interested, possibly amounting to the songlist being 300-350 songs. I don't recommend buying anything w/o good sales)

Secondly; the game changed online features. At the time of this review, if you owned the DLC pack and tried to play with your friend, they are forced to listen instead of being able to play the song. This really sucks because I wanted to actually play with friends but being limited to the base game + whatever free DLC songs they've given out is less appealing. What's the point of multiplayer if it became a glorified listening session? There doesn't seem to be local multiplayer either, so guess that's out the window.

Family share also does not let you have access to the DLC. If a family member wanted to play the game, they don't get to have the DLC too.
Also there does not seem to be an offline mode? If you have spotty internet it could be a problem.

I enjoy the game, but I cannot recommend people buy it at full price. Wait for sales.",1586930380,1599585413,False,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I played a TON of DJMax Respect on PS4 and was happy to see it come to PC, though I didn't really want to repurchase everything. I finally did and I can't say I regret it. I love this game. I'm not as good as I used to be since I haven't been playing nearly as often, but having to relearn to play on a keyboard (there is controller support, but keyboard is great!) has really gotten me back into playing. So, as for the game, it's great. It is my favorite rhythm game, along with Rock Band 4 and Project Diva. Playing on a keyboard feels awesome and getting a smooth 144fps @ 1440p makes a big difference.

First a couple of tips for new people: This game is hard, but once it clicks it feels great to play. Just start on the easy songs and progress as you get comfortable. Also, turn the note speed up. It's counterintuitive, but faster is better. Slower note speed leads to clutter on the screen that is hard to read. You need to learn to react to the notes without thinking about it. Trust me, it eventually feels natural. If you think you suck or it's impossible, don't give up! We all felt that way, this is a skill you have to learn. Start slow and you CAN get there. It clicks eventually.

For the PC version you can use whatever input device you have. Controller, keyboard, fightstick, whatever. Have fun. I have many hours on a Dualshock 4 and thought the Xbox One controller felt horrible for this game, but when I tried keyboard I fell in love. You absolutely should remap the default input to whatever you are comfortable with. Find something that has your hands in a natural position and will allow you to progress to different modes (4B, 5B, 6B, 8B) without much adjustment. I've been using WEF[spc], [num]489[rightarrow] where WEF489 are my 6B inputs and my thumbs hit spc or right arrow for 8B, pinkies on [CAPS] and [+] keys for side tracks (sticks on PS4). I keep WE, 89 for 4 button so my hand position never changes for any button mode. Do this early so you're not having to adjust down the line. Look online for other layout suggestions or just try stuff.

[EDIT: Second time editing this review. Last time was to note that the problems seemed fixed. This time is to report that the game is playing perfectly for me now. I haven't had an issue in a while, so I am deleting the lengthy complaint in this review because I don't want people to skim it and just pull out the bad. The game (seems) fixed (for me)!]

[EDIT2: Also, since purchasing this game they have added several new songs for free! Not sure how often they will do this, but it's a nice surprise to get free tracks now and then. Also, they finally added the ability to sort by star rating! So all 1 star songs, then 2 star songs, etc. Great for when you want to warm up gradually without having to search through.]

Okay, I'm putting this at the end to make it easy to find. When I first started playing I was failing out of 4 star songs. I could tell the note timing was off, but this game doesn't have a calibration tool. What it has is a note offset, so I started playing with that. I could not seem to find a setting that felt right. Part of it was not being used to using a keyboard, but the timing was definitely slightly off no matter what I did. I had the frame rate capped at 144fps in the game options, which matches my monitor's refresh rate. I found that when I capped at 60, the game felt fine. This isn't an acceptable solution, so I tried something else. I capped the framerate at 240 (there's no unlimited option) and used RTSS to cap me at 144. The game now plays perfectly and I get a smooth 144fps (EDIT: changed to 143 fps. Imperceptible visually but kept frametime smooth at 6.9ms rather than a 6.9ms-7.3ms variance at 144). Capping in-game was getting me an uneven 140-143fps and causing the timing to always be a little off. My system specs are 2080 Ti, i7-9700k, 16GB Ram and the game is on a quality SSD drive. I was reading some people were having lag issues with Nvidia cards.

TL;DR: Don't cap your framerate with the in-game limiter option. Cap at 240 (max limit) and use an outside frame limiter. I recommend RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS). My game works perfectly now.",1590637890,1596869892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While I am a fan of the series, I am not of this particular title, because how iterative it is, its bad music, and its overpriced DLCs.

Over the last decade, the presentation of DJMAX has barely changed; I can completely see Respect V running on a PS3. There's no notable new feature (edit: I just realized in game comment is a new feature, but... it's just commenting. It shouldn't really count), most of the songs are from old games, and honestly the devs barely had to do any work for this new title (besides porting the content between platforms, but that's not new content). Speaking of which, I have found that the vast majority of the music are only mediocre to decent. It seems to me like the composers did not work with the goal of making the music good, but rather making it have lots of notes so that it is difficult to play. Of course music is completely subjective, but I have to wonder if anyone liked the song that's just lots of synthetic dog noises (besides as a joke).

I also found the number of DLCs and their pricings to be excessive. Not only is there just a lot of them, but there are also two pricing policies: some song packs are $13, whereas others are $26 because they bundle the music download along with access to them in game. Suspiciously my favorite game in the franchise is in the more expensive camp. I don't know about the community's opinion but for me those are the best tracks in the series, and if the devs are deliberately charging more for popular tracks that's a really scummy behavior. And even if this is just a coincidence, taking choice away from the customer is still inherently anti consumer.",1594516331,1596494384,False,2,0,0.503698229789733887,0,True,False,False

Extremely satisfying gameplay, plenty of customization, and a lot of collectibles for the completionists out there. This game has more songs than any other rhythm game I've played on Steam, and each one is charted in a way that's incredibly fun to play.

There is however, a very crucial issue with timing on some computers. This may have a workaround fix by turning VSYNC off in-game or through your GPU directly. Some of the DLC is also a bit expensive, but in my opinion the experience and hours you can get out of this game is all worth every penny.

Another thing to note, the game cannot be played offline. To most people this shouldn't necessarily be a huge problem since people on Steam typically have internet access. But this does mean if the server goes on maintenance of any kind you will not be able to play during that time. This also unfortunately means if they decide to shut down the servers you will likely no longer be able to play this game you paid for.

In the end of the day, this is still a very good game that I personally love.

DJMax is fully keysounded, which is really cool.
It has solid BGAs, which is a big deal within music game culture.
The UI is phenomenal.
It isn't completely oversaturated by fucking garbage anime OPs.
It has a really nice UI.
The charts are good(!!!).
It has random(!!!!!).
A lot of the music is OST, not licensed(also it's really good).
The UI is REALLY good.

I know the concept of a music game with a budget higher than 20 dollars and a couple of domino's coupons is foreign to a lot of people, but this is a AAA game at AAA price, and in my opinion, it's well worth it.

I played a ton of DJMax Fever and then moved on to playing Portable 1st, 2nd, and 3rd on a jailbroken PSP about a decade ago. Hearing that there was going to be a localized DJMax game in the States in 2020 was a dream come true and, in a lot of ways, this game delivers on what I would want from it. The UI is snappy, the new songs are all bangers, mission mode supplies a ton of challenges, and AIR mode brings some of the best features of modern rhythm games into the fold. 

However

It is hard not to feel like DJMax Respect / V is a vector for more monetization down the road. There is a lengthy process to unlocking all the songs in the base game... unless you want to buy an unlock key from the store for real money. If you want to play certain songs from the older games (like the NB Rangers tracks) you'll have to grind through levels to obtain them. The DLC that was added into the PS4 version of the game from years ago is still being resold in V for full price. The release schedule of these catch-up DLCs has been thankfully brisk, but it doesn't change the feeling of the game being unfinished. Like the version you paid $50 has only half the songs available and the other half is going to be worth more than the game itself. 

If the plan is for V to be a platform that will eventually contain the complete collection of DJMax's history, remastered and updated for the modern era, it is understandable that paying out all that licencing takes a bit of extra cash. I think that's an understandable situation. However, it is hard to recommend jumping into the game when you are constantly reminded of what your full price entry fee does *not* get you access to. 

Also, the menus only have HUD elements for keyboard with no toggle to show versions for navigating with controller even though this is a port of a PS4 game. Just a weird little nibble there.",1595023743,1595023743,True,4,0,0.553991913795471191,0,True,False,False

DJMax Respect V is like a well-polished version of DJMax Respect for PS4. They replaced Arcade mode with Air mode, added a new 1v1 ranked game mode, and now you can play with up to 6 other people together in one party online!

The songs are amazing and the genres are very diverse, and one of the biggest things about DJMax is that most of the songs have ""keysounds"" so you can really hear what you're playing which can really help.

I mainly recommend this game because of the addictive gameplay. You can play by using 4 buttons/keys, 5, 6, or 8 so It's great for beginners to the genre, but it's also really enjoyable for rhythm game veterans because the skill ceiling for this game is extremely high.

- Constance update, more than enough music to keep you entertain for a long time.
- Easy to learn.
- Can jump in and have a quick game and jump out anytime you feel like it. (Hopefully will not stuck for more than 3 hours per session next time I played. )
- Lots of up coming DLC, so more songs (Hopefully will not dry my wallet).

Con. (minor complain/preference)
- For old DJMax player might find it a bit off for some of the old song, due the key placement are either missing or different in placement from the original games, which made it feel less impact to the overall music.

Pro.
- Good thing about this game is the regular update for key placement, because when i first got it, the game fell like machine key placing rather than an actual developer/player doing it, similar to that of an free android rhythm tap game. 
But now with the update most of the key placement felt good playing it (I can't explain it, but you will know once you have played it, to which I am glad new player wouldn't need to go through it).

So far i have not run into any bugs or issue to the game so it run very smooth.

This game was my childhood during the psp days, and I've been settling with osumania for a long time now, but it just doesn't leave the same impression as DJmax for me because big part of DJmax is when you press keystrokes, it actually plays the sound of the tune, so when you mess up in-game, you hear your mistakes from music being distorted and what not. Absolutely recommend for people that love rhythm games. 

Big disclaimer, Neowiz has taken out some features away such as DLC sharing in lobby, and auto-sync function because of Konami trying to fuck with Neowiz, and their past history with them. I don't know the full details, but konami forced neowiz to take out some features due to some kind of patent issue, which konami isn't enforcing on other rhythm games, but specifically targetting neowiz games. You can look up for more details online I'm sure if you are interested.

Another sidenote: it has always online DRM, and ya it sucks, but for me, it doesn't outweigh the positive, so I'm giving it an upvote.

I have to say, I am quite disappointed and really wish that I had not wasted my money on this game. The interface is ok and the custom videos that play in the background are nice but that's about it.

I have two main annoyances with this game. Firstly, there is no difficulty setting, you cannot choose to play any song and then set it to easy, normal, hard, expert like you can on their mobile game 'Tapsonic World Tour'. The only thing that you can do is increase or decrease the tempo which does not help in making it easier to hit the buttons as you still need to hit the complicated layout of buttons. Unfortunately, it seems that this game is aimed towards relatively high skilled players/younger people who have quick reflexes. Therefore, if you would simply like to progress through the missions then you are out of luck as very early on it gets quite difficult and you will run into a wall, unable to progress. I really don't understand why Neowiz did not add a difficulty setting, to me it makes the game too hard, ruins the experience and makes it near unplayable. 

Secondly, if you are a low skilled player like myself and want to play the 'online' mode using 4 buttons then good luck finding another real person to play with. Every time I have attempted to play online I am always matched against a bot called D.Penguin or C.Penguin. Only once was I matched against a real player and their skill was clearly above mine, making the matchmaking system seem unfair and pointless. 

To conclude, even if you are quite a good player on Guitar Hero, Rock Band or rhythm games on mobile I would be extremely about purchasing this game, DJmax is very difficult compared to other rhythm games. Being able to change the difficulty setting is a very basic function that nearly all rhythm games have but for whatever reason, Neowiz failed to implement this basic feature.",1594396853,1594396853,False,1,0,0.472677022218704224,0,True,False,False

And while I am still happy that they've returned, playing since release and seeing the quality drift slowly downward with each update is rather alarming.

We have had at least half a dozen updates that would cause the game's FPS to become choppy at best. Anyone whose played a music game knows that framedrops are the absolute worst thing that could happen. And this happens every. Other. Update. 

Additionally, the game's DRM requires it to be constantly online, and is to say the least, a notoriously bad DRM. One that really ought to be left out like it was in the PS4 edition. 

As someone who had played the PS4 version and loved it to bits, only to see various functions get chopped in light of this version releasing, it has made my viewpoint on the developers slowly but surely drop as well. While this is the closest to true arcade-y Beatmania-esqe gameplay you can get on the Steam store....the instability of the game alongside the need to constantly shell out money for new songs gives it a very shaky lifespan at best. Grab it while it's on discount but don't expect it to be the best thing ever. 

Now that being said, I do still enjoy the game, but...I'm losing hope in it. Not to mention they changed the already substantial judgement timing so now I can't even play music half as accurately as I used to. Songs I'd get S rank on are barely hitting A rank now, amongst the fact my RTX 2070 somehow doesn't give me full frames after some updates. The optimization is a major issue, as well as a removal of functions that're EXCEEDINGLY important to quality of life, such as audio tuning. 

Moving on....online gameplay is exceedingly unstable. I also tried playing ranked matches only to be ALWAYS matched up against a bot. At any rate the game might as well be offline besides the times where I can play online without glitches reminiscent of the DJMAX Online (2004) days...if you can't outdo Osu, whom of which is free, why even bother bringing DJMAX back to PC anyway? 

Aaaaaanywho, that's how my stance is nowadays. I previously gave this game a glowing review, but after seeing everything that's happened to it, it makes me wonder why the hell did they did to a game that launched in a perfectly stable fashion.",1577615083,1594104831,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I found this game to have a limited selection of songs, which didn't give me (as an osu! player) many options to choose from.

For me, it's super easy to get disoriented by mistimed keysounds that play even when you hit the note perfectly. Most notes are short and only require a single input, but musical notes vary much more especially with reverb or intensity. What I found is that if you lift off the key too early, it stops the keysound playback completely which causes notes that have reverb to sound hollow, and results in the music sounding unnatural or off-tune/time. There's no real way to figure out how long to hold down those keysounded keys for other than to keep playing it over and over until you figure it out. The problem with this is that it was my first time hearing many of these songs and I don't know how long to hold the key down. This basically led to me just holding down each note as long as I possibly could which also affected my ability to hit subsequent notes accurately.

//For a more serious review: IMO, this game is very entertaining but learning and mastering the control is pretty tough for Mobile/Tablet and arcade player like me. For now the best I can do is passing a level 8, 6 buttons stage with an A. I can still get a feeling that I'm not one with the control.

I still find it to be within 50-100ms, which is not different from it was before. However, I do appreciate the devs' effort in looking into the issue. Unfortunately, much of the problem stems from the standard ways of playing sounds on the Windows OS, which is why this problem is so hard to fix.

v162 AND LATER: The input delay definitely has been improved significantly as stated in the patch notes. I would say it's around 50-100ms, which equates to about a 16th beat on most songs. This is much more manageable, and I think many experienced rhythm gamers will not have a problem with it. However, there is still room for improvement; DJMax Trilogy, a decade-old game, had practically zero input delay on its hitsounds, and I want to push modern rhythm games to achieve that standard again.

EA RELEASE REVIEW: The input delay of hitsounds on this game is unplayably frustrating on higher difficulties. It is in the magnitude of hundreds of milliseconds, and if you can hear your keyboard or controller in the slightest bit you will be able to tell that your keypresses are happening a beat or even two beats behind the music. I would not recommend this for rhythm game experts, or anyone who considers themselves remotely a hardcore rhythm gamer in general.

TL:DR; Game is fun, but it really is quite expensive.

It is HELLA high. Not even considering that each music pack dlc is at least 25USD, but usually much higher. I haven't done enough research in terms of the cost consequences of it being a music game - Licensing, Commission for artists, etc, but the game as a game is really expensive.

So let's talk gameplay. The actual music gameplay is what it always has been if you've played Djmax. Some songs have fun songsheets to play through, and the existence of 4 keys, 5 keys, 6 keys, and 8 keys for each song means your favourite song will continue to have depth through the difficulties. I could go on and on about how fun this core gameplay loop is, but if you're considering buying this game purely on whether the songs and gameplay is fun - then you can stop reading here and buy the game. 

So let's go into why I'm hesitant to ask you to buy this game. Since it's a music game, your preference in song choice will largely determine whether the game is fun for you or not. This is where the price of the game comes into play again. From my experience, each DLC has had maybe 5-7ish songs that I really liked (depending on the size of the DLC as well), and it doesn't seem to me that each DLC has a very specific genre it's pulling from, it's usually just a collage of songs from a previous DJmax game. So paying 30 bucks for 5 more songs to play sounds reasonable to some, but I can definitely understand why most wouldn't enjoy that pricetag. 

Normally, i'd say DLC isn't very important to a game anyway, but this music pack DLC can be important because it could contain a song that you've played (and enjoyed) in the past, or just a song that comes highly recommended by the community, or just a song that you really like and wish to play - and people will say 'ah but if its expensive just don't get it' but I don't think that's really valid. You might end up with feelings of an incomplete game, or just 'i really wish i could play that song', and so on and on. 

Lastly, I think the peripherals that you unlock (i.e. gallery images, gear skins, note skins,) etc. are a nice addition but don't really contribute meaningfully to the gameplay experience, except some gear and note skins. I won't really go into the different modes of gameplay, since I think they just boil down to different ways to play the songs included in the game. 

To conclude, yeah this game is fun. Get it, but only if you either really like rhythm games or if you have a disposable income - even after enjoying it I feel like I can't justify this price tag to a newcomer to the genre or to someone who isn't earning too much.",1591756882,1591756882,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Admittedly, the one thing I have against it right now is that ladder matches will put you up against bots (they will be D.Penguin, C.Penguin, etc) if it can't find anyone to match you with.. Spending 15 minutes in ladder matches easily put me at gold 4 just due to this alone. Honestly, I recommend it, it feels very worth the base price. I'd also recommend picking up a few DLC packs as they will expand your library, and let you live that nostalgia of some older songs in the series as well.",1591408968,1591408968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I must say I did not expect to be so addicted to this when I bought it. It feels incredible playing this, even though it is hard at first until you get the hold of it. Even though I knew about only 4 or 5 songs in the game, all of the songs present are pleasant and lovely to play. The game challenges you to how quick can you fail.

Notes about other reviews:

[b]Game overpriced?[\b]
No. DJMAX RESPECT V is not overpriced. We must get out of the shell and realize that using such songs, even though DJMAX does own some of the songs in it, costs money to them as copyrighted content. So, part of the money you pay in this game should go to the original content creators. If you find this game to be expensive, get it on sales.

[b]Game takes too long to detect pressed notes?[/b]
As an instrument player, I can say the game DOES NOT HAVE ANY LAG at all. In fact, it has one good timing about how precise are your hits. Things like these you can pick up by ear and just accept that you missed it.

Overall rating is 9.5

[h1]Engine/Smoothness/Gameplay[/h1]

As I said before, I found no lags or bugs at all.

The gameplay is simple but awesome at its finest. Within a few days (or hours) of playing, you should already see you improved a lot, enough to take on harder levels. When DJMAX says the song is hard, it is, believe me. Even though I'm new at this, I'm loving it.
One issue I have however, are the flashy BCA (Background animations) which can get you quite on a surprise. Please, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if you have epilepsy backgrounds. DJMAX RESPECT V does give us the chance to disable the background animations at any time, which is nice.

DJMAX gives us a giant set of difficulty customization which ranges from speed to quantity of things happening at once. Find the most suitable for a start and keep improving.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

The animations of this game, while not common, are well put. You might get confused at first with a lot of things happening at once when you're playing but, once you settle in, you'll find that all the information that they give is actually useful.

After trying it on the free weekend, I got instantly hooked. Whenever I launch the game I spend HOURS playing it, because it's so much fun.

Love being able to see all of my old favourite songs back on the PC. Can be a bit grind-y to unlock all songs, but you start with like 30 available (1 level = 1 unlocked song), but I was able to level quickly (likely related to difficulty). I mostly play FreeStyle mode.

My Pros:
- huge song selection & many different genres, as it's a collection of most of their previous DJMAX games
- great control over difficulty: most songs will have an easy/medium/hard/extreme in addition to number of keys needed to play (minimum 4) and the speed of the notes approaching the screen
- each note played corresponds to a certain sound within the song (ex. drums, melody) rather than a generic hi-hat noise
- menu music and animations are killer (overall visual design is suiting; clean)
- can ""preview"" music (listen to part of the song) before committing to play it
- customize-able notes & gear (the playing area), as with all DJMAX series
- all ""modes"" available in the Menu have their own unique, great music. Even getting a ""Game Over"" isn't bad and I never feel like I ""lose"", even if I don't do as good as I want
- the introduction song (Boom!) has great animation. Can't take my eyes off it. (though I hear some people don't like the song... I don't mind it, personally)
- able to adjust ""brightness"" unique to each song (MusicVideos play in the background while you play), or you have the choice to turn MusicVideos off.
- seizure/photo-sensitive warning upon startup of game, I'm glad they brought attention to that
- they feature/collab with a few better-known artists (ex. Porter Robinson, Marshmallow, K/DA League, Guilty Gear)

My Cons:
- minor: some of the difficulty ratings can be misleading (ex. one song may be 13/15 difficulty and seem easier than a song with 11/15 difficulty [that's exaggeration and I can't name a particular example rn but along those lines])
- minor: featured song when entering FreeStyle cannot be changed (but occasionally updates to a different track anyway)
- upon first play, the playing area is set in the middle. Do yourself a favour and move it to the left (or right) to see the Music Videos
- probably controller, but that ain't my problem. They recommend keyboard anyways sooo
- minor: can be initially difficult to adjust to a dead front-faced play-area (if you're previously used to music mobile games that incline the play-area)
- if you're into downloading playing-maps/other songs... go somewhere else.",1590653898,1590653898,True,3,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

-  timing/offset issues, the game feels BAD, too early and the option to adjust the offset, doesn't work

- the dev team says that problem is a high priority, but, after that comment on the official discord, we have like... 6 updates and nothing about the major problem...

also, this uses Xigncode3, a anti-cheat/drm solution was it's much more agressive than denuvo/riot vanguard also, this is a deal breaker for a lot players

well, if you don't mind for the offset problems, the game is a must have, but some people, who plays games like this on a competitive way, is a BIG problem, at least on ladder matches (because, if you get a TIE, the sudden death round is on hard jugdement, is funny because, a lot of players, gets 100% on plat division, on the sudden death match gets on average, 95/93%, all of that because the offset problems

unfortunately my praise ends here. the game uses an invasive anticheat DRM called XIGNCODE 3. hey, what gives? it stops cheaters from flooding the leaderboards with 999999 score entries and all that right? how is it bad? well this system operates at what is called the ""kernel level"" where most things, including the exe the game itself runs at the ""user level"", which means more privileges and priority to the inner kernel level. this system is one of the first things to load up as you turn your computer on. in other reviews, you can see issues people have that this DRM is causing... causing to legitimate, paying customers that just wanted to play the game, and if you are able to play as expected, the DRM may still take up resources that could go to the game, impacting your performance or causing input delay (in a rhythm game!!) 

also you need an internet connection to play the game at all times, regardless of what you're doing, so sorry if you wanted to jam real quick on your laptop on public transit. all this to stop some cheaters... and what do we get for paying for a product we expected certain things from? it is even risky to have installed and launched the game once... you're worried about cheaters, what about hackers that are looking for security vulnerabilities to get into things they shouldn't (and would have one less possible avenue if not for this anticheat system) so if you played on this past free weekend in the middle of may and bought the game in earnest, and learned these things afterwards... well

where it counts, this is a fine game and i was genuinely enjoying my time playing it. invasive anticheat DRM needs to stop trying to become a thing. us paying customers are not getting what we deserve with these invasive systems that don't even work most of the time (there are still cheaters in riot's valorant and they have a very similar anticheat system in their game) plus you can see how many denuvo games get cracked, sometimes before they officially come out

I would love to overturn or delete this negative review for this game, i hate to see so much great art and hard work and talent go out with the bathwater... perhaps someday if XIGNCODE 3 is removed.

If you want to play a mania game on a controller, most of the charts are made for that (ps4 port), however if you're used to keyboard the maps will seem fairly simple. ""SC"" is the difficulty made for keyboard and a lot of the charts in that range aren't as high quality. The main pitch for the game is in the exclusive videos to songs you may like.
Some of the main issues that stuck out to me are:
-Lack of a friends leaderboard
-No custom chart support officially, that could be a pro or a con depending on player.
-Always online DRM that installs itself as a system driver, very invasive.

After trying it on the free weekend i decided to buy it, if you'd rather a more casual mania game it can be pretty fun. AIR mode especially is easy to just hop into to play random songs. If you're looking for a game with a higher skill ceiling i'd have to recommend checking out the alternatives instead.

Because this is a port of the console version, the 4K maps (aside from the occasional SC difficulty) are all way too easy. 
There is a lot to explore in 5-8K, however. 

Some people complain about xigncode3 and the always online DRM. Although I share the sentiments about always online DRM (some people have had server connection issues which made the game unplayable), xigncode is not as evil as others claim it to be. Yes, it runs on kernel-level access. But what anticheat doesn’t run with those permissions nowadays? Assuming they want to maintain some semblance of ranked integrity (though I doubt people really care about ranked), they would be using some version of anticheat (there are worse offenders that exist).  Kernel level anticheats do deter a significant amount of easily-made cheats. They do work, but they aren’t flawless either.

Yes, it sucks that you have to download it to play.
Yes, you’re free to make the decision to not download the  game if you don’t agree with their practices
But, I’d like if people stopped the continual fear-mongering that I keep seeing in the review section.

More than likely, you’ve already given an anti-cheat that you don’t know about kernel access.
Have Valorant installed? 
How about Apex Legends, Fortnite, or PUBG?
Chances are, you already have a ring 0 “rootkit” already installed in your computer.

If you don’t like the company’s practices, that’s fine. Just don't spread blatant misinformation. For those who don't understand, educate yourself. 

Find out what Xigncode3 does and then compare it to all other existing kernel-level anticheats. You'll see that a similar amount of ""privacy"" and ""danger"" concerns exists in all. 

Unlike some other anticheats, xigncode does not continue running after the game closes and seems to actually be less impactful on the games performance than a lot of others.

In the end, 99% of all decisions boils down to trust. Do I trust this program enough to install it onto my computer? The answer is usually a questionable maybe, but with more and more multiplayer games adding ""invasive"" anti-cheats to their products it becomes unavoidable.

Pros:
+ Large and Varied Soundtrack. 
+ DLC Packs have great tracks as well.
+ Graphics and Eye candy are mint
+ Multiple Game modes and key modes to accommodate most playstyles and allows learning of other ones as well. 
+ Multiplayer is fun.
+ Many Cosmetics and personalization options. 

Cons: 
- Always Online. Shouldn't say more to be honest. Any time logins don't work or the servers are down, nobody can play. 
- Offset options don't work according to multiple other players. +0 works fine for me but it doesn't for everyone and it alienates those people. 
- Even if Offset did work, there's no offset wizard or other ways to test your offset. Stepmania, Osu, Crypt of the necrodancer all have that feature.
- Side Buttons aren't toggleable. I just think it would but a fun way to relive the classic DJMAX gameplay.
- Invasive Anti-cheat. Many games are taking this route but I'm still not a fan of it personally. Just something to consider
- Ranked placements are done against bots. Big miss

Love it or not, if you enjoy pushing buttons to music, this game is a worthy addition to your resume, but purchase it with trepidation as there may be one or more technical flaws that can ruin the fun.

Pros:
-Quality music and videos spanning a much wider base of genres than is typical for most rhythm games
-Quality and consistent note charting
-A wide library of content spanning multiple generations of platforms including Playstation, PC, and the Arcade dating all the way back to 2006 with new content planned for the future in addition to backlogged DLC from the PS4 version as of this review.
-4 different button modes to suit your preference

Divisive: These ""features"" you may love or hate
-Keysounding. The ""Emotional Sense"" tagline of games past stems from the interactive keysounds, which trigger when you press notes and are reflections of actual sound samples used in the song. We're not talking generic Guitar Hero biffs, you can actually improvise music while playing if you get creative with it.
-DRM and Always Online play model. Most people don't care, but some people are very sensitive about whether or not they're being spied on. This game requires you to install Xigncode, an anti-cheat and product authentication application which has access to deep levels of your computer and could plausibly be used to send information you would rather keep private to other people. Additionally, at this time you are unable to play this game if you don't have an internet connection, as all your gameplay information and preferences are stored online.

Cons:
-Synchronization issues: Because of the keysounded nature of the game, Respect is sensitive to DPC latency. Your hardware and drivers may cause audio lag which is, as of now, unfixable. Keysounds *cannot* be disabled or muted and the added ""Sync Offset"" option causes more problems than it solves. If your device(s) experience lag, you're just SOL.
-Sharing - Or lack thereof. Family Sharing only allows users to experience the base game and its 170-ish songs. If you bought the DLC, your mom and dad can't play it on their account. If you play online against other players, you'll need to own the DLC for the song being chosen or you'll be forced into Observer mode, which is unlike the PlayStation 4 counterpart that allows players to ""share"" content they own with someone who *doesn't* own it.

There is no option to automatically configure timing offset/input lag. You have to set this manually through trial and error, which can be very difficult.

If you have to adjust this setting so that the note charts match up with the song audio, the game becomes unplayable, as hitting notes triggers in-game audio samples (notesounds), which aren't adjusted by the options. This means that these sounds are out of sync with the rest of the game. I have the offset at +100ms, by which point these sounds are so out of sync with the rest of the track that the songs become a mess.

-Some songs (especially the older ones) have weird volume mixes, like vocals being too quiet compared to the rest, or effect notes being a tad bit too loud that it deafens the backing track, etc.
-Notes coming down at very high speeds still have that after image problem (so it looks like 2 notes are falling at the same time). It's less noticeable than Trilogy, but still present.
-XignCode (though, many Korean MMORPGs use it as anti tamper measures so i can understand why they chose it)

Other than that, the game is what I wanted, which is a PC version of DJMax reborn, with many of my nostalgic tunes added in the game, and many other songs available as DLC.

If you're an old fan like me, you will not regret buying the game. If you're new to the series, and was in the market for a decent rhythm game, check some gameplay videos and the OST. If you like what you see and hear, you know what to do. If you think the MVs are corny as fuck (don't worry, I do too), no worries you can turn those off.",1588535530,1588535530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good variety of music written specifically for the game, good range of difficulty levels, and a Mission mode that gives you a semi-guided way to gain XP and improve at the game. Lots of DLC, but this is due to this game's goal of integrating content from the entire series into one entry.

The PC version, while having exclusive content, makes several missteps that make this version difficult to recommend. EDIT: with the introduction of the Respect V DLC to the PS4 game, the only content exclusive to the PC version are the keyboard-specific SC charts and the expanded Multiplayer systems.

Air mode has completely replaced Arcade mode rather than being an additional mode. Air mode chooses songs 100% randomly, but with Nico Nico Douga-style pre-recorded comments scrolling across the background. It's interesting if you just want to throw some music on in the background. But Arcade mode used to be the most reliable way to play songs you haven't unlocked yet - you are given a list of 30 or so randomly chosen songs and can pick which one to play. This made having to grind XP to unlock songs permanently much more palatable, as if there was that one song you really wanted to play, you could finesse your way into it. Now if you don't like the starting song list, you're shit out of luck.

New songs were made for the PC release, but implemented as $20 DLC you have to buy separately. Honestly if you just made the base game more expensive and included these songs, the game would be a much easier sell. Customers nowadays are VERY wary of launch day DLC and opening with $80 worth of DLC for a $40 dollar game raises serious red flags.

Finally, the game uses the infamous XIGNCODE3 DRM often seen in Korean MMOs. I don't have much knowledge of this DRM personally, but from what I've seen online it is FAR more invasive than average, so those concerned with keeping their computer usage private may want to do some reading before installing this game.

I was ready for this game to come out of early access so that I could wholeheartedly recommend it as the face of modern Asian Rhythm Games, the presentation is just so top notch. But they've introduced so many little gotchas into the new player experience that unless you're already a nutter for the genre I can't guarantee you'll enjoy the game enough for it to be worth the effort.

DJMAX is a really fun and well-made music game, both in the quality of music and maps, especially if you are into K-pop style. Having different instrumental sounds for each note is the best part of the play experience. It's easy to learn as beginner and don't have some counterintuitive play like some other music games have to just increase difficulty. 

However, for those who are new to DJMAX I DON'T recommend PC edition due to XIGNCODE3 so basically you don't own this game if the server is down or you go offline.

Hmm I hate to give negative review for my favourite rhythm game series:

+ Shut up and take my money cause it is DJMAX yeah dude just buy it
+ Best rhythm game on Steam though minor issues exist.
+ Bug fixes come promptly
+ Yukika best girl 11/10

- Damn please get rid of that xigncode3 anti-cheat. It's almost impossible to download it behind our beloved Great Firewall of China rofl.
- That ""Loading (60%)"" issue is just annoying - I mean, why is it that hard to cache those chart files on local?
- Side Notes plays like sh*t on keyboard; Mediocre quality SC charts compared to DJMAX Online charts.
- The 15 level difficulty system is almost broken, especially on SC charts.
- The offset is totally playable after the patch, however an offset adjustment feature is still necessary.
- I understand it's in EA parse, but come on, online matching / mission should be prioritized over that dull air mode imo.

As for me I would not recommended spending 50$ on this atm unless you are a enthusiastic DJMAX maniac.

I started playing with Technika in 2009, and met a majority of my best friends playing it. Without DJMAX I wouldn't be the person I am today. I can't understate how important those friendships were to me. I picked up all the PSP games, and bought and played Respect and all of it's DLC on the PS4.

I had multiple level 14 Perfect Plays on the PS4 version of the game, and had a good number of top 50/top 25 scores. I was extremely excited for the PC release of DJMAX Respect! All of the announcements relating to Respect V sounded amazing between some Porter Robinson licenses and ranked matchmaking! However when the game launched into early access the game felt unplayable. There was no timing adjustment setting and the game felt unplayable on my PC, but I gave the developers the benefit of the doubt because the game was in early access. However, a month or so passed by and my prayers were answered! The devs patched in a timing adjustment system, meaning I should be able to play!

Unfortunately, the SOLE reason I cannot recommend this game is because the timing adjustment system DOES NOT WORK. The way the system works is it adjusts the position of the notes forwards or backwards, but the game has keysounded notes, meaning the sounds made by hitting notes on time is now offsync with the backing music. The game punishes you if you need to adjust your timing windows to fit your preferences, yet other keysounded games can get away with having timing adjustment without ruining the music. I cannot repeat this enough: THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE IF YOU CAN'T GET USED TO THE VANILLA TIMING. THE TIMING ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM IN THE GAME DOES NOT WORK. I have been holding onto the idea of posting a review here because the game was in early access, and I was giving the developers the benefit of the doubt because the game was in early access. The game is no longer in early access though, so that excuse doesn't hold ground anymore.

tl;dr: If you're a seasoned music game player, do not bother picking up this game. The timing adjustment system in the game causes the keysounds to be offsync with the backing music, making the game unplayable unless you can play without adjusting your offset, which is a crapshoot because everyone's setup is different.",1586842505,1586842505,False,3,1,0.47503170371055603,0,True,False,False

If you like these types of games: muse dash, beatsaber, and DJ MAX are probably the best available on steam.  
Theres a handful of other fun ones here, but these are the best.

You already know you like these types of games...so just buy it. Its worth full price, its worth it on a sale.

Graphics: Looks great, plays great, but I've notice some tearing on linear notes due to differences in frame rate to monitor refresh, I've used this monitor for other games like musynx and tapsonic and this is the only one I get it on. Mods that effect visuals looks spot on, and I think sharpness is higher than its PS4 counter part.

Gameplay: You get 4 modes, (4/5/6/8k) and your looking at around 100 songs or so from the base purchase. Difficulties are varied for all skill levels to enter. Ladder mode is not popular but removes the fever system for a purely accuracy level of points (score is still a winner, so breaks vs 90's do effect the outcome.) Open lobbies allow up to 7 players to play (or spectate) lobbies and you can play whatever key/difficulty chart for the song selected [YOU must own it, no DLC sharing like on PS4]

HOWEVER, the PS4 was a specific spec so timing is spot on, this version seems to have widened them a bit to account for the multitude of system configurations available. This means that once you've reached a level of mastery, you'll be throwing 99.9X's all over the game. People pretty much can PP any song on demand and those who've mastered tighter timing windows should probably avoid this game unless you love and support the game and the music.

Air mode plays songs in a somewhat ABC order, free style lets you play whatever you want, and missions shake up the game so your playing upside down with fog and every lane on its own speed.

Enjoyment: I love the game, the music is good but I've heard it for 20 years now. New content has something for everyone. Though if you've mastered the game, you're likely to move on... and if you ""only want to play 4k"" I'd probably avoid this game as well, since the game is designed for all game modes and 4k actually suffers from bad chart design once you reach like 12s (out of 15)

DJMAX has been one of the big series in the classic rhythm game industry (or as people call it, mania-like games) and this is their third return to the PC platform, after DJMAX Online and DJMAX Trilogy. 
If you were a fan of the series, and you do not have a PS4, this game should be a must buy to try it out. If you already own the PS4 version, you might want to consider first before buying this game.
If you are new to the classic rhythm games (mania type), or just a casual player, I would argue that this game is a perfect place to start with because it is easier than other more hardcore games out there. (IIDX, O2Jam, EZ2DJ, etc)

Anyway, on to the actual review of the product. It is important to note that this game is currently in early access, and is also a direct port of the PS4 version, which is why I mentioned that PS4 owners that already own this game on PS4 may want to reconsider buying this again, because you will be getting similar experience. Since the game is in early access, some features such as online play, missions and arcade are currently missing.


Pros:
+ Large library of songs to choose from. The base game contains all the songs from DJMAX Portable 1 & 2, as well as new RESPECT original songs. I believe there are 154 songs in this base game. For the early access price, its around 30 cents per song. Songs from other series such as Trilogy, Portable 3, Clazziquai/BlackSquare and Technika will be added on as DLC in the future, so buying this game will allow you to play all your favourite songs from (almost) every DJMAX game. DJMAX Online songs and DJMAX V extension pack are out now, and they do contain amazing songs.
+ As a series that has been out for more than a decade, the gameplay is solid. There are keysounds for almost every songs, and the fever system is satisfying.
+ AIR Mode is a nice addition. When it was initially announced, I was not sure what was the point of this; After using it I'm beginning to enjoy it. You can leave the game with AIR Mode in the background to use as a radio, and when you hear a song you want to play, just switch to the game and start playing. It allows you to play this game without pressure, casually while doing other things.
+ It has difficulties that cater to everyone, including beginners to veterans, except for the top tier players. If you have played other more hardcore games like EZ2DJ, IIDX, O2Jam, and you are really good at them, this game might feel easy for you. The judgement is less strict compared to those, and the patterns aren't nearly as crazy. However, this is good for new players, and I would recommend this as a first title to get if you are looking to try out classic rhythm games (mania-type). The SC Patterns and level 14/15 patterns are still challenging enough for 95+% of the population out there, and there are hundreds of patterns ranging from level 1 - 13 that allows beginners to slowly train themselves. If you feel like you are up to the challenge, you may challenge yourself against others in the ladder mode, where you will even get to experience stricter judgement (in case of tie or game 3).

Neutral:
* The cost might be a bit jarring for people who think that this is expensive for an early access game. I just want to mention that this game is polished, and it is 3 months away from launch with more than half the gameplay features already out.
* The input lag has been fixed mostly, but there is still a small slightly noticeable input delay. Now there is a sync option added in, it can help mitigate this issue. As someone who plays other rhythm games as well, the small input delay wasn't that hard getting adjusted to. The loose judgement of this game actually helps in this regard as well.

Cons:
- This game uses Xigncode anti cheat, which people may not be comfortable with. I guess it is to protect the integrity of the ranking & ladder. Its more intrusive compared to the other anti cheats out there.
- As this game is a direct port of PS4 version, there are small parts of the gameplay that might feel out of place. The side notes (big green long notes) is one such example. Since most patterns are directly ported over from the PS4 version, some of them may feel easy, but obviously this is only a concern for veteran/die-hard players. If you are a new/casual player you don't need to worry about this. The SC difficulty patterns are the ones specifically made for the PC version, so you can play those if you need to.",1577452842,1585585287,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although some functions cannot be called using the controller, and still requires a keyboard, you should have no trouble playing through the majority of the game using only a controller, which is nice. Critically, there is zero lag from controller input.
[b] One and only Downside... [/b]
Some of the ratings are seriously misleading. Ghost Voices by Virtual Self on 4B normal has a difficulty level of 4 stars. This is the hardest 4 star song ever...could give some 6 and 7 star songs a run for their money. Try it!
[b] Conclusion [/b]

Well, if it wasn't for the Online-Only DRM, I'd recommend it. When the servers are down, I can't play. When my internet goes out, I can't play. When the inevitability of years later when servers go down, I can't play.

For that alone, I do not recommend picking up DJMax. Just play OSU, it's a F2P music game. May not be as pretty as DJMax but you can play it without having to be connected to the servers.

That said, with all my love for the game, there's something I have to say about it. And sadly, there's a lot to understand before buying:
[list]
    [*]There's no offline mode and game always requires you to stay online in order to play it. 
    [*]So, obviously, until they add ""offline mode"" this game can be considered as ""service game"". It's a big deal, because at some point in the future they could turn off the servers and you won't be able to play it at all. You should understand this before buying.
    [*]Anti-cheat can scan files on your PC.
    [*]In order to unlock all songs you need to spend a lot of time. Or... buy DLC. Yep. Let's make a problem in our game and then offer a solution as DLC. Bad practice.
    [*]Developers have some issues with business decisions and communicating with community. Community was asking for offline mode since EA, and it seems they don't plan to add it. This game should be playable offline. Losing all this work and effort of developers would be just utterly sad.

===========================================

Review 2 written on 12/27/2019, after a few patches. Please read the first review below for context.

I have to avoid 8B for now, until I buy an NKRO keyboard. There's no way I can find 8 keys that I can press simultaneously on my cheap 2KRO one.

A recent patch removed the option to choose monitor. I still don't understand why they just can't get display settings right, but it seems said patch resolved my freezing issue. I can now freely switch between windowed, borderless fullscreen and fullscreen, and nothing will freeze. You can also work around the inability to choose monitor, by:
1. switch to windowed mode
2. drag window to desired monitor
3. switch to fullscreen again

Since most things now work (my dumb keyboard excluded), I can finally recommend this game. They ported Respect charts into Respect V, which were intended for gamepads, but also add new SC charts intended for keyboards. Initially I didn't like that, because most Respect charts are way too easy for keyboards, but with the way they define difficulties they can have Respect V properly support gamepads, while still setting clear expectations on what you should and shouldn't touch while using them. That's kinda clever, actually.

I now intensely look forward to the much hyped online modes. Please don't disappoint us!

===========================================

First review written on 12/18/2019, 1st day of Early Access. I will keep this review up to date as the game is being updated.

After 11 years, almost 12, one of the best rhythm game series on this planet finally returns to PC. Sadly the current version has a plethora of major issues, so I can't recommend it yet. Let's give them time; Neowiz is the company that turned TAPSONIC BOLD from a mediocre mobile port to a full-fledged PC game in a few months, and I have faith they can do the same kind of miracle makeover with RESPECT V.

Issue: switching from fullscreen to borderless window freezes my entire PC. When this happens even Ctrl+Alt+Delete does nothing. Respect V seems to be built in Unity, which should handle display settings pretty well, so I have no idea how this can be an issue at all.

Workaround: Open properties of the main executable, go to compatibility settings, and disable fullscreen optimizations.

Issue: the default key mapping is horrible. I don't know how the devs intended us to assign fingers to the default keys: thumbs on C< and index fingers on DL, or index fingers on C<, thumbs on space and middle fingers on DL. If former, my thumbs are too close to the index fingers and my hands hurt badly. If latter, who the heck uses middle fingers for the innermost lanes? Either way I hate the default mapping. Also cheaper keyboards can't register more than 2 simultaneous key presses if ; or ' is involved.

Workaround: my current setup is WERIOP for regular lanes and VM for LR lanes. This is the best mapping I can think of, that still uses index fingers for the innermost lanes, and all 6 regular keys can be pressed at the same time. To press all 8 keys I probably need a better keyboard.

Issue: Air mode is advertised as a radio mode, but I don't think it's an actual radio. From what I observe I think the game chooses songs locally, and downloads other players' comments from the past. It's completely asynchronous.

Issue: the anti-cheat software that comes with the game, xigncode3, doesn't sound too friendly. I heard it's essentially a rootkit?!

Issue: no way to adjust timing. Devs seem to imply there are patents on this?!",1576737282,1584294197,True,0,0,0.518248140811920166,0,True,False,False

The game is playable state now. changed review to ""Recommend"", but well.. not exactly.

Keyboard is main controller now, but this game still haunted by playstation controller. side lane and 8-key layout is just unbearable. I still don't know why they removed arcade mode. freestyle combo-grinding is painful(oh, they keeping this stupid system since DMP1).

if you can go through all of this, this game is not-so-bad music game experience.

basically EA of DJMAX V is for testing new ""AIR"" mode only. another contents(like mission mode from PS4 version) are missing. sometimes sync feels a bit off, and game balance is not fully adjusted; judgement is too generous for keyboard, which can be issue for veteran music game players. some minor issues too.

DJMAX Portable 2 was the game I played the most on PSP years ago. I loved it so much that I bought this game in expectation of new content. Old tracks were obviously in the game. Art? It's aesthetically pleasing. But new tracks? Lacking. None of the new tracks have sound effects bound to the keys. For a massive ""rhythm game"" franchise, DJMAX Respect V delivers absolutely NOWHERE near ""unrivaled rhythm game experience""; one might as well call it a duplicate of old DJMAX games with a sprinkle of new songs and designs. Moreover, this game comes with an anti-cheat program, a.k.a 'XIGNCODE3 ROOTKIT', which undermines your security system. And to top it off, DJMAX Respect V is poorly optimized for competitive gaming. In other words, if you are playing it on a non-gaming laptop/desktop, don't expect smooth performance during ranked games. 

DJMAX Respect V is just a heap of pre-existing tracks and a few new ones (void of sound effect) slapped together sold at a disgusting price of 50 US dollars. Why should anybody play this game when they could revisit the old DJMAX series or even better, play OSU which is free? This is a harsh review for an early access game but for Respect V to meet its price value, it should put more effort into new tracks and better the optimization and ""anti-cheat program"". 

Tl;dr - Bad computer/laptop or concerned with XIGNCODE3 ROOTKIT? Don't buy. 
           Played all DJMAX series and expect something fresh? Don't buy.

After seeing the full release of the game and the pricing of DLCs, I am going to change the review from ""positive"" to ""neutral"". The DLC packs are really expensive and I am not sure if they actually worth that much money with that amount of content. I am more doubtful that Neowiz is turning this game into a money-grabbing microtransactions-infected game.
However, I still think that the base game worths that amount of money they ask for when on sale.

===================================================

The game is alright, just as what you would expect from a DJMAX game.
It comes with 4/5/6/8 buttons mode, each with at least 1 (usually at least 2) and at most 4 difficulties.

The real problem is the ""Unlock Song Pack"" DLC

Although the game has a lot of free songs (162 songs as of 6 Jan 2020) and the dev seems to add new songs to the game quite frequently, not all the songs are available to play right after you purchase the game.
You will need to put time on playing the game and unlock these songs (98 songs to be precise) with each level up.

Some people argue that this DLC saves their time, and also I know that this DLC exists in PS4 as well. But this kind of ""create a problem and sell you the solution"" is exactly why I may hold off recommending this game to everyone.
You've already paid 40USD for this game and I see no reason on why charging more to unlock what we, as a consumer, should be entitled to.

I am more than happy for song pack DLCs, those require additional efforts for the developer to create and I am glad to pay for their hard work (also DJMP3 DLC when), but the ""Unlock Song Pack"" is really unacceptable to me.",1576750449,1584087786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an easy buy, at full price, for any lover of rhythm/music games. First, know that it's part of a long series of games with a lineage more than 20 games deep (portable systems, mobile, arcade, pc) and you don't make it to 20+ games without doing something right. What is it they do right? The music.

The mechanics are fine, hit buttons in time to the onscreen notes, lots of difficulty levels to add more notes and special modifiers, lots of ""gear"" to equip to give power ups (or power downs for extra points)

But the music is where it really shines. This series has always had a great track record in picking catchy music, often with strong inspirations from a variety of genres including pop, kpop, funk, grunge, metal, and even classical (and more) though there is a bit more of a bias in the kpop direction: don't worry, they're catchy, addictive, will take over your mind and become many of your favorites. Being a late-stage entry into the series, they also have a deep back catalog to draw on. In addition to plenty of new entries, the game is sprinkled with many of the best entries from prior games. 

I hesitated to buy, even at 20% off, because I wasn't quite in the mood for a music game at the moment, but I dove in nonetheless, having spent hundreds of hours in prior editions in the series and so nostalgia and excitement for new modes and songs drew me in.

About the pricing...
So let's say that you bought the game in Early Access which cost around Rp.552,000(20% disc) in Indonesia
and as a bonus for being an EA player i got Emotional sense DLC for free.

Now after full release they got this Complete edition Bundle(15% off, but 32% off atm) which consist of :
- DJMAX RESPECT V for Rp.552,000 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - RESPECT OST for Rp.111,200 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - V OST for Rp.111,200 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - Emotional Sense PACK for Rp.111,200 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - V Extension Pack for Rp.276,000 (20% disc)
Total : Rp. 1,161,600 and by buying in bundle it cost Rp.987,360 (15% Rp.174,240 save)

Now let's say that i as EA player want to have the same DLC as the bundle, i need :
- DJMAX RESPECT V for Rp.552,000 (Which i already own)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - RESPECT OST for Rp.111,200 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - V OST for Rp.111,200 (20% disc)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - Emotional Sense PACK for Rp.0 (bonus as EA player)
- DJMAX RESPECT V - V Extension Pack for Rp.276,000 (20% disc)
Total : Rp. 1,050,400

- Literally installing spyware on your computer (xingcode)
- No 3rd party controller support (bye EZMAX/Daos)
- Extra $9.99 DLC to unlock all songs as this was mobile release
- Awful customer support as always
- Zero Community Activity
- Still no answer on DMP3/DMO DLC almost one year after they promised it.



The game is a barebones port of the PS4 version lacking so much that it's not even worth your time on money.

For much I love the series I can not recommend this title. Neowiz is pushing extreme predatory tactics to lower the standards and bar. Honestly go spend your money somewhere else, let them know with your wallet.

Edit: as full release, the game got lower price than EA ripping off loyal customers from Early access. They released a EXTENSION PACK (SONG DLC) using content shown in the Teaser and game trailer. LITERALLY Switch and Bait, forcing players to pay more for BASE content.

Base game: 1480 RUB
V Extension: 740 RUB
Exclusive Gear: 890 RUB
Emotional Sense: 310 RUB
V OST: 310 RUB
RESPECT V: 310 RUB

And finally. DJMAX RESPECT V Complete Edition bundle with EVERYTHING above costs 3140 RUB even WITHOUT sale...

Why I even bought this if I could wait a bit, add a 140 RUB and got all content possible or even bought DJMAX RESPECT V *TWICE* or, if I add a bit and got it on sale, **THRICE**?

Really well polished game overall with plenty of variety in the songs and difficulties to have some nice stuff to listen to and be able to push yourself to get better and better.

Like its predecessors, RESPECT V offers a sleek, neat and modern GUI, with a significant selection of music both new and old from earlier versions. This particular version has also been branching into more contemporary/mainstream (notably English) music, which is a nice addition to what DJMAX can offer to the diverse audience on Steam. 

RESPECT V comes with controller support; I have tested both PS4 and the 360 controllers with no problems (I would not advise using the 360). Ideally, you would want to master the keyboard as the most difficult music scores will have patterns that are near impossible to execute on console controllers. Keybindings are also adjustable for those who want to.

While the game comes with multiplayer and ladder matches, I have paid little attention to those features. Given the current public opinion, it might be best to just wait until they ironed out the kinks before attempting them.

In terms of community, a big chunk of the community is Korean, and quite adept at DJMAX, if not music-rhythm games. Do not let this dissuade you from playing, as you will be spending most of your time solo to unlock content, which is both rewarding and fun.

My only and biggest peeve with RESPECT V so far is with the use of Xigncode 3. Not only is this darn thing so invasive, it has blocked me from playing for the past 2 months as my antivirus kept flagging it despite being whitelisted.

For those who are new to this genre, I would recommend trying out the well-known F2P titles first. Even though RESPECT V is arguably a good place to start, the price, bugs and issues combined make it difficult to justify. Those experienced however, should give this a go whenever possible, or just wait until it comes out of Early Access. At least by then we can expect some DLCs to be released, and match the size of the repertoire available on RESPECT (an earlier version on the console).",1583177288,1583177630,True,3,0,0.54371410608291626,0,True,False,True

More or less a PC port of the said game, but the appeal is for those who wanted to have the meta controls (Keyboard) and even go as far as using 3rd party controls. Creativity aspect on how to play this competitively or casually is pretty high.

As a massive fan of the DJMAX series, every song is so memorable that you will find yourself humming along to a tune or two before playing another few rounds. As a rhythm game, the game does not disappoint in giving the end user a euphoric desire to FC or even sing along to some of what the game has to offer. 

Along the same veins as Guitar Hero, this game series follows the rhythm game format of O2Jam, Beatmania, and Pop'n Music where button inputs will give a specific instrument or voice dependent on the section of the song giving the player to have the feeling of ""playing"" the music. From the wide variety of music that can be found on the soundtrack, there are so many that you can fall in love with. From Hello Pinky, For the Ikarus, Starfish, Fentafest (from the old titles), to Groovin Up, U.A.D., Don't Die. and Killer Bee (from the Respect made songs), there is definitely a song that will get in your head for days on end. 

Of course there are some things that need to be mentioned before you make a purchase like this. Currently the song list that comes with the PC version of DJMAX Respect is much shorter than that of the console release (including all DLC) to a total of 99 songs. This will hopefully change in the next few months since the release has only been for about a month. Next unlocking songs, even for a seasoned veteran of the series, is tedious and massively grindy since song unlocks at every level up to Lvl. 99. 

However, if you are a massive fan of the series without a console, or a newcomer wanting to make this game their first entry into the series, you will be thoroughly entertained for days even weeks.",1580487152,1580487152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

having so many different styles of play (4b for newbies, 6b as a step up, 5b as an oddball hybrid, 8b for advanced play), with most songs having several difficulty levels for each style, has been great to help me build my skills. timing windows are pretty relaxed as far as what counts as a hit, letting me continue combos even if i just catch a note at the last moment (perfect-play runs can come later on, after all!) air mode lets me mess around in higher-than-usual difficulty levels, with no risk of game-overs & the ability to just watch & listen along in autoplay mode if I so choose. also doubles as a crash course in hangul!

In my opinion this is about the best rhythm game you can get without having to buy an expensive controller. There's other better ones, but they mostly require a $100+ controller investment. 

This game is a tad expensive but I got it on sale for $40. You'll definitely get your money's worth if you're a rhythm game fanatic. If you're not idk why you'd buy this game anyways. 

Feature wise, the game has everything you'd want. Freestyle is your standard mode, pick a song, play. Air, I've heard some people badmouth it, but I find it nice to just play random songs, though I find the chat to be annoying and I would prefer an option to disable it. For that matter I wish there was an option for a more minimal UI. The new mode allows for multiplayer lobbies where you can play along with others and try to beat each other's score. 

One thing I will complain about is the fact the game doesn't separate Korean and English players. What that means is you get a bunch of Korean chat in both Air and multiplayer, and I'm sorry but I CAN'T READ KOREAN! So yeah, an option to only view English chat in Air and only be matched with English players in lobbies would be great.",1579431132,1579431132,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

The GOOD:

-The same great addicting, precise, challenging and beautiful DJMAX gameplay we've come to expect from Neowiz.

-Much like the Portable games, TONS of unlocks. BGA's, Art, Gear, Notes AND Songs with(hopefully) even more tracks as DLC.

-Possibly the most diverse set of songs i've seen in a DJMAX game, with the addition of the Portable 1/2 songs you have a really great selection of Hip Hop, Dubstep, Trance, Rock, Classical, and so much more that Respect has on its own.

-Great for newbs, great for pros. All difficulties and button sets to cater to everyone's play-style and skill level. 

The MEH:

-Grind. While i love the amount of stuff to unlock, and the fact that EVERYTHING can be unlocked just by playing, it takes FOREVER to level up to earn more songs. I don't remember the PSP games being this slow to unlock music. I get that it's for the ones who've never played and by the time they get to the late game music they will have built up the skill to play them, but dammit i wanna play HAMSIN without having to GRRRRIIIINNNND to get there. With that being said....


The BAAAAAAD:

-Microtransactions. Great for getting new music, preposterous for unlocking everything. Yes some of us want all the songs from the get go but creating the grind only to sell the solution with a microtransaction puts me off.

-Poor graphic performance. Of course, this game has a performance improvement over the PS4 version, but note scrolling is not smooth yet, even playing at 144Hz. At highest speeds notes present ghosting / skipped frames, especially if you select a rectangular note pattern, and this effect is worse when increasing the speed of the notes. Many patterns look weird and barely playable when speed is over 3.5 or 4.

-x5 speed limit. I think developers don't know how to implement a proper smooth note scrolling, and this must be the real reason behind the speed limit. This is a serious problem. Do you remember when we were able to x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x12, x15 and even x99?

-Serious lag and sync issues. It is not possible to set the audio delay. (Forget to play this game in anything other than a good PC monitor)

-Most of the new Respect V songs lack keysound. Are you serious? Do you think I can always hit a 100% and I don't care about keysounds? Licensing issues? This is ridiculous. Worst of all, it seems this is becoming a trend and they won't do anything about it. This is a big disappointment.

-Alone

[u][b]The changes:[/b][/u]
-Arcade mode is gone, not that the original is great in any way, because the progression of DMR is tied with achievements instead of levelling, you barely get anything meaningful with arcade. Although it is one of the series' signature mode, I don't miss it really. 

-Air mode replaced Arcade in DMRV, but really, although I'd say it's a bit better than Arcade mode, it's still pretty wack. First of all, I'm not sure why would anyone want to chat during the gameplay, other players can't see your gameplay, there aren't that many stuff to comment other than the music video. However, I think Air will be much better if it features other player's gameplay if you put it on auto.

-Not sure why they removed the mission mode, but it will come back surely based on the trailer, it's the meatiest part of DMR's gameplay.

Everything else is pretty much the same as usual...

[u][b]Some cons so far:[/b][/u]
-The game is also incredibly loud and its volume can't go under 50%, glad to see one of my loudest PS4 game maintain its title on the PC platform.

-Default keybind feels off, I think left/right shift is not a good binding for songs with tons of spaghetti notes (K/DA, for example, that song is the definition of spaghetti notes). I think this may be the first time I prefer PS4 controller over a keyboard on MUG.

-Game is too pricy for what it offers at this stage, without mission mode and online mode, DMRV is pretty much just an OSU, all it got is a free play mode, no story, no mission, no PVP, no nothing.

-With the expectation of enhancing PVP aspect I thought they'd make song unlocking easier as well, [strike]but I guess they have to sell the song unlock DLC[/strike]. It will take some dedication to unlock everything.

[u][b]Some pros if you are not familiar with the series:[/b][/u]
-This is probably one of the most hardcore/high-quality music game in the market. With tons of original songs and music videos to enjoy.

-Unlike maybe 99% of the music games in this generation that use generic notes sound, this game's notes' sound effects sampled from the song you play, so you can actually ""play"" the music.

-It even runs on final destination mode, items, combos and special effects does not grant extra scores, it's all about the note accuracy. The pros of this are that it helps to keep the game fun when you are playing against a high-level player since all songs/difficulties have the same max score of 300,000 (without counting fever). But that's a pro for multiplayer mode... Which the game does not have at this stage.

[u][b]Summary:[/b][/u]
Overall its quality surplus most of the music games out there, DMRV feels like something more professional compare to other mobile music game ports on steam. So if you interested in music game its simply a must buy, there are nothing like it, nothing ever come close to it in the long history of MUG.

For fans, if you got a DMR on your PS4, maybe wait for a while until they release more modes. Although it is quiet excited to see Djmax again on PC, it's basically a worse version of the original for now.",1578800835,1578801857,True,2,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

This also applies to the PS4 version, really DJMax Respect is a game best enjoyed with both versions since each is its own unique experience that pays homage to DJMax's history on both PC and console and you really need both for the full experience.

The only major downside at the moment is the inability to sync your leveling progress between the PS4 and PC versions which can make regrinding for all the songs a bit annoying but at the very least you can DLC your way out of it now like you could on PS4 (and is my prefered way of doing things since the song unlock system in Respect quite frankly sucks)

DJMax is a lesser known but long-running rhythm game franchise that has had some experience in PC, but never at an international level like this (and with less hoops to jump through to play).  While Respect has been out on PS4 for some time now, this version for Steam brings a lot of its own reasons to buy, including a few new songs as well as being able to play with a keyboard again!  Even in early access while there's a couple less modes at this time, it offers a TON of content being only second in track selection with recent notable ryhthm games to the monstrous Project Diva Future Tone.  With well over 100 songs and tons of different note charts, even offering a quick but useful tutorial to get new people up to speed, this is a must purchase for anyone into rhythm games, and likely even if you own Respect on PS4 (as did I).",1578196391,1578196391,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't let that price tag scare you: as a rhythm game, it's one of the most high quality and polished experiences available on the market, with [b]over 160 songs[/b] (without even counting any DLC), background videos and several charts for each song, and tons of unlockables. The game is also really fun to play with controller.

It's one of the few games that uses actual keysounds for its songs (which means you're playing the actual instruments of the song as you play), so although you will hear your failures much more than in other games, it becomes much more satisfying to clear a song perfectly making it sound correctly.
The sound and input sync aren't 100% perfect right now but it's close enough that if you wear headphones the latency should be unnoticeable. A few modes are also missing with it being Early Access and all - mission mode and online are expected by the time of the full release. Developers have been very responsive to fixing bugs in a timely manner so far. An interesting point is that although steam cloud support is not shown, the game syncs your scores to its own cloud so you don't have to worry about losing your progress.

All that said, there are two major points about this game you should be aware of before buying it:
-This game uses [b]Xigncode3[/b] as anti-cheat. The full implications of this software are up to you to research, but if you were hoping on running this on MacOS or Linux, you're out of luck for this reason.
-This game uses [b]Always-Online DRM[/b]. What this means is not only that you can't play offline (which is extremely inconvenient as it is, given that the game should work just fine offline like the PS4 version does), but also that the company behind the game (NEOWIZ) is in full control of one day closing the servers (or banning you), in which case you'll be left with absolutely nothing, as the game you paid for won't work at all. This is actually something that already happened many times in the past with NEOWIZ's games.

To wrap up, the game is amazing, and if you love rhythm games it's absolutely a must-buy. Just keep those two points in mind, though.",1578182533,1578182533,True,15,0,0.641720473766326904,1,True,False,True

I have to say it did not disappoint, the song selection is pretty broad and the game play is smooth. However, in its current early access state, it does not have missions or multiplayer, which might be a turndown for some, but I mostly stay in freestyle so it wasn't a big deal for me.  

Songs can be unlocked by simply leveling up and the grind is not too bad, as you can open up AIR mode and leave it in the background which will let you level up. You also have the option of buying the ""Unlock pack DLC"", which is a nice option for those who don't want to grind at all.  

Definitely recommended for DJMAX fans and those who are looking to get into rhythm games. However, for owners of the PS4 RESPECT title, IMO this is somewhat similar so you might want to think twice if you are looking for something different.

Instead of telling you how awesome this game already is, because you know that already...I will instead give you some tips on how to enjoy playing this awesome game:

Regardless of which key mode you go with, always remember to relax your arm and fingers while lightly resting them on the buttons of the keyboard.

You will know you are playing the game wrong when you arms and fingers tense up to keep up with the faster bpm songs...pause the game, take a deep breath, relax and then resume or restart the song.

Don't worry about missing notes while playing in a relaxed manner, with practice you will eventually pick up technique and start strumming those keys with ease as you relax your way to a max combo.

So just remember to relax, loosen the arms and fingers, don't stress the key presses just lightly depress, relax and enjoy. That's the best way to play DJ Max Respect.

With that, peace out and enjoy yourself.",1578122883,1578122883,True,1,0,0.479539662599563599,0,True,False,True

Plenty of achievements to get and collectibles like music videos and illustrations.

It is also only in early access at the moment so there is much potential along the way towards the full release.

- A more casual mode called AIR where songs are played continuously but you can take a break anytime by entering chat
- Online leaderboards

Pros:
- Huge song list.
- Fun and challenging charts, with the new addiction of SC charts. I play rhythm games all the time, and I had to retry a few of the most difficult songs to pass them. They are challenging enough in my opinion.
- Ranking system based on letter grades and max combos.
- The new background animations are beautiful.
- New songs being added for RESPECT V only, and many of them are well-known songs from musicians such as Marshmello, Porter Robinson, etc.
- 8K mode is a unique and exciting experience for advanced rhythm game players.
- A ton of collectibles, achievements, and the level system makes the game fun and interesting.

Cons that won't be changed:
- In 8K, the side notes are a bit clunky and uncomfortable to play. They occur sometimes uncommonly and took me a long time to get used to.
- Some backgrounds are pretty bad, with one that flashes black and white intensely that made me want to quit the song because it got really annoying.
- Have to play easy charts in order to get 100% master rating for rankings, but the ""easy"" charts are not too tedious in 8K mode.

Cons that can be changed:
- Lack of ranking system mode and missions
- There isn't a way to organize the large quantity of music by music artist, difficulty, etc;
- Freestyle mode defaults to 4 Button Mode every time no matter what mode you played previously. It also resets to ""Normal"" difficulty every time you change songs, which can get annoying.

But I have to say a few words about DJMAX.

I've been playing these games since high school, when I picked up a used copy of Fever for my PSP. I played that every day and every night. Then came Portable 3, Technika Tune, and those mobile ones - plus Respect PS4. 

Now, finally, DJMAX hits PC in the West for the first time (it's been a PC series in Korea for years.)

It's impossible to overstate how good this game is. It has absolutely flawless rhythm gameplay, a tracklist that offers something for truly everybody, and an addictive leveling and unlock loop to keep you hooked. But there's something that's always elevated DJMAX for me, and that's in its music videos. There are dozens upon dozens of self-contained little stories here - ones that often stick with me, even being only around two minutes long. Parts of this game and its predecessors have become an ingrained part of my consciousness that I carry with me. How many games can say they offer that?

Anyway. As a lifelong rhythm gamer, DJMAX is as good as it gets, and Respect V is a stellar version of an already-great game. With promised post-launch support, I have faith that this thing'll only get better.",1577684247,1577684247,True,20,3,0.687550604343414307,0,True,False,True

this game is in early access for a reason. Several of the features touted are not available.

The game includes Xingcode3 Rootkit anti-cheat, which installs and scans files without you agreeing.

The game suffers from bad input delay on a case-by-case basis and the devs say they are working on a fix, will update review when or if it ever happens. (Sync issues apparently have been addressed, but not hardware issues so this might be a problem depending on your setup.)

I find the current price to be too high knowing from the ps4 version that most of the game's content is going to be coming as paid DLC. The total content is not going to be worth the total price in my opinion. The game also currently has much less content than the ps4 release.

But there is this thing that bugs me, you have to know that this game has a rootkit installed in it; it's called Xingcode 3. Basically, it's an anti-cheat/hack that forces you to be online at all times to play and compiles info about your PC, it can even scan files in your computer without your permission as well. I won't dawdle about what it does specifically because there are a few reviews explaining it. Please, [u][b]remove it[/b][/u], if you do so, I'll gladly change this review.

About the content, it's almost the same as vanilla DJMAX Respect on PS4 with the selection of songs, there are a few more for this release and some other free songs planned for the future. But this version doesn't have the missions, arcade mode and the online mode (yet). Besides, the new AIR mode isn't motivating to play or a great feature, I played like 10 songs and then left it in autoplay to unlock illustrations and such, never cared about it again.

Also, I think it's really pricey for an early access game, it's the same as the vanilla one and doesn't even have the same features. I suggest you buy it on sale for at least a half with the current state of the game or wait for the full release, if they remove the rootkit that is.

All said, this is a genuinely good game in general, it may be the best rhythm game in my opinion and I'm truly optimistic about the future of this game, I just hope the developers listen to the people who are not happy with the anti-cheat intruding their privacy.

Kidding aside, it's great that DJMAX is finally back on PC. Already bought the PS4 version and put in tons of hours on it. The PS4 version has an immense amount of songs on the base game (plus DLC) which means you'll never be starved for content.

Despite being in early access, I can already see that it's still the same game but with some added features and songs. The addition of songs from some popular mainstream artists like Porter Robinson and Marshmello is a great addition.

With over 150 songs and future collabs. This rhythm game won't dissapoint but if you want a GOOD rhythm game for free, go play Osu.

The game offers (Early Access):
-Freestyle: play any playstyle and stack up combos infinitely and see how far you can reach.
-Air Mode: play an endless playlist of songs that are picked randomly with the playlist and difficulty of your choice.
-Collection: See how good you're performing, how far you've reached and all the achivements and unlockables you can get by playing the game.
-Ranking: See your ranking vs others on each song or world-wide per playstyle.

Pros:
-Every song has keysounds with responsive feedback.
-The songs have a lot of different genres and a lot of them have catchy beats that you will like and replay.
-If you're an old fan, all of the MVs, music and keysounds were remade to sound up to date.
-They'll be adding songs and updates for free as improvement goes on.
-The game doesn't demand absurd asian skills to play the game. It's one of the most accessible games on the early and late game. Practice makes perfect.

Cons:
-(During Early Access) The game is missing futures like Online and Mission Mode. It'll be added once its released with even more unlockables.
-There's a few desync issues but they can be fixed in the options.
-There's no offset option for now.
-The game will be plagued with DLCs sooner or later. If you wish to support the game, spend it.

Extras:
-A very welcoming community full of rhythm-game-lovers willing to help and answer questions:
-You can ask quesitons to the Devs and accept feedback during the development, don't be salty.
-It's community is very accessible to multiple countries, be friendly.
-Here's the discord if you'd like to know more about the game: https://discord.gg/eJSTz8J

Thank you again for introducing me to Yukika’s Neon, the retro effects of the MV is so beautiful. 

---Review like stuff---

Personally, the new UI with less graphically rich branding was a right move.

The latest music and accompanying animation show how far the game has come.

The current build of the game does not appear to hide any really juicy content behind hard to complete requirements.

Depending on the difficulty, some of the song might have a disjunction that tosses off your tempo with notes you will play.

The wide variety of available music allows you to look for and find other songs that build you up to tackle the more difficult parts in others.

DJMAX Trilogy on PC was punishing in that aspect, giving limited content that help you learn demanding patterns.

Airplay is another fantastic way to learn songs, you will not instantly fail and get to enjoy the music.

Another intriguing feature about Airplay is how the music is automatically chosen.

The social aspects of Airplay appear to allow you to interact with players currently on the music station online.

On my PC, Trilogy had an issue with micro-stuttering that would completely ruin the experience at times.

Respect has only been smooth.

----End---

I look forward to seeing how this game evolves as it goes towards the official release.

My wallet is ready for some of the songs I’ve been missing from the previous games.

Forte Escape, where are you?

RIP Pentavison

I'm not great at these types of games, but the songs become incredibly catchy and while it might seem to take forever, you do get better the more you play and that in itself is incredibly satisfying.

This game feels a lot easier than the previous games (I've played them all from the PSP, PSVita, Arcade Technica, PC Trilogy etc) so it's a great intro into the series, you also get a lot of great songs in the base game from the previous titles too and getting to play them in 4K with newer/slightly easier button patterns is a breath of fresh air.

I might only be a 4-5button scrub but I'm hoping to pick up one of the pro Beatmania controllers next year, who knows, maybe that will help me to break through my current barrier!

If you love either rhythm games, kpop/jpop, or you enjoyed any of the games like DDR, Stepmania, Osu etc then 100% pick this game up (Even at full price as I did) it's the best this genre has to offer and the thought of how much content there could be to come in the future is very exciting!

listen here. if you've ever been even slightly interested in rhythm games this is your shit right here. this has everything for anyone from the weary beginner to the consummate rhythm game professional.

this game exudes style and fun from the pure eye candy of the menus, the background animations and the unlockables.
djmax rewards you for the time you put in and the loop of mastering songs and getting stuff for it is absolutely great.

At the time of review, this game is still in early access, so NEOWIZ still has time to optimize it and I'm excited for what they've promised. I don't know about multiplayer in rhythm games, but that's what i'm looking forward to the most.

Pros
- the amount of songs, you'll definitely have a lot to play
- using a controller feels very good to use
- the general aesthetic looks incredible
- online leaderboards without having to enter codes into a browser? Sign me up!
- AIR is incredibly fun to play in since you can kick back from time to time and enjoy the music after playing a bit

Cons
- some of the visuals are heavily outdated for the songs from the portable games, so those can drive away new players
- no button indicators for controller (at this point, it's still early access)
- the lack of color difference between the buttons in 6B mode and forward. It can get confusing whether or not you're hitting the right button when pressing 'D' or right dpad or 'L' or X. (Xbox controller for reference)
- the keyboard timing is slightly delayed

Regardless of its issues, I am 100% on board for this game and cannot wait for its full release. NEOWIZ definitely nailed this one.",1577139281,1577173378,True,1,0,0.534606218338012695,0,True,False,True

PROS
-new songs not found in Respect
-controls are good, but the side track buttons you'll have to get used to them.
-leveling unlock system exist and leveling is somewhat slower than respect.
-there is plenty of songs but you'll have to unlock them, dont listen to people who say too little songs.

CONS
- AIR mode serves no purpose, it has no meaning, tho the first 5 min is quite interesting.
- anti cheat, i understand the purpose of it, it is not useless in any form, preparing for its online mode
- lack of songs at the moment, as i believe there will be more coming to our way int he full release.

It's one of the best (if not the best best) rhythm game on Steam right now. No quirky controls. No gimmicks. It's a straight DJMAX game. However, there are some points that you should know before buying:

 - The charts are made to be played with a Dualshock in mind. There's the SC difficulty that is made with no controller limitations in mind, but the majority of the game could feel too easy with a controller. On the plus side, You can play everything with a controller (except SC charts, of course).

- The whole game is made with a controller in mind. To select things, you might have to press some weird keys that made no sense. You cannot use a mouse to select anything. This is not a complaint or a negative side, just something to bring up.

Now let's go with the positives:

+ The gameplay is straight-forward. Notes come down, and you press the keys. No gimmicks. no nothing. It is extremely satisfying to play. It is also very easy to pick up.

+ The songs are key-sounded, meaning that when you play, certain sounds and instruments are muted and hitting the keys will make the muted sounds. This allows for a more immersive gameplay, and adds the fun into trying to hit the notes.

+ There's a sense of progression. Songs, skins and collectibles are locked behind achievements. You play to unlock those.

+ Air mode is quite novel. It is the ""free-roam"" mode on this game. You select the difficulty and key mode that you want, and you get to play nonstop. A novel concept, and a fun one too.

There are also negatives, of course:

- The game is in early access, meaning that certain features are being worked on. Multiplayer is a big one.

- The price is steep. It's almost as expensive as new AAA games. The game is already on PS4 years ago, and it's still in early access. I bought it with a -20% discount and I still feel like it was expensive. Maybe if it's on sale for %50 it would have been reasonable.

Overall, it's a very enjoyable game to say the least. I would advise anyone picking this up at a later date when the price is right.

- As far as I can tell some of the DLCs are free on Steam, with extra exclusive content not available on PS4. So Fxxking over existing customers by selling your game at 1/6 the price on a new platform is NOT ACCEPTABLE.
- Now let's talk about their anticheat, ""XIGNCODE3"", which is plain cancer, the anti-cheat program is loaded over the internet, their distribution network sucks bytedance d1ck so you got a loading screen that takes forever and as a bonus point your whole system is frozen during this process. Also, why the F_U_C_K a rhythm game would need an [b]AntiCheat that loads code into kernel space[/b]?
- Possibly due to some weak attempt at anti-piracy DRM mechanism, the sheet data of each song is loaded over the web, what that means is that if neowiz someday decides to shutdown the server like it did with DJMax Technika Q, you can say bye-bye to your expensive (likely over 200$ by that time due to the DLCs) collection

- The game lacks a bunch of content when compared to its PS4 counterpart. I mean sure Air mode is kinda cool, but where are the other [b]missing game modes[/b]?


Overall, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this game over its PS4 counterpart except the price, and judging by the current look of it some of the aspects that I hate is likely never gonna change.

Syncing issue has been patched; music syncing is about where trilogy was, which is a bit early, but very doable. Most people rush the beat anyway so they wont notice, and the rest of us are able to adjust. Game is good value for the price (150+ songs) although early access is missing some features that are coming soon (competitive online multiplayer most noticeably). If you like music games, especially djmax titles, this is a must buy. Any negative reviews are either A) about syncing and it has been fixed or B) some other bullshit that's stupid and you should ignore. The fact they got the syncing fixed in ONE DAY is a great indication that they take this title and it's success seriously, something generally rare in music titles.

Old Review: Extremely disappointing. Did they use people with hearing loss to sync the charts? The music syncing is ABYSMAL, and not even just ""it's slightly early/late"" but actually insane amounts off, sometimes an entire beat. Actually unplayable if you play with the music at all. I have no idea how this happened when trilogy and djmax online both had totally fine and normal syncing with keysounds. Even on mobile, djmax ray and technika q have accurate syncing. I have faith in djmax so I'm sure they'll fix it, but do not pay full price for this until it's fixed.

PROS:
- Loads of content for early access game, doesn't feel barebones at all
- Great port and optimization, which runs very well up above 60 FPS
- Flexibility in control; you can switch between keyboard/joystick and even remap each button to suit your style

CONS:
- Xigncode anti cheat measure which is unnecessary for a Steam game and supposedly a rootkit that scans your PC without permission
- Note calibration which screws your accuracy, but at this point of writing a patch came out which greatly fixes some of this issue
- Continuing the above point, no note offset to compensate your playing style
- Side note mechanic feels okay on joystick but awkward for keyboard user. For this PC release I'd prefer to have this feature removed
- Pretty hefty price tag for a exact port of a PS4 game that came out years ago
- AIR mode feels underwhelming
- No Arcade and Mission mode

I've played Respect on PS4 and Trilogy on PC so I compared my experience playing this game to the former two games. Overall, Respect V is doing pretty okay by providing tons of content while adding regular content coming forward. Some issues mentioned above have hampered my confidence in trying to hit the notes properly, but if the first patch is the indication then I think we're in the good hands.

For an early access game this is pretty well fleshed out, tons of songs to play and choose from (including loads of classic songs from the old games and new), all the button modes in tacked and couple of other features which a interesting. 

Air mode is kind of a quote unquote live radio channel? I think its the games way of adding a social element by either just pressing auto play and sitting back and watching the songs and comments go by (or even add a comment yourself) or playing through the random songs... If I'm honest i haven't dabbled with this element much which seems to want to be the main show since its the very first option on the menu.

What i have been playing for my first hour is really freeplay mode; pick a song, pick a button mode and play to your hearts content. You level up depending on how well you play the songs which unlocks new songs, new overlays for the notes and play screen, as well as other things. You get a good selection of songs to start with and the list of playable tracks to be unlocked is huge. If I'm honest, i wasnt expecting so many songs for an early access title. 

There is a rankings mode, which I think is the games competitive element? but i havent really poked around in that yet.

Only con I have is playing on keyboard, the menu and button layout takes a couple of sections to figure out how to navigate and control. Also a weird issue I had, which was easily fixed by rebinding the buttons in game, was to start with one of the buttons said it was a certain key but when pressed did nothing. When the game was fresh the track which it shows you is bound to ' actually is # or when the left tracks line up nicely (A, S, D) the right was more like (L ; #) rather then (L ; ') which is what it shows you. Though like I said it was easily fixed by going into the button options and reassigning it.

Otherwise I am enjoying the hell out of the game and can't wait to get back in and play some more.",1576832132,1576832132,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True
960170,60159825,76561197997973152,0,9,1576,0,383,1618604592,"[u]Initial thoughts:[/u]
This is an Early Access review for DJMAX RESPECT V which covers personal thoughts and opinions about the current state of the game. As an avid fan of DJMAX Portable 2 and the DJMAX series, I was delighted to see a DJMAX PC port when I stumbled upon it while viewing social media. Priced CDN$45.59 at time of purchase, it seems blatantly fair for such a huge library of music. I will have to judge the prices for the DLCs in future to see if they are worth getting them or not.

[u]Nostalgia:[/u]
DJMAX RESPECT V has the largest DJMAX library in the series, with over 147 songs from Portable 1, Portable 2 and Respect. Some might deem this as reusing content from previous games, which is true, however I can overlook this premise because I find myself taking a trip down nostalgia lane while playing the same songs a decade ago.

[u]Setup:[/u]
Since I've played Portable 2 on the PSP, I'm more accustomed to playing DJMAX with D-pad and buttons. As such, I went to link my DS3 controller to my PC. There are [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/90dqov/guide_dualshock_3_on_steam_windows_only/] guides [/url] online teaching driver downloads to enable DS3 for Steam's Big Picture. Setting up took about 10 minutes before I was comfortable with the configurations in Big Picture controller options.

[u]Gameplay:[/u]
I have never touched DJMAX in a long time, so I'm pretty rusty to say the least. I found myself testing out 4B for the first hour, whilst moving on to 5B and 6B in 3 hours time. It took me quite awhile to adjust to the speed of the notes after not playing rhythm games for years. Overall, the graphics and handling were pretty good when I ran the game at Full Screen 1080p 60fps. 

I have tried AIR Mode which was something new to me. I love the player interactions for songs due to the ability to comment on them. I recommend this mode for players who want to kick back, relax and chill to the music because auto-play can be switched on. However, a little gripe for me is the inability to earn progress after the completion of songs in this mode.

Freestyle Mode is probably what people buy to play DJMAX for. As usual, players can unlock cosmetics and new songs after leveling up through playing songs. Here, you can choose your favorite music and play them at 4B, 5B, 6B and 8B modes. I personally feel rewarded for unlocking MVs after getting MAX combos for songs. I might be nitpicky at this point, but I do notice a strange empty feeling after getting a MAX combo. This could be because I was used to the comment 'MAX combo, what a crazy mix!' from Portable 2 and 3.

UI, animations in the lobby and loading screens are pretty slick. It has that aesthetic, professional feel when selecting a game mode.

[u]Final Thoughts:[/u]
DJMAX RESPECT V is a game that I've purchased in a heartbeat mainly due to nostalgic purposes. Highly recommended to people who have played previous DJMAX games and know what DJMAX is all about. It [i]can[/i] still be a great game for newcomers, but with a price point of more than $50 and other cheaper rhythm game options like Osu! and Beat Saber, DJMAX RESPECT V might have troubles captivating new audiences into the rhythm game genre.

- SC Diff ares challenging. (They're made for keyboard. Hooray!)

That game introduced me into an entire world of rhythm that had been existing in Asia for over a decade. As I branched out into other rhythm game series, I consistently returned to DJMAX. Their original songs stood out from other games and the slick presentation has always been a staple.

In DJMAX Respect V, the grand return to PC since 2008's DJMAX Trilogy, the developers have managed to capture the entire franchise into one beautiful package. I have been playing Respect on PS4 since it launched (two and a half years ago), and the amount of passion and detail that has been put into painstakingly remastering and upgrading old songs into the modern era is impressive. The game truly lives up to the ""respect"" subtitle in how the huge promise to eventually release every past DJMAX song as DLC has slowly, but surely, being fulfilled.

Respect V has launched with early access and is a slightly different beast than Respect (with some new modes, songs, and a brand new focus on competitive multiplayer), it does not have any of the DLC at launch that Respect on PS4 has. It will come soon, and I hope it will catch up to PS4 in less than a year. Even without DLC, it contains over 150 songs (the entire setlists from DJMAX Portable 1 & 2 included), a great progression system with cosmetics to unlock, an incredibly detailed stats and collection corner, and tons of modes and difficulties.

Respect V has performed very well on my Asus Zenbook 2017 (without a dedicated graphics card). I look forward to multiplayer, Porter Robinson, ironed out bugs, achievements and cards (confirmed coming soon!), and more when the game graduates from Early Access in early 2020. DJMAX Respect and Respect V are games I never thought would exist after the DJMAX brand died years ago. The thematic elements of the intro video and menus represent how all of us felt when DJMAX died and how we felt when it was brought back from the grave in the most spectacular way. These two games will remain the definitive editions of the franchise in my mind and I'll never forget the few tears that blurred my vision as I watched the first teaser trailer for Respect.

- Can play on controller or keyboard and can swap between playing on either immediately
- Easy to understand controls

Cons:
- Every time I switch songs, it puts the speed back to 2.0 even though I want to keep it at a higher speed
- Input lag 
- Missions can only be seen in Collection mode but I would like to refer to them in FreeStyle so I know what I have to achieve
- Not all game modes shown in the commercial is out (but this is early access)

Personally, I love the game and can see myself playing it for a while, but there are problems. If it was easier to see the missions to unlock certain songs when hovering over the song, it'd be convenient or just see in general how I can unlock my favorite songs rather than just aimlessly playing then going back to collective and back the FreeStyle. The only mission I have trouble with is keeping a combo over 50K+ (which continues to go up I'm assuming), because I think an average rhythm game player might see that as intimidating and think ""No way can I do that."" Playing that much is exhausting, but at least when you restart a song, your combo stays where it was.

Advice tho: if you're not used to playing with a controller, please take a break. You can start feeling cramps in your hands when playing on controller for a long time. 

Overall, love the game but hope UI gets adjusted for an easier time to know what the player has to do to unlock songs.

Thus if you find the game too easy on the hardest songs I would recommend trying to play with a controller for more of a challenge.

I never got to play it on the PS4 cause I didn't have one at the time and I'm glad to see it come to the PC (I played Neowiz's other mobile rhythm games but it's not the same). For the price for EA there's a lot of content at launch in terms of songs. This is an Early Access review but I don't regret getting it at all. 

I played Trilogy and DJMax Fever a lot and it is different; Since it's Early Access I already assumed there will be bugs and technical difficulties that it looks like people are complaining about already (And it seemed like they knew but decided to buy it anyways). The judge timing is different; At least from Trilogy and I'm not sure because of how the game was done this time around, a bug, or I just suck. (So it seems people are complaining about this, but there are already people getting crazy scores with no problem, so at this point I'm just going to say get used to it or what the internet says 'Git Gud'). It's missing tons of modes (Arcade, Online) but it makes sense for Early Access but apparently the game full launches in a couple months with online to come out before.

You know what; At least the team is pretty active in their discord and already addressed a small bug patch earlier this morning. I will agree that there are problems with this games but it's still tons of fun. Stuff below

Pros:
Tons of songs at launch
Unlockables
No grinding for Gold (Trilogy had this and it was long..)
Awesome team communication with community (feedback and bug fixes being addressed)
Good ol classic DJMAX gameplay

Cons:
It seems be to be online-only? (Sucks if the server will ever go down.. Looking at you Trilogy! At least that game is still playable)
Judge Timing is weird (Could be me, cause apparently people are beasting in this game)
Early Access means limited modes and gameplay
Why are TRACK buttons a thing? Especially in 4b,5b,6b, if I wanted to play with 2 additional buttons in 6b I'll play 8b! (At least these buttons aren't always in the songs)

For an Early Access game, it's definitely expected that there's going to be things not working as expected, like missing features, bugs, etc. At it's current state, I wouldn't think that $50 is a worthwhile purchase especially since the game is missing a lot of stuff that won't get added until later. Coming from the original DJMax Respect on PS4, there are certain things that I liked about the game that aren't available yet.

Pros:
-Good number of tracks to start (not sure if DLC will be included or available for purchase later)
-AIR mode is pretty cool, an endless queue of playing tracks
-Freestyle mode is there
-Ability to customize keybindings

Cons:
-Missing Arcade mode in current state, one of the fundamental modes of any rhythm game
-Lack of offset calibration, leads to frustratingly inaccurate note hits
-Currently no controller support yet for gamepads or even 3rd party rhythm game controllers like the EZMAX. Key bindings for the controllers are mapped completely incorrect.
-For EZMAX (or other DJ controllers), currently you're only allowed to configure one direction of the turntable, so no scratching allowed, just continuous rotations in one set direction
-EZMAX controller has a bug where the track list continuously scrolls up. Only affects this section and doesn't affect the menus at all.
-AIR mode is really cool, but your songs don't get graded (S,A,B,C,etc). You have to play Freestyle mode to get those.

The game has plenty of tracks to start off with which get unlocked as you keep playing and achieving new milestones. The song variety is also pretty good, you can find all sorts of tracks with every track having multiple difficulty levels for every kind of player. Every song also komes with its own music video that can range from something emotional to straight up goofy.
The tracklist will also expand with DLC that adds most of not all the tracks from the older games eventually making this game the definitive edition in the franchise.
However at the moment of this writing the game is still in early access and taht also comes with bugs and the like so be warned.

TL;DR
+ Alot of music
+ Variation in genre

The Air mode is absolutely unnecessary. No one wants to just chat over the music instead of playing it, let alone there will be someone sending inappropriate text, which may ruin the game.

The lack of modes makes the game no fun. We had missions/tournaments/stages before but now there is nothing but freestyle. If that's all of this game, why don't I just play my DJmax Trilogy??? We expect sth new, not a streaming-like Air mode!!

If the Air mode and online multiplayer mode is all you gonna bring, the price is definitely not worth it and the reason you didn't put a Trilogy on Steam is to, simply, sell at a higher price and make more money. I want Neowiz to make money as well but please, make a game with your heart.

I think this is probably the sort of game that doesn't need a lengthy review. If you're a fan of rhythm based gaming, DJMAX is one of the best. If you've dropped cash on discount rhythm games and ended up disappointed, this is probably the one you want. While the level of content available in early access will definitely feel sparse to anyone coming over from the Playstation 4 version of this game (which has had years of support and tons of DLC released for it)...yeah it's ""missing"" a lot of songs, but for everyone else, 150+ songs out of the box for this price is pretty high value.

For new players, people without a PS4, people that want to play on a keyboard for accessibility reasons: Buy this

Doesn't support Ultrawide monitors (would would have let you have the gear completely off to one side and have the full video on the screen at once, a missed opportunity), there are modes seemingly missing that makes it kind of annoying if you've been playing the series for a long time like Arcade or Mission (I'm guessing they are coming later), but the new changes are awesome. Air Mode where it just makes nonstop music for everybody with comments and the ability to switch between auto-play and actual play on the fly is an awesome idea. There's also a ton of songs right out the gate, which is awesome.

Biggest change that's up for contention is the addition of, ""side tracks"" which replace the spin notes of the previous games. Problem? Left and right side tracks which require you to hit your buttons of choice (left and right shift by default), which turns like a 6 button song into an 8 button, and an 8 button into a 10 button. Do you ever hit Right Shift? I don't. My pinky can't handle it.

But in the end, it doesn't matter. Absolutely amazing gameplay, 160+ songs without DLC spanning the history of the series; there's just nothing to not love here.

เป็นเกมดนตรีที่ดี แต่ถ้าไม่แฟนเกมดนตรีจริงๆ ยังไม่แนะนำให้ซื้อจนกว่าระบบปรับแต่งอะไรจะเพิ่มเข้ามาจนพร้อม
โหมดที่เปิดแล้วตอนนี้มี
AIR - shuffle playlist ที่คอมเมนต์ได้ กดไลค์ได้ พิมพ์ไทยได้ด้วย!
FREESTYLE - 150+ เพลง ปลดล็อคจากการเล่นเก็บเลเวลไปเรื่อยๆ
COLLECTION - รวมสถิติของเรา เอาไว้เปลี่ยนรูปเปลี่ยนเพลตประจำตัว
RANKING - ก็ดูแรงก์ของเราในระบบออนไลน์
ส่วนที่ยังไม่เปิด
ONLINE กับ MISSION ยังไม่รู้จะมาเมื่อไหร่ อาจจะเมื่อหลุด early access ก็ได้

ข้อดีคือ
เพลงเยอะมาก และรวมถึงเพลงที่จะอัปเดตตามมาด้วย ปรับปุ่มได้ปกติ ใช้จอยได้ลื่นไหล
ราคาเท่านี้ กับจำนวนเพลงประมาณนี้ ถือว่าคุ้มกับสาวกดีเจแมกซ์มาก
กราฟฟิกสมูทสวยงาม ปรับได้สุดถึง 240fps

ข้อเสียคือ
1. ต้องออนไลน์ตลอดเวลา ตัวเกมใช้ XSIGNCODE3 ใครมีโปรแกรมโกงติดเครื่องอาจจะต้องระวังหน่อย 
2. NEOWIZ จะลอยแพเรารึเปล่า เพราะ BOLD ก็หยุดอัปเดตไปนานแล้ว รวมถึงใน tapsonic เวอร์ชั่นอื่นๆ ก็ลอยกันหมด
3. ตัวเกมนี้ในระหว่าง early access ระบบปรับแต่งที่จำเป็นสำหรับเกมดนตรีอย่างปรับดีเลย์เสียงกับปุ่มยังไม่มา ปรับ volume เสียงก็ไม่มี

==============================
ถ้าใครเคยซื้อ BOLD ในช่วง early ให้นึกสภาพว่าตอนนี้ก็กำลังเป็นแบบนั้นครับ
แค่มีเพลงให้เล่น มีแรงก์ให้ดู มีโหมด AIR ให้เปิดเพลงฟังเพลินๆ อยากกดเมื่อไหร่ก็กดได้ โหมดที่เหลืองจะทยอยตามมา หรือว่ามาตู้มเดียวตอนออกจาก early ก็คงต้องติดตามกันอีกที
ใครเป็นสาวก และซื้อแน่ๆ ก็กดในตอนที่ยังลดราคาได้เลย

ใช้คีย์บอร์ด 6B ก็น่าจะกดได้สบาย แต่ 8B คงต้องทำใจให้ชินกับคีย์บอร์ดก่อน เพราะรวมๆ แล้วใช้ถึง 10 ปุ่มเลย
แต่ถ้าต่อจอย (ผมใช้ PS4 ต่อบลูทูธ) จะให้ความรู้สึกที่ดีมาก เล่น 8B ได้สบาย
