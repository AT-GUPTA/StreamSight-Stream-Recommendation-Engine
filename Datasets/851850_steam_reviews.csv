i tried to give it a chance (actually more than one) but ended up getting humiliated by the waste of time spent on this game.
Shame on me for not watching enough gameplay before.

A game like Xenoverse 2 still getting updates and people decide to buy this, play it AND give a positive review?

This is literally an idiot's version of Xenoverse.
The combat is atrocious. it's literally a ""wait for the cue to attack, run like hell, wait for the cue to attack, repeat"" combat.
You are forced to collect apples and fish, forced to walk gohan while he shouts ""don't be so fast!"" and then walk as gohan. And then you're forced, yet again, to collect apples so that you can feed the crying gohan (one forced tutorial wasn't enough).

People say it's a slow start, but i reached the Raditz fight (the first big boss) and it was so ridiculous i had to quit to gather my thoughts as i had real trouble figuring out if this was for real. i played on Hard, but i bet it's the same on all other difficulties. You are given a time window to attack, need to run before you finish your combo (or you get knocked back), wait for the enemy to finish his attacks, go back to step 1. This is it. This is literally the combat system.
Oh, and don't worry about having to do this all over again.. Your savegame data has a high probability of getting deleted because there's some issues between the local saves and the Steam Cloud. Just go check the discussion forum, you won't miss it.

Again, how can this game have so much positive attention when there's games like Budokai tenkaichi (ps2 era!) and Xenoverse??


Damn you all for making games like these stand out. Probably the same folk that mass-bought The Day Before, just because their favourite streamers told them to.

i can't believe i spent 15 euros on this, geezus (i can't even imagine what goes through one's mind to give full price for this).

My bias: i'm 30 years old and i've played Dragon ball games since the Sega Genesis.

[b] Pros [/b]
- The story very closely follows the source material with minor cuts and changes likely due to time constraints. 
- Characters, although cartoony, look eerily similar to their anime counterparts. 
- Fishing, mining, foraging events are dotted on the map as an added activity. No huge open world game should go without as many of them as possible, as long as they enhance the core game, not diminish, hurry or force the player to do them. 
- Goku can go fishing with his ol' pals. They won't comment or sneakily throw stones at him when resting so that's a plus, at least. 
- Items, characters, events and references are explained in the Z Encyclopedia. Whoever worked on this should know that Gohan the scholar would be proud. 
- Memorial spots will convince our main character to relay his feelings on events from the original DB. Quite the trip down memory lane!
- The developers made sure to add short breaks in the storyline for the player to be able to manage their team, including skills, inventory, community boards, etc. 
- Permanent food buffs apply to all characters so don't hold back on full course meals!
- Mass Effect 1 had planetary exploration with the Mako, Spore had the creature and tribal stages and this game has underwater exploration. Neat!
- The DB wish system is a welcome addition and was worth pursuing during interludes.
- The fighting system is quite straighforward once you're familiarized with it. 
- The game is mostly stable, however I did encounter a few bugs/glitches and one UE5 crash when building a car. Moreover, I got two softlocks where the ESC and M key wouldn't register. Once that happens the game won't autosave either. Restarting fixes it but you lose a bit of progress. 

[b] Cons [/b]
- Changing the layout to keyboard + mouse at EVERY startup was mandatory for me, as the game does NOT in fact save this setting.
- The way the game menu works makes it clear the they had consoles in mind throughout development.
- Not all dialogue lines have been voice acted. Most, even long lines, have short interjection sounds added to them which is detrimental to immersion. 
- Autosave without multiple backup auto saves and no F5 quicksave.
- For food items there is no ""cook all"" or ""eat all"" option. You need to do one thing at a time. Pointless time waster, if you ask me.
- Relatively slow start-up time. The fastest I could get in-game was 51.2 seconds. This did not include switching the keyboard layout or checking for the last saved game.
- Guru's lip animations are funny and sad at the same time. 
- Power levels, at times, can be quite inaccurate. Krillin at lvl 22 had slightly more BP than Gohan at 28 (post Guru) or Piccolo with more BP than Goku right after Trunks showed up. 
- Activating powers from the skill tree sometimes fails and the action must be repeated.
- Support characters can get stuck sometimes while trying to get to you. Very minor issue, but the glitchy sound they make is amusing.",1708808236,1708808236,True,4,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

This game pays a great homage to the anime and does so very well while integrating a robust fighting mechanic that always keeps you on your toes. While it does get very easy after a while, the sense of stake through storytelling always makes the fights interesting, especially in the latter part of the chapters. Through world exploration and town vendors, you can find materials and ingredients for recipes to craft various food recipes and other things. This mixed with character progression makes this very much an RPG style of fighting game, and i love it for that. My biggest problem is that the game does a very poor job of explaining its many mechanics. It sort of throws everything at you all at once and very soon you start to forget things you learned previously and they never come back to it, Some of these systems are hidden away very well too,  where if you don't look at the legend for input commands in the bottom of menus you can miss very important upgrades etc. Apart from that I'm enjoying this game, mostly because i enjoyed the anime as a child in the late 90's.",1708374449,1708374449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its a retelling of basically the entirety of Dragon Ball Z from start to finish where you play as multiple characters across all of the arcs. The game features a semi open world with different ""realms"" that give the illusion you are in an open world. You are usually pretty free to explore these whenever you'd like but sometimes the game will prevent you from exploring and force you to continue the story. There is a LOT of fan service in this game. It features a very much appreciated, but albeit lengthy encyclopedia that has basically every piece of DBZ lore in it. The combat is very similar to how Xenoverse feels, which isnt a bad thing considering the combat in that game is very solid. The battles you will encounter while doing the main story are very nice but they will include a lot of gimmicks to prevent you from just consistently doing combos and whaling on the opponent which I'm not huge on but it really isnt that bad. The sound design is beautiful. Almost every action you do sounds exactly like how it was in the show, from teleporting to flying to firing energy beams, they all sound wonderful.

I wanted to love this game so much i tried and tried. The good? it tells the story well, combat is decent, challenging enough and thats about it.

Now onto why i struggled with this one. While the game tells the story well, meaning fills in the details well, thats about it. My god, the voice acting, the horror, i mean idk if this is how DBZ is in the anime but its awful, emotionless, cringe worthy at times. The cut scenes... what the hell, sure they can look good at times with all the cool effects but it feels like a fan made project at times, things just seem off like there missing something. Maybe its emotion, it just feels super stale and like they didnt even bother trying to animate properly. [h2]The graphics..[/h2] look i get this is a anime, but this is Nintendo switch like graphics, i read they did a remaster on console, guess they dont care about PC fans. Speaking of not caring about fans, bought the ultimate edition and then they drop a new sub story that i have to pay more for. [h2]Open world[/h2], this is easily the WORST open world game ive ever played, you thought ubisoft was bad? wait till you try this. It consists of side quests which feel incredibly meaningless that will forever be locked behind story progression with no way to go back besides restarting so make sure as you progress through each main mission you check. They hint at this but dont make it out right clear. Leveling youre characters pretty much consists of progressing the story, doing side quests, skill challenges to unlock occasional skills, and flying around grabbing orbs... ive never been so bored. Most of the time youll just progress through a mission and then bam youve leveled 7 times all of sudden. Theres enemies throughout the map but there just simply battles or there juiced health and damage versions of the same simply creatures with a pokemon like spotting system. Theres enemy bases on the map to destroy... with no enemies.. at least early on. All you get is some meaningless items, like a 10 min boost to stats. You unlock skills with no other then the ORBS right on.

Id steer clear of this one unless maybe youre a hardcore fan of DBZ.",1707982449,1707982449,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game's Steamdeck compatability rating of ""Unsupported"" is simply wrong. The fact is, DBZ Kakarot works absolutely flawlessly on ALL Steamdeck models (standard and OLED) and has done since day one of the Steamdeck's release back in February 2022.
Why CyberConnect2, Bandai Namco or Valve didn't list Kakarot as ""Verified"" from the beginning, or at the very least update it to that in the past two years, is confusing to say the least.

As for my thoughts on the game itself:
It's great and I definitely recommend it, especially to other DB fans (but then they most likely already bought the game and all of its DLC by now). The gameplay is fun and the combat can get challenging provided your not overlevelled. The overworld is... fine - not bad, but not great, does a perfectly good job of tying the gameworld together. All of that being said, almost all DLC for the game is grossly overpriced, especially given the miniscule amount of content in each ""major"" DLC pack. As a result, all of the DLC should have, in my opinion, just been part of the base game. This goes double for the final DLC, 'Goku's Next Journey' (still to be released at time of writing), which is just the final, very short, arc of DBZ. To state that more clearly, DBZ Kakarot, the game intending to tell the full story of Goku from the beginning of Dragonball Z to the end of Dragonball Z, does not contain the end of Dragonball Z. The only way to play the ending of the game is to buy a DLC pack, that hasn't even been released yet, over FOUR YEARS after the game itself was released. I understand completely if you want the DLC, I have the season pass 1 myself, but if you intend to buy it I strongly recommend that, like me, you wait until the DLC you want is on sale, preferably at a significant discount.

TL;DR:
-Actually Steamdeck ""Verified"", not ""Unsupported"".
-Base game great, but missing ending.
-Almost all DLC grossly overpriced, wait until on sale, preferably at a significant discount.",1707239173,1707239173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 This game does a great job of portraying the Saiyan Saga all the way to the Majin Buu Saga that made you feel as if you were playing and watching the anime at the same time. I enjoyed the combat system and it was very simple to learn. Also, being able to take out lower-leveled enemies by simply flying into them is a plus.

 My only major gripe was that I wish they didn't pad out the game with mindless fetch quests. If they were side-quests that's one thing, but some of them were a part of the main story and felt like unnecessary filler content. 

 All in all, if you like JRPGs and DBZ, I would recommend playing this. It goes on sale quite often.

Hey there, fellow Dragon Ball Z enthusiast! I've gotta spill the Senzu Beans on Dragon Ball Z Kakarot – this game is an absolute blast, and if you're a fan of the anime, it's like stepping into Goku's shoes and yelling ""Kamehameha"" at the top of your lungs!

Okay, so I lost track of time and ended up spending a whopping 75+ hours in the game – yeah, it's that addictive. Let me break it down for you in the chillest way possible.

First off, the graphics are out of this world. They've managed to capture Akira Toriyama's art style so perfectly that it's like playing through an actual episode. Flying through the skies, smashing bad guys – it's a visual feast that would make Master Roshi proud.

But here's the real kicker – the open-world vibe. You're not just stuck in some fighting arena; you get to explore the Dragon Ball Z universe. Cities, countryside, otherworldly realms – it's like a Saiyan vacation. And the best part? You can fly wherever you want. Goku would be jealous!

Let's talk about the fights. Fast-paced? Check. Action-packed? Double-check. The combat system is like a dance of destruction – unleash powerful moves, transform into Super Saiyan (or higher if you're feeling spicy), and give those baddies a one-way ticket to Planet Namek. It's so satisfying.

The story? Oh man, they've nailed it. It's not just a rehash of the anime; it's like you're getting the VIP backstage pass. You dive deeper into the characters' stories, and it feels like you're part of the Z Fighters crew. It's like reliving the best moments with a fresh twist.

And don't get me started on the side quests. It's like hanging out with your favorite characters, doing random stuff, and earning cool rewards. I mean, who wouldn't want to do a quest with Krillin or Bulma? It's like a Dragon Ball Z fan's dream come true.

Now, the soundtrack – it's like they bottled up the essence of DBZ and turned it into music. The iconic tunes kick in at all the right moments, making you feel like a Saiyan hero on a quest to save the world. And the voice acting? It's like having the anime characters in your living room.

I've replayed this game more times than Goku's had bowls of rice (and that's saying something). There's always something new to discover – side quests, challenges, collectibles – it's a never-ending adventure.

So, if you're a fan of Dragon Ball Z and you haven't played Kakarot yet, what are you waiting for? It's not just a game; it's a love letter to the entire saga. After 75+ hours, I can confidently say it's a wild ride that'll leave you grinning like Chiaotzu after a successful Solar Flare. Get ready to unleash your inner Saiyan and dive into the anime like never before!",1706082270,1706082270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The XP and stats systems are artificial and are tied to the story, so its more of a casual fun game and not really an RPG.

Beat the game in about 88 hours and only missing a few side quests in the beginning since sometimes it can be confusing on when a side quest is actually available making them easy to miss. Free roam provides that sense of speed that you see in the show when they are travelling around earth which is cool.

5 - Various incentives to play for dozens of hours.
6 - Epic and realistic battles in a brutal graphics engine.
7 - The DLCS are fantastic, Trunks and the Tournament are phenomenal.
8 - All details portrayed in a sublime way in homage to the mythical series.
9 - You can even participate in car races.
10 - You can use the gravity camera like in the anime.
11 - The characters have superb detail, the best Cel shading ever used in a game.
12 - Flying through the various worlds (there are many) is a delicious experience, you can even walk underwater.
13 - The combat seems simple, but it's complex if you want to master it. The special effects are out of this world.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I love it, It is my number 1 favorite all time game and i will recommend it to people but give them a fair warning about some stuff that i don't see a lot of people talk about even hardcore Dragon Ball Fans. 

If you are a huge Dragon Ball Fan I strongly recommend this game because it is amazing and recreates a lot of the stuff people loved back in the day of DBZ and I will say that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is one of the best looking Dragon Ball games I have seen especially when they had help from the people who made the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm game's. It has interesting boss fights, fun gameplay, and amazing animated cutscenes Plus this game as mod support so you can mod the game in pretty much in anyway if its available and not out of date, Like for instance changing outfits in the game with mods. You can also get a car in the game drive around it or use that weird mech thing that has legs that you can walk around in and such and if you bought the Tao Pai pai you can throw the pillar just like how Tao did in Dragon Ball. There are also minigames in the game too like Baseball, driving mini games and various other obstacle courses, The side quests are interesting too and expand on the lore of Dragon Ball Z that I really love. Also for those who think the combat is just mash a certain button and fire ki blasts at times just know there are different combo's in the game but don't expect it to be as advance as Budokai sadly but hey there are beam struggles in the game.

if you are either brand new to Dragon Ball or not a hardcore fan of Dragon Ball I would say this about it: as a RPG game this game could have done a lot better like allowing you to make choices in the game and have meaningfull choices and have different endings for side quests and maybe even the main story. I will admit the DLC's for this game could have done better at times but in the end i still love them to death and I can see what people say when they could have done better. Like some of the characters you can't play as like Android 18, Krillin, Goten, Kid Trunks, Yamcha, and tien. The only time you get to play as Tien is in the DLC and if you want to play the others you will have to mod the game. like I said before at the end you would have to mod the game in order to change outfits rather it being a option in the game like it was in previous Dragon Ball Games. 

I would still recommend this game even though as a RPG it could have done better and I hate the fact that the PS5 version looks better than the PC version but I will still say that this game was fun as hell and I would still recommend it to people to try it out. Im also glad there is a demo for this game so people can try it out but I strongly recommend you play this game on controller. You can rebhind all of the settings to mouse and keyboard that would be more comfortable for you but this game is way better on controller.",1704740757,1704740757,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fighting is fun, intuitive, and easy to understand. Its very fun to just fly around in all the different beautiful landscapes. The sidequests can be somewhat repetitive but there are definitely a lot of really good side-quests with great humour. The cutscenes for a lot of the actual battles are really well done and it overall follows the story really well. I liked the gimmicks of communities and skill trees in how they allowed you to gain stat boosts in various different ways - which are easier to do if you complete the sidequests.
There are some flaws and weaknesses in this game but doesnt change my overall appreciation. I think some things go unexplained and finding certain menus are hard to do - I didnt know you had to equipt some skill tree know-hows until the buu saga. It may seem like a small nitpick but there are a small handful of menu optimizations or small tutorials they could make in order to make it a lot more accessible. 
Apart from that the story is really good. The frieza and cell saga are great and find, but the buu arc definitely felt rushed as it was 90%  cutscene with very minimal to no sidequests. You cant even play as goten or trunks other than one small walking session as goten early on. The lack of playable characters is something that could be improved on, that is the only thing I think tenkaichi 3 has over this game (I am aware they are different types of games but still). The last criticism I have is the lack in diverse enemies for sidequests and even main quests - sometimes it felt as if they just did not want to take the time to let you fight a specific character.

Overall, I think this game is about 60-70% of the way there to the definitive ideal 3D dragonball game. To me a perfect game would include a similar framework for the frieza and cell saga from this game, a more interactive experience in the buu saga, a lot more playable characters akin to Tenkaichi 3, and a handful of optimizations as previously mentioned. Doing that plus retelling the story of OG Dragonball (in the style of the DLC could definitely work) as well as Super (and maybe even GT) would result in a near perfect 3D dragonball Z game.

The game takes you through every arc in Dragonball Z in a more story-driven format than we usually get in a DB game. The world is gorgeous, and there is plenty to do. It was great to relive the series again without having to sit through sooo many episodes. Combat itself is good too. Deeper than Final Fantasy 16 anyway. 

If you want to relive Dragon Ball Z in the best way possible without sitting through the anime, this is the game you want.

I downloaded this game with extremely high hopes, and I was left with nothing but disappointment in terms of how unstable/unplayable the game is.

After I had played for some time, played some of the DLC, and progressed the main story to when future trunks and Mecha Frieza fight, and right after the battle and the cut scenes with Mecha Frieza and King Cold, the game blacks out and has a Fatal error with no error code. I have tried to fix this issue, but to no avail. Now all I'm left with is a copy of the Legendary edition that can't be played. I wish this issue to be fixed for the future, but I am disgusted that a game as great as this one is left with such a brutal flaw that makes the game unplayable.

The game does a lot of things from the anime, be it filler or throughout all of Super, justice. It's fantastic because it actually makes you feel like you're in the Dragon Ball world. A lot of funny things like Vegeta having maximum Cooking because he had to cook for Whis as well as the reason of the Potara earrings having a time limit unless Kais are involved, which are all ""end of DBS"" things is fantastic. I am simply amazed beyond comprehension as a fan of the franchise.

That being said, there are a couple bits of issues.
Awareness is very important in this game - red unflinchable strong attacks are something that players have to keep track of, and if you don't avoid it, you get stunlocked. Sometimes, the game feels like it's very unresponsive to your command inputs and your opponents can't be knocked back even when you blast a full power Kamehameha/Final Flash/Special Beam Cannon.
Lastly, leveling. The biggest thing in an RPG style game is ""over leveling."" When you're overleveled here, the game really makes it known because the stat differences are insane. I felt too powerful starting from Cell to the end, even through the final secret boss, Mira. Vegito, which is unlocked through a substory, is also overwhelming stronger than his level states, which fulfills the fantasy note of how strong he truly is.

The story also diverges in a weird way - you are unable to access Super Vegeta and Super Trunks (Grade 3 Super Saiyan), however you can play as Super Vegeta 1 time AND you face him in training grounds combat. This bothered me because even though Super Vegeta isn't efficient compared to Super Saiyan 2, the level should be in between. If I can access Kaioken, I should have access to this, too, it's only fair.
Post-game content is also very weird - we don't get to fight Spopovich, Yamu, or King Cold, we just kill henchmen, which is nothing but cakewalk at that point in the game.

Otherwise, I loved the game and the post-game content was cool.",1703987736,1703987736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the dlc is meh the level gap is ridiculous leading to a repetitive level grind the open world battles just get so freaking old man. Every two seconds you’re trying to go in get something done and battle after battle oh you want to escape? Okay sure escape but they’ll just be 20 other enemies right on top of you so you pretty much have to fight. The ki needs a huge upgrade. Once your ssj3 every two attacks you have to recharge and recharging is near impossible in multi combat considering every time you stop to charge you get hit 50 times and third partied non stop. I’m really over this one unless the other 2 dlc make a miraculous turn around





So start with the bad. It’s repetitive. Way too many enemies in free roam you can literally get in a fight every two seconds and all they do is third party you the whole time so you can’t get any combos off powering up is a pain in those situations. All of the main bosses are pretty much impervious to knocknack and interrupt the whole fight making it stupidly annoying. The healing items are horrible and so just annoying. You can use vitadrinks L which are cheap and efficient in the beginning but once you’re at a million health which doesn’t take long you need healade which is stupidly more expensive or senzu beans. Which respawn every now and then. You do get a lot of senzu beans it just takes a lot of time. But you also take a ton of damage due to all the third partying so you kind of burn through those too. Fire s are a good healing option but not always possible to use youd have to stop after every fight and that’s just annoying.  I mean it’s fun and all but it’s a game you’re like “okay let’s just get it over with”",1703781484,1703968190,False,1,0,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

While I'm not a fan of some aspects of the models namely the faces the overall style is really nice. The combat system is super simple and while that may be an issue for some the main point of the game is to tell the story. Unfortunately in that regard it fails to tell the DLC story from battle of gods in a faithful manor. The DLC is relatively short and one of them is literally designed as a cheat which is kind of nostalgic to how old games had built in cheat codes. Performance wise the game is fine but some DLC is taxing because of shadows. For whatever reason at the time of writing this the game hasn't gotten the graphical update that the playstation version had a while back which is unfortunate because it could have just been a free DLC if it's because of performance. This game unlike any other modern dragon ball game has a fusion mechanic which is really nice but because the game is restricted to late portions of dragon ball and dragon ball Z as a whole you cannot use gogeta or the blue form for vegito. While you can't use the forms from super or the movies the modding scene for this game has you covered. If the devs gave us a way to reduce or remove the random encounters for some time so we can fly around undisturbed it would be better and same thing with adding a music player and making other fighters playable. Lastly this isn't a combat system issue it's a game issue in there being an end game but it not being very fun or repeatable despite it being a looped system. I'd give the game a 7 or 8 out of 10 for a comfortable review of a game that can improve itself but chooses not to.,1703719774,1703719929,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This review is to help you deciding whether you are going to buy the game or not. Please be aware that part of this review can or not include spoilers but I feel every detail should be considered. I have completed 100% of the game.

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an open world RPG game where you can explore most of Earth while using most of characters. Exploring experience is decent, with high quality visuals and details. Levelling system is acceptable, but it for sure is grindy. 
While travelling around, you can fight some enemies that give you EXP and Orbs which is most of you need to level up. There is no PVE mode like Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 and there is no training mode. The ""training"" mode is only used to get more super attacks for your characters, and those can be very challenging if you do not meet level requirements. 
Story line/Main missions are VERY good, no questioning, If you are a Dragon Ball fan you will be very proud of this game, I almost felt like watching the Dragon Ball movie, so Unreal Engine 5 is a must from now on.

Overall Dragon Ball: Kakarot does offer a great experience, it is a game to be played patiently, to enjoy the whole experience of Dragon Ball. If you like to rush, then you will miss most of the precious details. There are some positive and negative aspects of the game that will be mentioned before I conclude this review, and also some recommendations on what to do.

Positive aspects:

[list]
[*]Amazing graphics.
[*]Fun combat.
[*]Fidelity to Anime/Manga story.
[*]Very good for people that have NEVER seen or played Dragon Ball before.
[*]LOTS of missions and places to explore.
[*]Intuitive menu, simple and straight to the point. 
[*]Good Skill Tree and Character menu, self explanatory.
[*]I LOVED transformations(except for one), combat animations 10/10 , very satisfying
[/list]

Negative aspects:
[list]
[*]If you do NOT like a lot of dialogue, this game sometimes can be painful, but it is meant to be that way. Also there are some missions that will require you to keep going back and forth to places instead of just showing a cut scene straight to the end of the mission(nothing you can do about, that's how the game goes as well).

[*]if you decide to skip SIDE missions, you will have to RE-DO some chapters as a whole and there is NO WAY to save progress with [spoiler] the time machine[/spoiler], so if anything happens you will lose progress and you will have to start over.

[*]Very reliant in character levelling. There is simply no way you are going to beat an enemy that easily without healing. So yes, it is going to be VERY hard sometimes to get new super attacks in training and EVEN if you try very hard, it might not work.

[*]BANDAI decided to add voice lines to characters so EVERY SINGLE TIME you collect an item or food it is going to spam that line. No, there is nothing you can do unless you go to setting and disable some of the sound(Which I would not recommend, sound is very important for experience).

[*]Dragon Balls COULD have more options/potential to wishes. MOST of wishes are lame(seriously), I would say 70%-80% lead to side quests which WILL give you some soul emblems, but that's not something CRUCIAL The rest of the options will only give you Z ORBS(easily collected fighting), Zeni/Money (Just sell some items I guess?) or Rare Items(This one is MAYBE the best wish, because it is boring sometimes to go all over the place and collect VERY specific items).

[*]Side quests could be more elaborated, this side quest system reminded me of Assassins Creed Odyssey where most of the time it's about collecting, HOWEVER it is compensated by extra story details for the characters, which I liked.

[*][spoiler] Vegito Fusion is BAD. You can only transform to Super Saiyan, it is weaker compared to Super Saiyan Blue and of course, you CANNOT transform to Vegito Blue without Mods. [/spoiler]
[/list]

Some tips:
[list]
[*] Please take your time to complete every chapter and respective side quests, trust me it is going to be hard to go back and complete it all with[spoiler] the time machine[/spoiler]

[*] Try keeping up with story line level so it is not too hard, not required but you should consider it. 

[*]As soon as you get Dragon Balls, start making wishes, anything. Try knocking out reviving some characters first! You will thank me later.

[*] Take your time to explore and gather as many resources as you can so you save time on side quests!

[*]Get as many recipes as you can and abuse from extra stats, do not think you won't need it. It is easy as going to a campfire or going to Chichi to prepare some food.

[*]Always check Skill tree so you have everything max level.


[b] Do I recommend Dragon Ball: Kakarot? [/b]

Yes, but wait for a good sale so you can get ALL of the DLC's. I got mine for $30.
It can also get even better with mods, but trying completing the game first as it is then you mess up with it later on. 
You will have a ton of fun. trust me.

Frankly, the RPG elements are too minor for me to consider it an RPG.
Story-wise (without DLC. I haven't bought them and have no clue what they offer), it follows the entire DBZ story,  Saiyan Saga->Best Dragon Ball Villain Saga->Android Saga->Buu Saga. It doesn't offer anything new story-wise, but some fans like myself may enjoy revisiting some of those story bits.
Gameplay-wise, the thing I enjoy the most of this game is the fact that it's the first DBZ game to allow exploration this vast. You get huge areas in which you can run or fly with wildlife, enemies and even some fun Easter eggs.
The other half of the game is the fighting. While you can freely customize your characters' skills and use them anyway you like, the fighting can get pretty boring, especially once you realize that Vegeta's Technique™ is one of the most broken skills in the game.

TL;DR: A game that can be pretty appealing to fans and non-fans alike. For non-fans it's a 7.3/10, but for fans it's an 8.5/10",1703268688,1703268688,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is an open world action game with several RPG elements, which goes through the Dragon Ball Z story with few, important exceptions (Tournament of Galaxies is not available at all, maybe the want to use it for a DLC?). Whilst doing it, it gives off the atmosphere of the Dragon Ball world as well as of the different sagas. Cutscenes are just state of the art and play a big role in this. Reproduction of characters is excellent as well. 

Fightings play of course a big role and are in my opinion quite fun and satisfying, since moves and transformations as well as villains in their different forms and skills are excellent reproduction of those in the anime. Same is true also for what concerns the main story, Side stories can be boring and repetitive at times, even though they time by time reveal unknown details on the characters, which can be quite interesting. 

Exploring the world (or the worlds) can be funny as well as frustrating. It's fun because it (again!) gives one a lot the feeling of finding himself in the Dragon Ball world. It can be frustrating due to the large number of enemies patrolling the world (those fights can't be deactivated and in some cases cannot be avoided). The world also looks somehow ""empty"", but this is how the anime's world also looks like. 

Character development is good for an action game, very basic for a RPG. Don't expect anything like in ""The Elder Scrolls"" series or in other classic RPGs (Torment, NWN) or you'll be very disappointed. You can use Z balls and trainings to unlock new skills or boost those that are already available and you can level up your characters, There are a couple of elements that I found very interesting, though. Communities increase several skills and enables interesting bonuses. In order to get the maximum out of their communities, players need to unlock, develope and wisely position soul emblems accordingly to their talents and bonuses. Cooking temporary or permanently increase characters' statistics and also provides interesting bonuses. 

Graphics feels from 5-7 years ago. It is nice see but definitely not the strenght of the game. Difficulty at normal level is in my opinion barely acceptable and hardly ever gives the player a hard time in boss fights. I didn't try the highest level but I normally expect a bit more challenge from games. 

There are already several DLCs available, some of them being really worth of playing (the Trunks one, for example). I didn't like different editions and I feel like the DLCs are overpriced, though. 

All in all I recommend Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot to every fan of the anime (for them is a must have!) and to gamers that like action games with open world and RPG elements, especially if they are curious to get to know the anime's world.",1697884752,1702236766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I dont care about all these little side mechanics that where clearly added just to make the game last longer. The game tells me about so many things I gotta know to be able to play it BEFORE IM EVEN INVESTED IN THE GAME.

The cut-scenes and story are awesome and get better as the game goes on and the side stories are like the worst of the worst kinds of filler. Here's my review.

The Story - This is the best game to get the most dragon ball out of it, from the way it is presented to the amount of story content this game packs in with the main story and the season passes. This is the game to get if you want to experience the Dragon Ball Z/Super story. What would make this game even better is if they add a Dragon Ball section in a dlc so you can play as young Goku and go through that story as well. 

The Combat - The combat is honestly quite boring and annoying the lower the level you are. The combat is at its most fun when you are 50 levels over leveled and can easily deal with the enemy only going through on phase of them spamming an unblocking array of attacks while they cannot be stunned. I recently had a second play-through of this game and I do not miss the slog of waiting for the enemy to do 4 or 5 of the same unblockable spam move while they are unstunnable. Though the second play-through is still much easier as I know how to use what the game gives you in a better way. Overall the combat is just button mashing and waiting to be able to attack the enemy and knowing when to spam dodge until the enemy is done with their attacks.

The World - Honestly the world along with the side quests are severely under baked and boring. These were a slog to get through on the first play-through and even worse the second time around. You will just find yourself skipping the dialogue so you can get back to the action because it doesn't matter at all. It really does just feel like the worst filler episodes the show has to offer and I'm talking OG Dragon Ball Z not Kai. All in all try to avoid side quests and world stuff unless you want a break from the action or want to grind for levels which really isn't necessary since the game keeps you at a decent level for the whole game.

Overall - This game is the best place to go for those who want to experience the Dragon Ball Z/Super story over again and every new thing they add I believe it just gets better and better. Though saying buying one season pass will get you all the content then proactively changing the description of it when they make a season pass 2 is kinda wack. Also please give PC players the next gen update :)

Edit - Still doesn't have next gen update >:(",1579459353,1700618724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While holding B, click 1-4, etc. The problem with this is that you need those extra fingers for moving!!! I can't move with WASD *AND* hold the 'q' key *AND* press the '1' key all at the same time with my left hand, it's impossible.

The obvious fix would be to move the modifier keys to the mouse, but lazy programming PURPOSELY blocks us from using any additional mouse keys such as mousebutton1, etc. 

I don't know how to compensate for all the dual-button presses on the left hand when you can't use ctrl, alt, or shift for them. This game was designed for a controller. If you don't have bumpers 1 and 2 on both left and right, using modifier keys on a keyboard isn't actually a functional design. They built it, but it's not actually functional... more like a fakearoo designed to trick Steam into thinking the game is actually keyboard compatable when it is in reality no such thing. 

EDIT: bought a freaking keyboard... and now this: 127 Hours in, and an update wiped my save files. 

Now some sync problem between Steam Cloud and my Local files mean that I have NO saves whatsoever and have to start from scratch. 

NEW EDIT, some 120 hours later and like a year later after a fresh install.

Somehow the whole steam cloud sync thing wiped my Kakarot saves AGAIN. so... now I have to restart for a third time? Y'all really need to fix this.

Perfect example are these 2 fights back to back: Gohan & Krillin vs Dedoria - Dedoria has no super armor and Gohan staggers him very easily. Immediately followed by Vegeta vs Dedoria - Dedoria is impossible to stagger, spams his super attacks over and over and can somehow just crushing fist and meteor headbutt through a Surged Galik Gun. Literally makes no sense, in the manga and show this fight is where Vegeta gets to flex his new power and he destroy's Dedoria so it's literally just bad design to even make him so strong. That goes for every boss in the game however, all they do to make fights hard is make the boss impossible to stagger and then spam super attk's over and over, complete horse shit. Oh and the keyboard controls suck too.

Likes: simple fighting game that offers you to relive the classic Dragon Ball Z of your childhood (almost 100% faithful to the anime). The graphics are great and the animation style makes it look very similar to the original anime, even with regular gameplay.

Dislikes: horrible execution as an RPG, voice acting is terrible for non-lead characters (they could have paid Team Fourstar a pittance an gotten a lot better work, even for the leads), prohibitively expensive for the content it has, limited character playability (Goku, Gohan (kid/adult), Vegeta, Piccolo, Trunks (teen), Gotenks, and Vegito (for one fight)). There are a ton of loading screens. Every time you change areas (pretty frequent), you're staring at a loading screen. There's also loading before fights and other stuff, but there's no screen for it.

Neutral/Matters of Taste: The core game is half cutscenes. If you are playing for nostalgia, that's fine. The animation is, as mentioned above, great and feels like you're watching the show again. People who hate ""watching video games"" will despise this. Kojima only dreams he could have gotten away with this much non-playable time in a video game. Todd has loading screen simulators. Hideo has his interactive movies. This has both.

Verdict: worth a buy for under $20 if you want a nostalgia trip. It feels better than watching the anime in some senses because you're able to actively participate. If it's not on a huge sale, save your money for something you'll enjoy a lot more. Definitely not worth the price of a new AAA game, especially with the cost of the DLC.",1698521124,1698521124,False,7,1,0.580934107303619385,0,True,False,False

The downside is that a lot of the story arc had to be cut from the game for various reasons. The entire snake way and other world saga has been cut for example, with the focus being on Gohan's training whilst Goku was dead.

In order to level up your abilities, you need to collect thousands of different coloured orbs that are scattered throughout the world, which can get quite tedious at times with random combat encounters waiting around every turn.

All the original voice actors were used, which is fantastic, but only the main story quests are voiced. During side quests, npcs  just make grunts and other strange noises while the player is expected to read a small wall of text in order to know what they are saying.

Overall a solid game but I would wait for it to go on sale rather than paying full price.",1686863497,1698499543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- They offered the ""next-gen update"" to console players for free, but PC players got nothing.

This game runs better on PC and loads faster than console which keeps me invested. A lot of collectibles to keep you busy if 100%ing is your thing. I suggest playing through the main story before the DLC because if you level up too fast on the DLC then the fights become trivial and there's no challenge if you kill them in one punch.

It tells the entire Z story in a cool and interesting way, even though most of it is by text, when there are cutscenes, you can't help but feel the hype of watching those Dragon Ball awesome moments again. 
The game also shows that a game doesn't need a super elaborated combat to feel good, even though it has some annoying RPG elements (like the level farm until 300 or the Z orbs). The biggest problem in my opinion is the lack of playable characters, like the villains you fight in the main story.

Also, bi-pedal races are broken because you can easily beat the times for some reason. I guess they just jumped into every single platform instead of doing shortcuts. Anyways, mid driving game 6/10.

There's a community board where you like gift people certain items you find to increase certain stats that aren't really explained. There's A LOT to look at and decide here but I feel like if you look a little bit more into it that there isn't much decision. Certain characters just belong in certain stations.

The open world aspect is very odd. You spend most of the time there just flying around collecting these little orbs that are floating around, which you will end up using to upgrade your skill tree. The first level on one of the skill trees I saw was 400 orbs... Does not seem worth the grind. You get some from fights anyway. Regardless of if flying around is necessary or not, it grows stale very quickly. Old games in the past where you just click to get straight to the battle or cut scene are outdated sure, but this seems wholly unnecessary.

Every meal you eat gives permanent stats. Meaning if you want to grind you can just keep increasing your stats super, super marginally. That's a very odd decision but gives you something else to endlessly grind for. Although from what I saw looking online, you end up in the millions with health so +500 is not really worth trying to get.

The worst part is the combat. The depth perception in this game is so fucking bad. I sometimes dodge moves and sometimes don't because I cannot tell how far or close things are to me. I see so much potential in this combat because mid fight you'll go into a bull hell mini game, which is amazing, but the rest of it is just awkward horse shit. Enemies just randomly start glowing red so you have to just...dash away and let them do their move otherwise you take a HUGE chunk of damage. Dumping strong stun/guard break attacks onto them while they are doing this does not stop them from what I can see. With all of the light shows going on, a lot of the time you can't see that the enemy is literally charging you or doing an attack you desperately need to avoid. It literally feels like all you should actively do is your melee combo after spamming your dodge/fade button then doing a beam attack IF you get to fnish your melee combo... which sometimes the enemy just break out of.

The fights also feel like they take to long with the massive health pools everything seems to have, mixing with the enemies getting their ""red state"" where you just have to get away.

There's plenty of positives but they aren't even worth listing since I can't even recommend this at the $15 I paid for it.

The DLC for BOG and ROF were quick and simple, which I did not mind, but felt there could have been a little more.

I honestly say that this game is a great introduction to the Dragon Ball franchise but more importantly Dragon Ball Z and somewhat the beginning to Super as well. If any Dragon Ball fans (so when Goku is a kid) it does have like collectables that reference the story of the original story and does give some context to it.  The story is just the basic Dragon Ball Z story but with some edits that are good and somethings that are not. But it's mostly good change and if you are a big DBZ fan then you will notice the difference. The story for me took about 6-8 hours, just because of how good this game looks. There are a lot of collectables, like cards that tell you about the story of Dragon Ball. D-Medals which is a way to learn new moves, which are found just exploring the world and more importantly doing side-quest which aren't that hard (they'll just like beat up some bad guys or collect a item that's all). The Journal which I call it that, it's just like something that keeps up with the process of your game and allows you to see cutscenes again and also see character details. The cutscenes are so beautiful like to be honest. Spoiler a bit but when Gohan goes SSJ2 for the first time and when Vegito gets first fused. The fighting in this game is awesome as well, everyone moves and plays like how they would in the anime. Sadly the only issue I had with gameplay will be discussed later on this review. Overall an amazing game and I'll give this game a solid 8.5/10. There are some issues that I didn't like but were added later on with the Switch release of this game.
Now to the DLCs:
1st DLC: Battle of Gods: Just a simple training DLC allows you to fight Whis for items that give you EXP and grants you a Super Saiyan God transformation which that's all it really is. I'll give this DLC a solid 7/10
2nd DLC: Resurrection F: Similar to the first DLC but adds a new mode called Horde Mode which you fight a bunch of enemies and gives you EXP (best way to gain EXP honestly) also grants you Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan or Super Saiyan Blue for short and new abilities to gain. But this DLC follows the Resurrection F storyline which is nice. Takes about 30 minutes to a hour at best, after you beat the story you unlock Horde Mode and Frieza training which is hard. I'll give this DLC a solid 8/10
3rd DLC: Trunks, The Warrior of Hope: This DLC is good, honestly I have nothing wrong with this one. It's a story that is shown in the anime and also in the movie as well. But adds stuff from Super where Trunks fights Babidi and his minions. The way you can gain new abilities is also amazing, I won't get into detail but it's worth it. Also you gain the Super Saiyan 2 transformation for Trunks and once you beat the DLC, the Trunks in the main game learns it as well. Honestly a solid 8/10. (I wish this would add on the Goku Black story and skip the tournament arc with Champa but hopefully we get it in the sequel.)
4th DLC: Bardock Alone Against Fate. I think this is a great way of starting off the dlc and to see what timeline the story is going. Because when leaks came out that it was going to be the Bardock story we got in DBS Broly and not the TV special one. I'm glad that we did get this version of Bardock because he's such a badass and I honestly love this version of Bardock. I love the sidequest, the voice acting (in both English and Japanese). What I thought was super interesting, getting into spoiler talk at the moment [spoiler] I thought it was super nice to introduce the storyline for Kid Vegeta and I really love his voice actor in English which is Deku from MHA and I thought that was a perfect fit to it.[/spoiler] Great DLC 9/10
5th DLC: The 23rd Martial Arts Tournament. I want to this say that this is probably the best DLC in the 2nd patch of the DLC. I believe that everything was perfect. Beginning with the Kid Goku vs Demon Kid Piccolo Fight to introduce the new combat is simply amazing and love how the combat feels new but at the same time old. Love the story, and love how the pacing was. Love the Tien Storyline and how it flowed into the story, really enjoyed it and in the end. It was simply amazing but overall great, sadly there is barely no post story content besides doing raids and as well redoing story missions to gain exp water to max out your level but overall that is it. Either way a solid 9.5/10.
Issues:
- I wish they locked the first 2 DLC's after you complete the story because when I played this game a second time I did the training DLC and ran through the story like within 2-3 hours. 
-Also when you control  Majin Vegeta does a Super Saiyan God move, it crashes the game and I tested this out 10 times probably because it forces you to go SSJG and you have to remain SSJ2.
-If you played this game before the Switch release, you couldn't fuse Goten and Trunks to Gotenks unless you hacked your game or did a cheat also with Vegito you couldn't fused without hacking or cheating but it sucks that PC, PS4 had to wait like a week or two just to play these characters and what also sucks that we may have never been able to play these character if there wasn't a Switch release.",1647842280,1696137802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything blends together beautifully, bar 1 or 2 scenes after large story points where i can only assume the budget was gobbled up by the fight scene prior.

Pros:
🔘Soothing Music from the OG Dragon Ball Z Anime
🔘Most Accurate Dragon Ball experience till date
🔘An Immersive experience for all the Dragon Ball fans (including me)
🔘Beautiful Graphics with great compelling Storyline put all together accurately from the Anime
Cons:
🔘Story feels a little faster and shorter as compared to the Anime
🔘Some areas are unexplorable like Kame's House top area, Hyperbolic Time Chamber.
🔘Lack of an Open World due to the semi open world area

First things first, Goku's appetite is just as impressive in the game as it is in the show. I mean, I'm pretty sure the only thing that can defeat him is an empty fridge. I was hoping for an upgrade to the Capsule Corp microwave to zap those Senzu Beans and meat buns, but alas, no luck.

The battles are epic, just like in the anime. I felt like a Super Saiyan even when I was just collecting carrots and fish for Chi-Chi. And speaking of Chi-Chi, her constant nagging for Goku to ""get a real job"" is oddly satisfying, considering he's busy saving the world all the time.

Now, the game lets you fly around the world like a boss, but I've got to say, I spent way too much time looking for the Dragon Balls. It's like trying to find a needle in a Namekian haystack. But hey, Shenron shows up eventually, so it's all worth it!

And let's not forget those iconic moments from the show, like the driving lessons with Piccolo. I mean, if you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ki blast, right? Who knew Piccolo was such a backseat driver?

In summary, Dragon Ball Kakarot is like the ultimate fan service for us die-hard DBZ fans. It's got nostalgia, humor, and enough energy blasts to put the whole Kame House underwater. So, if you're looking for a game that lets you live out your Saiyan dreams while munching on virtual meat buns, this one's a no-brainer.

The controls are simple to understand. Dodging attacks at the last second just to teleport to the enemy an absolute rain bricks on them never gets old. 

Some things I don't like about the game though is:
1. In the first 15min they try and explain the entire game to you so you're just overloaded with so much info nothing sticks and understanding how to manage teams, build community boards or the importance of eating meals just goes over your head. I had to go watch some ""10 tips before you play"" videos to properly understand what the hell was going on.

2. The UI for eating food, upgrading character traits, or increasing friendships is painful to use as you can only do 1 action at a time. Each action shows a message asking are you sure, then another one to say the task has completed. Then you have to do it all over again. This was my biggest gripe with the game because as you progress you unlock new characters to play with and you can then spend orbs to increase the level of the attacks they can use but instead of having an option to just max power. You need to go through it one by one. Are you sure you want this upgrade? Yes! Ok here is the upgrade. Are you sure you want this upgrade.... over and over and over again because some characters skill trees have over 50 nodes. So 50 * 3 is 150 clicks to upgrade you character when there could of just been a max out character option.

Same for food. If you want to eat something before a fight for a buff and you have enough ingredients to make 10 of a dish for example you still have to sit down at a camp fire, pick the dish to make, and then it takes you back into the open world where you have to sit down and then make the dish again. It would of been so nice to just be like make 10 of this thing so you can get your buffs by eating once.

And community board friendships have the same problem as the traits upgrades. You increase friendships by giving characters gifts which increase their skills so they contribute more towards getting you passive abilities but this also needs to be gifted one by one. If you have 5 of a specific gift you can't give them to a character all at once. You need to select the gift, are you sure, yes, cool gift applied. I don't know who though this would be a good idea but whoever was in charge of this needs to be fired for reals.

What blows my mind is that they didn't make this oversight when selling items. You can select how many of each item you want to sell or buy and then sell or buy them all together. Why this could not be applied to other aspects of the UI is beyond me.

Even though the UI at times made me want to jump off a bridge, I still had so much fun playing through this game and I would still highly recommend it. 

It gets a solid 8.5/10. Gameplay is amazing and thats what you will be doing most of the time but the times you need to use the UI mentioned above is what just ruins it but luckily you don't need to do this too often.

As the time of this review, I went through the main game, two of the three DLCs included, got over 80% of the achievements, did all the sub stories. So on and so forth. As a 20 dollar game, it was fantastic. But as an 80 dollar game? Full price? Nah, just don't buy it then. Wait for another sale like I did.

It's a fun game, really. The grueling and tedious grind is almost worth it for the complete upgrades in moves. My favorite part was getting melee combos to their max hit count, and button mashing until the enemy has no more bones. At some points, the game really does get repetitive. I... really wasn't a fan of a certain near end-story boss segment where you're fighting the same boss, same form a few times. But I can excuse it for the game trying to be engaging. Compared to it all, Raditz was unironically the hardest fight in the game. I was sorta hoping for the same treatment throughout, but I guess not. Then again, him being the hardest makes sense lore wise considering the skill difference between Goku and him. And mechanically wise, a bit silly, since you didn't have much options for grinding beforehand.

If there were ONE thing I'd love this game to have, it would be a Faulconer score music pack or something. It got on my nerves how repetitive the music got. The bland and generic overworld music. The fight songs that only deviate from time to time. And the cutscene music that gets old really, really fast. I know the best experience to watch DBZ is through the anime, but the emotion of scenes gets really lackluster with the same music from before playing.

The animated cutscenes are really beautifully done, with such a vivid style that really feels like a direct translation of 2d to 3d for DBZ. They feel fluid, powerful, and dynamic.

All in all, the game is great if you pay 20 bucks for it. Not so if 80 for the deluxe. Repetitive music and gameplay at times. Same ol DBZ story. Same ol Goku. A fun trip for fans, but not the recommended DBZ first-time experience (if you tell someone to play a 60 dollar game to learn about dragon ball, you're evil.)

I'd give this game a 7/10.",1693719203,1693719203,True,3,1,0.534608244895935059,0,True,False,False

-> I am a 90's kid.
-> You know I'm gonna call this a masterpiece. Full stop.

If you've ever played any of the Naruto Storm games by Cyberconnect2 you are gonna find the combat in this game very familiar, the simple B button smash combos and fast dashes still remain and, when powered up, super attacks trigger cutscenes too. So overall a familiar feel to the combat, but in general Kakarot is its own beast.

Definitely the best thing about it is the amazing attention to detail from both manga and anime, I'll name a few of them:

-Power levels rise along with the story progression and are accurate in every event of the anime.
-Transforming strenghtens Saiyans ridiculously and makes other characters useless, just like in the anime.
-Stuffing your face with food before a battle is OP, just like in the anime.
-You go faster by flying. But you still use Nimbus. Because you know it's fun. Just like in the anime.
-You can race cars and ask Bulma for parts in her workshop, just like in the anime.
-Yes, you can properly collect Dragon Balls and spam Shenron wishes, just like in the anime.
-Korin gives you free Senzu beans overtime. Yes they are OP as they should, just like in the anime.
-The end game Super Spirit Bomb is so huge it's rendered out of the frame, just like in the anime.
-The cutscenes are... you know it. Just like the anime.

I could go on and on about every tiny detail there is, only noticed if you are a fan and care to look deeper, but it would be a long post. Hopefully these few things I mentioned are enough to make you buy the game and get immersed in what I think it's the best DBZ universe experience ever made. Go feed your inner kid some happiness, and it starts with that opening.",1592515267,1693310261,True,315,36,0.924895882606506348,0,True,False,False

The only thing that a dragon ball game needs is an amusing combat system, and this game missed it too badly. For Christ sake, even Xenoverse has a funnier combat.
Here enemies are in a constant power armor mode, you're trying to do a combo? Your opponent enter in a power armor charging attack state that if it lands it paralyze you for some time. 
How much does it happen? You can do a full combo and than you get this state 2 to 3 times in a row.
You are charging a special attack and get hit by a fly? Interrupted. 
Your enemy is charging a special attack and gets hit by a Genkidama? He'll pass trough it and smack your sorry ass.
I'm really pissed that this game isn't even decent. This game could be really something to look up to in the dragon ball videogames history but it missed the shot horrendously.
Cut scenes are really good to watch.
Side quests are hit or miss (more miss than hit).
The ""RPG"" has high and lows, to me more high than lows.
Exploration is nothing special at all, but I found really relaxing and amusing to been able to fly at max speed around in total freedom.

Now I have done a lot of grinding (If Goku, Vegeta and Gohan at Lvl.300 doesnt count as grinding then I have no clue what does) and I plan on getting that sweet 100% of the entire game, which will take a few dedicated months at least, but I remain determined, now this is where the DLC come in because they are great for grinding, DLC 1 gets everyone to lvl 200+ in a few hours no problem, DLC 2 is even better because if you replay it, the support characters will also level up, even if you do not choose them, there is also the new Horde Battles which are amazing for leveling up your characters, though I would prefer that they stay true to the movies or the arcs in Super but I digress

My only real complaints are that there are so many things hindering my 100%, the way they made certain loot based on location, community board is agonizingly slow to max out, the distance and abundance of all the 200+ D-medals, and the amount of useless tasks needed to max out the encyclopedia (I just don't like grinding, many of these may have been positives for those of you who are somehow more addicted to video games than I) , there is also the fact that the controls are pretty un-intuitive (Keep in mind that I'm a filthy Xenoverse player so I'm biased towards that format)",1582480039,1692598807,True,0,1,0.476377934217453003,0,True,False,False

And the dlc's are all great adding a whole new story and area or way of fighting everytime is lovely they could have just remade some of the already made fights but they add new things animations and ways of fighting i enjoyed every second of this game and will continue to everytime a new dlc comes out.

In regards to animation this games looks and feels amazing with all the new animations remade from the old anime I enjoyed watching the amazing results of the fights i just had made into a beautiful and powerfull looking animation after beating an enemy like super buu it makes you feel like you did this you fought him like this and just makes the game that much more amazing i think the animation and story carries this game by ALOT since the fighting does get repetitive in some areas of the game

From the moment I stepped into the world of Kakarot, I was enveloped in a cocoon of nostalgia, transported back to those cherished childhood days when the adventures of Goku and his friends were our constant refuge.

What truly sets Dragon Ball Z Kakarot apart is its unparalleled ability to be more than just another game. It's a sincere love letter to the entire Dragon Ball universe. The creators have poured their hearts into every moment, ensuring that even the tiniest easter egg resonates with fans on a deep, emotional level. 

The epic cinematics in Dragon Ball Z Kakarot are nothing short of breathtaking. From the earth-shattering battles to the poignant character interactions, every frame is crafted with utmost care and respect for the source material. The sheer scale of the battles is awe-inspiring, and witnessing the iconic moments from the series recreated in such a stunning way is nothing short of magical.

In conclusion, Dragon Ball Z Kakarot isn't just a game; it's a heartwarming, cozy, and nostalgic trip down memory lane. It's a labor of love that celebrates the legacy of the series, surpassing every other Dragon Ball game with its epic cinematics, genuine storytelling, and impeccable attention to detail.

This game is the best dragon ball game up to date. The music, the choreography, the action, are the best we've seen come from not only the dragon ball series, but anime games entirely.

This game is a must buy for anime fans.

Pros:
-Beautiful graphics.
-Fun game-play.
-Amazing attacks/moves.
-Amazing story. (I mean it's fucking DBZ and DBS)
-Good looking transformations, the animation for it could be better but it makes up for that with the design of them.
-The scenes are top notch.
-DLCS are amazing.
-Side characters are amazing.
-Main characters are amazing.
-Good character development.
-Decent difficulty.
-Good length.
-The combos are amazing.
I love DBZ and DBS so it makes sense I would like this.
Cons:
-The destruction on the ground from attacks could be better.
-You get barely any XP from battles in free-roam, but it evens it our from the EX you get from side missions and main missions plus the KI orbs.
-Doesn't make sense that random protection robots can scale to characters as strong as Goku.
-It would be better if they added more parts from DBS, Goku Black saga and T.O.P.

I do enjoy the game tries to fill in the gaps of time between what the characters were doing beyond what the show presents us - that's actually a good quality I didn't expect to see and most of the game's is littered with what are called ""memories"" that are short bursts of information portraying the original dragon ball content to remind us of Goku's origins.

While an extra eye of detail can be commended unfortunately some of the time spent on that could have gone into improving the combat: often I felt the controls are stiff - using a keyboard just doesn't feel right due to how fast your need to use your fingers to be pull off combos. But that being said, most ""combat"" ends up with you holding down power, spamming the specials over and over and then repeating the same tired attack, charge use special combination because the ai doesn't know how to challenge the player besides exclaiming what they are about to do while a giant red laser warns players they're about to attack - the health in this game requires you to mundanely collect resources from the map to gain zeni: with the only alternative to use the dragonballs to give you money that isn't that great of a wish when you consider most quests grant you things that you can sell anyway.

I think the game lacks polish in what you can buy, how the upgrades should work and how the game should play out. If it was my design I would have removed the skill tree ""abilities"" to upgrade only after you had progressed - the selection of skills should have been limited to just the upgraded forms of the attacks and removed the inferior version as most ki costs are the same - redundancy is something programmers should be avoiding.

The combat needed more to it, I felt unchallenged, it felt too on rails and there were no exciting moments other than the occasional cool new move thrown in there the lackluster progression of combat holds this game back.

I do like how this game plays for the lore reasons, but I only wish the game played more like other combat titles which had more flexible controls, better ""counters"" and the AI would present you with a challenge that wasn't just ""spam"" health items and ""spam"" specials and win. The combat is otherwise too slow and clunky for me to even consider this fun. If you're playing this: have an open mind, don't go in with the concept of expecting good fighting, instead enjoy the plotlines - you'll find most of the content cannot really be enjoyed until you do most of the missions themselves: I find this is to purposely make players replay the game and go back to finish off the content they missed. Fortunately you have a time machine to do most of that later on.

To summarise:
- Combat could be better improved.
- Travel is slow and some mundane elements could be shortened to make the game seem less of a chore to get through.
- Maps are overly sized: most of it is just space with nothing in it: while I enjoy the exploration aspects, the lack of content in this aspect is very apparent.
- The Memories seem rather pointless as only hardcore fans of the show would understand the plot-points from the original Dragon ball episodes (not Z).
- The game shines in the story telling elements: but only because it has the content to refer to - so as much as I praise the story, most of this can just be attributed to the fact the game is just regurgitating the same story from the show. I get the impression they really wanted to make their own story in the game but couldn't due to having to stick to the plot from the show: if this was the case, maybe you could have just made the scenes of fighting the main villians short missions rather than make the game revolve around them.

-Most of this game could be summed up as: Have you seen the show? Oh well it's that, but longer and you have to recollect the dragon balls every time you want to fight people you already killed - to fill up your community board: wasn't all that work worth it though? (inner screaming) it's repetitive and the only direction it can go is telling you the plot of DBZ: I feel this game is better suited to those that haven't seen the show and even then I'd still would prefer they watch the series instead rather than have their impression be ruined by bad mechanics in a video game.

I do hope that the later DLC makes up for it's lame repetitive state - I don't plan on buying Goku's dad DLC as it's 15 quid for the opportunity to basically sit there and gawk at a lemming: why would I pay for that? I'm glad I just stuck to paying for the Season pass as I didn't realise just how bad the game felt until halfway through the content. The game feels like it's content has been stretched and not for the right reasons.

I'd advise anyone who is just looking at what content to get in terms of the DLC to stick with the first season pass - the second season pass only offers you promise of content that doesn't exist right now, which is not worth your purchase unless you are willing to wait.",1692194829,1692194958,True,16,0,0.678651928901672363,0,True,False,False

This gotta be one of the laziest cash grabs ever , or at least in the top 10...
Mario N64 had more ""Activities"" and bigger ""Open World"" to play with

I knew the fighting would be repetitive , but i thought the open worldliness would make up for it... BUT NO! The amount of loading screen time because of the mini-maps that comprise the whole thing is absurd and  your endless list of options in this god awful joke of an ""Open World"" are:

-""Fight"" dumb repetitive enemies (grind) to level up.
(some of which can tank everything or would just eat everything)
-Fish for food (why?!)
-Fly around and getting Z Balls and Apples which will re-appear again and again in the exact same spot over and over again (whats the purpose?).
-Rest or roast food in the already set campfires scattered on the map(s).
-Super dumb and basic side quests which almost all of them consist on flying around to fetch a dumb item making you waste half or most of the time in loading screens because its not a single whole map.

Add to all this the fact that not matter how many times (At least for me) when you set it up to play with keyboard instead of Controller, when i log out and then back on later i play again,it will display again and again on any screen command the Controller equivalent instead of Keyboard , is so frustrating...I just ended giving up and playing with the damn controller instead.",1691529837,1691790285,False,5,2,0.489045172929763794,0,True,False,False

Travelling around the open world is great fun. You can fly with or without boosting, fly on Nimbus, drive a car or just run at a great speed.

While the combat is extremely simple, it's great fun. A mix of the animation style and the great sound design makes each little punch feel like it has so much weight to it, and combining this with effects such as your Kamehameha getting bigger the more you level up really makes you feel stronger and stronger as you play through the game.

Speaking of the animation, this game looks INCREDIBLE! I'm constantly going back to watch some of the prettier cutscenes, because they're just animated so well.

Such as Gohan being overconfident at the end of the cell saga letting cell explode. He just kinda says ""ima explode now"" which makes his reaction to goku's sacrifice a bit different as in the show it was essentially his fault goku had to do that because he wanted to draw out the fight with cell.

It wouldn't be fair to give Dragon Ball Z: Kararot a Thumbs Down.  On Steam, reaching ""Mixed"" on overall user reviews tends to indicate a fairly bad game.

Dragon BallZ: Carrot isn't a bad game.  But it also doesn't seem exactly sure what it wants to be.  On one hand, we need to stop with generic fighting games that just tell the story of Dragon Ball Z over and over again.  How many time can we keep rehashing it?  The voice actors must be going bonkers.

But that's what DBZ: Kakacarrot Cake does change... A little bit.  Now it's a fighting game AND an open world JRPG with Gacha elements.  Which is a surprisingly welcome change of pace.  Its actually kind of fun to explore maps that are based from brief glimpses of backgrounds we see in the anime.  They feel stylistically spot on, while older DBZ titles seemed to phone it in a bit.

However, I'm also wondering why these elements need to exist at the same time.  I finished the Freiza saga before I realized I could upgrade super attacks with the Z orbs that are all over the map for you to collect.  But the thing is, you get hundreds of them in random encounters - which sort of renders the delicate trails of 1 at a time feeling kind of meaningless.  Then on top of that, the fights seemed fairly beatable without the upgrades anyway, making collecting them feel even less important.

In a similar vein is cooking.  Every game has to have cooking and fishing these days.  And while it is kind of relaxing and wholesome, the food effects only last 3 minutes, and the recipes worth using can take some doing to have all the ingredients.  Some of the buffs are permanent I guess, but the UI doesn't do favors on making that clear.  And the permanent bonuses seem a lot lesser than just leveling up.

Now the leveling system is something that's actually pretty cool, though I wish they leveraged it even more. In most DBZ games all characters are evenly strong with just different special attack styles.  Which leads to hilarious, but utterly nonsensical matchups like Krillin being able to put down SSJ3 Goku like it's nothing.  Not in this game.  Characters are actually scaled more like the show.  I was actually scared for a moment when I realized I was punching Radditz for 50 damage, and he was hitting me for 300!  Later I was super satisfied when Goku goes super saiyan and I get to demolish Freiza like a strapping young lad beating his meat furiously for the first time.

Like I said though it would be nice if it leveraged it a little further.  DBZ is one game where no-win fights would actually make sense, you're pretty much garunteed to lose and the score is based more on how long you survive, than how fast you beat it.  And the fights with the fun scaling are rare, most of the time the enemy is just the same level you are.

That's most of the major stuff for better or worse, the rest are nitpicks.  It's annoying on first boot up when it has a pop up for every single DLC being available and you have to tap through one by one, and there's over 9000 of them.  During overworld exploration your camera always snaps back into position behind you if you let go of the stick.  Graphics settings are mostly locked.

On a less technical side of things I wish it was Dragon Ball: Kakarot, and not Z.  The more casual and wholesome vibes the game has out of combat are a better fit for early Dragon Ball, not to mention we just haven't seen that stuff in game form in ages.  It would have been new, and fun.  It would also be a good match for the leveling up and training systems too.  It could always lead into Z and Super anyway, it is ""Kakarot"" so you'd think it would be Goku's story start to finish.  And yeah that would be an insanely long game, but maybe they could have released each series as an big expansion.

So yeah that's my long, rambling review for Kakarot.  If you like DBZ you'll probably like it.  If you find JRPG style crafting mechanics tedius you probably won't.  If you just want a pure fighting game you're probably better off with FighterZ, or waiting for Budakai 4 which I think I heard is coming?",1691366886,1691366886,True,1,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Cooking is the weird part of the game.  Ignore the flat bonuses, unless you want to accrue thousands of hours farming they will not make any noticeable difference.  The temporary bonuses are all that matter combined with levels.

Played the first three DLC's, the Trunks DLC is quite good and if you liked the base game will enjoy this DLC.  Other two DLC's add some ways to get experience, training with Whis or fighting Beerus, or horde fights against enemies.

[b]Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot[/b] maybe the most faithful adaptation of the original anime yet.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
Unlike other videogame entries that are almost exclusively fighting games with maybe a recounting of the anime as a little undeveloped extra, here we have the exact opposite situation more focus on the original tale over complex or balanced mechanics.

Especially evident in major battles where a lot of care was put in the moment to moment animations of the fight itself.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You’ll be able to explore the setting of Dragon Ball flying around the world ad doing sub-quests while in-between major happenings.

The fighting is simple, one button to guard, one to keep attacking with the same long combo string, and characteristic to Dragon Ball games, one button to charge your energy to be used on very flashy moves.

[h1]Story[/h1]
It’s Dragon Ball... and it’s dumb, oh so very dumb, only re-experiencing the story again I realized how bad and nonsensical the writing is, it’s trash, but it’s the trash I grew up with.

But if you didn’t know... Follow the adventures of Goku and his friends as they save Earth from increasingly stronger foes.

[h1]Downsides[/h1]

Gameplay also spots a lot odd ducks:
[list]
[*]A long fishing minigame that will NEVER yield you a fish that you need for quests
[*]Vehicles that are way slower than even the slowest speed the slowest character can achieve
[*]A leveling system that is useless in its current form, since doing multiple subquests and fights in the overworld barely increases your exp bar while main fight give you multiple levels at once
[*]The world is filled with these ugly floating orbs that again mean jack since a single story fight will reward you more of these orbs that you will ever find within the overworld in your whole playtime
[*]Some attacks are VERY broken, to the point you can win any encounter by spamming them
[*]Skill trees that are beyond useless as skills will be locked behind story progression and you’ll always have enough resources to purchase them, on top of that, skills are always an updated version of the previous so there’s no incentive to keep the old ones.
[*]Formations is a nice reference-fest, but another useless addition, they provide a way to gain more experience enhance the damage you deal and other stuff but in Kakarot level difference decides everything, if you are 5 level higher a couple of normal combos will defeat any enemies, if you are 5 lower you’ll do no damage, this isn’t an exaggeration, you’ll do 1 point of damage against the multi-million pool of the enemy.

Then you play a few hours, and it starts to fall apart. In a series so full of iconic moves and panels that were already turned into attacks in other games, they give you mostly generic 2-3 hit rush moves.
You fly around the world and it starts out nostalgic and comfy, until you realize the world is just buffer so you're not going throught the story in 5 hours.
None of the side content matters, side quests are funny enough but mostly just useless fetch quests.
Entire mechanics like the community board are absolutely useless, enemies start spamming moves that give them super armor to the point where you can't even stagger them after blocking.

The Cut Scenes look amazing and some of them gave me chills on how good it looked. My only personal problem with the game is there are only about 7 songs they use for everything in the game which gets very annoying pretty quick because there not the greatest songs to begin with but the rest of the game is amazing. In my opinion the game gives a great challenge which makes it fun for people who enjoy a challenge like myself (I Played on the Hardest Difficulty). My favorite part of the game has to be the Side Quests or Sub Story's Because they not only give you a load of exp but they also give you experiences you can't see in the show like Goku training goten because he feels bad not being as strong as his fusion partner trunks. That same Sub Story shows how the two boys just want to spend time with the fathers and that training was the best way to do so. I rate this game a strong 8.7 because i love music in games and it was honestly disappointing that there was no custom music made for this game aside from the remixes from the show which don't change much but the the rest of the game is a very enjoyable experience.

Great game!

*EDIT*

Played a bit more by this point in the game and now I would like to elaborate a little more!

I haven't played a single player dragon ball game that makes you feel like you're playing an entire episode of the series. There are certain parts that are cut out but I don't wanna spoil the story for anyone who doesn't already know.

There's a huge skill tree, while linear still very fun to explore due to it's size.

There's a lot of story to get through, I'm around 14 hours in and only just now working on my second saga.

There are so many collectables, while this can also be seen as a bad thing, it tends to satiate my need to loot and find secrets.

Now I do wanna mention the bad of course. (There has to be something)
The difficulty scaling.. It's really quite something. If you're a veteran to these types of games, you're gonna have absolutely no issue at all on any difficulty setting. I'm nowhere near a veteran and I had to play on hard mode because the game doesn't give that much in way of a challenge.

Can I look past this? ABSOLUTELY. 

What I've played so far I can still recommend this game.",1689299233,1689606072,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For starters, past 3 DLC drops which include Trunks and Bardok, which btw have NOTHING really to do with Goku, only indirectly, and soon getting the 23rd World Tournament, is NOT what the DB fans wanted.  Last good DLC drop was the Resurrection F DLC which was from when Frieza came back and became Golden Frieza.  We have yet to see: Goku Black or Tourny of Power which MANY fans have been patiently waiting for.  But this is what you get when you deal with any game that has Bandai as publisher.

I will say this, you want any good game at this point for Dragonball Super to go all the way up to Tourny of Power, go play Xenoverse 2 or FighterZ.  Chances of us getting any DLC of Goku Black or Tourny of Power is slim to NONE.  Plus the repetitive gather missions is absurd.  Only good parts of this game was the story a bit and the fighting.  That was it.

I know this wasn't going to be a 3D remaster of those but figured it was going to be about what they did with retelling the sagas/arcs with some added stuff for more fun and fluff which makes sense and pretty what they did do. Ultimately however I can't help but feel like the game falls short in the long run. 

A lot of why I feel that way is because the main part of the story is voice acted and all well done which should be since the cast has done this several times now, however going into the side quests which are meant to add to this world end up being just the most mindless fetch quest with dialogue windows being voice acted by a simple grunt, huh or just a word or two which I can't stand. The combat just feels like Xenoverse lite and find no enjoyment in every damn thing having power armor. I get bosses having it to some degree but random encounters quickly and I mean quickly get old due to this. Also, the lack of diversity in moves outside of Special Beam Cannon, Kamehameha ETC added to the already dull combat since there was nothing that made any character stand apart from another like speed, strength and just power-leveled Goku only. 

I want to touch on however my biggest disappointment and that is the DLC (excluding the music ones given I get the whole needing to pay licensing fees and all). I absolutely cannot for the life of me understand why they would shoehorn in segments that were made for the main story into DLC with History of Trunks or Bardock. Literally, they took the dumbest page out of the Final Fantasy 15 playbook and thought it was good. I also can't help but feel like the 23rd tournament arc would have made sense also in the base game. DLC to this should have gone the route of Marvel's Spiderman and used the movies as added arcs and kept this a strict retelling of Z. 

Overall it does retell the story but seeing this going the route of Xenoverse 2 with DLC practice has made me lose any hope that Budokai Tenkaichi 4 will be any different. Also pretty damn lame this didn't get the graphic update of the newer gen consoles which is the only reason I cross bought this game like a dummy.

Good fun jrpg. Story: It's dbz, from bottom to top. Canon-rich, with plenty of scenes from the series recreated within the engine.

Npc's could be a little more alive, they're just standing there doing nothing until you arrive, but it's the original VAs as well, so it's cool. Cutscenes are very pretty, sidequests are a chore. A handful is interesting, everything else is 'go gather this, then beat these minions'. It's labeled 'open-world', but it's the same as SM-Odyssey; different maps to roam around in.

The graphics are not enjoyable to look at. I'd go as far as to say, they're downright ugly. Characters look alright, but the world looks way worse than even Zelda BotW - and this isn't even a handheld exclusive game. The scenery for every fight is basically just a wasteland with like two trees on the background. On PC you can unlock the framerate and the game will easily run upwards of 500 fps on a high end machine which tells you just how little is going on in this game world. For a 2020 release this is lacking.

My other major complaints are the cutscenes and the overall presentation of the story. They basically copied the animated series here because every dialog is just two models stuck in their idle animations standing in front of one another only moving their mouths...it may have been like that in the anime but it should've been obvious that this would make for really boring dialogues in a video game. I had to push myself towards the end of the game to not skip every cutscene and fast forward through every dialog. And whenever characters animate, it just looks painfully bad. In many situations the developers try to mask the bad quality of the animations by choosing awkward camera angles that block your vision over what's happening. 80% of the game, characters spend their time in their idle-, or walk-animation because there simply aren't any others. Overall there are VERY FEW moments in the entire game that have unique animations and this - again, in 2020 - just doesn't cut it.

Also the game is overburdened by completely pointless ""rpg""-systems like cooking or building cars (when you can literally noclip through the open world by just pressing the fly-button). When I have a health pool of 1 million HP I don't really want to spend time gathering ingredients for a meal that increases my health by +50. These systems that pretty much never intersect with the actual gameplay could've easily been cut without anyone noticing.

Last thing I'm touching on is the soundtrack. There are so few tracks that in the middle of the game you already will start saying to yourself ""jeesh, this one again"". Again - there are no unique compositions for the big story moments here. It feels like an artist created like 5 tracks and the devs inserted them wherever possible. This leaves many big story moments without any impact as characters die or do their first time transformations in complete silence. I can't even imagine the epicness if characters or moments had unique musical themes like in other games or movies. In this game it's basically ""ah this is a tense moment, let's grab the tense music."".

This was a huge chance to tell the entirety of the Z-Saga in one great game but the big parts of the story that everyone will remember from their childhood look way better in your memory than they do here. What is especially painful about this is that you only get a chance to make a game like this once. A massive chunk of potential was not realized here.",1688650277,1688650277,False,2,0,0.462625086307525635,0,True,False,False

If you're a DBZ fan, you will most likely enjoy this because it's literally just the main story. It's not a perfect game but it's fun and engaging, I like the RPG elements, I like leveling up your characters and party, it adds more depth to the story's universe. It's rewarding to play someone like Gohan and watch him grow from a 4 year old kid to one of the strongest people in the universe. It adds depth to the story that was presented in the source material because you yourself are making the character stronger.

If you have never interacted with DBZ or know very little of the story, then this game is still good for you but it is definitely not the best way to experience the story. They make some changes to the story, nothing major because it is still faithful to the source material, but they change some stuff around to make it work better in a game. I understand why they did it, but in my opinion it takes away from the experience of the story.

Game play wise, it does get a bit repetitive. Combat is basically just pressing the B button. If you wanna make it a combo, you could press one of the other face buttons, but you don't have to. If you wanna do a special attack, you hold the left bumper and one of the face buttons together to do the special attack that was assigned to that button combination. If you hold the right bumper and one of the face buttons, then one of your party members will do something to help you out, such as attack an enemy.

To make something clear, this is not really a fighting game with RPG elements like Xenoverse or something, it's an RPG game with fighting elements. The combat isn't super in depth, there aren't any crazy button combos and timing and stuff. The combat is simple but effective.

The fights themselves are not that bad. Fighting the random encounters gets really repetitive because they are littered all over the map and you can usually kill them in a couple seconds because your character is just insanely strong, but you don't get much XP from it, so you do have to grind a lot to level up in that sense. However, there are regional bosses in certain areas of the world, which are much stronger than the average enemy you will encounter. They are usually at the level of a main story villain. These fights are much more rewarding in terms of getting experience. They are more difficult and time consuming, and they will continue to get a little more difficult. Once you defeat all the bosses in an area, a new one will spawn that will be even stronger. Once you defeat that, another will spawn that will be even more stronger. It's a good way to level up your characters and gain XP. Or if you just love to fight, it is really satisfying just absolutely demolishing your foes. While I said the combat is repetitive, that doesn't mean it's bad. As I said, it is really really satisfying just absolutely obliterating your foes and getting an S rank on the fights.

Where the combat truly shines is in the main story villains like the Saiyans or Frieza. It's a great combo of building up the villains that already happens in the story as well as the actual game play element. Like I said, if you're already familiar with the story, then you know how big of a deal someone like Frieza is, and when you finally get to fight him, it is incredibly satisfying. The main fights are definitely done right. 

The open world itself is enjoyable. There are lots of activities you can do, such as the random encounters I mentioned before, fishing, collecting Z Orbs, or doing side quests. A cool thing I like is that if you want to get the XP from the random encounters but don't wanna fight, you can just fly around super fast, and your character will be so insanely strong that you don't even have to fight them, just colliding with them will kill the enemy and you'll get the XP. It's really fun to do that and it makes sense DBZ-wise because most of the characters in DBZ are just that strong. The side quests are kind of a mixed bag. A lot of them are just fetch quests, but the developers usually put some kind of a fight in there to make it worth your time. While the side quests are hit or miss, they give you a ton of XP so it is definitely worth it to do them.

Speaking of XP, leveling up your character is easily the best aspect of this game. I just feel like you are able to connect and grow with the character so much more. I'm gonna use the example of Gohan again. In the show, we know how strong he is and we know what all he had to do to get there. But I also feel like a lot of that growth and training happens off screen. In this game, you go and do those fights, get the XP, and level up your character, so you are literally seeing your character grow into what they will become. You can level up and make your character stronger by of course getting XP, but also through Z Orbs. Z Orbs are collectibles that are found all over the map, and are also dropped through combat, side quests, and other activities. There are also these things called D medals, which are used for getting new moves to use in combat. To get these new moves, you go to training zones that are found in certain areas of the map. Each playable character has their own skill tree, but the moves are pretty similar, a lot of them are just the same. There are prerequisites to get the move, such as being a certain level, having a certain number of D medals and Z orbs, or having learned a certain move already. Once you have met these prerequisites, you enter a fight where you usually fight 3 enemies at once, and they are usually just some shadow version of a villain you already fought. They will usually be around the same level as you, depending on how much time you put into leveling up your character. Defeating them will grant you the skill, and you can assign it to a button combo after that. You can also go into the skill tree and level up your special moves using Z Orbs, as well as gain effects that can be used in combat, such as +5% damage or +3% healing or something like that. It's not super in depth like some other RPGs, but it is still good.

Once the Dragon Balls are available to use, you can spam them just like they do in the anime. You can revive enemies that you've fought before and fight them for XP. You can ask to be rich, you can ask for rare items, for Z orbs, etc. Once a wish is made, the Dragon Balls are on a 20 minute cool down and then you can collect them again.

There are some aspects I haven't mentioned, such as the Community Board, because I haven't delved too much into them. The community board is basically just a way to get more XP and gain some sort of advantage, I haven't put a ton of time into that yet, I'll probably do it later. Some other people said something about racing cars, which I haven't looked into yet.

The soundtrack's alright. Not as good as the Japanese soundtrack for the anime or the Bruce Faulconer soundtrack for the American version of the anime, and not as good as Kai's soundtrack, but it gets the job done. It's usually just a remix of a song from the original soundtrack. The voice acting is great because it's the original cast of the show doing the voices. Sometimes the lines come off as a little cheesy, but it doesn't really ruin anything.

I haven't finished the game yet, I'm on the start of the Android Saga right now, but from what I've experienced so far, it's a really great game.

Overall, this game is definitely worth $60, and if it's on sale, you should most definitely pick it up.

Furthermore, the open-world aspect of the game adds depth to the experience. Players can freely explore iconic locations such as the bustling city of West City, the desolate wasteland of the Saiyan homeworld, and the serene surroundings of Kame House. These environments are faithfully recreated and filled with side quests, collectibles, and memorable encounters with familiar characters. While some side quests may feel repetitive, the overall exploration aspect adds value to the game and immerses players in the Dragon Ball Z universe.

Characters are beautifully designed, and their animations are smooth and impactful during combat sequences. Moreover, the game features iconic cutscenes from the original series, making players feel like they are part of the action.

Audio design is another strong point of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot. The game features the original Japanese voice cast, adding authenticity to the experience. The soundtrack perfectly complements the intense battles and emotional moments, enhancing the immersion and invoking a sense of nostalgia.

Replayability and Additional Content:
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot offers a decent amount of replayability. Aside from the main story, there are various side quests, activities, and collectibles that provide additional hours of gameplay. The game also features a robust character progression system, allowing players to level up their favorite characters, learn new abilities, and unlock powerful transformations.

Conclusion:
Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot successfully captures the essence of the iconic anime series, providing an immersive and nostalgic experience for fans. The enjoyable combat system, faithful storytelling, visually stunning graphics, and nostalgic soundtrack combine to create a memorable adventure.

This game truly allows you to FEEL like Goku and co., from driving like a maniac and destroying general riff-raff here and there, this game captures the essence of what it would truly feel like to be in the Dragonball Universe from the perspective of the characters.

The combat is dynamic and beautiful, from particle effects and the feeling of the impact your attacks have. The use of camera angles in a way that feels like an episode from the show.

the ONLY thing this game has going for it is the graphics

the combat can be cheesed by exploiting almost every single mechanic to even a moderate degree

gameplay outside of the main story is used for basically exclusively getting zeni for heals (not required) as basically anything else gives a completely worthless reward or so little of what you get more than plenty of from the main story

the main story itself is alright in pacing but really drags on during some points, namely intermissions between main arcs and during the beginning of the 3rd arc WAY too many sidequests that are just ""go to area, find thing repeat 1-3x turn in, do another"" until you get to the actual content of the story

shockingly the dlcs solve none of the issues and almost all of them are a cut below the main story itself and either have either unique issues or exaggerate main issues of the game itself

dlc 1 is a complete nothing burger, it just introduces 2 fights, 1 as a challenge, and 1 as a fight you do dozens of times to just get free exp, but using it in the main story ruins the only even moderately engaging content of it, and afterward is completely worthless as it only carries over to the next dlc

dlc 2 is probably the best one even though its still got a bunch of issues, unlike dlc 1 it actually adapts the story instead of coming up with a couple chatboxes setting up what is essentially a cheat mode for the maingame, and within that it adds the only decent mechanic in the dlcs, raid battles, which while honestly more boring than the main 1v1 combat of the base game, is at least fun to mash punch and onetap 100 npcs until the game decides you can just clear out the remaining number

dlc 3 is one of the most awful pieces of video game ive ever played, it has 2 major segments, trunks v androids, and trunks v dabura, trunks v androids makes up around 70% of the content and consists of ONLY 2 FIGHTS repeated to around a 16 times total, with the androids themselves consisting of around 10 of those fights, and this is excluding all the optional times you can fight them by triggering the drones in the overworld, and to make it worse, the fight itself isnt interesting as its just dodging for a minute straight, doing 1/4 of their healthbar by bursting them down with everything you can and then repeating that till theyre dead 10 TIMES MINIMUM, and while the trunks v dabura fight is much better, it doesnt do nearly enough good to even begin fixing the dumpster fire that was its first act

dlc 4 is shockingly more competent than the others, no annoying gimmicks, no major repeat fights, the main character isnt just a rehash youve already played before, and the enviroment is unique and not just a remade area youve already been to, though this is all brought down by more than half of the dlcs playtime just being raid battles over and over and the assist movesets being AWFUL to fight for the training fights to level up your character

overall while it isnt literally the worst game ever made, its extremely disappointing from the hype the game recieved, hopefully dlc 5 is somehow an absolute masterpiece of gaming but from the quality of almost enjoyable to utterly awful of the base game and its dlcs, i wouldnt get my hopes up",1582784493,1687947457,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was a big DBZ fan as a kid so it was nostalgic to play through the story. That being said, I feel like it wasn't worth it in hindsight. The story is fairly faithful (as far as I remember) but a lot of the big moments felt rushed. The actual game combat was fun for a bit, but got stale for me after about 10 hours or so. The RPG aspects seem interesting at first but are a bit silly as you swap characters to follow the story and seem unnessary for half the playable cast.

Faithful retelling, simple battle mechanics similar to that of games like Xenoverse.  

The reason I can't really recommend this game, is it has so much potential but feels like it falls short.  Mini games are okay but I feel they could have tried a few more things for training, or tightened up the driving controls to feel like something different, same with the other rides in the game, they just feel pointless considering how efficient it is to just fly.
Speaking of pointless, the party system is mostly irrelevant through the main story.  There are intermissions in the story where you get some ""freedom"" to do side quests, train, gather materials or you can skip these sections if you want.

A really fun aspect of this game is the card game that is included, however, I'm assuming due to gacha mechanics that come with this card game or mabey it was lack of interest, but you cannot get any new cards, login bonuses don't register, you can't unlock new cards in game, and while it seems like there will be a single player mode, as of now it's incredibly difficult to play, which sucks because I really like some of the cards I've played against and this seems like a lot of fun.

Now, this game does a lot of things well.  The battles are handled pretty well but always come down to flying and charging the opponent, that might be over simplifying it but, a better combo system would have really added some depth.  
Crucial battles from the series felt special, the fight with Raditz was intense compared to everything else presented up to that point, and made me hopeful for more complex boss fights.  
This didn't happen to always be the case, but when you fight other bosses you feel like the protagonist, in a way that should satisfy fans. 
The sub stories are simple expansions on lore and I think make the world feel rich.  Also, it's a beautiful recreation of Akira Toriyama's world of Dragon Ball.  I did enjoy spending a lot of time just looking at all the things there are to see in the world, and hearing how the npc's respond to some of the current events.

If you really feel you need to play this game, I would at least get it on sale like I did. I think with a little fine tuning and more original story content would make this the perfect DragonBall Z game.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1686466978,1686466978,True,0,0,0.348432064056396484,0,True,False,False

Mechanically, it is a decent, if not great game - with the extreme downside of being heavily censored and watered down to PG, with consideration for modern, woke audiences. For this reason, I don't recommend you buy this game at full price, especially if you have not watched the anime or read the manga before. Consider that you are not taking the entire experience home with you, due to the abject censorship this game is subject to.

Provided that you can purchase it on a heavy discount and on the condition that you already know the Dragon Ball story like the back of your hand, play it, though the censorship is prevalent and everywhere. I'm not kidding, I can't stress this enough: practically every scene which depicted anything that could be even moderately objectionable has been censored or removed entirely. 

To be fair, this is a problem that Western dubs that were based on the American script had already accumulated over time due to oversensitive burger audiences, but it's tripled down in this game. If you are from a region which the anime was dubbed from the original Japanese edition or experienced it in the original Japanese, it's going to feel like the story has been robbed of its soul.

Obviously, contains spoilers, but here's a quick list of what's been cut in the main game:

This is an awesome narrative game following the series closely like some of the old games did.
Something DBZ games have been lacking for ages.
The open world stuff has potential but is mostly filled up with nonsensical ridiculous sidequests, subpar minigames and collectathons.
A shame that for the sidequests I still am forced usually to play a designated character.

All in all well worth it at a discount as the story mode itself is great.
The optional content is lackluster.
Endgame i'll revisit eventually but so far has left me very 'meh'. 

I do hope they make a new Kakarot in the future uniting Z & the movies. Or Super and it's movies. But with a more well thought out endgame/open world aspect.

Update 1:  Finished the 2 dlcs linked to the 2 first Super Movies. 
Pretty interesting. Took me ages to realize they were hidden in the dlc section of the options screen. (assumed it led me to the store)

New abilities/level cap. And an interesting grind system allowing you to grind special items that will help you level up all your characters faster. 
The story of the 2nd part is fun. Horde mechanic is cinematic.
A bit barebones overall.

Regarding the Future Trunks DLC, only just started it.
The big plus there so far seems to be that it is more standalone. Unlocked a medal for the community board but overall it seems more selfcontained and has some specific map mechanics with drones hunting you.
Also you don't get access to your items/resources from the main campaign. Thus making things quite tense.
Final judgement is for when i finish the dlc.

DLC is almost a must though as it does add a lot of content overall.

Update: Trunks dlc is pretty good. And worth picking up. Looses momentum near the end. (post credits content) But it's pretty good. And especially fans of Trunks will love this dlc.

Addendum: 04/06/2023 - picked up the season pass. Still need to start Bardock's storyline.
A HUGE MINUS I STILL THINK SHOULD BE INTRODUCED is either levelscaling or a good New Game +. The time machine is only good for tracking down missed sidequest.
The game NEEDS a hard mode New Game +

Includes all major plot points with far better graphics without some of the distracting fluff the original series had. That being said, it also includes some gameplay fluff that may be distracting but only if you let it.
For those that know nothing about Dragon Ball Z: This is an anime. Duh, right? So you can probably guess the graphics style. That being said, it is fully 3D and very well done- vastly improved upon the original series' graphics. Everything's in English, if wanted, and the storyline is a key feature of this game. You don't really need to know a whole lot about the series to enjoy this game. It is a fighting game, yes, but it feels more like a third person action RPG since there is a lot of character growth in levels, stats, and skills. I haven't beaten this game yet since I've let my son do more than half of the gaming hours I have put into it, but from what I've heard there is a lot of extensive character customization[spoiler[ after the game is won in a New Game+ fashion[/spoiler]. The fighting is very smooth and most of the time (hate it those few times whenever I can't interrupt my combo to dodge or block an attack) you can time things beautifully for a kickass experience. Fighting evolves throughout the game which is great if you want to compare it to Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which is basically the same combos the entire game and only super skills changing. Awoken skills, or transformations as they're called in this game, also make a difference in your fighting style which makes perfect sense. You are also able to, but not required to after the first tutorial bit, upgrade your stats and gains using a Community of characters that specialize in different things to provide you with various long-term passive bonuses of your choosing. It works using a mechanic that is similar to a gift/relationship system, but you can do it from anywhere and almost at any time.

The big complaint I have about this game: It's not cooking like people mention, it's not grinding for items like others mention in their reviews (if you don't like grinding then play on an easier difficulty so you don't have to, ya foo), it's that even though you've achieved the experience levels and orbs (orbs work like a specialized experience resource in this game) to upgrade a skill there are still many times in which you have to have a break-out battle to ""train"" for the skill in order to learn it and use it. This is made a little worse in the way that you can't progress further in that part of your skill tree at all unless you unlock that specific upgrade through the break-out battle (obviously you're required to win it) needed to unlock that skill. Gets annoying, especially when you're in a part of the game where it won't let you locate and use a training node. [strike]Also, even though the new skill is better in every way it doesn't automatically replace the older version of the skill? Maybe people just don't want to use more ki, w/e who cares.[/strike]",1685227163,1685227163,True,13,1,0.641298651695251465,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a delightful action RPG that immerses players in the beloved world of Dragon Ball Z. Developed by CyberConnect2, this game faithfully recreates the iconic moments from the anime and manga, while also adding its own unique gameplay elements and storytelling.

One of the most impressive aspects of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is its stunning visuals. The cel-shaded art style beautifully captures the essence of Akira Toriyama's original artwork, bringing the characters and environments to life in vibrant detail. From lush landscapes to explosive battles, every scene is a visual treat for both long-time fans and newcomers to the series.

The gameplay in Kakarot strikes a balance between action-packed combat and exploration. Players assume the role of Goku, experiencing his journey from the Saiyan Saga to the Buu Saga, and even diving into other characters' stories in between. The combat system is fast-paced and satisfying, with a variety of special moves, combos, and transformations at your disposal. The inclusion of iconic battles against powerful foes like Frieza and Cell is a fan's dream come true.",1684518735,1684518735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yea, I know, I see the community post discussing that if you change something in the graphics settings, it will display KB+M controls, but, even then, the controls can't be redefined, and for some reason, you have to change that setting every time you load the game, since it don't save it. 

Fishing, Follow-Ups, and Attack Charging just don't work at all with KB+M. Follow-Ups and Attack Charging, you MIGHT could live without, but you can't beat the game unless you can fish, and you learn that early on, like, before any bosses. To me, that is considered game breaking. The fact that I'm now forced to go buy a controller or find a mod to fix the issues just to progress past the first mission, on PC, is as anti-consumer as it gets. Also, Attack Charging don't even work WITH a controller on PC, so, there's that. The KB+M control scheme it has is unintuitive, but if I could change the buttons, I could make it intuitive. 

Oh, and speaking of mods, there are no mods to fix these issues. How do I know? I asked. I was then labeled as an elitist, so, what little community of players this game does have are unwelcoming, unhelpful and immature. 

In closing, if you're amongst the group of lazy, self entitled gamers that don't give a crap about the anti-consumerism that is continuing to destroy this industry, and you want to hang out with a bunch of immature morons who may not even welcome you, this game is perfect for you.

I loved it, and it hit all the right beats for any DBZ fan, however, it happened twice to me where I closed the game and for some reason, my saves disappeared. The first time this happened I was 2 hours in and the game crashed. My saves were gone, but I decided to just play it again because I didn't get that far. The second time though, I was 11 hours in. I made sure that my steam deck said that my saves synced with steam. I then closed the game. When I reopened it my 11 hour save file was gone and it reverted me back to a 4 hour save. I went into my steam account to see if my 11 hour save file was there and it wasn't. I was dismayed, uninstalled this game, and regret buying it. 

I am not the only person to have experienced this issue with this game. And I've never lost my saves for any other game I played on steam, only this one.

I did not know that I would still be able to feel the magic and owe from this universe again like I did during my childhood, but Kakarot delivered and more. 

By no way is this a perfect game. Fights can become frustrating as ennemies tend to often block even the strongest of your moves, the soundtrack is good but some musics are way overused and become a little repetitive, there are some missing moments from the anime etc.

But for every wrong thing there are 10 others that are just great. The world is gorgeous, filled with easter eggs and other references that I would not have expected them to add (I particularly enjoyed the Dragon Ball nostalgic pictures spread across the map), cutscenes are gorgeous, the fighting system is very satisfying and really gives you the sense of power and strength of either your Z fighter or the enemy you're up against. Musics are also great, if not too few for my liking. Most dialogues are actually VOICED which adds a lot to the immersion and overall it just feels like a very generous game.

I am glad seeing them adding DLCs to make this game more complete and I would LOVE to see the same formula applied to the original Dragon Ball! I can't recommend enough this game if you enjoyed the original DBZ anime!",1683522071,1683522481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This title not only pays homage to the beloved series but also delivers a gaming experience that is both innovative and thrilling. It is a true testament to the developers' understanding of what makes Dragon Ball Z so special.

The game's astonishing graphics are a sight to behold. The characters are rendered with an exceptional level of detail, and their movements are fluid and true to the anime. Even the most intricate of battle sequences are brought to life with such precision that one cannot help but marvel at the visual spectacle. The game's environments are equally stunning, providing a vibrant and immersive backdrop that transports players to the Dragon Ball Z universe.

But the true genius of Dragon Ball Z lies in its gameplay. The developers have crafted an intricate and rewarding combat system that caters to both newcomers and seasoned fans alike. Players can execute a variety of moves, including combos, special attacks, and transformations, allowing them to fully embody their favorite characters. The game also boasts an impressive roster of fighters.
The story mode, however, is where the game truly shines even more! The developers have managed to distill the essence of the anime's epic narrative into an interactive experience that is both engaging and emotionally resonant. The pacing is expertly crafted, and the game's story arcs are faithful to the source material. Each pivotal moment is presented with a cinematic flair that rivals even the best adaptations in the industry. This game allows players to relive their cherished memories of the series while forging new ones within its digital realm.

In conclusion, Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is an absolute masterpiece, earning a well-deserved 5/5 rating. Its captivating gameplay, breathtaking graphics, and enthralling storyline make it a must-play for fans and newcomers alike. The developers have not only paid tribute to the iconic series, but they have also elevated the gaming experience to a whole new level. Dragon Ball Z is, without a doubt, the perfect way to relive old memories and create new ones in the process.

I paid $14.99 on a flash sale... looks like you can purchase it for $21.24 at the time of this review. DO NOT HESITATE IF YOU'RE EVEN CONSIDERING IT AT THIS PRICE! Feels like a steal I would have easily paid the $59.00 average price for a game of this quality.

*Controller apparently is a must. I use one on my PC, but I've heard the M&K isn't the best options for this game.",1683067228,1683067228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
851850,137691494,76561198056302780,0,9,589,0,274,1683092817,"I've played for a small chunk of time compared to the amount of game content I have left to play.  I can say that I've played Dragon Ball games since Ultimate Battle, and into Budokai.  I have played the Raging Blast and Tenkaichi series games too. I currently play FighterZ and used retroarch for Legend and DB Kart more recently.  I haven't played much of the MMO games though.  I love the 2-D side fighting along with the three dimensional aspects from RB and UT.  This game is what Dragon Ball really needs to translate the story properly.  This story starts early in DBZ and lets you feel the length of the story in a very positive way! It's fun to play and immerse yourself into the world and be a part of it playing different characters as you progress.  The RPG elements are not overwhelming.  They are simple once you get the feel for it knowing what you're looking at, yet filling.  I am playing on hard which requires you to learn the game.  I am looking forward to more boss battles to beat the challenge.  Regardless on the type of game you want to play, whether it be a fighter, MMO, or open world/railed story mode, you want this game in your collection.  I play this game when I want to roam around and have fun with the story.  The DLC is going to be fun to get into.  It is structured like LOTR Shadow of War/Mordor, in the sense that your dlc stories are like separate slightly smaller games on their own using the same engines and build. Some you can access right away and others require you to beat Kakarot first.  I haven't played any yet because I want to finish the main game first.  I picked up the base game and Season 1 pass on the sale.  So glad I did.  I do wish there were more difficulty settings. A very hard and ultimate difficulty would be a nice addition to the standard three.  OH YEAH! there is a digital version of the card game you can access as well! From the main menu or even in game from terminals in cities! You can collect cards in the main game or while you play the card game itself.  I can't wait.  The card game is loosing online support but from what I read will still be playable against CPU.  So great.  I still have all my old cards!  This game is definitely worth it.  This game is terrific for people wanting a casual or semi challenging RPG and/or DB fans.  My main issue is that I want more content and combat mechanics!

Brings the beloved anime to life, just right.
From the Saiyan saga to Buu's demise,
Revisit the story and let your power rise.

As Goku, you'll train and fight with friends,
Exploring the world, where adventure never ends.
Master the Kamehameha and other techniques,
Test your skills against foes, both strong and unique.

The graphics are stunning, the details so fine,
Capturing the essence of each character and line.
The voice acting brings the story to life,
With music that will fill you with pure delight.

Relive the battles that defined the show,
Like Frieza's defeat or the Cell Games, you know.
Experience the emotions, the triumphs, the strife,
As you progress through the game, and emerge as a warrior of life.

So take the journey, as a Saiyan or a Z-fighter,
And immerse yourself in the world of Dragon Ball, brighter.

Controls are terrible:

K&M hotkeys are clearly designed by someone who hasn't played PC games since the 90s.

When you go to Settings to change Icons to Keyboard +Mouse it gets reverted back to Type 2 as soon as you turn the game off.

And just after some testing I can confirm that for no reason whatsoever the directions will lock you

--->Quick example: S+ Space is the command for jumping backwards to dodge. Sometimes, for no reason, it will lock you into a forward dodge. It will take multiple times of  using totally  separate actions to ""shake it off""

So many poorly written/voice acted cutscenes.

And the fights are literally JUST ABILITY SPAM! It's non stop.

Let me be abundantly clear: THIS GAME ISN'T DIFFICULT, it's just block or dodge in almost the exact same patterns with an increasing tempo based on enemy health.

This game was clearly meant  to be a microtransaction fiasco that took an absolute shit.

First, as much as they tried to make this game compatible with a keyboard and mouse, it was meant for a game controller. The game constantly provide prompts to use controller buttons rather than referring to the keyboard and mouse buttons that I'm using; ""what button do I mash to cat the fish?"". This leads to the second problem, wonky controls. During fights, evading moves are an issue when the game forces you to be up close when your're trying back up. Other problems is trying to search for the key bindings, when some are incorrectly listed, example world map (in the map section press Z not S). When teaching moves, the legend still refers to the game pad when you're working with a keyboard+mouse. 

Great, half way into the game, I can't use the items hotkey to heal mid battle.

Lastly, the tutorial is all over the place. One moment you get spammed with multiple tutorial windows, the next you're trying to find the right key to interact with a dinosaur. Many of these problems can be solved by constantly searching on the forums to find if anyone else is experiencing these problems. Fortunately, there are others out there that do, which is a relief, but implies that this game should have had more beta testers to help smooth this game out. It's also a bit annoying when you're fighting others that have multiple fighting moves, but when playing those same characters, you're unable to pull off those special moves yourself (ex. stunning, beams); the ""Super Attacks"" feature is broken",1679787861,1682182044,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. If you start thinking about the world and rules of DBZ, you will be frustrated. Kids are less likely to notice. 
2. The game-play is simple and reminiscent of many of action games. In this case it's much flashyer and in the sky, which is cool, but caters itself to a less experienced audience(game-play wise). 
3. This game is made for people who are new to DBZ but there are better experiences and introductions to it out there. 

The game is a solid experience that accomplishes what it set out to do and that was a low bar.

After a decent amount of time with Kakarot I feel I can recommend it to most. The gameplay is a mix of action RPG fights as many DBZ characters and exploring the overworld gathering resources and doing side quests to power up your characters. The fights themselves are usually satisfying and cinematic while doing a great job making you feel stronger as you level up. The overworld isn't amazing but serves its purpose and has many areas and secrets to explore.

Some small gripes I have include boring filler battles (Prepare to fight the same RR army robots a couple dozen times), and the combat becoming a tad stale. Even across many different fights, while the opponent's attacks, voice lines, and cutscenes are quite different, the way you fight and defeat each of them rarely differ. Also the game's built in card game is actually extinct, which is disappointing when a lot of in-game rewards are cards for a game nobody ever plays.

As long as you're a fan of or at least interested in the Dragon Ball Universe, there's enough satisfaction in becoming stronger and progressing the story to keep going to the end.

All in all I would rate Kakarot as follows:

As an open world RPG: 7
As a whole: 8

This is, like, almost an objectively bad game. Horrible combat, buggy as fuck, god awful camera. Really has no intention of making you feel (lol) like any of these characters. 

This game is ass easy. You will not die as long as you have an above room temperature IQ. That being said, the combat is atrocious. Your characters are push overs. Every, and I mean EVERY enemy has super armor. Remember that time Vegeta full power decked a saibaman in the face and it tanked his shot like Superman? No? Oh, well that's the whole game. There are no satisfying offensive or defensive tactics in this game. Just mash B three times, dodge to the left or right, and hit B three more times. Every boss fight is like a Destiny health sponge boss that you unload on for five minutes. Just awful. And don't even get me started on those training mode bosses you have to fight to unlock more moves. Ugh. 

It's got cute stuff, good graphics, and some funny moments. However, this is just like every other low budget Dragon Ball video game. Cutscenes are mostly characters standing in place exposition dumping on things you already know. They went balls deep on animating Recoome's fight with Goku, but left out Final Flash lol. 

I know zoomers have taken to calling this game ""GOATED AND PEAK"" or whatever, but I just can't. The open world is full of Superman 64 rings to collect and nothing else. Well, that's not entirely true. If you like fetch quests that all play out the same then sure, have fun. You like the fishing from FFXV, dude? You like mini games? Alright, have fun catching the four varieties of fish in the game.",1681000691,1681000718,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game's graphics are impressive, and the attention to detail in the game world is phenomenal. As a player, you get to take control of Goku, one of the most iconic characters from the Dragon Ball Z series, as well as other characters like Gohan, Piccolo, and Vegeta. The game covers the entire Dragon Ball Z saga, from the Saiyan arc all the way to the Buu saga, so you'll get to experience all of your favorite moments from the show.

One of the best things about Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is the combat system. The combat is fast-paced and intense, and the game does a great job of making you feel like you're really in the middle of a Dragon Ball Z battle. Each character has a unique set of moves and abilities, and you can also unlock special moves and transformations as you progress through the game.

The game also features a robust skill tree system that allows you to customize your character's abilities and stats. You can choose to focus on specific areas like melee combat, Ki attacks, or support abilities, depending on your play style.

Another great feature of Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is the open world exploration. You can fly around the world, interacting with various characters, completing side quests, and collecting items. The world is vast and detailed, and there are plenty of secrets to uncover.

One area where the game falls a bit short is in its side quests. While some of the side quests are interesting and offer unique challenges, many of them feel repetitive and don't add much to the overall experience.

Overall, Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is an excellent game for fans of the series. The combat system, skill tree, and open world exploration are all top-notch, and the game does a great job of capturing the spirit of the Dragon Ball Z anime. The only real downside is the occasionally repetitive side quests.",1680109737,1680109737,True,1,0,0.490945667028427124,0,True,False,False

You don't have to take small amount of efforts to collect any item. BUT when it comes to DLCs they lack content except (Future Trunks DLC) it's just repeating the same stuff for levelling up. The only fun mode is in Power awakes part 2 where you have to beat small fries in the training mode super fun mode when you maxed out both Goku and Vegeta. Fusion are OP in the game and I LOVE IT! Vegito and Gotenks are crazy good when it comes to beating high level opponents. Overall Super fun game when you level up your characters with decent good combat.

Fighting is a little basic but the system for super moves is well fleshed out and takes an eternity to get through. It isn't the best game I have ever played but I have had a good time just getting to spend time in the Dragon ball universe.

This game is more about getting to relive all of the stories from the show in real time than it is about complex fighting combos, though it does have a decent amount of those. I only sort of know the story of dragon ball Z up to the arc with Cell and I am pretty sure it all came out before I was born, but I am very interested to see where it goes afterwards, the Namek arc is kind of a drag to me except Vegeta is hilarious.

That being said, despite being called kakarot you spend almost no time playing Goku, atleast that's what I've experienced so far I am only going through the Namek arc right now.

Quite a lot of side content and subquests, as a fan of the series from childhood I can't think of a game that excels above this one in recreating the source material except for the Budokai Tenkaichi series, and that is simply in terms of the battle mechanics.

This is the definitive DBZ story experience in a video game, and until Budokai Tenkaichi 4 should be considered far and away the best DBZ game to date (some Super content as well)

Anyone who is a fan of the genre should pick this up, and it amazes me how much the voice cast continues to lend their talent through the years to these games..the only games that beat this in terms of fighting are DB Figherz (for 2d fighting fans) and DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and only marginally...and this is the best retelling of the main story through a video game, ever!!

You kill enemies, you gain xp, you grow your stats and progress the story. It's something I've been waiting for since I was about 12, I'm going on 27 now, and I couldn't be happier.

The only downside to the whole experience was how the entire world just felt...empty. Sure you can fish and you can play baseball...but that's it. It would've been great if you could enter tournaments with specific conditions and limits, drive around in the world in cars like Goku, Picollo and Vegeta had to do when getting their driver's licence, balance school life with crime fighting for Gohan. There's soooooo many things you can pop into this, but it just feels bland when going from mission to mission. To add to this, I honestly also feel like Bandai Namco really REALLY has just been shitting out the same stuff every time rather than try add more stuff for the player to do.

I am aware that people take issue with Bandai's handling of pricing, and the Dragon Ball Super DLC. However I will not be discussing those things in this review. I will be updating this as I plan to buy the Bardock Expansion. 

Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is the first real open world experience we've gotten to see in the Dragon Ball franchise. I have grown up playing over a multitude of Dragon Ball games. Seeing all different adaptations to Z's story, I was enthusiastic to see how this game would compare. The game is BEAUTIFUL, there is very obvious care put into this game visually. As the story progresses, the detail of the games CG cutscenes also become more detailed. If I were to guess, this would most likely be to homage the development of the Z anime's style. This game nails world building, sound design, tone setting, in ways that Dragon Ball hasn't gotten before. The song pieces in the game are directly from the anime, now redone in new quality. I usually roll my eyes at another Dragon Ball game release, in which you experience the Saga fights in a very cut and dry manner, However this game has become an absolute essential to me. I have but one complaint with this game. Considering this is still a [u]game[/u] I know I can't expect them to include everything from the original Z, but you get to miss out on what I'd deem some of Z's BEST moments. For instance,[spoiler] the amazing choreography in the fight between Majin Vegeta and Goku are cut down to nothing but a slideshow. They skip out on almost ALL of the 25th World Tournament, they rush Gohan's saiyaman arc, a big plot point in the Cell saga is also dismissed. Goku giving Cell a senzu bean after their fight. In Z, it is clear that Goku sees something in Gohan that everyone else doesn't see, it is a complex father-son dynamic that they share that I feel gets dismissed in Kakarot, and the moment of him giving Gohan the lead to fight Cell is instead now anti-climactic. Candy Vegito is skipped, Vegeta's iconic Final Flash against Cell[/spoiler] is basically skipped, and I'm sure there is more that I could name. To a newcomer, these may not be a big deal to miss out on, however for long-time fans like myself feel bummed out to miss out on these hype and important moments to the story that we enjoyed seeing on our first time. Sometimes the AI can be very annoying as well, but as long as you keep upgrading your characters as your supposed to and make use of the mechanics the game gives you - you'll be fine. 

This game is probably the best retelling of the Dragon Ball Z story in game format, despite it's shortcomings. If they had just taken their time more, I think the game would be a worthy 9 out of 10. I can for sure say the money I spent for the game didn't go to waste. 8/10",1678747507,1678747826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Cutscenes"" looked really good made u feel like your watching DragonBall Z in 3D that actually looks good. Now the biggest con for me were the achievements, because there some grinding one in this that require to get certain items to either make meals or to do the training challenges and some of them are really hard to find from just playing the game through normally. Also this game has nothing to do after beating the story really except collecting items, which is alright if your into wasting your time to get achievements. Didn't play any of the DLC cause Bandai doesn't make new achievements to get from purchasing DLC so no point for me.

The overall production is minimal though, like the game was rushed out. To charge money for the extras they added is a little crazy though. The open world aspects are there but don't really hit with the main game, and the main game's combat is incredibly shallow even up to the majin buu saga. The cutscenes are very samey, the music is subpar at best with the faulconer track mods being the only saving grace and those happen only very rarely. The cutscenes are decently made but I don't really feel like I'm playing dragon ball and 90% of the game is fighting 2 or 3 kinds of enemies. Every 5 hours you might get a boss that does a slightly different move and you can tell from those fights that SOME people cared about this game,probably some writers, too, but for most who worked on it, it's probably just a quick cash grab off nostalgia sadly. If we're lucky we'll get a fully fleshed out version of the same thing sometime in the next 10 years, but if you're looking for a good comprehensive, truly defining dragon ball gameplay experience, go find tenkaichi 3 or wait for the new tenkaichi to release and hope they didn't give it the same treatment they gave this game. Caviat to my negative review is that I'll probably still finish this game because I love dragon ball, but really for 90% of people it's not worth it, especially for the price.",1678159028,1678159028,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Its closer to Legacy of Goku than to any of the fighting dbz console games, the combat comes close to the feel of Tenkaichi but suffers from lack of combos that makes combat get a bit boring after a while, The world is cool to explore at first but feels empty with the same enemies always appearing to fight, some variety of common enemies like we got in the LOG games would have been nice and likely could have made the bland combat a bit more entertaining if there was a bit more strategy to beating foes. Some more interesting side content and collectibles (maybe like the lost Namekians in LOG2) would have been welcome. The cutscenes are inconsistent, some being done very well and mirroring the anime scenes they depict, others feel lazy.

If you're a Dragon ball fan you'll probably enjoy it. I haven't tried the DLC yet as its a bit to expensive in my opinion(my opinion on most DLC, i miss being able to just unlock side content and characters instead of being forced to buy content that 15 years ago, would have just been included in the base game.  Maybe ill pick it up during a sale. This game does feel ripe for an original Dragonball story line following Kid Goku and Co and i hope they capatilize on that, if so ill probably buy the DLC on release if it looks promising. Maybe young fans arent as into that idk, I never cared much for Super so id like to see them go back instead of forward.

If your looking for a good DBZ fighting game look elsewhere.(like emulation) BandaiNamco should know by now that DBZ fans want a remake or a game like Tenkaichi 3 more than anything, but I've pretty much accepted that we wont get that and if we do it will be a shadow of its former self and suffer from predatory DLC instead of including the massive amount of unlocks (and incentive to keep playing) that the original tenkaichi had.",1678031075,1678031075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story telling itself is okay, most of the time the text/speech cut-scenes linger for too long around a 1 second or so where you get an awkward silence, some side quests makes no sense others are really good and are created with the characters personality in mind. Combat itself which is the core of the game is good, its quick and fluid, but then there are the abilities. Galick Gun and Kamehameha beams hit like a wet noodle, they are not the finishers in the anime or manga, but on par with a punch or kick so that is disappointing. The ""open"" world is littered with balls to collect which in my opinion only hurts the gameplay, very boring just flying around and collecting balls (like 1000s of them) when you also get them from fights. The level grinding from world mobs/monsters is terrible, you get almost no exp and eating meals gives you permanent stat boosts but I am not gonna spend 24 hours eating just to get strong. The graphics considering characters and combat effects are really good, but the textures on the world itself looks like its from early 2000. The difficulty sliders seems to reset itself every time i have started up the game and the vsync option dosent work for me, makes the game run at 32 fps with 1-2 fps variation but the game runs at 60 fps locked 100% but with a lot of screen tearing. considering i payed 60 dollars i am disappointed, the game seems a bit rushed or at least many things seems like an afterthought or bolted on after the core gameplay (story/combat) was finished.",1678024936,1678024936,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

Being able to play the old saga's storylines.
With lots of gametime. Over 50 hours gametime and I haven't even gotten to the DLC's.

The game allows you to free roam different area's as you will need to do that so you can upgrade Goku/Vegeta etc. 
You'll be able to play with different characters, not all DBZ characters but the big boys.

I'm really bad at these kind of fighting games, but I managed.
Follows all the iconic storylines from Gohan as a child when the Saiyans invade, to Namek and Frieza, to the Androids and Cell, to Majin Buu.

Sometimes they cut the story line a little short. Per example the most iconic scene IT'S OVER 9000, Frieza SLOWLY sliding in half and Goku stopping Trunks sword with his finger weren't in the game.
They have to make choices, but that was a bad choise not to feature those.
But I love the game, it's fine!

Would recommend this game to anyone.
Even if like me you totally suck at fighting games on PC. (set it on Easy)
Didn't want the game to end..

One thing the devs could add and it seems like a small ammount of work.. is the ability to choose what clothing you wear.. Atleast in the time inbetween Saga's.

I am less than ecstatic.

Didn't even get to max level (300) before demolishing the games current lineup. This second set seems to just throw all of that effort away in yet another ""past"" setting. I'm sure many of us were hoping for a Goku black or tournament of power dlc release.

As the title would suggest, it covers the story of the anime Dragon Ball Z, although, I'd say that's probably one of the biggest problems, but we'll get to that later.

In DBZ Kakarot you get to play as almost all of the major main characters of the show, each with their own unique move sets, abilities, skills, and transformations. Said move sets are also quite nice looking, and change based on the form you're in, and if your ki is surged. The base game content isn't SUPER grindy, although it can get a little annoying at times having to collect all of the necessary orbs to level up your skills. Each of the skills are visually impressive, with decent lighting and sound, and in some situations they even have unique short cinematics that play when you use them. The transformations are also similarly visually impressive, and give you that great power-trip that you'd expect when transforming into a being of great power. The music is also quite good, although from what I can tell, most of it is just taken from other DB media (mostly the anime).

Unfortunately, despite those positives I can't recommend the game unless you're a MASSIVE DB fan, and even then I'd still recommend at least waiting for a price drop.

The fact that the majority of the content is from DBZ is a major problem, based on the fact that most other DB games also use DBZ content instead of taking anything from the original DB, Super, or GT. It's so tiring seeing the same thing that you've seen countless times in other games, just with slight differences in art, and gameplay. The gameplay is pretty good, but the story is disappointing. It's just too stale. On top of that, outside of the MAJOR scenes in the DBZ anime (and in some cases even major scenes) all of the story is shown through crappy in-game recycled character animations, and nonsensical visual behaviour from the characters. For example, [spoiler]when you first go SSJ against Frieza, at one point you just stop fighting, Goku is still floating in his battle stance, and then suddenly just switches to the basic idle flight animation you use when traversing the world.[/spoiler] It's so jarring and reeks of laziness. Clipping is frequent, and the majority of voice lines aren't even voiced, they're just subtitled. Characters repeat the exact same noises and phrases over and over and over again in battle regardless of if they match or not. A perfect example is when almost any character charges their ki. They yell very calmly, which fits the charging. However, when they transform into SSJ, SSJ2, SSJ3, etc, they use the EXACT SAME CALM YELLING. In the DBZ Anime and Manga, Goku pretty much bursts his f*cking lungs with how much he screams, yet in DBZ kakarot it's just a calm, recycled yell that you've already heard 100+ times. On top of that he uses the same yell when he surges. This is even more absurd when you surge in the god forms, mainly SSB. The community system is done so poorly as well. Unless you're going for achievements, or you wanna level up your skills/characters a teeny bit quicker, there's absolutely no incentive to putting any time or effort into the system. Why would I spend hours collecting items and levelling up what is basically digital cards for a 10-20% damage boost, when I could just transform into ANY of the forms and become significantly stronger in a split second? The meal system is also unfortunately quite poorly designed. Some of most efficient meals you can use to increase your stats still only increase them by a couple hundred points, when by the end of the game you have literally millions of points just in HP alone... Outside of the character levelling, none of the systems are even slightly interesting or even all that useful.

Edit: As of 22/02/2023 I have played through each DLC, including the new Bardock one, so my review edit is basically just adding to the DLC portion.

The DLCs are a mixed bag. A new power awakens P1 has basically no story, doesn't follow the canon of the show or manga, and is essentially just [spoiler]""get given every form that already exists so new playthroughs can become super op, get given SSG, and use items to become super high levelled, after a few short copy-pasted fights against Whis.""[/spoiler] Once you've done that with Goku and Vegeta, that's it, DLC 1 over. A new power awakens P2 is a little better, with a short story that MOSTLY follows the canon of DB Super, but even then, you just get given SSB after a few short fights that are copy-pasted from the previous DLC. And the sad thing is, the forms are super cool, so if you want to use these awesome forms, you first have to play through a sh*t pair of DLCs, although the boss fight at the end of DLC 2 is pretty good, but it's not really worth it to replay it. Trunks - The warrior of hope is definitely better. Future Trunks' story isn't usually covered in DBZ media, so it's a nice breath of fresh air compared to the recycled base game. Both Future Trunks and Future Gohan have some pretty nice movesets, especially Trunks due to his unique moves. A fair few are recycled from Future Trunks in the base game, and from other characters, but the couple unique ones feel nice and have that classic DB flashy-ness to them. The addition of the Future Buu Saga is also a nice addition, so no complaints with this DLC. Bardock - Alone Against Fate is by far the BEST DLC so far. As usual, Bardocks base combos look great and are a massive step up from base game and even the Future Trunks DLC. All of Bardocks moves are also unique, and despite Bardock being quite weak in canon, they all feel extremely strong, and again, have a nice, flashy look to them. The story is similar to the Future Trunks DLC in that it's a nice breath of fresh air. Bardocks crew actually have a little bit of character development via the main quest and sub-stories, so that's a good addition. The only real dissapointment is how short it is. Maybe they could've included the 'Past' portion of the original Bardock story? But regardless, it feels like a step up in quality. One more annoying thing, which thankfully doesn't really apply to DLC 3 and 4, is that you need to grind a sh*t ton of orbs for any of Goku and Vegeta's new god-power moves, which can take hours.

[b]Conlusion:[/b] After the additional 100 or so hours I've put into the game, including playing through each DLC, and even adding mods once I was bored, I still can't really recommend the game, unless you're a massive fan of the gameplay (which I feel gets repetitive easily), a DBZ super-fan that's not tired of the recycled story, or you intend on modding the ever-loving sh*t out of the game. Outside of DLC 3 and 4, the story, animations, and voicing are just so poorly developed, and it feels like very little effort was actually put into them. The only saving grace for the base game is by far the mods, however even that's limited as most of the decent mods broke once the Bardock DLC was released. If you honestly really wanna try the game, wait until it's on sale. Otherwise, steer clear.

[i]TLDR; Outside of DLC 3 and 4, the game and its extra content feels half-baked, over-used/stale, and that very little effort was put into actually making it fun enough to warrant a purchase and proper playthrough unless you're a DBZ super-fan, get the game on sale, or have NEVER played a DB game covering DBZ.[/i]",1637753245,1677073669,False,57,9,0.540577590465545654,3,True,False,False

The fighting in this game is surprisingly pretty good but you should be careful if you don't want to cheese the entire game because some moves are spammable and absolutely broken (Ex: Big Bang Attack). Then again some of the enemies seem nearly impossible to beat without using said moves. You tend to get into a habit of vanish spam and then super attack rinse and repeat.

Then again, the game is still fun to play especially if you are, like the rest of us, patiently waiting for the next DBZ game to drop while simultaneously wondering if it will be worth a shit at all. If your a man of culture you wish you could play Xenoverse 3, FighterZ 2, or Budokai Tenkaichi 4 even, but this is what those shit-heads at Bandai Namco have given us.

For every Dragon Ball fan this game on the first run is OMG! From the soundtrack, presentation, exploration, pace, everything is fantastic! But as usual like most Dragon Ball fans we tend to focus on the wrong things when playing a new DB game for the first time. On the second run you see the truth. The combat is basically single button focused, the enemy AI is braindead that does nothing else besides Super Attacks that have a set duration, I mean the enemies don't even evade, they just sit there and tank everything if their super attack animation has started, which is ridiculous. Grinding to level up is useless sibce you get enormous catch up levels with the main story. If you are not a Dragon Ball fan this game is garbage. If you are tho and haven't played it yet, this is a must have for the first play through! After that, bury it and leave the beautiful memories you got out of it be.

The game's graphics are top-notch, with beautiful cel-shaded visuals that capture the look and feel of the anime. The game's open-world exploration element is a standout feature, offering players the ability to explore iconic locations from the Dragon Ball Z universe, complete side quests, and find hidden items.

The game's combat system is also well-executed, with fast-paced and satisfying battles that require a good mix of strategy and reflexes. Players can chain together a variety of moves and techniques to create devastating combos, while also dodging and blocking enemy attacks. The inclusion of various playable characters with unique moves and abilities also adds to the game's overall depth and replayability.

Another highlight of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is the attention to detail in the story mode. The game covers all of the major arcs from the anime series, offering a comprehensive and immersive experience for fans. The game also includes new story content that adds to the overall narrative, offering fresh perspectives on classic characters and events.

However, the game is not without its flaws. While the game's open-world exploration element is impressive, it can feel a bit repetitive after a while, and some side quests can feel like filler content. Additionally, the game's camera can be problematic at times, making it difficult to keep track of enemies during more hectic battles.

Overall, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a must-play for fans of the series. It offers an immersive and faithful retelling of the classic Dragon Ball Z storyline, with excellent graphics and a well-executed combat system. While the open-world exploration element and side quests could be improved, the game's attention to detail in the story mode makes up for these shortcomings. With that in mind, I give Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot a score of 8/10.",1676453554,1676453554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can totally understand people who do not like this game but I always wanted a game where you could play through the whole story of DBZ and until this game we didn´t get a propper game which really delivered the story of DBZ from start to finish. Had alot of fun. Played in on several weekends with my friends to complete everything. Had alot of fun with it. Still waiting for the DLCs to launch but till then I will play the new Card Game they included into the game.

EDIT: Now that we have the DLC Pack 2 available I played trough the first DLC with Bardock, Father of Kakarot. I still am very happy with it and can't wait for the next DLCs to be revealed",1604235423,1676141237,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a game it´s kind of repetitive at some point but it´s very clear that tries to reach a great spectrum of ages altough the simplistic but suprisingly fun combat makes up for some of it. The real con that has (besides the desicion of not showing blood lilke the original series and manga releases and some interface design issues because of the console oriented release) is the music, it does a great effort to capture the essence of the series but falls out short in variety if you make a completionist run. Apart from that it´s a nice way to revisit the DBZ history with some sidequests that add a little more for the fans of the franchise.

The major story beats are presented in a flashy & gorgeous fashion, flying around the world is fun, there's tons of details big and small that fans can enjoy, and I really liked the community board where you can arrange badges representing characters to give you powerups, w/ certain groupings dishing out cute exchanges between them as they give you bonus upgrades. This RPG is probably the most realized the DBZ world has ever felt in video games. While its great to see alot of these sidequests add more to the universe, unfortunately there's not alot of variety in them as most of them boil down to fetch quests or combating foes. Combat is also unbalanced, but not in a difficult way: on the default difficulty (they patched more options in later) the game starts out not too hard but after a while it becomes SUPER easy unless you fight villainous enemies, super buffed versions of previous enemies, and even then you'll be strong enough to whoop them in the post-game when you doubtlessly have many levels under your belt, a bunch of powerful abilities, and you maybe learn how OP surge mode is.

For a game that's saying all sorts of things about an open world and free roam, there sure isn't much open world and free roam stuff going on.
Basically you can fly around and recreate all the thrills of Superman 64, beat up on some random encounters that can't hold a candle to you, gather materials for no real reason, or go to the next story mission. And if you get to the story missions, that's where the gameplay actually stops! Get ready for two hours of cutscenes in between like two or three fights. They give you a skip, but even with that option it takes forever to get control back.

The only people I can recommend this game to are the people who want to watch Dragon Ball Z, but have never seen a single minute of it. Because it's all here! Believe you me, there is nothing that's been cut out. There's even some extra stuff thrown in to waste my time! I made it to the Namek Saga and I'm dreading the Frieza fight. His five minutes are going to be up by the time I'm in a retirement home. And speaking of! I love how the game is called Kakarot, Goku is PROMINENTLY featured, and so far I've spent the entire game as Gohan. Thanks guys! Great idea to base a game around a character that spends 90% of his time either in the ICU or straight up dead. Brilliant.",1675957843,1675957843,False,0,2,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The game play overall kind of sucks, but in my opinion in comparison to let's say ""Dragon ball Xenoverse"" it was a much better replay of the story line. It has a similar look and feel to Xenoverse but the story lines were super hashed out and I absolutely loved the parts I have plays so far. Xenoverse would be on par with this, but what they lack is a proper chat function. So I would place this game much much higher on the enjoyment scale than the other one because of that simple fact. This game focuses on the story line aspect, and that is how they delivered. It is a little difficult to get use to the advancement processes, but I found out that you can power up your community with your gifts much later. Like in the android saga later. The levels are based on story line, so it is actually better to advance the story line than to grind, and I like that aspect. In other words, I love the fact that if I wanted to I can just play right through the story in real time.. And ""CHOOSE"" to fight when I want to hunt for battles.

+ Trunks DLC is awesome and a really cool ""what-if"" kind of thing
+ Fully animated cinematics look absolutely stunning
+ DBZ encyclopedia is really fun to flip through and read

Negatives:
- Fully animated cinematics are few and far in-between, usually only reserved for the biggest scenes of the series. There are a lot of static cutscenes of characters just standing still and barely moving
- Why are there so many moments with no voice acting and only text blurbs?
- Random story omissions or changes are really weird and dumb
- No blood
- No English soundtrack. Japanese soundtrack is inferior and some of the best scenes are neutered due to the bad music. There were mods to change the music, but those mods no longer work after recent patches
- Can't transform in free roam, no alternate costumes
- No engaging side quests and content outside of the main storyline

Overall:
I am the absolute biggest Dragon Ball Z fanatic, but this is one of the most disappointing games I've experienced. Legacy of Goku 2 and Buu's Fury were two of my favorite games from my childhood, and I always dreamt of a console version and this is essentially that. A good game, but not as good as Legacy of Goku 2 or Buu's Fury. If this game is on a deep sale, go and grab it but nowhere near full price.

Also has lite RPG elements. (don't bother grinding for levels, you'll gain all the levels the game wants you to have during the story.) Like, you'll be fighting the NPC baddies for like 2k experence and then watch a cutscene and get 25k, followed by a story battle and gain another 20k. It's only worth it for the Orbs which are used to unlock moves (and unlock their powered up forms)

There are also mods for it. I personally got a Bruce Falconer mod.

A must play for any Dragon Ball fan, especially on PC since the game really shines with the inclusion of mods which increase the difficulty, clear up the HUD, and modify the soundtrack to reflect that of the US Funimation broadcast.

The fights are dynamic, cinematic, engaging and very stylish. The action can be very fast especially in group fights and you need to rely on instincts and fast reflexes to dodge attacks while also managing your energy meters. I recommend using a mod to increase the difficulty and to avoid using health items mid combat if you want to get the most out of it. Every fight can be cinematic and memorable if you go in under leveled and vary your moves. There are also various characters to play as and a variety of different enemy types with their own unique fighting styles and moves.

The story is massive, covers pretty much the whole manga while expanding on many characters and events through side missions. The world also changes throughout the story and NPCs change locations and dialogues, commenting on different events, to give a sense of the passage of time. The graphics are also true to the show and make the world come alive.

The base game itself was fun and worth $60 on release, but all the DLC that came after were not.  I paid $104 for my Ultimate edition preorder here in the Eastern US and that only included the first season pass.  The second season pass has been released at $40, the cost the game itself was raised from $40 back to $60 here in the US, and reading comments on steam news posts it's even worse in other countries. 
Beyond the greed of the company there is also just pure laziness or spite for PC players as we haven't received any news on a next gen patch that console players already got.  So not only do you have to pay more now to buy the game on PC, but you are actually buying an inferior version compared to the console versions.
I wanted to restate at the end that the game itself was fun when it released, but dropping a new $40 DLC and jacking the price of the game up 3-4 years later for no reason is just plain greedy.",1673965736,1673965736,False,15,1,0.563657641410827637,2,True,False,False

-I loved the sub stories for the most part, some I wish were expanded upon because they were quite amusing.
-I loved the progression and how it felt throughout the game.
-the fighting was fluid, fun and easy to grasp, with challenging moments due to ememies ganging up, and/or using super moves that potentially worked well together.
-I like that they went up to [spoilers] the buu arc [/spoilers] so that they could elaborate upon each arc and not overwhelm themselves with too much.

Now some things i didn't like.
-vehicles, I don't know why, but everytime vehicles are put into a dragon ball game, I have not enjoyed it, but with this specific two vehicles, the walker and the car, it felt shoehorned in and like they didn't really think through how to make the challenges with them more fun, I would probably have it so you race on circuits with people, using different attackes depending on the player you are playing as to slow down or break the other vehicles.
-There isn't a satisfying new game plus in this game or any of it's dlcs. you are just able to go back as your characters who were in the saga (which makes lots of sense) but without any late game abilities barring [spoilers] super saiyan god and super saiyan god super saiyan if you have the corresponding dlcs [/spoilers] but like, why can't i use my ultimate special beam cannon with piccolo? that kind of thing makes the game fun by giving you the ability to be overpowered after you've beaten its challenges
-the original z fighters are not able to be played, which is fine, but they are really hard to make into worth while support characters.
-i would say bardock alone against fate, and trunks warrior of hope are the only real worth while dlcs for their story, the plot for the others so far are sparse, though the transformations are nice.",1673838877,1673838877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love dragon ball games. ever since I was a kid and this game although was a nice little stamp for people the game does not feel alive to me, the open world felt bland and I don't really count it open world with it being sections of big areas. battles boiled down to just simple use a super move till it, hits. The cutscenes were great but that's as far as I'll go with it. It stopped being enjoyable after sayian arc and side quest felt pointless and stupid. I never felt character growth of any such here. any grinding felt pointless with them giving enough experience to just move on with the story. And the bloody dlc- holy crap what a way to ruin it for anyone who bought the season pass. the first dlc was a waste. you just grind levels and can fast track yourself to get super sayian if you do it before the main story. the 2nd one was more grinding so you can waste time to level up everyone so they have some use during the main event. They give something new with a whole area filled with enemy's and new supers but it still does not feel anywhere near enough to make it feel new and refreshing after the main story. the freiza fight was nice and a step up. Trunks dlc was the best out of anything we've gotten so far. the characters had amazing fights and the cutscenes were top of the line. it really felt like the world had gone to hell and a threat was waiting for its chance to hit, and it even went a little farther with it then the original episode of trunks. It was awesome! 

But uh- That's where season pass 1 ends. anyone who paid for ultimate edition gets jack past that. and they have the balls to charge $30 for season pass 2 or if you want $20 for the next episode- Nah screw you guys. its $10 at best with only 2-3 hours of content.  

Get the game and dlc on a good sale or off a key site.

Edit: I do not condone any sort of review bombing or is my review made because of the next gen update that has not come to the pc yet. I do not care about it, This is a late review I didn't plan on making since I was waiting for the next dlc to come out and well- It came out for season pass 2 after the ultimate edition of the game ended up not being so ultimate.

Man. I hate that I have to change this review to a negative... but I feel so cheated. I bought the ultimate edition on a pre order, because I love DB franchise. I bought it because I thought they promised to release all future content free of charge. Was hyping myself up for the Bardock DLC for weeks, and when I got online today I see the price tag of nearly $55CAD for the Season Pass 2, or ~$27CAD for Bardock DLC alone. WHY??? 

Also realizing now that they took away the Ultimate Edition from Steam Store and replaced it with ""Legendary Edition"" which STILL COSTS LESS THAN BUYING ULT EDITION + SEASON PASS 2.

BANDAI, WTF??? When will you learn to stop treating your biggest fans/supporters like garbage? 

Where is the Next-Gen update for this game that PS5 / XBox Series received/is receiving? 

I can't bring myself to buy the Season Pass 2 at full price. I want to play the Bardock episode, but not at $55 and not stand-alone at $27. It's ridiculous. HONOR YOUR PROMISES BANDAI I SPENT $125 ON THIS GAME ON RELEASE. 

I am the biggest Dragon Ball fan that any of my friends know, and so you know how upset I must be to not be willing to drop more money on Dragon Ball content. Sad day.

ORIGINAL POST Posted: 20 Feb, 2020 @ 2:15pm: 

If you didn't like the show, or the many games that came before this one, you probably won't like this one. Shocker. 

If you DO like the show, and you DID enjoy the games that came before this one, you'll probably love this game and continue to play even after you beat the story. There's a lot to do, and it's a really fun open-world experience. Unlike the majority of the other Dragon Ball RPGs out there, it's a refreshing take on the Dragon Ball Universe. 

Complaints:
- you can't openly play as fusion characters; just 1 or 2 battles and that's it. 
- they miss some important moments in the series (e.g. Vegeta Final Flash, Trunks Vs. Cell, Battle Inside Majin Buu, etc)
- no co-op or multiplayer
- no difficulty settings


Here's to hoping they delve into the Dragon Ball Super territory with future DLCs. 
Or, at least give us some of the movies (Fusion Reborn, LSS Broly, etc) 


Anyway, good game for any Dragon Ball fan. Would recommend ONLY if you enjoy the series.",1582226139,1673629147,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never got past the first fight, because the game blinds you with controller prompts instead of keyboard prompts.
If you have a controller, that's awesome, but as a PC port with Keyboard controls (Which it lets you customise in the menu)... I'd expect better tutorial prompts.

Its just so frustrating when your trying to learn the controls to play the game!
You have no controller, its set to keyboard and it tells you to just hold LR or X + Y.
Or maybe you could allow people who bought it on a PC platform to love your game, by just giving all the controls in Keyboard format when they are playing with a keyboard... In a game which you allow the controls to be customised for.

I'd give it about a 3.7/5.
On one hand, it's probably the most pure and vivid versions of the story for any DBZ game ever, on the other hand, the game seems very bland after 21 hours. It feels like the developers just wanted to make another game retelling the same old tired story with an open world aspect and didn't want to take any real risks with gameplay. The game feels way too easy even on hard mode and restricting myself from healing items. The most fun part of the game is going into battle way underleveled WHEN YOU CAN, because the whole game is artificially level scaled, giving the player massive amounts of XP for simply progressing the story, making hours of battling small enemies entirely pointless.
Combat is fun at first but gets repetitive. The open world falls into the same issues that big open world games have these days. I appreciate the big open world, but there's NOTHING TO DO. All of the side quests are fetch quests or insta-battles.

Literally one of the very best Dragon Ball games I have ever played, outside of the Budokai Tenkaichi series. Trust me I have legally bought and played along with beat almost literally every last Dragon Ball series game available in English, even on consoles, and mobile. I can rattle on for ages about all the other games in the series, however Let's get into some more detail why don't we?

[h1]The following list are the absolute pros of this amazing RPG game![/h1]

[list]
     [*] The leveling system is very in depth, it gives a nice sense of challenge without being too overwhelming.
     [*] Free roam is very immersive! Flying, along with being able to run, and use acrobatics!
     [*] Absolutely amazing storyline that follows the manga and shows almost to a T!
     [*] The battles are decently advanced, but without feeling too arcadelike.
     [*] So many fun and quirky side quests to do!
     [*] Minigames!
     [*] DLCs!

Cut scenes are amazing
In game mechanics is good and much better than older games
UI is easy to understand 

Add dragon ball dlc where kid goku goes to tournament and trains in mountains and this will be wholesome.

You can play this whole game instead of re-watching anime, nostalgia kicks in super high with this being my childhood favorite.

As much as its the only game we will ever get to a free roam dragon ball game. Its still lacking in a great many areas. The rpg system should have never been a thing outside of making power level matter. There are many memories or scenes that are not in the game like the final flash on perfect cell and many others. Cant play as all characters outside of modding the game. It would be great to play as krillin or other characters to level them up on there own over a party dynamic. You cant chose costumes or let alone make your own for the characters but that's a discussion for another time. But above all the game really isn't fun an is kinda tedious at best. Its obvious that a dark soul designed was used as the base where you have to dodge damn near everything only to get a couple hits and whittle down the enemies health which as i said isn't fun an is used to pad the run time for hours which still again isn't fun. The budakai series is a lot more fun than this game.,1673232007,1673232007,False,2,0,0.501742184162139893,0,True,False,False

Always ready to meet the next challenge, even if its bigger than you are. It was the same on Namek. You had improved so much that it made Recoome look like he was standing still. Your power had increased so dramatically since our battle on Earth that I thought you had done it. I thought that you had become a Super Saiyan. It tore me apart. How could a low class soldier accomplish so easily what I, I had struggled my whole life to achieve. After three millennia, it has finally happened. A new Super Saiyan has emerged. And somehow, I had become this pompous witness. Then at last it happened, I too transformed. After living every moment of every day for the singular purpose of surpassing you, I finally became a Super Saiyan myself. The prince had reclaimed his throne and fulfilled his destiny. But no matter how strong I became, your power still exceeded mine. At first I thought it was your loved ones and it was your instinct to protect them that spurred you on and pushed you beyond your limits. But then I found myself with a family of my own, and my power didn't increase at all. I used to fight for the sheer pleasure of it; for the thrill of the hunt, while I had the strength unmeasurable. I spared no one. And yet, you showed mercy to everyone. Even your fiercest enemies. Even me. Yet you never fought to kill, or for revenge; only to test your limits, and to push yourself beyond them. To be become the strongest you could possibly be. How can a Saiyan fight like that and at the same time be so gentle that he wouldn't hurt a fly. Oh, it makes me angry just thinking about it. But, perhaps it is my anger that's made me blind to the truth for so long. I see it now, this day has made it all too clear. You're better than me, Kakarot.

The cutscenes are absolutely well done with very good quality while although the mid dialogue portions are scaled down graphically it made sense to me seeing how even in the show they also done that so to me it was normal. The only cons at all i could think of about this game is the repetitiveness of the combat, however you only notice it after a couple few hours when you finally understand and get good at the combat only then do you realize that it only takes one good combo then a ki blast then repeat to beat everyone in the game sadly but other than that very good!

This isn't just a ""point A to point B"" retelling of the story though, as you now have sidequests and even some surprising fanservice here and there (for example, seeing Launch again after her sudden disappearance in the manga).

The presentation is what really pulled me in though, after seeing those bland cutscenes in Budokai Tenkaichi where characters just stare at each other with dialogue, it blew my mind finally seeing scenes being properly recreated to give a cinematic feel before and after a fight.

Gameplay-wise, the game will feel very familiar to those that played previous console DBZ games, it can be a bit button mashy, but you still have those special moves at your disposal that require button combination, and your characters level up all while gathering ingredients to eat foods that boost your stats.

The animations in the cinematics are very clean, the in-game cinematics are also pretty good. Obviosuly, if you have seen DBZ, you may find this repeating, given that this game is set from the Saiyan Saga going all the way through the Frieza Saga, Cell Saga, and finally ending in the Buu Saga. It has a lot of replayability, many substories that show the love of Dragon Ball that was put in them, showing many different instances that reward the biggest DBZ and original DB fans. The controls are simple to understand, and making a dodge is rewarding. If you get it with the DLCs, it adds a lot more of replayability, showing fragments that are almost coming out the Frieza's Resurrection movie, also the Future Trunks Arc. One of the downsides, in my opinion was the collection of D-Medals. There are 30, 40 all around the different zones. Some of them are sometimes really hard to find, me needing a guide to find some of the ones that I had missing. There is a NPC in every zone that sells the locations of Fishing spots, Mineral's locations, and I don't know why they didn't add an option to buy the actual locations of the D-Medals to show on the map, which would have been a very appreciated feature. Also, the modding community is incredible, adding different suits, modes, etc. The world exploring rewards the players with rare items, fossils or gifts or minerals. The Minerals and fossils can be sold in order to get a good amount of Zeni to then buy healing items or cooking items that help to make meals that have different effects on the party. The gifts are used in the Community's tab, which adds even more effects that occur when ""connecting"" different characters badges that you get throughout the story and side-missions, giving to make a lot of different interactions and combinations that in-game, make sense. The collecting of the actual Dragon Ball is pretty good, and very different from other games like Xenoverse 2. Here, the Dragon Ball when found, are used to unlock different items, and sub-stories, and after this, they re-spread into the world, not being able to search them again until 20 irl minutes pass, also the locations are totally random, and change in each zone, not landing always on the same place. There is no in-game 100% reward, which I think is pretty weird for a game of this caliber, however, having all the achievements of the game feels good, like in any game. My final words...

""An action anime-RPG that rewards players for the knowledge of the series, and makes non-fans learn the story of one of the best animes ever, while mantaining an entertaining experience""

The graphics are great, but the voice acting and robotic character model movement kinda kill it for me in cutscenes. 

The so called ""Open world experience"" is quite awful in my opinion.

I am a longtime fan of DBZ and Goku specifically, but I just couldn't get into this game. Granted, I played it for less than 4 hours, but even in that short of a time frame I was able to come to the conclusion that this isn't the DBZ game I was expecting.

My favorite DBZ game of all time is (unsurprisingly) DBZ:BT3, and I haven't played a game in this series since that has recaptured that magic and nostalgia for me. 

Gotta skip this one unfortunately. Luckily I picked it up on sale so no big loss if I can't get it refunded.

and im very happy to share that i personally only have 1 gripe about the engine/mechanics for the AI... they spam invincibility frame attacks sometimes ... like its a little redonculous at times...

but thats it... it doesnt make the game unplayable or even really detract from the fun...theres plenty`to do nothing feels like a grueling task the combat is fun and super flashy but it doesnt get to technical there are quite a few counters for different situations including the invincibility frame moves it just takes time and patience to pull em off what i like the most about the game is the main story missions and side missions surprisingly having to navigate  to them like in tenkaichi 2 is super fun plus you got stuff to do while your en route idk the game just feels well connected and smooth and the story is off the chain everything just fits together for an over all chill/exciting hybrid experience very very nice guys i cant wait to see what you can do with a little pvp in mind and co op for those of us who dont like pvp 

update: so after the dlc's and the couple years that have passed these devs have just continued to knock it out the park with this title! i stand by my thoughts that if you were to do a little work on a slightly more intuitive combat system with less iframe and more technique required and include a co-op and cac aspects youd make hundreds of millions and earn even more lifelong dbz fans! absolutely amazing job guys and i hope this title is a benchmark that paves the way for a new era of open world cac dbz game in the near future!! killer job devs absolutely killer job!",1579308596,1672028458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember playing the original budokai on my ps2, fighting cell was hard, the enemies kept getting more difficult...but with this game, I have done none of the stupid minigames or stat boosts besides the one it forces you to do in the tutorial.... just the main missions....and i am able to defeat every enemy in every fight with ease, even the fights where I'm outnumbered. There was no point in adding the rpg element in this game since just rushing through the main story is easy already. Mini games have no purpose and they make it seem like this game is open world but its cut up into sections where you have to fast travel plus its empty. The game is repetitive and anyone who finds this game fun is simple minded or someone who didnt want to make the hype seem like it was for nothing. last time I played this game was June 2021..... tried it again today December 24 2022 and it was still a huge disappointment.

Its not that theyre in the game, it is an RPG after all.. Its that they are mundane, repetitive and often time consuming. The side tasks are largely blowing things up in free roam and more fighting. The side quests stories can be nice, but alongside them is more fighting or gathering resources. The side quests also do not have voice acting, and the game just really did not make these things fun. I tried to play this game as an RPG, and I wish I had not.

GOOD: I came in uninitiated to DBZ and the DB universe in general. I LOVED learning the story of DBZ and Frieza, Piccolo, Vegeta and all the others my friends had referenced for so long. The animation and overall feel of the game visually was great. I enjoyed some of the battle cut scenes in particular, though the standard cut scenes were all mostly well done. Some people might find the amount of story telling the game does as a bad thing, I did not. The world looked nice and was fun to fly around in too. The storytelling was probably the games biggest strength overall. 

TL;DR I am glad I played it, but it is definitely flawed. 6/10.",1671741162,1671741301,True,4,0,0.578118681907653809,0,True,False,False

- The thought of giving Chris Sabat or Monia Rial even residuals off this makes me sick (that's a personal con, not a game flaw)
- The flight controls are abysmal and counter-intuitive. At times it gets close to Superman 64 levels of bad. That's barely hyperbole.
- The frequent overuse of dialogue when being sensed for battle or gathering materials (particularly the latter) can be grating
- There's a wild difference between about 5 levels below a group of mobs versus 5 levels below a boss. The latter will almost always result in death especially when fighting the Villainous Zones.

That's it. That's literally all the flaws I can find. Anything else boils down to learning the game itself and getting good.

The pros:

- The art direction is wonderful and the story follows the Z series faithfully
- The humor is great and the characters are portrayed as you'd expect
- It's the first (non FGC) Dragonball game I've played where I actually felt like I was playing not only these specific characters but they felt distinct enough from one another
- Different builds are viable (Go with physical Piccolo, trust me, it's nuts)
- There's a healthy amount of side quests and time for exploration
- The Community Board is engaging and something you want to fill, mix-and-match emblems without it resorting to tedium
- Hard mode is appropriately challenging without being the ""Dark Souls of Action RPGs""


I have played only a handful of truly perfect games in my life. Hades, Witcher 3, Final Fantasy X International come to mind. Both 10/10. So I don't give out 10s or 9s easily, and I won't do so here either. But when I say it's a solid 8 and worth the price, I mean it.

I hope Naruto / Captain Tsubasa narrated story and the 'gameplay' is just like DBZ Kakarot.

Pros:
-Playing as many of the Dragonball Z characters.
-Follows the story pretty faithfully and lets you interact with some of the lesser known characters in the story.
-Controls are not too complicated and it's satisfying executing the moves.
-Lots of side missions.

Cons:
-Can only play as the top tier characters such as Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan, and Piccolo. The other characters can be part of your team but they are regulated to support characters. 
-A bit of a grind when trying to level up at times unless you like doing all the side stories and just flying around collecting Z Orbs to unlock parts of your talent tree for each character.
-Some of the weaker characters (Tien, Yamcha, Krillin) are only support characters, which means you can't directly play as them. Their move sets are also less. Feels like there are some moves missing. This is the main negative for me since I would like to go back through the game and play as someone other than the main characters.
-The fighting mechanic requires a lot of dodging so sometimes it feels like you are just spamming dodges.
-No way to customize what the characters wear.

Other thoughts:
-I would recommend the season pass since the additional games are fun to play and let you unlock Super's level ups.
-I played using a controller and I found I liked playing with it better.
-The game follows the story so there are times you can not change characters. While this could be viewed as a bad thing, this game is about following the story so I didn't list it as something bad.
-There is a lot to the game so definitely look through the menu screen.",1671244991,1671244991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]


[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]


It is time to experience Dragon Ball Z like never before! Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is an open-world action RPG where you will fish, eat, train, fly, and battle your way through 3 different story arcs in intense cinematic matches. Level up your heroes so you can rise to the challenges you will come across throughout your travels and deepen the bonds with other heroes in the DBZ universe to push your limits even more. And with loads of side quests telling new-never-before seen stories, what more could you ask for?


[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]


Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is rated Unsupported on Steam and I have to disagree with the rating. Kakarot runs right out of the box on the stable Proton branch and with a couple of tweaking, it feels almost like it was made specifically for this device. I did play primarily using Proton GE 7-42, but it should work perfectly fine on the stable branch.

I played around a bit with the framerate and felt the smooth 50 was the best. It did come with some higher battery drain, but moving around and battles just felt like significantly better than lower FPS. To help with stability, I did bring the Internal Rendering Resolution to 95 instead of 100. This helped just enough to keep most actions at around 50. I did notice some small drops to 48 when flying fast in open areas and drops to 30 when either in a cutscene or a boss was prepping for an ultimate attack, but this dissipated quickly too.

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot hasn't really had any other issues that I have noticed so far. Other than some very minor areas where framerate can dip, the game holds strong and sticks under a 16W battery for around 3 - 3.5 hours of battery on a full charge. Don't let that Unsupported rating fool you, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot not only works on Deck, but this is by far the best way to play!

In-game photos and the settings I used are on our website!

The sad thing is, they have everything there but ONE thing and that one thing makes it so uninteresting to play. The difficulty. There is none. I ALWAYS play this game on hard and each time I check to make sure it is actually selected. It is seriously that bad. Now I am okay at videogames so this for me completely kills any momentum and leaves me feeling a bit empty. Now I know some copers will think this is a good thing, saying difficulty is the devil or something but even those kinds of people would agree that the ""easy"" difficulty is like a 1v1 duel with a toddler. Visually, sound wise, this game is unparalleled when it comes to dragonball games. Some situations do have those really awful read the text dialogue but luckily unlike Xenoverse they are not generally in the story besides tutorials. Seriously those kinds of ""cutscenes"" are a peeve of mine. Haven't played the Trunks DLC yet, and have only heard good things so I will update this review at a later date.

TL;DR Game is way too easy, wait for a sale and consider installing some mods. I do recommend as the game is very beautiful with some of the best cutscenes from any dragonball game

1) the main storyline is fun, major boss fights (especially against Vegeta, Frieza, and Cell) are challenging but fair; it was a major problem in previous dragonball games (e.g. the Budokai Tenkaichi series) that fights against characters who are supposed to be stronger than you were just as much curbstomps as fights against literal whos, and some games overcorrected this issue with fights that were just blatantly unfair. The major fights (more on this qualifier later) feel a lot better than in previous games I've played.
2) Dragonballs actually playing a role in the game. You can collect them and wish back minor antagonists.
3) Some (again, more on that later) sidequests are fun and tie-ins with other parts of the franchise that aren't major parts of the timeframe of DBZ make fans like me happy.

But onto the cons:

1) Some of the less story-important fights were poorly playtested and unbalanced. Especially Dodoria (as Vegeta) and the Android 20 fight. Characters which, in theory, should be weaker than the player character, become brutal to fight because of repetitive and broken movesets. It isn't satisfying to spend half the fight dodging Dr Gero's energy absorption or watch him regen his entire health bar after you've gotten him down to half of his health and it isn't fun fighting him on repeat for an hour.
2) The game is not content to stay in its lane. I don't know who playtested this game and decided ""we need to have fifty different minor enemy encounters that respawn on each map so you can't move around freely, and these enemies will scale with you so it will always be tedious to fight them, and damage you take in these fights will impact fights in the story too."" The thing I dread most in this game is just moving around because I don't want to waste a minute fighting aggro'd saibamen and Red Ribbon Army robots.
3) A lot of the sidequests are fetch quests, some of these don't even tell you where to find what you need, you just have to hope the spawning algorithm puts them in a place you'd look. Some sidequests are also bugged and inaccessible.",1670884025,1670884025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, one time I shit myself so mother fucking hard that blood spewed out my rectum like a wind-x fire hose, my nigga. I'm talking literal blood. It looked like the meat sauce my mama use to make, but I can tell yah it didn't taste like it, believe me I tried it, and oooooh mama was it spicy. Now imagine throw up, sulfur, rotten eggs, skunk spray, garbage, shit that has been sitting out for 5 hours on a hot day with melted cheese on it then afterwards put in the oven, and fungus infested feet. My asshole smells more than 5 centillion times worse than that, my nigga. The stench was so mother fucking raw that it could clear out an entire orphanage in seconds, my nigga. School shootings ain't got nothing on my smelly ass butthole. My butthole is so mother fucking hairy that it looks like a spider web, but the spiders didn't have enough time to eat the bugs out of the web. My asshole is like a literal nuke, i could single handedly wipe out a mother fucking city just like Hiroshima, my nigga. I'm talking nuclear war with my big black fucking asshole, alone. I could spread my cheeks to reveal my dark and moist butthole and let out the biggest, loudest, and smelliest shockwave of unnatural proportions with just the clap of my ass cheeks, alone. I can literally pick up a Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus tank with just my asshole hairs. I could literally scratch and sniff my asshole and it would make brass knuckles.

I sometimes put it in my taco bell and its hotter than 100 reaper peppers in one bite. My asshole burns 24/7, I absorb cream through my asshole just to keep myself sane. It grew mold and now has a mind of its fucking own. It talks to me at night and wants to commit several acts of homicide on this world. Its words alone are more foul than its smell. My fucking asshole can fire cannon sized shits at my victims if I wanted too. I can fart so mother fucking long and hard that I can reach speeds up to Mach 30 and have the ability to fly. I can use the crust of my diarrhea to create a full body suit. I am the main cause of global warming and cannot sleep in a bed without melting it with my ass. My ass cheeks are so god damn crusty and bloody it sounds like sand paper every time I walk, my nigga. I find diarrhea crust all over my fucking house. I haven’t showered a day in my life and my asshole is infected to the brim with multiple infections, it carry’s every disease known to man and more. My asshole hairs suck in any unexpected niggas who dare stand behind me. My asshole sucks them up and incases them in diarrhea like a spiderweb and eats it afterwards, my nigga. Spiderman ain’t shit compared to my asshole. My asshole is Chernobyl on steroids, my nigga. I have the power to cause more destruction than the meteor that killed the dinosaurs, or even the big bang, my nigga. I call that bitch the shittastrophe for a reason, you furry ass monkey. I farted so long one-time I broke the sound barrier and caused millions to go death. I farted the polar ice caps to atoms and caused the Australian and rain forest fires just by my big, black, juicy, wet, stinky, crusty, bloody ass just being in the area. I am on the FBI's most wanted list, but they can never contain the power of my dummy thicc stinky ass, my nigga. My asshole is so lose that I can fit a whole white star up my rectum and consume it through my ass like filter feeding, my nigga. My asshole makes mud slides on the daily, my nigga, I’m talking shitcanos. I can wipe out the surface of any universe with just a meal at taco bell, hoe. I can never use a toilet, and my ass cheeks kill anything in the ocean if I try to shit there. There is no tree that could ever wipe my asshole, and any water that gets in there turns from normal water to reversed chocolate milk. My butthole is the most powerful weapon in all the multiverses. I am mass destruction, bitch. There’s so much sweat on my mother fucking ass that I can slide on my ass hole as a means of transportation while creating a tsunami, my nigga. My asshole is so motherfucking hot, that it makes the earth’s core look like an ice berg. I can easily melt a neutron star with just a gust of wind coming out my ass, you bitch. No matter of weapons can stop me, I am the physical embodiment of war and death itself, I could end the human race in just a bubble fart. I could beat superman with just a mere fart or beat Goku by just my asshole hairs ingulfing him. I can out run the flash and sonic combined with just me farting my asshole off. I was able to reduce god to atoms just by the pure smell of my ass. Thanos couldn't even snap away 1% of my ass, my nigga. I can literally solo the marvel, anime, video game, cartoon and dc universe with my asshole and nothing else. I have the power to literally erase everything and anything in the past, present, and future, with just a wet fart. I decide whether or not you, your family, or anyone else you love to exist or not, bitch.

I am everywhere, anywhere, in any and every area watching you, bitch. You cannot hide from me, mother fucker.

The story is awesome of course because its basically DBZ story line so if you have not watched it in years than you can play it instead of rewatching!

Edit: Should also mention, I played this entirely on the Steam Deck. It says unsupported and I believe that is because it lacks the Cloud Save option.

The reason this game interested me was because many years ago on the Game Boy Advanced they had ""The Legacy Of Goku II"" and that game was one of the only RPG DBZ games around(Atleast the only good one).

This game has a lot in common with that game so if you were looking for a more modern take on it then look no further.

The fighting is pretty decent and it feels good progressing your characters skills.

The cutscenes in this game are glorious. Sometimes even beating the actual anime itself.

The aspects I didn't like are the amount of Orbs and medals you need in order to unlock skills. Orbs are actually not a huge problem but D medals are going to start holding you back from learning your skills. Its not a huge problem but it definitely became annoying to have to try search for D medals in the world in order to train and learn new skills.

The two Dragon Ball Super DLCs are not that great but the latest Trunks DLC is excellent. That Trunks DLC has a lot of heart and emotion put into it so its a great addition to the game.

It cuts corners in some cases narratively from the original anime so as far as story beats goes it's a little more like DBZ Kai. It has loads of easter eggs from both Z and the original Dragon Ball and a lot of the side stories are cute filler that have tongue in cheek references to memes and the overall fandom. The game looks beautiful and is a very accurate representation of the source material visually. The soundtrack sometimes gets a bit repetitive with what tracks you keep hearing and some of the tracks are not to my liking after hearing them as often as you do. The game-play is varied in quality I'd say. The combat system has a little bit of a learning curve and you don't feel like you've mastered it until a little ways into the game, not the most intuitive. But once you have mastered it you do begin to enjoy the fights but then hits a period where it starts to feel stale because you've sort of learned all you can and even if you haven't most of your attacks and abilities are just buffed up versions of what you already knew. So fighting is hit and miss. World exploring and the overall map you can traverse is fun to be in and visually stimulating but after awhile you begin to realize that outside the sub stories there isn't a ton to do in these maps. The world feels lived in especially in cities and towns but none of them offer anything different other than it's location. There's items to find that can do various things for you but again it starts to feel like a chore to go and get them. Besides walking and flying you have other modes of transport which is neat but not necessary since both running and flying is quicker. While the game is called Kakarot you do get to navigate through the game at key moments as other characters, however if you're hoping to play as your favorite side characters than you are out of luck. It is only a handful of people you can play as and the rest are either NPC's or assist characters.

Overall I recommend this game to people who would like to relive the story of DBZ again in an interactive form and especially die hard fans of the franchise but also I would say it is a good way to get to know DBZ if you are unfamiliar with it and don't wanna watch the anime or read the manga. However if you don't enjoy DBZ already and don't have an interest to get into it based on what you already know, I don't think this will win you over.

-skill tree locked to story events presenting artificial difficulty 
-open world sucks its a 2 gear flight system where you get skill tree orbs
-the game looks really good in all cut scenes 
-anything not a cut scene SCREAMS made in unity 
-game seems to run really bad for some reason. (I5 9400 - 16 gig ram - rtx2060)
over all it just feels like a really low effort, low passion game. 
if you want a good dbz game i suggest one of the older games (bodukai 3, ((hot take battle of z)) budokai tenkaichi 3, raging blast, xenoverse 2 or fighter z)

I still remember when games like Tenkaichi Budokai came out and all I was looking for was an accurate adaptation of the anime story into the game. All Ps2 era games were great, the peak of all dragon ball games history, but story wise they always missed something. That something is not missing here on DBZ Kakarot. You never experienced the whole anime yourself? You can just play the game and grasp all the important aspects (with a bit of fillers also) without watching the series. It covers basically every bit of story the whole anime has to offer. Something is still missing here and there (like Goku's endless snake way run before arriving to King Kai's planet) but it's not a big deal to be honest.

Gameplay is ok, I still prefer the Xenoverse style, Kakarot is more centered on boss-like battles where sometimes you just have to dodge an infinite series of enemy attacks, but after you get used to it and learn that the game is just structured this way, you'll make the habit out of it

Music is 10/10, starting from the intro that is basically a remake of the original japanese anime opening (obviously with cha la ed cha la) and a couple of battle themes are taken from the original anime (the japanese version, of course)

Graphics is one of the best I've seen in a db game, much much better than Xenoverse 2 and surprisingly very similar to the anime-like vibes that fighter z have done until now.

Kakarot puts you in the shoes of none other than Son Goku once more to do the tried-and-true Saiyan, Frieza, Cell, Buu arcs again. But this time, it's in the format of an open-world, and there's plenty of leveling and stat allocation in order to hone the Z-FIghters' skills to your exact specifications!

Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot really makes you FEEL like Spider-Ma- Goku, I mean. For real though, it does a good job of giving you a little more insight into the Dragon Ball world, as you can freely explore several maps from the series, and there's dozens of side missions strewn about the world that you can take on as you do the main story that we've all come to love. This game makes it really fun to just fly around and explore the world, looking for items and sidequests, and I don't think it suffers from the issue of collecting tons of different little baubles and trinkets to waste your time.

The combat isn't incredible or innovative by any means- you're going to be performing easy melee combos and breaking it up with big energy blasts and super moves just like every other 3D Dragon Ball fighting game. That's not to say it's not fun; I love blasting baddies and beating bitties as much as the next guy, but if you were strictly looking for some deeper combat, this is not gonna quite scratch that itch for you.

I can confidently say this is the most immersed I've ever been in a Dragon Ball game! It's got so many small side characters from the series that the show seemed to have forgotten about, and is chock-full of references to both Z and the original Dragon Ball, which helps make it seem like one continuous story instead of these chopped-up little episodes. It's awesome seeing so many of Goku's friends brought back!

Any Dragon Ball Z fan will love this- it's graphically impressive, it's nostalgic without being gimmicky, and it's just good, dumb, DBZ fun!

It is, at its core, a fun game that uses the DBZ universe fairly well. It follows the main plot arcs and adds in a lot of fighting sequences to add the gameplay loop. However, it does miss out on some of the story elements. The game makes more sense if you already know the series well, but it does mostly gloss over the story, losing virtually all emotional impact and awesome moments that the series otherwise had.

Gameplay is quite repetitive once you understand how basic combat works and doesn't scale up in challenge as the game goes on. If anything, the early game is harder as more effort is put into making the boss fights unique, but later boss fights devolve into spamming vanish and switching up melee attacks. The end game comes down to a grind, though fortunately you don't have to do much outside of the core story to finish the game.

It is overall a fun game, but there are many missed opportunities that would've made the game far more engaging as a DBZ game. It does have creative fun with the characters and it's a very good DBZ game, but it's method of telling the story is a bland version of what you watch.",1670168631,1670168631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm 18 hours in and most of it felt like a filler episode of the show.
dialogue is slow, even when frenetically pressing the skip button. Animations in cut scenes are stiff. Quests in the game feel like they are either pure grind (at least it can be done quick most of the time) or a fetch quest that involves multiple loading screens.
The fights are flashy, but outside the 'big ones' (notable story fights and those for some bigger upgrades) they are insultingly easy on normal difficulty. Even the harder fights are not really fun. Raditz an Vegeta where fine, but after those you start to discover/unlock new abilities that make the whole thing extremely repetitive (if you want to be efficient).
Enemy variety is not that high actually. Some robots that look slightly different but all do the same. Saibamen in various colors. Frieza force soldiers in varieing shapes (I honestly don't know if they behave differently, they die to fast to notice, the fade into the fight sometimes takes longer then the actual fighting). That's it for the goons to this point. For the big bads: They are all here, that's a plus. Until you fight Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta for the fifth time as part of some upgrade. And at this point it isn't cool anymore, it is annoying as hell to be spammed with unrelentling attacks, permanently just evading stun locks until at least one of them is down.
The maps are clustered with currency but I never actually bothered to collect any of it after the first two hours as mandatory fights and side quests cover you in the stuff.
Staying with the maps: They are nice and pick up various scenes from the show. But there is nothing really to find when you explore. Currency? You don't need it. Reccources? For what? Mostly useless upgrades? Dragonballs? They are extremely easy to find (radar + always the same spots) and even then, the wishes you can make unto this point never felt impactful.

I have no problem with the cheesy diaglogue. I bught into this when I purchased the game. Stupid motivations for side quests? Part of the appeal.
The biggest sin of the game is simply that it is repetative, slow and therefor boring for most of the time.
I'll finish it probably, but this is mostly because I already paid.

I really wanted to like this game, I was a big DBZ fan growing up, and to a small extent enjoyed the Dragonball fighting games.  I was never a huge fighting game fan, and found myself saying ""I wish they'd make a Dragonball RPG"".

The RPG aspect of the game is very shallow and thoughtless.  Basically just buy whatever upgrade becomes available, no picking a skill tree, or deciding which skill to spend points on.  Levelling outside of the story seems pointless, as every boss battle just gives you a massive and incomparable amount of XP that just puts you where you need to be for the next boss.

The combat is absolutely awful.  It goes something like dodge, dodge, dogge, dodge, punch twice, repeat.  Most fights are bosses, and they just spam the same annoying supers over and over while you spam dodge over and over, and eventually whittle them down.  I guess you can call it an action RPG if action constitutes dodging for 95% of a fight, and hitting the punch button once or twice in between.

The ""open world"" which is divided into a bunch of tiny little sections, not actually a World, is empty and bland.  Once you collect the Dragon Balls a few times you realise just how pointless most of it is, and just hurry to the next checkpoint to continue the story.  

The game refuses to save my Keyboard+Mouse settings, every time I start the game I have to go into the settings.  At about 45 hours into the game it started crashing constantly in the menus.  I looked up the error UE4-AT and it seems like the game has had this issue for years, on consoles and PC alike, and they just never bothered to fix it.  Don't waste your time or money.

Not that it was the deal breaker for me, but some of the voice acting is just terrible.

Review Update: 100%'d the game, didn't get much better.  Their idea of sidequests I guess is respawning the same bosses 3 or 4 times and making you fight them again.  Combat got ""better"" in the sense that I could spam 1 move with Vegeta and win every fight, instead of the constant dodge 100 times then punch 3 times.  Might be worth a play if you can get it on sale for $10-20.",1669150316,1669500584,False,2,0,0.502340078353881836,0,True,False,False

The graphics are awesome, the world is nice but the orbs are a little obnoxious for an ""open world"" game, plus the narrative is very driven and the side quests are very shallow and not very fun nor worth doing. I loved how the story progressed through the anime at the right pace. The biggest problem I found with this game is that every enemy has the exact same AI. When fighting a boss they literally only charge up their ki and use super attacks. This effectively makes the combat dodge, Special attack, dodge, special attack, repeat. This is very unfun gameplay and when I say every enemy I mean literally every enemy does this. The only time you will catch an enemy using a melee combo is when you are literally in their face and wait 20 seconds for them to do something. Another major problem is the gank fights, especially the one where you fight cell jr. all three of them have relatively big maximum health pools (I played on hardest difficulty), and each of them attack you and you only at all times. So you will be trying to kill one cell jr. but getting hit by 3 kamehamehas at all times, plus they all have solar flare so you just get spammed. So yes, I loved the ambiance, and the narrative that the story followed but the combat in this game is frankly inexcusable when compared to literally any other dragon ball game.

Cutscenes and story were as expected.  Very good and mostly faithful to the anime which is most important right?  I haven't really enjoyed a DBZ game since the first budokai trilogy.  This game changes that.  It is fast paced enough and rewarding if you have good reflexes.  

Leveling for the story didnt feel like too much of a grind.  Beware;  The game does tell you about eating food, but is not good at reminding you that FOOD ADDS PERMANENT STATS FOR ALL CHARACTERS.  Keep that in mind and the game isnt terribly difficult.

Occasionally characters will disappear entirely while in cutscenes.

The other issue is.... About ever three hours they throw a fight at you which is totally fucking retarded difficult and you only hope is to spam heat-seeking/target-locking abilities over and over again while spamming health items. These fights are TOTALLY unbalanced for their place in the story. These fights have no solution beside 'cheesing.' These fights have enemies with unlimited poise; regardless of what you do they WILL NOT get stunned by you and they WILL interrupt ANYTHING you throw at them. (of course, besides the target-locking ki spam abilites you have) These fights are SO unbalanced, any immersion I had with my character is totally hijacked.

-80% of the game is flying in 1 of 2 speeds, collecting coloured orbs in inconsequential maps (yes I did say maps, this is not open world).
-20% is pressing B repeatedly & throwing the same ki blast at bosses.
-Not an RPG. The skilltrees are entirely linear & locked to story states.
-No VA on anything not in the main story. All side missions are textboxes.

As for the game itself, it's basically what I dreamed the Legacy of Goku games would be. I loved those games as a kid, yet I always wanted a similar experience in a proper 3D open world. DBZ Kakarot aims at that, and while it definitely flounders a bit with some confusing controls and simplistic combat, it's still worth playing to experience the DBZ storyline again in a new way. The open world itself is more or less a series of hub worlds with a few side quests sprinkled here and there, item collecting, fishing, and a light crafting system to flesh out the story a bit more while traveling from plot point to plot point.

As I said, the combat is simplistic. Don't expect Fighter Z combos, or even Tenkaichi 3 duels. It's like a cross between Budokai and Xenoverse, with one-button combos and special attack commands. You basically just mash the attack button, spam the dodge button, and pepper in a few special attacks to win. It's not a challenging game at all, but still gives you enough of a DBZ feel to keep you engaged.

The graphics are very well done, and are probably the best thing about it. The cel shading is outstanding and even the details of the world itself are charming and familiar to fans. All of the cutscenes are voiced by the Funimation crew, which, while decent, you can tell that some of these VAs are tired of repeating the same lines over and over again.

It's worth getting for DBZ fans and those who are looking for an engaging open world brawler. Do not buy it at full price though, wait for a Steam sale and get it with all of the DLC.",1613844334,1668782088,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But that's just it. It's just 'okay'.  The characters constantly repeat there phrases evertime they pick-up something uncommon or remotely rare. But approaching end-game everything is pretty much rare, so they're constantly saying 'OH YEAH IT'S SO FRESH' or something within those lines. And it's either one or two lines that are exactly the same. I swear to god I literally had to mute my game because it  was annoying me so much.

I plan to make a video in further depth about why you shouldn't buy this game. Despite the game saying 'Kakarot', the game is no where close telling the story of our beloved Goku. It felt more like 'Dragon Ball Z: Gohan' because you primairly play Gohan for 70% of the game. 20% of it is either Vegeta or Piccolo. And 10% is rarely played by goku, might even be lower then that.

Second of all; I was very upset that I couldn't play any of my favorite Z Warriors from the series. It would of been nice to play as Tien when fighting Nappa, maybe play as Neil against Frieza. Hell let me play as Krillin when they first encountered Dodoria!

As a note, you can only play as 4 or 5 characters which fricken sucks. These characters are Gohan, Goku, Vegeta and Piccolo. I think at somepoint you play as Gotenks and then Vegito but it would of been nice to play one of the other Z-Warriors or at least give me the option to change them during the 'intermissions'. It doesn't even claim to be open world as it advertises. The maps feel more like 'levels' then actual open-world. You'll constantly be seeing a lot of loading screens when traversing because you'll be changing a lot of the places you go to in search for dragon balls or other.

All and all, this game is not worth your wallet. Even at a 50% discount. I would move away from this game. Even $10 for this game feels a bit much. A lot of the characters are very ugly and bland. Just look up a video of the Frieza era, you can see what I mean. They even got the voice actors wrong for the builds of the characters.

the scenes in this game look better than the anime so I highly recommend this if you want to re experience the story but only read the manga 

There IS a ""skill tree"" but it just unlocks moves doesn't actually let you build a character.
Levels are stupid too since the game just gives you like 5 levels after you switch to a different character and stuff 

I guess the best part is the extra, non-canon content which is usually small Ubisoft-Style side quests where you do something for a side character from the anime like Pilaf and get so see a 8 line long dialog. Sometimes characters comment on the situation or say something funny when you talk to them during a story mission

----

Ah. Here we have a pretty divisive game among the hardcore fans. I suppose I can count myself among the hardcore, since I've played every single Dragon Ball game (OG, Z, whatever), and I've finished about 80% of them. If you can find it in a wiki, I've played it and probably finished it. My absolute favorite DBZ game can be found in the PC Engine, surprisingly similar to Kakarot called Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Son Goku Densetsu.

That game has a Buu saga Gohan trying to recount the tales of his dad to Goten, who at that point hadn't met him. It goes through Goku's most significant fights up to that point, which goes from Tao Pai Pai all the way to when he gave his life in the battle against Cell. All the while, different characters such as Bulma will pop up and add their two cents about how they remembered Goku. Keep in mind that during this time, Goku seemed to be dead for real. It's a celebration of Goku and his achievements, and I loved it as a kid (even made me tear up way back when haha). While most will agree Kakarot is closest to the Legacy of Goku series on the GBA, that series was also following the spirit of the little-known PC Engine game.

At the end of the day, they're all games that seek to celebrate the life of Goku, as he is and always will be the foundation of the IP. Does this game live up to all the hype surrounding it? Well, it depends on what you were looking for. 

Many fans of DBZ are in it for all the crazy battles and iconic moments, but a large percentage are hot off the heels of Xenoverse 1 and 2, which offer a different spin on the decades-old story. Those who are looking for something new and genuinely game changing in the Dragon Ball Z universe won't find it here. Fortunately, Xenoverse 2 is STILL somehow coming up with DLC, so there's a fantastic outlet.

What about gameplay? Once again, those who come in expecting the intricacies (and craziness) found in Xenoverse or even Dragon Ball FighterZ won't find it here. The gameplay is serviceable, and can be surprisingly addicting for those who want to spend their time trying to get extremely annoying bosses into a stun state — which unlocks fantastic animations for super attacks. You can even hit them with a blast that exits the planet if the final blow is a super beam from surge mode while transformed. That said though, the IP has many games with more complicated and intricate gameplay, such as FighterZ.

So what does Kakarot have? Well, do you remember the moment when Goku first arrives at King Kai's and jumps for joy? What about when Goku takes out Nappa with the Kaioken and holds him up with a single arm? Did you see Goku's face at that moment? It's almost like you ripped the scene out of the manga/anime and put it in the game's engine. These developers went through great lengths to develop these cutscenes. They could have just as easily used the in-game models, make them look angry/surprised/whatever and left it at that. Xenoverse certainly did, since who would be crazy enough to reanimate the face to match the source material 1:1 in regular cutscenes? Kakarot's devs did.

What about that moment when Vegeta yells at Nappa to stop when the big guy gets carried away and disobeys him? In that moment Vegeta looked like how he was originally drawn. Many will complain about how the game lacks cutscenes and polish as you go, and I absolutely will not fault them for that. However, this game goes through the Saiyan saga, to Frieza, to Cell, to Buu — that's no easy feat. Keep in mind that what I was talking about earlier was just around one small part of the game. The devs did everything they could to replicate the soul of the series and translate it into beautiful scenes. Even the gameplay, simple as it is, tries its best to emulate the hectic style of fighting, all with a similar level of polish.

I was personally disappointed when Vegeta's final flash and Trunks' attempt to take out Perfect Cell wasn't given any attention, but the devs themselves said it pained them to pick and choose what to focus on due to time constraints. This is a game that the developers were obviously passionate about. You can FEEL their ambition in every second the game plays out. In fact, many of the issues people complained about is primarily due to them overreaching, rather than underperforming. 

Remember when the trailers first came out and we wondered if it was going to go up to the Frieza saga? They pushed so hard it went all the way to Buu, and I appreciate how hard they worked. Is it a perfect game? No, it isn't. However, did the developers succeed in what they set out to do? Absolutely. They were also testing the waters with A New Power Awakens, and decided to finally step it up a notch with Trunks' DLC story. The same passion and creativity can be felt all throughout the DLC, and now we know Bardock's coming, alongside a new season of DLC. It's a good time to be a Kakarot fan.

This is my favorite modern Dragon Ball game for all the reasons I shared above. I appreciate it because it feels like a love letter from the devs. Hell, all you'd have to do is watch the opening to get an idea of what you're getting into. The game is a celebration of Goku, hence the name, Kakarot. You won't regret buying this.

I however must also say, that I find myself quite disappointed thus far, as it has not met my satisfaction of what I would consider a well made DBZ game... for reasons I'll discuss below.

First of all, for a game called Dragon Ball Z: ""Kakarot"", it sure feels like you spend more time playing as other characters, more than what you actually do playing as Goku (aka ""Kakarot"", as titled in the game's name)... seriously, you start off as Goku up to the point that you defeat Raditz, which then from there you play as other characters (Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta) up to the point that you fight the Ginyu Force... then after defeating Captain Ginyu and Goku getting his body back, you go right back to playing as the other characters again, until Goku recovers in time to fight Frieza, in which I defeated and guess what; I once again play as the other characters, while Goku is off in space (P.S. not to sound like a Goku fan boy here, as I'm honestly just aiming to make a point).

Furthermore, aside from playing as other characters, more than what you actually do playing as Goku (""Kakarot"", as the name suggest in the game's title name); that isn't the biggest downer about the game... what's far more disappointing is that, you don't get to experience Goku's ""hard earned efforts"" in training to become stronger (training on King Kai's Planet, before the fight with Vegeta & Nappa... training on the way to Planet Namic, before the fight with the Ginyu Force as well as with Frieza, etc)... nope... instead, when it comes to playing as Goku again, he just ""magically"" gains tons of Exp out of thin air (out the wazoo, etc)... his strength doesn't feel earned at all, it's like as though he just magically becomes strong enough to defeat what foe(s) he aims to fight at the time.

Another thing I noticed that doesn't make sense, is that somehow some characters have higher BP (Battle Points, aka Power Level) than other characters with higher level... I mean seriously, Gohan at level 33 has a lesser BP than some of the characters known to be weaker (aka Yamcha, Tien, etc) that is like level 9.... um.. come again?? you gotta be freaking kidding me... not that the BP actually does anything in the game anyway, as it doesn't effect characters stats (HP amount, Ki amount, Melee Attack, Melee Defense, Ki Attack, Ki Defesce)... like seriously, Vegeta & Piccolo having a high BP at this point, isn't doing a significant amount of damage to the enemies, compared  to characters that don't hardly have ""half"" the amount of BP of what they have.... here, take a look at this screenshot for example.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835349028

As I recall in the Anime (and I don't think I'm mistaking), after Goku's awakening; at the point where Goku meets Cell for the very first time when saving Tien and Piccolo, he didn't fight Cell at any point during that time (matter of fact, the ONLY time that Goku fought Cell, for the first time, was during the Cell Games aka Tournament)... so why the heck did they do that in this game, where Goku fights Cell (2nd form) upon meeting him??... so lame, the creators need to go back and re-check their sources... but whatever though, that's the very least of things aside from just getting the story wrong.

I find it really annoying trying to charge up my Ki  (especially while getting spam attacked from time to time) in order to do special attacks, and yet the computer can just spam attack you with Ki energy attacks without seeming like they need to charge up Ki at all (matter of fact, the computer doesn't even have a Ki gauge, just has an HP gauge and a Stun gauge).

Let's see... anything positive to say about the game, I'd say the idea of eating food to gain additional stat points would be one, being that in the Anime or even the Manga, Goku and other characters (mainly Saiyans for sure) are known for eating like gluten's... in which case, gaining stats boost from foods in the game, actually gives you a good reason to go hunting and such for ingredients, etc. so I kinda somewhat do like that aspect of the game..... oh and the game graphics are spectacular, I'll definitely give them credit in that regard.

This game really does it very well regarding story telling, graphics, mechanics and atmosphere. As far as I can tell they have all the original dubbing actors, music and sounds and this REALLY brings me back. I enjoyed it very much and I can fully recommend it!

You basically play the original series and fight the fights by yourself. You can train to have it a bit easier, but you don't necessarily have to, since you get all necessary EXP from the story itself (however I did all substories, so maybe one should do them).

Background: I am a DBZ fan. I discovered my love for DBZ in my young teen years and I've loved the series ever since.

All the silliness of the DBZ universe aside. This is a fun game. It's not a fighting game, it's an RPG, meaning LEVEL DOES MATTER... I played this on Hard knowing I was only going to play this through once.

The game captures the feel of the show pretty well. The battles are epic, the Ki attacks are immense and flashy. The melee combat is... ok... The game boils down to, ""Melee enemy until they glow red, then back off as FAR AS YOU CAN... once enemy does move hit them with Ki ability... repeat... seriously...

The game has it's set piece moments and any DBZ fan knows what they are. Everything else is filling in the gaps between these set piece moments. There are some truly fantastic side missions that have an unbelievable amount of charm that fills out the world and the characters in surprising ways. Ways untouched by the anime....

Speaking of the anime... the games story is... different. All the important beats are there. Raditz. Saiyans. Frieza. Androids. Cell. Buu. Beyond... It's all there as expected (more or less) but the in between parts are different. Not bad, just... different. If you're a DBZ purist this game will anger you. If you're a fan who enjoys the series and accepts the good and the bad, you'll have a great time.

My score of 7/10 is mostly due to the stale nature of the gameplay. Because it's an RPG where enemies can be unblockable and unstoppable, so you run away and wait for an opening then attack.... rinse, repeat. It doesn't feel as good as some of the fighting games where the combat and attacks are more responsive. Melee abilities in this game should mostly be avoided. Far too often the enemy can interrupt your melee pursue animation and send you flying, opening you up for serious damage. There are some abilities that are useful and do high damage, but nothing that outdoes a ranked up Ki ability.

When it comes to the grind for EXP and resources. AVOID thinking that the orbs in the world are worth it. You will always get the most value for orbs by fighting enemies. If you need orbs, go to an area where you can instant finish enemies (flying right into them and auto-winning) flying around like this is... boring, but effective and is useful to gain experience and the orbs necessary to upgrade your abilities. You may not feel the need to grind orbs until you hit higher levels where each ability cots 20k+ of each orb type...

This game is a love letter to my childhood, albeit a love letter written by a stalker who only knows what I like through a random assortment of shady pictures and shreds scavenged from my garbage... but it's still sweet... in a strange.. unsettling way...

If you're not a DBZ fan but are interested. Play it on easy and breeze through the game. You'll more or less understand the story and be able to talk to your fellow nerds. 7/10",1667105430,1667105430,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

At first, I was taken by surprise at the visuals. This is, in my opinion, the best looking DBZ game out there. The cutscenes are really stunning and the attacks that story enemies perform are stunning. This game looks like how you think the anime looked when you look back on childhood memories. 

The problems starts with the quests, combat, and world. I understand the point of the game was to make it a full RPG with an expansive story and side quests, but in doing so, I feel like a very path was taken. Side quests feel boring and tedious (beat these copy and pasted enemies in this area, go fish for 10 fish in order to get some eggs for Master Roshi type deal). The combat is very button mashy. You can mash your attack button and follow it up with one of the other 3 face buttons in order to end the button mash combo in a different way. It's just not very fulfilling. I feel like this could have been improved upon by just adding a second attack button in order to string along some very basic combos. The one button attack string just isn't fun. Lastly, the open world, while expansive, gives you nothing really fun to do aside of collecting some flying orbs, and seeing the memorable cast of character running around the various areas.

I'll go ahead and cut it short by echoing what many have said before me. Visually, this game is great. If you want to turn your brain off and experience the story of DBZ in a new light, this is an amazing title.

I would write a really long review here, but I'll put it simply so that I don't start a rant about how much I love Ballz and Vegetables hairline. This game gets very repetitive, very quickly. Grinding in this game feels like you're trying to sleep through your depression. But, maybe it's all worth it for the story, and the beautifully animated cutscenes based on the frames of the original anime itself.

If you love Dragons and their ballz, you'll love Dragonz Ballz. Play it if you have the time. The game is excellent, as is it's DLC. I'm not happy with the life service it's multiple season passes will be getting, but oh well, do you think I'm gonna argue with Bandai?

The hardest mode posses no challenge so long as the enemy is within 15 levels of yours. The level scaling is kind of weird as I noticed enemies 14 levels  higher than me are easy, but at 15 levels they 1 or 2 shot me.

This game has no actual combos. It is simply a button masher which is unfortunate because beating down an enemy with button mashing is not rewarding in the least.

It'd be nice to see this game with a proper combat system and a better field. I was also surprised that the amount of damage you take doesn't affect your exp considering saiyans grow faster when they are beaten nearly to death.

The main game starts with the Saiyan Saga and ends with the Buu Saga, retelling every story beat very faithfully when compared with the Anime! There is also lots of side content to dive into within the game including things like Side Missions, Collectables, etc.

[*] [i]Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F [/i]
[*] [i]Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks[/i]

Put another way, it feels sort of like a Dragon Ball powered version of Yakuza in its free-roaming segments, and then shifting to a traditional Xenoverse/Tenkaichi-like fighting game once combat starts. And as an arena fighter, it’s great. Combat is simple, focused on one-button combos and a customizable selection of four special moves, but loaded with little intricacies that go a long way when it comes to keeping the action from ever becoming thoughtless. You’re always locked on and tethered to your opponent, too, allowing you to move toward, away from, and orbit around them midair with ease, and you can switch between targets with a simple flick of the right stick.

While this may seem very button-mashy – and to an extent it is – it’s a combat system that nonetheless forces you to be reactive to what your opponent is doing. Most enemies have dangerous attacks that absorb strikes in order to deal one of their own that can immediately stop you in your tracks and leave you stunned, forcing you to carefully balance offense and your extremely mobile defensive options. Fortunately, Kakarot’s combat is smartly designed so that you can always evade to cancel out of a combo and get the hell out of the way when you can see something dangerous is being obviously telegraphed.

Ki management is also very important, as your ki meter dictates not only your special move usage but also your ability to use vanishes to instantly get close and punish projectile attacks, your ability to use a super dash and follow enemies up after knocking them away, your ability to use a burst of energy to knock an opponent away when they’re about to break through your guard, and of course your various transformations, including going Super Saiyan. I really like the way Kakarot uses Ki, tying just as many useful defensive techniques to it as it does offensive, making it a vital rechargeable resource during battle.

There’s also a tension gauge that fills over the course of a fight, and once it’s full you can activate a Surge mode which allows you to cancel special moves into each other. That means you could string together a series of kamehamehas, one after the other, for massive damage – as long as you have the ki for it, of course. It’s a nice trump card to have once things get tough, and especially satisfying since you get an awesome “Super Finish” animation when you end a fight with a Surge-powered beam attack.

Since Kakarot is single-player only and doesn’t need to be balanced with competitive play in mind, developer CyberConnect 2 was able to go a little bit wild with its enemy design and give them special moves that would typically be too powerful in PvP. Cell, for example, can split into about 20 weaker versions of himself, all of which start preparing attacks aimed directly at you, while Kid Buu and Frieza can create planet-sized energy bombs that force you to rush out of the blast zone or suffer massive damage. It makes these villains feel appropriately epic to fight.",1665918108,1665918108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wow! Just fantastic!
I haven't played a Dad Simulator like this since Fallout 4. Cant believe I slept on it.
Even tho it is strictly an Asian dad simulator (for Anime dads to practice fatherhood) and the culture differences are rather stark, I was still able to enjoy my time as a virtual dad in this unfamiliar space.
As per usual, when I find a gem like this boy, I neglected my irl family and played thousands of hours offline, so my displayed playtime in no way reflects actual time spent engaging in the advanced father simulations.
Ruminating on the moments I mentally highlighted as a physic anchor, for when my irl family disappoints me and it cant be overstated how often they disappoint me, I couldn't help but notice that there was a slight problem with the boy-son-child of the game.
It might be my lack of a frame of reference regarding raising an Anime child, but what troubled me the most was my inability to control the types of people my Anime child was permitted to interact with. This Kame Roshi man was clearly a molester. I know it was implemented in the game to warn of the dangers, however, I felt a dialogue option to confront Mr. Roshi or alert the authorities of him would of been realistic to the simulation. If this had of been developed by Bethesda we could of expected such options. I would like to speculate that they would of scripted an event whereby you attend Mr. Kame Roshi's trial and  give a witness statement in the dock, you and then your boy-son-child. I digress.
It is because of this that I unfortunately cannot recommend this game as there are many fantastic Father Simulators on the market these days.
This is is still a great game. Please don't let my 'one thing that annoys me' deter you. It is a fantastic way to get an insight into raising an Anime child from the perspective of an Asian father.

I almost forgot to mention one of the most important features this Dad Quest game has that so many others forget to include. This is the fishing mechanic. No Dad Quest Father Simulation game can boast the full robust experience of operating a virtual father if they lack this key component.

The game is fun and responsive enough in battle, flying around is a joy. Gathering items to get stronger is a chore, and takes way too long. If you're not strong enough to beat a boss and assuming you're at max level...you have to gather supplies and cook food to get stronger, and that takes far too long. It's nice though that you even have the option to do that in this game, whereas other games would block you from progressing altogether. 

This game would get about an 8 out of 10 if it had enough content, but it feels like it was rushed out for the sake of profit by the studio when you're playing it...so for that I have to give it around a 6 out of 10. It's a high score for me to give any game, but there no denying that it's accessible to new players if you're willing to chill out and gather food for hours/days of playtime at which point you WILL feel unstoppable. 

Here's what I'll end with...if you have zero patience for RPGs, it's about a 6 out of 10 - you will have fun but will be challenged at times. If you're willing to grind for hours, it can be incredibly rewarding and you will feel like the game is anywhere from an 8 out of 10 to a 9....I don't see anyone thinking it's perfect because the DLC is far too short.

Good for revisiting story, yet its repetitive to people who know the dragonball story of by heart. The combat is decent even tho infinites ""break the games combat"" but thats what makes it fun for me personally. The effort for learning new attacks is worth it, just upgrade as soon as you level up and then you can learn new attacks and better versions of previous attacks. Some feature within the game havent been needed, such as cooking for me, but im sure itll change if i was to put more hours into the game and progress more. 12 Hours got me into the namek saga just before goku makes the well known ""move"" on frieza, the game starts from the beginning of dbz and only covers dbz (unless you buy dlc) which kinda sucks but i hope they add more dbs dlc so we can cover the great arcs like goku black and ToP.

The game is okay, the gameplay gets boring really quickly and if you buy the DLC you can blitz through the game in a matter of hours due to you being able to get SSJ god before you even met Raditz, obviously that's up to you weather you do that if you own the DLC. The cut scenes are the highlight of the game making iconic scenes from Dragon ball z look amazing and feel fresh however its only really the big moments in each saga that look good as the rest of the cut scenes are just okay but when its good its really good. It does miss out some bits here or there which i find personally fine. I know Dragon ball Z well enough to fill in the blanks but its kind of a bummer if you are looking forward for some scenes and they just aren't there.

The game despite its flaws is fun. You can play the filler driving episode which i haven't seen a lot in Dragon ball games and they add characters like Launch which i find a nice touch however this game is so filled with content that is more or less useless/meaningless. The driving mini games, Baseball with Gohan, an entire fucking DBZ card game with an online and in game purchases? for some reason.

If you want to play another game that retells the story of Dragon Ball Z with cool cut scenes, go ahead this game is for you but if you are looking for a new more fresh take on a dragon ball game? This isn't your thing.

I personally had two highlights of the game, The cell saga had some of the cut scenes in the game and is one of my favourite arcs in all of Dragon ball so i did have some fun with it and the random secret ending where Mira and Towa from the Xenoverse games show up and you have to fight Towa...Yes that is a thing and i found it cool but its give or take.

It has so many callbacks to the original series and sticks to the original Story. What an amazing way to re tell the story and play with all the characters.

So solid 3.5 out of 5. They could've made it more dynamic and not so interrupted by long dialogues and cinematics.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I'll break it down as quickly as I can. If you're a fan, do yourself a favor and get this game soon! I held off, had my doubts. I was wrong. What seemed to me as a franchise cash grab, showed me that there is true passion put into this game. It's the small things too. Allowing you to build and drive Toriyama-esque vehicles, even though you can fly at 10x the speed. Letting you cook, explore. Even map layouts are scarily accurate. It made me personally feel like a kid playing that DBZ game we all always wanted.

OK, now gameplay. The fights are insane. Smooth, punchy to godlike maneuvers that tear up landscapes as you fight. Each character feels different from each other, each with an expansive skill tree. This is not a versus game. Don't go in expecting that. The combat is very much intended to make you feel like a super saiyan badass, so it's tailored to be smooth, fun and CINEMATIC. Something these games have lacked... for a while. Exploring the world is fun and full of options. Also, exploring and fighting is a smooth transition. I believe that's important in a dragonball game. 

It's a gorgeous looking game (which is set to receive an even bigger facelift soon) From, gorgeously rendered landscapes and cell shading to hand-drawn, visceral cutscenes that at times make it seem like you're watching a remastered version of the show, the game is easy on the eyes.

I truly believe that if you're a fan of this series and want to get lost in the best in-game interpretation of this world's story, you need to do yourself a favor and play it. BUT i also believe that from the perspective of someone curious about the series that knows nothing, this game does a great job of telling the story to new comers with the added benefit of being a part of it themselves.

Simple really. I play FighterZ for the versus aspect and this for that single player escapism Dragonball never seemed to get right, until now.

Excited for Season 2 expansions as well!

Get the game, explore this awesome world we all love. Fight. Be powerful. Save the universe. Have FUN!",1664172126,1664172126,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

and I was absolutely abscessed with them as i now am in this game 
i just wish they added more DLC into super more fights and continued the story 
maybe they are making a follow up game i dont know 

but do i recommend this game to a DBZ lover YES 

graphics, control, game play 
all is amazing 
please make krillin Playable Character tho please 
the content of the story could have added more they left out quiet a bit of detail, but it does not take away to much from the game.

there are multiple ways to fight an enemy either train and nuke everything. 
Or defensive plays to be made as well as z combos which could use a little improvements but they work! 

DLCs well they could have done a lot and i mean a lot more with Beerus and Whis 
they have not even Sniffed the Tip of that ice burg but this continues through out the DLCs but fear not even tho it is only a little bit of content it is still content .",1641645148,1663936450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not because I ignored them or anything, but because I know my priorities. Dragon Ball Z Kakarot is slow, full of shit that does NOT matter (the orbs, the giant skill trees of every character, the fact that Yamcha and Chiaotzu are available support characters, the crafing/cooking mechanics, a LOT of quests, side-mechanics, etc) that does actively get in the way of your game sometimes AND the fact that this is JUST the Dragon Ball Z story without movie plots or even the filler episodes (just because it has the car episode does not mean this has like. anything else)
But. I don't mind! I don't mind grindy, easy, slow games like this sometimes. It's bad, sure. It's easy. I mean it's better it be easy than difficult, because any actual difficulty it offers is more frustration than challenge.
I think Kakarot is a fun game. It's fun. I'm always having fun with it. I beat the main story, did a bunch (but not all) of the post-game quests and am most likely going to play much more because there's 3 dlc stories to go through (though yes two of them aren't a lot it's just more fights. the Future Trunks story sounds awesome though)

I recommend it. If you like Dragon Ball Z that much, why not? I haven't played one of these in ages. I miss the show. I like playing as my favorite characters.

I never realized this until I played it myself, however. The name of the title doesn't clearly reflect what this game actually is, which is a full retelling of the anime.
Calling the game ""DragonBall Z: Kakarot"" implies that this is a game all about Kakarot (Goku), when in fact you only get to play as him about a 1/3 of the time. I get that the whole DB series has always been about Goku in general, so it's a minor nit-pick. The point is that the naming convention kept me from immediately realizing that this wasn't just a story about Kakarot, but in fact a somewhat definitive DBZ experience.
My favorite thing about this game is how it expands upon the greater lore of the universe(s) in ways that would still fit neatly into canon. There are even some extra lines of dialogue peppered throughout that fill in glaring plot holes and address various well known fan theories. This really is a treat, especially with most of the original cast voicing them.
The open world design and Action-RPG style is, like I said, what I've always wanted in a DBZ game.
The battle system could be a lot better. I would've preferred a fighting game style system with access to a character's entire moveset through the use of combos, but the simplicity of it lends itself well to an RPG, I suppose...at least it isn't card-based for once.

I do suggest playing it on hard as it makes the fights a bit more challenging and overall more rewarding.

Or rushes other moments Like Goku Going SS3 for the first time. 

This is what Fighting games should be. (this is technically an Action RPG but plays the same as an Arena Fighter). Not nearly as much double standards for the AI then the player (AKA difficulty by annoyance) as most Fighting games.

Time wise the main story is about 40 hours, plus post game side quests and grinding, then DLC. I don't own them (yet?) but I've heard they don't add that much time/content. [Future Trunks arc, Battle of Gods and Resurrection F] I do hope they add the Broly and Super Hero movies as DLC.

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] This is a well designed arena fighter, jumping around from 1v1 to 3v6 battles.  The controls feel tight & responsive.  Techniques are easy to use, as are the transformations.  Everything is unlocked through an upgrade menu skill tree, using orbs to make the way down to the bottom, with some techniques hidden behind training battles.  The visuals & soundtrack all pop, using many tracks from the show itself, though missing the insert songs.  As for the story, it's exactly what you expect from a Dragon Ball game.  The side quests, though, provide additional content, attempting to explain both what was going on during major events, as well as showing off some characters that borderline disappeared in the second half of the series.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] This is an RPG at heart, & as a result, the endgame is loaded with grind.  Although the core game gives plenty of opportunities to gather orbs & provides you with plenty, a fair amount of the endgame requires an insane amount of them.  The higher level challenges can also feel incredible cheap to attempt to playthrough.  It also feels like the game has a lot of bloated downtime between the chapters, with some side missions & challenges feeling rather unrewarding (though admittedly it is amusing having Son Goku cruising about in a car).  A fairly big miss, however, is the lack of the entire first half of the story, with the game kicking in at Raditz's arrival.  Finally, there's the oddly detailed free card game DLC.  This is entirely dependent on the user playing, but it feels like a cheaper version of Magic the Gathering.  Personally, I didn't enjoy it, but I could understand someone putting more hours into that instead of the main game.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] The achievement list is actually very simple.  Though it's varied & may seem like a challenge, the majority of them will actually be completed just playing through the story & completing side quests.  The only one that will provide some challenge is the battle with Mira.  My recommendation is to actually boot up the first DLC as soon as you can.  The rewards make leveling up very simple, & should not be passed on until the endgame.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] This is actually a well designed arena RPG that has enough content to pull you through to the end of the game.  Though it feels a bit laggy in content from time to time, & the lack of the first half of Dragon Ball is missed, the positives outweigh the negatives.  Definitely worth a look, & not only just for Dragon Ball fans.",1632081640,1662818539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Side quest were decent some of em had some funny jokes and showed the personality of the characters and some were boring quests just like all rpg that ask you to collect random shit 

a thing i wish they added is make your own fight/s

7/10 for combat 
9/10 for main story
6/10 for side quests

It can still be a fun and engaging experience but the voice acting drops off when you are not playing the main questlines which would have been acceptable 10+ years ago but now it feels quite dated especially considering how high quality those main quest moments are.
The side content also is a bit odd at times...for instance before you leave earth the main quest insists that the largest threats to the planet are the saiyans whom are roughly around level 20ish however there are a number of level 50 robots just chillin out in the open in the same zone as those same saiyans and nobody seems concerned or even mentions them...you would think SOMEONE would udder something along the lines of forget about those monkeys Ultron is here run for your lives!
They have been adding content pretty consistently though which is commendable given they are trying to keep up with where the show is to the best of their ability.
Then all of a sudden they release a card game... this card game can only be played online...yes the shoe horned a gacha mtx card game into a single player rpg...this card game actually cant be played in the normal game itself though so if you want to play that you cant just play with npc's along the way, instead you need to wait for someone else to show the slightest amount of interest to play a game online...which can take a while.

The only acceptable reason in my eyes for them to shoehorn in an unwanted card game riddled with microtransactions would be to raise additional funding to bring the voice actors back in to record quality audio for all of the quests and dialogue...BUT... I seriously doubt that's what the publisher has in mind... which is most unfortunate as I was very optimistic about this game before launch. There is nothing more immersion breaking than the stark contrast of quality voice acting of the main story along side bargain bin quest audio. Cyberconnect is notorious for this behavior and it really shows how dated their formula has become these days. The card game is a new move for Cyberconnect, however its Bandai's go to move which will surely drag Cyberconnect's reputation through the mud when they really just needed a win. This game was so promising and came so close to delivering only to fall flat and then make an abrupt U-turn into oncomming traffic.

I still would recommend it for a Dragon Ball game in general but you should avoid the card game like the plague that it is.
It's getting so exhausting to buy games these days, the industry as a whole is nothing but a disappointment and they are so shameless about it that it's hard to ever feel inclined to praise a game when they get something right.

Kakarot is not an RPG, it's more like a main-canon action adventure with minimal RPG elements. I see it as ""another way to experience the DBZ story"" that is more interactive, but little else. I do recommend it as an ""occasional diversion"" if you happen to be in one of those ""what should I play?"" moods. IT's good in small doses, like a few hours in a day or two to take a break from other things. But I'd get it on sale (which I did) because I wouldn't call it ""worth the full price"" especially since the DLC is so expensive, even though I intend to get it eventually.

Especially because if you bought this, chances are you already know the story pretty closely. I do not recommend it for new fans for the Dragonball universe. I'd go watch the anime for that.

It's an open world action RPG that follows the storyline of Dragon Ball Z (and with DLC, much of Super). There may be better examples, but: if you combine the combat of [url=https://youtu.be/tBB5FonUU64?t=174]Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu[/url] (1996, PS1) with the scope and pacing of [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo8H1urQC1I&t=5261s]Super Saiya Densetsu[/url], that's Kakarot. 

The combat is relatively simple and can become tedious—especially when flying around various sections of the world, bumping into random goons—but the boss battles can punish you without discovering various tactics for an enemy (especially on Hard mode, which can be toggled). When not battling, watching a cutscene, or reading dialogue, various section of the Dragon Ball Z universe open up for semi-autonomous exploration. 

You don't have to engage in exploring (sticking to the story), but the developers have sprinkled in a great amount of Dragon Ball lore, and there's several mini-games (e.g. time attack with hover cars, cooking, fishing) that involve materials across the lands. They also include a whole card game.   

The art work and animation is phenomenal. Music and voice acting: excellent. The environments capture the Toriyama art style and coloring. I wouldn't mind seeing a non-interactive storyline using this engine.

The game is single player and story driven, so replayability may be limited, but it does such a fantastic job of recreating the anime in video-game form that I'd recommend buying it at full price (at least over rewatching the entire series!). If you're not that antsy to relive the story, but are a fan through and through, <$60 (with DLC) should be more than enough value.",1661301905,1661301905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, if 9 year old me could have played this game, I probably would have thrown up from excitement.
This is everything I'd ever dreamed of for video games as a kid. Being able to BE Gohan would have melted my little adolescent mind. 

So far, this appears to be an incredible and almost-perfect blend of the actual Dragon Ball Z plot-line into a video game. There's a great amount of side missions, world to explore, and added mini-games or mechanics to really make the Dragon Ball world come to life. 

The gameplay itself? Fucking Superb. I've played plenty of the DB games, but I've always wanted to see something more open-world and more free to transition- like being able to just take the fuck off and start bombing somewhere flying, and to just stop flying anywhere, and then explore the world around.

the graphics are great, the story content is good, the mechanics kinda suck, post game content is horrible after about 5 hours or so and then the story is only about 20-40 hours of play-time on an average run.
i'll also regard the horrible glitches the game has had before, such as saves deleting themselves after updating, fatal errors causing your save to corrupt sometimes, the game making you go through many cutscenes and fights without a free roam portion so you dont even get a chance to save (ex. buu saga) and then fatally crashing making you need to do EVERYTHING again.

although a lot of the bugs are rare and a lot more have been patched since 2021.

just starting on the buu saga. and tried the dlc.

The game isn't a fighter, which a lot of fans dislike about it I guess, but instead an RPG that tells the story of Dragon Ball Z. It has little easter eggs of Dragonball which is neat. My only real complaint about it is that the normal difficulty is super easy. The game consists of you grinding for levels, spamming a single button for combo build up, a button to charge ki, and then hold two buttons to perform super attacks. It's bare bones at best. Even compared to Xenoverse which has light/heavy and supers/ultimates. If you're looking for some challenge, this probably isn't going to be it.

So why did I hit recommend? Because of the following.

I've been a fan of Dragonball and Dragonball Z since the 90s. I absolutely love this series in all it's forms (Except the live action. It shouldn't have ever happened.). I even enjoyed GT with all it's quirks and odd bits. Super is a refreshing addition as well. However, those aren't in this game (if you don't include the mini-series DLC additions which I'm not at this moment). 

What is in this game is amazing story telling, amazing cutscenes, and that feeling I had as a kid watching the series play out for the first time. I've seen the animation dozens of times, even the Abridged stuff, and after the first handfuls of replays I lost that feeling.

The swelling of pride, of sadness, of anger, or joy when my favorite characters did the impossible. Or sitting on the edge of my seat when I am watching the battles play out. Sure I knew before playing the game how every fight ends, but the way the devs made the cutscenes play out with the way that the voice actors gave feeling to the characters. Even the new additions added to the cutscenes (like making Frieza/Buu/Cell look absolutely sadistic looking in their final scenes) was enough to make my heart race and had me feeling like that kid again.

I do wish I could have played as more characters than the four that I played for the most part of the game. You could probably guess who those four are, I won't spoil it even though it's been out for 2yrs now. Sure you get access to some support characters and a few new ones at the post-game, but still would have been nice to try to main Krillin.

TL;DR:

The game is easy as spamming two buttons and a joystick direction. 

The story, cutscenes, and the additions to the story made me feel like I was in the 90s watching the show for the first time.

Would I suggest buying it? On sale sure.
Complete it? At least the story.
DLC? Eh, I've done the first God DLC and it's okay. Super small.
Replay Value? For DBZ Fans I'm sure there will be some. I intend on going back and playing the DLC and Maxing out characters and doing all the sub-story missions.",1660544780,1660544780,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The power curve of the game itself is solid; you don't have to spend tons of time grinding and if you do the main story and side quests you'll be right where you should be for fights.

That said, don't be tempted by the ""villianous enemies"" to try and grind up and fight them when they first appear; you'll end up overleveled and trivializing the main story fights.

If you're fighting an opponent one-on-one it's okay but if you're fighting multiple opponents it's quite annoying and not fun to play. The fighting is just not smooth and fluent like other dragon Ball z games. .The stun meter is always full so when you get up close on them you wind up just stunning yourself which is stupid and nothing like any of the other dragon Ball z games fighting games I have played. I'm puzzled why they even put that feature in the game when you yourself don't have the a ability to stun them just from blocking. Anytime you use one of your special long range blast moves they will either just dodge it or you will get hit by one of the other fighters and get knocked out of it. The barrage you get from the other people you're fighting just does not make for good smooth gameplay when fighting. I found when I even use my special attacks like the Spirit bomb it hits them and does no damage sometimes. I have had to even spam the Spirit bomb in multiple fights because it auto locks on one of the few special's in the game that do that just to win a fight against multiple apponents, this makes the gameplay boring. I don't recommend getting this game unless you get it on discount. Otherwise I would recommend getting dragon Ball z fighters or xenoverse 2 (which has its own problems also) but it certainly more enjoyable to play than the fighting in this. The Budokai series was the last real great dragon Ball z fighting series in my opinion that was out. How you go from smooth gameplay like that from back in the day to the janky garbage you put out now is just amazing and shows that you need to hire better talent.",1660427355,1660427355,False,2,0,0.483853429555892944,0,True,False,False

Most of them have felt like something akin to Mortal Kombat but with DBZ characters. This does not. This feels like you are an active member in the game. I understand why some people have called it a ""button masher"" and to some degree it is, but that is also the nature of fighting games. That's like calling a driving game boring because all that you do is hold down the gas pedal. It's missing the forest for the trees. Yes, you mash buttons repeatedly, but you also can string together combos that are not moronically extensive, but still feel somewhat like you're doing them with direct intention, and not just hoping you get a combo by mashing every button all at once. Enough about the combat though. The story is what I absolutely love.  You basically get to ""play"" the entire show from Raditz onward. You can level up different abilities, use different team members, and I loved the aspect of the Community Board that lets you level up every character. Overall this game was so well done. It was so much better than what I expected. I would give it a solid 9/10.

I've played a fair few Dragon Ball games, the Raging Blast series, the Budokai Tenkaichi series, the Xenoverse games even the Dragon Ball game for the Kinect for the Xbox 360 and this has to be one of the best experiences in a Dragon Ball game I have ever had. Most Dragon Ball games like to give a spin on the main story or have the focus shift from the story to just the battles between the characters, and that's a good thing, DBZ is over 30 years old now with a lot of game instalments in that time so its nice to see something new. Kakarot includes so much detail in the story, in the animations, the new fights, the cut-scenes and the numerous side quests that it feels like each battle is brand new out of the box. People criticise the free-roam which while its definitely no Witcher 3 or Skyrim (and come on who was expecting that here) in a DBZ game it is by far the most inclusive and fun free-roam to date and I had a blast in it and the battles are in a similar position, they may be simple and not light-years ahead of what we have seen in recent DBZ games but they are the most well executed and just plain enjoyable battles in a Dragon Ball game I've had in years.

Played it for all of about 20 minutes before stopping. While this might be a good game what I saw in those 20 minutes was really annoying.

1: Booting up the game I saw something like 30 text pop-ups about stuff I had ""unlocked"" that meant absolutely nothing to me because I haven't even played the game yet.
2: The tutorial fight was okay albeit somewhat simple.
3: The movement in the open-world area sucks bigtime. This game feels like something from the late 90s or early 00s. Really stiff jumping, very clunky.
4: Open world zone immediately presented an annoying ""escort the slow npc"" thing which served absolutely no purpose but to slow the game which was really annoying considering how janky+fast the movement is in this area
5: The fishing thing with the random quick time events was annoying. Not hard but annoying. At this point I am just skipping all the dialogue because up until now 90% of the gameplay has been ""read this text box"" or ""listen to these characters be annoying""
6: The little emblem thing was the last straw. ""Put it NEXT to Goku"" was being shown to me but no matter where I clicked it just wouldn't do anything but repeat this message. Finally it worked after clicking the exact spot it wanted me to put it despite me having clicked that area multiple times. Maybe this is a controller issue I dunno but it was really stupid.

Anyway...
I'm presently pretty frustrated by this game and quite disappointed. It looks super cool from the videos and screenshots but it feels like a game that would have come out 20 years ago. It is clunky, annoying and vapid. 

I will be giving it some more time this weekend but my initial feelings aren't good. At present I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but the hardcore DBZ fan and/or people who may not notice/care about the really clunky gameplay.",1660106286,1660106286,False,3,0,0.479811429977416992,0,True,False,False

It has a huge open world with a some nice things to find, and ok side quests to do.
The battle system is easy to learn, but had some good room for complexity. It's very reminiscent of Xenoverse, but with some welcome changes. You're able to utilize ally attacks against enemies which make for an interesting strategic element of a battle. Plus I always appreciate when I don't have to use up an attack slot for charging up ki.
The character interactions might be my favorite part of this game. There's older characters in Dragon Ball's history that make reappearances and its always welcome to see them come back.

Now for the review, of what I've seen so far.
The start, the tutorial is easy, but to a new player can also be challenging, and is a great way to intoduce the controls, BUT if you're using KB+M, change your button icons in settings, it should show as type B when you first open it, you'll have to do this every time.
Saiyan Saga, for your fight with Raditz, do the two side quests that you can so that you will have your best chance against him, next is Nappa and the plants, by this point you hopefully have done the quests, but you still will have to farm up XP, now Vegeta, he was a PAIN to fight, even on normal, even when I was in close to the same level as him.
Frieza Saga, this was easier overall than Vegeta was to fight, once you got the power boost it was a cakewalk, nothing much to say.
Android Saga, you never fight 16, which personally I would love to be dunked by 16, but is still challenging with the fight against Vegeta as Trunks.
I have yet to finish the game, but so far the Cell Saga is good. Personally I can't wait for the Cell games portion.
So far, 8/10, if the grinding wasn't required and it was all down to playstyle and being tactical, I'd personally call it a perfect 10. But it is a nice 3D DBZ game. I hope that GT stuff is in the game, or gets added if it's not already in.

An RPG. One that faithfully recreates the story of Dragon Ball Z, in the most pleasant of ways, but isn't without its faults.

 [b]The Good[/b]
In-depth storytelling and cutscene direction that's actually worth a buck. Kakaroto's take on each and every saga, & some of their most iconic beats, have been, for the most past, faithfully recreated alongside a soundtrack that's been lifted straight from the show.

Visuals be no slouch either (albeit some ""engine.ini"" tweaking was required to tone down the crappy bloom), attention to detail is abundant throughout, and the sheer amount of love and care put onto some of the most iconic landmarks is tangible.

Speaking of maps, the game's been divided into a dozen or so explorable area's, and they've been sized just right. Not one is either too big and empty or too little and claustrophobic. Traveling from one side to the other is often a quick affair.

Character modeling is on another level though. Each boasting crazy high polys and all intricately detailed.

The more you progress through the story, train, and attain new moves & transformations, the greater, more impactful your actions will be. Some to the point of brokenness, like the maxed out versions Vegie's Big Bang Attack, Goku's Spirit Bomb. It's amusing.

There are two distinct types of ""currency"" (kind of), and each serves its distinct purpose.

Zeni (money). You earn it by farming for ingredients (meat, fish, spices, vegetables, fruit...), minerals, mechanical parts, even gifts (which can be used to upgrade your community boards), and all can be sold for prices of the variable type.

Z balls (of which there are 6 types in total), easy to come by, they're scattered everywhere & can be used to upgrade your skill trees.

With that said, there's one set of special balls to collect, 7 of them actually, and these are of the wish guaranteeing type. They allow you to ask for severe amounts of all of the above. Or you can wish your enemies back to life. Like Rasditz and Napa. King Cold and The Gunyu Force. ...and so on. These ""what ifs"" are the best kind of side mission you can get.

[b]The Bad[/b]
Skill trees too. Unlocking more and new upgradable slots/techniques (ones specifically marked by an icon), requires the beating of training sessions. But to beat each training course, one must be at a similar level as of the required. Which wouldn't be too much to ask.

Problem is, reaching higher levels, needs story progression, and even though farming's a bit of a requirement (but not overly imposed), what comes out of it the most, is Z Balls, maybe some items, but not much else. 

Generic battle encounters, other than Vilaneus Enemies (and even those), barely give any meaningful amount of XP, making all of the leveling process, feel not only a tad little bit on-rails, but never truly satisfying.

Speaking of battles. The game's severely lacking in enemy variety. Each random encounter (can usually be avoided) consists of the same 2 or 3 types of robots, a drone or two, and colour swapped Frieza soldiers. Not fun. 

Combat in of itself, ain't anything to write home about... It's fluid and does the job, but is simple and button mashy, which leaves a lot to be desired given the game's colossal size.

Sub Stories, aka, side missions. They serve their purpose and earn the player decent amounts of XP. At their best, they give insight on the littlest of details, raging from early Dragon Ball to later Z, even some the most obscure facts are thrown around.

But they're just not fun, and can be divided into 2 types. 

It's either, go there and fight the same random enemies over and over. Or... go there and collect some rare items. Maybe a mix of both if lucky.

It's a bore fest, really.

[b]The Ugly[/b]
Menus, menus, and more menus! Oh man... There's a butt load of them and they never go away. The more you play, the more chapters you beat, the more menus you get introduced to!

It got odd, fast... and for each one, a pop-up tutorial or two. 

Speaking of tutorials, they're everywhere, for everything you do, for everything you earn, for everything you unlock, you get a random tutorial pop-up for it, constantly breaking the flow of the game.

Making Kakaroto's all the more confusing, a lot of it overlaps after a while, making it hard to keep up.

What about battle buffs? 

Oh my... You can get some characters to make you the most delightful meals, and each meal earns you exclusive buffs of variable stats and duration. But the problem stems from the fact that there's just too many, each requiring all sorts of ingredients, some more common than others.

Some cutscenes suffer from pre-render syndrome, and their resolution was capped at 1080p & rendered at the lowest possible bitrate imaginable.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
Kakaroto's a long, long game, that tells the story of DBZ exceptionally well, and is fully loaded with fan service, but falls short of being truly great.

Therefore earning a rEvo's rating of 6/10.",1659347345,1659349521,True,9,0,0.610879182815551758,0,True,False,False

(If you are a fan of Dragonball): B+
(Otherwise): D- 
 
2nd edit - The more I play this game the worse it becomes..., once the DB hype runs out, the combat quickly goes from awful, to annoying, frustrating and infuriating, especially against multiple opponents.
Fights very quickly devolve away from DBZ fantasy into dodging like a coward until a small window open when you can do one attack of some kind and then go back to avoiding fighting again,


Cons [Combat]:
- a mosquito sneeze is enough to interrupt a Super Sayan God....,
- game actively punishes you for trying to do melee combat,
- enemies constantly abuse super armor, 
- multiple enemies will keep you interrupted and chain stunlock you often,
- game is obsessed in putting you versus multiple opponents while denying you your own team mates,

Cons [Combat mechanics]
- multi hit moves poorly connect with enemies and will often miss,
- ""guided"" Ki moves don't work properly,
- some special attacks work with combos some do not - game wont indicate this until you try out,
- blocking is next to worthless as it will be broken and open you to damage while stunned,
- enemies can magically perfect dodge your attacks,


Cons [Skill/RPG System]:
- skills/upgrades are gated by story progression and level,
- game allows you to waste time unlocking certain skills but then blocks you from being able to use them until arbitrary points in the story,
- random encounters give barely any experience but game is constantly trying to force you into them, often one after abother,
- food stats gains are some sort of a troll attempt, you gain 1000 HP when your chaarcter is sitting on milions,

Other Cons:
- big explosions/clouds of dust /terrain obscuring your vision while enemies keep beating you up,
- open world is pretty but filled with nothing interesting,
- side quest add some flavor but are only voiced by ""grunts"" and are rather boring,


Pros:
- You can go Super Sayan and punch Frieza in his ugly mug,
- can visit many locations from DB Universe and meet almost all of the characters,
- decent graphics - characters recreated well to match anime,
- 1 vs 1 battles are Ok.",1658521166,1659202914,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This game is not an RPG. It's more like a 3D hack and slash that progresses you through the story of Dragon Ball Z. A significant downgrade from a game like Xenoverse 2.

I got attacked by the same two, very similar, looking enemies about 100 times, while flying around the open world, trying to collect endless orbs, which I need in order to learn new abilities.

I progressed through the story, and I did some empty feeling quests.
The whole experience was extremely tedious. It felt like a waste of time.

What's worse is... I don't know if developers/publishers are paying for, or possibly spamming 5-Star & Thumbs Up reviews on their own games... or what's going on... but look this game up on Google, you'll find plenty of paragraph-long, 5-Star reviews that are word for word copies of each other, posted by different users.

All I'm saying is something is fishy.

I'm starting to feel like reviews in general are completely meaningless these days.

It's a truly an awful world we live in, where you don't know how good anything is,
but in reality, everything sucks more, and more, and more, every, single, day.

If you thought this was just another game to play through the dbz storyline, you are partly correct.
But this game is so much more. Being semi-open world gives rise to unique and nostalgic conversations.
Graphics are top-notch, combat feels fun and your connection to characters for some reason feels much better than you would expect.

Played the future trunks DLC too, dreat job by the devs there. The extra parts after the android saga (not shown in the anime) is a treat and hits hard.

I'm not a DBZ fanboy and I wasn't one to watch the show so the story was new to me in every aspect. My sister loved the show and I appreciated the artwork. 

The gameplay and story are quite fun and I think that anyone who is a DBZ fan will absolutely love the game. I have tried other DBZ games and this is the only one that has held my interest. I will be going through and beating the rest of it.

I do have one complaint that I think others should keep in mind before buying the game. The side quests and intermissions between major plot events are horrible. They are what makes portions of the game almost unbearable. Most of them you can skip but there are some that you have to complete. These side quests sum up to fetch quests. The most horrible of them all is one where you have to get a royal tomato by getting a specific fish that only spawns sometimes at certain locations so you end up gathering up a ton of resources that are not related to the side quest itself. I took me almost half an hour (I wish I didn't have to admit this) to find the item needed. It comes down to my own stupidity to waste that kind of time on something pointless.

Basically an interactive anime with very straightforward fights. Most people pull through, just look at the achievements and their completion rates, despite the long play times. (We play long hours because we are watching cut scenes). I have enjoyed this a lot, I think the genius of Toriyama shines through even though it's not the comic.

BUTs:
- A game controller is almost required, the keyboard support is really poor. Also, make it an XBox controller, if possible.
- If you are one of those who skips the cut scenes, don't get this game, as you would be skipping 70% of the content.
- The game is teen-rated so it doesn't show blood in the fights.",1658080960,1658080960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I just finished the main story and I'll probably keep on playing it and will buy the dlc's. I had a lot of fun with this game so far and I have to say that this is, right after budokai tenkaichi 3, my favourite dragon ball game out there. Unfortunately I still have to give it a negative review. I'll explain my complains in detail below, but here are my main points, why I just can't recommend to buy this game to anyone here. 

1. The pricing for this game is way too high. Don't get me wrong I like to pay money to people who brought me a lot of fun with their work. But I still can't wrap my head around the pricing for this game since it is very flawed in many ways and the technical side of this game is not nearly on the level it should be for a game from 2020. For 20 bucks this game is totally worth it (I got it for 20) but anybody who buys it for 60 bucks or more ist just wasting their money. There are far better games out there with better pricing and you can watch the series online for free.
2. I do not think this game is for anybody who is not looking for a nostalgia trip through one of his favourite storys of all time. The game is so flawed and everything in this game but the flying and the combat could have been implemented better. I probably only enjoyed the game, since I was able too look beyond all these flaws and my monkey nostalgia neurons just fired like hell everytime I saw something nice.

So lets come to pros and cons:

Pros:
- super fun combat (they just nailed it)
- really good cutscenes (when it comes to the main story)
- occasionally funny dialogs in sidequests wich arent in the main series
- some sidequests are really good
- flashy fights
- the game really looks and feels like the anime
- first time you are able to explore the whole world yourself
- the game sounds really good (soundtrack, voiceacting and soundeffects are just on point)
- the rpg system makes the game a whole lot more interesting, since you have to somehow manage the strength of the characters
- good mini games
- Well it is a Dragonball game. This is a pro in my opinion
- You get to play the episode where Goku and Picollo go to driving school

Cons:
- The game doesn't look too good if I am honest. You can look over that fact since it looks so charming. The characters look nice, if you focus on the combat and if you are blind, well yes then it might look good, but if you take a closer look this game looks really crappy. The trees look like lego sets if you take a closer look and the whole world just looks like they either did not have enough time to put enough detail in the world or, what i would guess, they were simply too lazy to make a more detailed world.
- The map is a f**ing wasteland. I love that you are able to explore the world by flying around it but this world is only pretty and nice if you look at it from the sky. This map is really f**ing empty and tbh there is not much to find on it other than little fotos that give you a nostalgie trip to the first series. 
- The NPC's are some of the worst I have ever seen. These are just walking zombies who well.... just walk and stand in the middle of nowhere and do literally nothing. The world does not seem like there are living people in it. It seems like they had 20 npc models, made 2 walking and standing animations for male and female and just placed them around the map. For a full price game this is really the worst you could do and it is embarissing.
- The Sidequests .... well ..... the Sidequests.... While some where pretty funny and had some interesting interactions between the characters or even interesting fights, other sidequests are really repetetive garbage with no soul or meaning to it what so ever. Plain and boring missions where you fight against robots, saibaman or freezer soldiers for some stupid reason or where you have to find some random items that are all over the map ( The map is not really small).
- I will not talk about every mechanic here but let me put it this way. There are a lot of optional gameplay mechanics here that seem nice at first but are in fact obsolete since they dont impact your fights in any significant way. So these mechanics just feel like a total waste of time.... and there are a LOT of these mechanics ..... It just seems like a waste of potential these mechanics have. It is a pity.
- To see everything in this game you have to grind a bit and this can get boring pretty quick since the world is empty, boring and everything is kinda soulless outside the main campaign.


So in conclusion:
- I really liked the game. I think it is not bad but I would not call it great either. It is good if you are a fan of DB in general, it is ""meh"" if you aren't familiar with the series.
- Should you buy this game ? Not for the full price. Wait for sale and grab it for a cheap price. BUUUT since it is a full price game .... I will give it a negative review because no human being with more than 2 brain cells can justify this price for a game that is this flawed and looks like it was made in 2012.",1636242303,1658063588,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Absolutely worth the purchase, I feel like this would be the best DB game If it had Versus mode. Then it would be the best Singleplayer DBZ game.

The story is very complete, a bit tidious when you come out of a mission and you have to travel to x location, but theres tons of things to do.

DBZK provides a card game, is actually pretty good, If it wasn't for some players that just abuse Android 17 & 18 to win matches ( User: ""Card update please "" Im looking at you pal, how bored are you, same 2 card always) also there's literally few people playing that, shame it's pretty dead. Because the concept is really good. I feel like it should be a game by itself deattached from Kakarot.

The gameplay is engaging but not too complex to those whom enjoy DragonBall but may not be fighting game enthusiasts. It feels fast, fluid and powerful. I'm playing on Normal difficulty and while I haven't struggled too much on any fights yet there certainly is challenge to be found here so I feel like Normal difficulty is a good place to start.

Where Kakarot really shines is in the small details. They're able to show you all the moments reimagined in epic ways. For simply living the story of the universe I can't say I've played a better Dragonball game in that regard. They do the big moments justice while filling the world up with fun little side quests and fan service

Would greatly recomend to any fan of DragonBall whether casual or diehard.

I've seen every episode from the original anime up to Super and read nearly every chapter of the manga (I'm not current on Super), so needless to say an openworld game in this universe had me pretty excited. That being said this game is not worth the time you'll waste in it. It's grindy, repetitive, and annoying. Characters say the same 5 lines of dialogue over and over in the open world and you are constantly attacked by trash mobs that scale to your character's level. The combat is boring and incredibly easy, and the only reason your progress through the story will be halted is when you need to grind for levels so you don't get OHKO'd by the next boss. It covers the story of Dragon Ball Z so I mean nothing you haven't seen before in a myriad of other games, now you just have to deal with annoying repeating dialogue and get forced into fighting random Red Ribbon robots that are as strong as you are for some godforsaken reason. Now the animations are gorgeous and rewatching Z in this way was kind of cool, but we've all seen it so many times that it didn't really excite me like if they had started from OG Dragon Ball. Not to mention the game is called Kakarot and due to Z mostly being Gohan's story that's who you play as the most. All in all I'd give the game a 5/10, it's just uninspired and very obviously trying to profit off of fans love for the series.",1657267868,1657267868,False,8,0,0.609348595142364502,1,True,False,False

1 The combat is very easy
2 just the 3 main sagas it definitely would have been better had it included any movie content, dragon ball content, or id even go so far as to say GT regardless of how you may feel about it. Instead it adds some extra character depth to some of the old characters though if you haven't watched dragon ball you might not know them.... Welcome back Launch xp.
3 By far the biggest issue is i feel like you spend more time as gohan then goku.

though my review sounds mostly negative i do rather enjoy the game not a master piece but definitely fun for any fan id love to have had this game include everything dragon ball starting with Bulma shooting goku in the head only then it might have deserved the name Kakarot for now i call it dragon  ball z Gohan lol",1657146320,1657146320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This becomes very important for not only fighting Beerus but the 100 man battles as well in the DLC.

Flying around in a open world is also kinda fun until the random encounters start becoming hella annoying and you wish you could be doing literally anything else.

And... hot dang, so far I'm really impressed! I've just reached the cell saga and I have to say I am having a ton of fun! Boss fights are interesting, Raditz being the hardest so far.

Was it an easy fight in the anime? Great! You'll likely stomp! Was it a hard fight in the anime? Oh- shit- prepare for a fight!

The only thing that kinda hits me is that you have to limit yourself a little to enjoy it. You can win almost any fight pretty easily as long as you aren't severely under levelled. Why? There's food that gives you perminant stat boosts and there's no limit to the amount of recovery items you can bring.

However, without focusing on cooking the meals and just cooking it when I'm in the area/ randomly picked up some ingrediants aaaand setting limits on using recovery items for yourself- feels really balanced.

The combat is smooth and fun, the game looks amazing; and there's some fun stuff to do outside of the main story like races, upgrading machines, destroying towers/frieza ships, hunting etc. There are also plenty of sidequests to do, however some of them tend to be pretty stale consisting of fetch quests.

So far my review has been fairly positive, so you're probably wondering why i'm not recommending this game. And the main reason for that is due to the bugs/glitches that the game still has. There are times in the game where I have been softlocked and had to reset the game, losing some progress as a result. And the most damning being that one day I log on, and I have lost literally all of my save data. The game acts like I have opened it for the first time, i've tried everything, digging into the game files etc; no luck. Which is unfortunate, because I was grinding this game to try and get 100% (I had 2 achievements to go). I don't feel like playing the entire game again just to do this, and so i'm not recommending based on my experience.

Maybe this won't happen to you, but it has happened to multiple people; me now being one of them.",1656260948,1656260948,False,63,9,0.615078330039978027,0,True,False,False

The game tells the entirety of Goku's saga from the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, and covers a few alternate stories like Trunks' timeline, and the movies that would become the start of Dragon Ball Super. Other than that, there are a bunch of fun stories treated as side quests, and a few minigames to keep you entertained, while hardly being a necessity to completion of the game.

Story mode alone is refreshingly long; there are a great amount of battles and each one is punctuated by either a cinematic video, or a fully-voiced summary of what happened in the original series. It does skip some parts, and modifies another ones to fit better the format of a videogame, but all that is understandable.

The meat of the game, and gameplay would be a sort of 3D fighting game while exclusively flying. There is only a melee attack button that makes combos by itself, with four different finishers - each exclusive to each character - and a customizable palette of 'super-attacks' which would be the iconic moves that each character has been using in the series canonically. Characters Level up and learn or improve on their abilities. Keeping up with the Level the game wants you to is hardly a challenge if one goes around hunting for side-quests or defeat a few enemies here and there for some extra experience and items.

There are several currencies in the game, and the flight controls are fair. It is a little regrettable that while each level is absolutely littered with 'Z orbs', a currency needed to learn or improve moves, they become irrelevant very early on. Why would you spend half an hour hunting for a few hundred while a single battle offers you several thousand, and you abilities require tens of thousands to level up? It's a shame that it's such an obvious fix, as simply adjusting prices, scaling, or making each orb collectable in-world worth multiple of itself.

There are a few mechanics that I did not care for. The first DLC, A New Power Awakens, is nothing but a grind-fest. Granted, that's precisely what the movie it's based on was, making the characters stronger as they train, but they went a little overboard. I believe the game would work better with a LOWER level-cap. Why grind all the way up to 300 when and 200 would have achieved basically the same? I realize it was a sort of challenge and the game can honestly be beat without even rivaling the level of the final boss, but it's just food for thought.

The 'horde battles' at the second DLC, the second part of 'A New Power Awakens', are honestly dull and uninteresting. The characters are just not meant to face that many enemies at once, which most of them die from one hit and are hardly a challenge. Spamming the same area-of-effect attacks is hardly a fun activity. They're mostly optional, but as a new mechanic you pay for, it is honestly a pretty bad one.

That's all the gripes I had. The voicing of the characters is great, the inclusion of the original Japanese voices is a treat, as it is to re-live Goku and friends' adventures through a pretty damn good retelling of it, with graphics that both look pretty, but pay tribute to the original animated shows (take notes, people who do DBS). I doubt any fan of the series would be disappointed to add this one to the collection.",1655984045,1655984045,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Edit: Now that i have finished it, i must say some parts where a little bit TO forgiving for my taste. At least on normal also most of the optional charakter upgrades where not really necessary.

You can:
- Fly, YEPPA!
- Fly at a higher speed, YEPPA!!
- Fly underwater, YEPPA!!!
- You can hunt, mine (both actions are cheap but I guess we could say that) and fish.
- Use a Skill tree.
- Craft a few robots.
- Destroy Red Ribbon Towers and Frieza's ships lying around the map.
- Do subquests.
- Defeat special enemies on the world map.
- Gather the Dragon Balls and summon Shenron.

The Main Story Line is really well made, it's probably one of the closest to the original DBZ manga I've ever played so far.

Is there any flaw?

Sure, a few:
- Some subquests are utterly stupid, you want to skip them. They're not just hard, they're practically a bit unfair, sometimes just boring, and this sucks in a game so simple such as this one.

- I didn't like the fact they added lev.42 special monsters when you are still level 10, why adding enemies so early that can OHKO you? FYI, you get to level 40 when you're around the Cyborg Saga.

- A few scenes have been basically censored and some kills have been softened: some of your enemies will die by a Ki Blast in a cutscene, and not by beheading (Guldo) , for example. 
Chances are, whoever buys this game, has watched the original show or has bought the manga, so what's the point of this ""censorship""? 

- You can't play as Mr. Popo, otherwise the game would be over in an instant.

- Certain iconic moments/fights have been cut.

Other than these small (but maybe a bit annoying) details, it's totally recommended, well done.",1654882576,1654993157,True,45,6,0.81348806619644165,0,True,False,False

Otherwise game is mostly fun. Things I don't like:
- Combat is too basic (1 punch button)
- Fluff fetch quests (mostly sub-stories but also sometimes inserted into main story)
- Repetitive voice lines with no option to reduce / disable ONLY the repetitive voice lines
- It's an RPG but many elements don't seem to matter (For example, there is a cooking mechanic to permanently boost your HP and other stats, but the amount is extremely insignificant compared to 1 level up)

- nice graphic style
- awesome and fun combat
- if u never watch dbz anime then this is perfect game for you cause this is basically anime but also game at the same time.

cons =
- big boring open world and empty
- grinding takes forever and not interesting at all. u need to collect different color kind of orbs. these orbs respawn everytime and so u need to collect these everytime (at the start of the game) to unlock new moves
- they did a very poor job of implementing the feel of a super saiyan. u dont feel any different than normal form. your ki attack doesnt look different. your attack look and feel the same. and this is why im not interested to play the dlc where goku change into ultra instinct form
- levelling your character is also a pain in the ass. the amount of exp provided by normal battle gonna make you sad. 
by level 60 u gonna need a million exp to level up. the amount of exp u get from normal battle is 30k-ish.
the only way to find million exp is to fight main story boss.
- very weak jrpg game overall

but it still kinda a good experience. not worth the full price

TIPS FOR NEW PLAYER 
- if u have new awaken power set dlc.
u can perfectly start with that. in that dlc u can earn an item called sacred water that can give u exp. they way to collect these is u need fight this one guy over and over again. its grindy but u will go from level 1 to 100 or even 250 (max) in no time and gonna make ur main story gameplay much much easier and u can unlock super saiyan god.",1654188486,1654189227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The open world is stunning and instantly allows you feel transported into the DBZ series. 

The Bad: *Disclaimer* my negative points are mostly from a completionist standpoint and shouldn't deter anyone from checking this game out. Firstly, the mini-games available are awesome and fun, but quickly feel pointless. Cooking being added to generate stat buffs is a great touch, but I feel like more could have be done with Bulma, possibly to add an item development system. I'm a big fan of the ole Budokai Tenkaichi series, and being able to collect equipment/wish for items from Shenron gave those titles a great feel; which I think would have worked here as well. Second, the encounter/open world combat with random villains is nice at first, but after a half hour of random fights while you try to pick apples; you'll quickly find yourself avoiding enemies as much as you can.

Overall: A great addition to the DBZ franchise and well worth a runthrough if you're a fan of the series.",1654085706,1654085706,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[i] - Nostalgia is over 9000! [/i]


[b] PLUS [/b]

- Faithfully recreation of the Dragon Ball Z saga.
- All the characters, world and lore that you know and love from the anime.
- Fantastic and recognizable soundtrack.
- Colorful and flashy combat.
- Varied minigames and collectibles.
- No missable content, you can replay everything once you finish the main story.


[b] MINUS [/b]

- It's not a fighting game, expect a RPG with lots of fights.
- Main story and quest levels are fixed, overleveling them removes all the (little) challange.
- Dull sidequests, fight this or fetch that. Worth it just for the NPC and lore nostalgia.
- Open world illusion, few and small maps, lacks variety.
- Pricey, wait for a sale.


[b] RECOMMENDATIONS [/b]

- Aoe attacks are essential. Vegeta's Big Bang Attack is monstrous.
- Auto transformation skills are useful.
- Play the DLCs after finishing the main story, or you will easily overlevel it.
- There is only one autosave slot, keep your own saves regularly.

I tried all the recommended fixes and nothing worked. So I had to play for 20 mins at a time waiting for the next crash, even then still beat the game, but was tedious.
