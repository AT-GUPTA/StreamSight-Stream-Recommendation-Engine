Just lost a lot of progress because apparently saving game files is too hard for the FM24 devs (never had this problem in previous versions.) Maybe you should check out FM22 or FM23 until these guys fix their beta software?

Ok, more bugs. Now it won't let me change the starting country when I try to create a new save, and I cannot choose any England start dates.

I *might* come back and update my rating to be positive much later, but right now it is bug city.

*** EDIT 11/30 *** Whelp, Steam auto-updated my FM24 and guess what? It broke ALL of the newgen faces I had in my save! I cannot stress things enough! This game is BUGGY!

If you already downloaded FM24, DO NOT install today's update! Who knows what else they broke!?

*** EDIT 12/21 *** Well, found out the hard way that the 30/60 minutes auto save feature DOES NOT WORK. Just found out my most recent autosave (should have a rolling 10 of them) was from 2 weeks ago (or about 1 year in game time, lol.) Honestly, I would *love* to give this game a recommended rating, but every time I get close to, I get screwed by another hideous bug. Maybe by spring they'll get this game sorted out?

If you have not yet bought FM24, DO NOT BUY IT until they fix all their bugs. You will be much happier continuing with FM22 or FM23. Trust me.

*** EDIT 2/7/24 ***

EVERY time I am having fun and thinking I am too negative and should change my review to a positive, I get hit with another, frustrating, time wasting bug. The developer stated they fixed the issue regarding save game not loading in November but I just lost another save and an hour or so due to that bug again. Fellas, if you buy this game, PLEASE back up your saves REPEATEDLY, several times an hour (multiple time per game day.) Again, I never had this issue with FM22. Not sure what their problem is this time around, but the longer this goes, the more it will take for me to regain my trust in the franchise. Fun game, just be prepared for your progress to be wiped out at any time.

*** Edit 2/13/24 ***

Ok, now that is TWO saves corrupted in less than a week. How is this not considered ""beta"" software. Don't spend money on this product until they fix basic issues. If you do play FM24, you MUST save your game multiple times per game day, and have MULTIPLE save files so you don't lose too much progress. I do not get frustrated very easily, but honestly, I am getting tired of having to update this!",1699771555,1707808476,False,4,0,0.515065550804138184,4,True,False,False

I keep going through periods of no crowd being in the stadiums. My strikers predictably get hurt just as they are finding form again and again and again. (This has happened with EVERY striker I've had over and over since starting the save and I'm now on 2039). The fixtures are pretty much in the same order in each season. So for example, you play Man Utd, Fulham, Southampton first 3 games of the season, once you've played everyone once, it'll be that order all over again, or very, very similar. Loans are super annoying. No one wants to offer money when trying to loan your players and none of them want your player, no matter how good he is, above fringe level playing time. You can negotiate the playing time, but you have to do that individually with every offer. So if you have 20 offers for 1 player you have to negotiate 20 times (with half of them backing out if you try to get better playing time for your guy).
 I'm quite new to the FM scene. 23 was my first and I loved that game. I've been playing this from very early on and I can't believe how broken it is and how nothing seems to be getting fixed for it. It's a massive step backwards in my eyes with very little progress being shown.

In -7- years it is almost exactly the same game, even down to the flavour text questions. (And some STILL have spelling mistakes,... 7 YEARS later.) If anything, it has gotton worse. You can't assemble a world class team without them moaning about not all being played day in day out, despite real world elite footballers understanding the words ""squad rotation.""  There is then NO way to appease them - loads of BUTTONS, loads of OPTIONS, but save scumming and trying them all proves NONE of them work apart from appeasement. And if the squad then get angry at you, again, NO BUTTON WORKS EXCEPT APPEASMENT. What is the POINT of putting all those options in if NONE of them work?? And the player they were angry about? His average for the season was 6.7 and his current average was 6.4.... And these players thought he DESERVED HIS PLACE IN THE TEAM BASED ON FORM.

Real world elite football squads do not work like this. They do not gang up on the manager in droves to defend a player who is playing awful and then throw a collective hissy fit where they tank their perfomances on purpose.

So that, combined with the fact that even awful FIFA improved its game year-on-year more than this lazy developer, means I will not be trying this product again for probably another 10 years.

It is all about scouting, all the areas of the game stay so unclear and confusing no matter how much time and effort you put. You can work on the tactics, training or the staff but it's useless.
There is no feedback or explanation for what you doing, all of the sudden your team play poorly. Same guys, with great spirit and physical form but overnight they just cant play football for a month or two. No matter if you ask same something as basic as a 442 counter attack, you gonna get smack by some randos.

Edit: I've now played this game for over 400 hours (because I'm a football addict, not because the game is fun), and it seems to get more and more infuriating the further you play into it.

By about season 3, the match engine becomes comical. Shots magically repelled out of an empty net, wild rebounds/curved shots that bend the laws of physics, and defenders who completely lose the plot. Not to mention that the game is extremely rigged toward the home team (as long as you're not the home team) even when it's an event halfway across the world like the Club World Cup. Apparently Real Madrid is based in Japan and should be counted as a home team there.

Also, players start having hissy fits about not playing enough games ... when they play almost every game ... and then when you grant their request for a transfer, they turn it down. Players turn down transfers all the f***ing time ... for no reason ... and then they p*** and moan about not getting a move.

For the umpteenth year in a row, SI still has done nothing to change the balance of transfers. Other teams completely lowball you on your players and want a huge premium on young players that they stockpile and ... never play.

This game is an absolute mess and possibly the worst Football Manager of all time, but we know nothing will change.

Graphics look like a game from 2000 but apparently these are massively improved.

The sound during the game is like listening to an illegal live stream through your neighbours wall.

The new J-League has no appreciation for its own rules, mostly disregarding players trained at their club and forcing them to have massively reduced team sheets from the second season. The league essentially becomes a joke.

Press conferences are as pointless as they were 4 years ago, assigned to the assistant after 2 goes.

It all comes back to the actual matches - I found that changing tactics to almost anything else works for about 3 matches, then quickly falls apart. This is in EPL, J League, la liga. Developing my own tactics with my players or downloading a ""top"" tactic, it doesn't matter.

Loads of games with 15/8 shots/on target vs 1/1 and losing 0-1. This should be the freak, not the regular. It seems to be punishing the player for playing the game. All the player ratings are basically tied to goals and winning the game, so when you lose despite dominating (key passes, key tackles, etc.) your players score low, their avg. goes down as does their value, not to mention your league position, and it all spirals.

It feels like nothing you do in the game really matters; everything is either extremely RNG or it's scripted, but the game engine is a blackbox and you have no idea what is making these decisions. Do shouts matter? Are my tactics good or is this luck? There isn't a ""combat log"" that can show you how each dice roll was determined with various + and - based on your players stats, you are trusting the game to be a reasonable actor despite the evidence to the contrary. You can't work out what works and what doesn't, especially when you can reload a game and get a completely different result.

Outside of the match engine, the game is too much and too little information at the same time. I'm inundated with useless scouting reports, but I have no idea how my avatars national team is doing unless I actively subscribe to it. Players playing for their countries? No idea. An under 18 *exists* at the club? Here is a detailed report. Champions League results? No thank you. It's like being trapped in a room with an Alexa who is subscribed to every detail of your club, but all you really want is to watch the sports news channel.

The game has a lot to live up to, obviously, compared to real world media coverage. But it doesn't create any kind of world with excitement or intrigue. There isn't a Sky Super Sunday type coverage option where you could see the highlights, hear the pundits, see how these teams form has been. It all gets lost in this information overload, every inbox item is just presented with equal shitty value.

After so many hours on this series, I'd love for this game to be a chillout, have something on tv in the background kind of game. Or an intense, high focus, detailed tactical game. But it's neither, it's just boring and frustrating.",1700688061,1706295417,False,1,0,0.492957741022109985,0,True,False,False

There is a glitch that needs sorting still, Left Back after 60 minutes will begin to man mark a central midfielder.  

Team changing a CM to Mez and all of a sudden he has 20 yards of space on the edge the box even though you have the space marked out.

The worst and this has happened since 2014 the game literally robbing you, I have just played PSG they scored a goal 2 yards offside it show the reply, Got back to 1-1 and a penalty that was outside the box given. I score a goal and its onside again the replay shows disallowed again.

I only buy Football Manager every few years and the last one I bought was FM 2015. Every year the latest edition gets a bit more complicated without adding playability to the game. With FM 2015 I managed to get Hearts FC to win the SPL every year and eventually win the Champions League on a regular basis. That was fantasy football and great fun. The only downside was that the 3-D game mechanics weren't entirely convincing with the oft qouted ""ice skating on the pitch"" in some evidence 



This version of the game is much more realistic which means it's less fun. I manage The Spartans FC and and managed in something like ten years took the club from the fourth tier of Scottish football all the way up to the top tier. However I spent nearly all my time in the SPL avoiding relegation which was so frustrating I decided to delete that particular game and start again using the youtube tutorials . However this hasn't made much difference despite following all the advice from multiple sources on youtube 

None of this is helped by needlessly complicated tactics and elements such as keeping the players happy. No matter what I do the players attributes often drop to an alarming level  which is a pity because the game visuals are fairly impressive 

Sega have made it clear that FM24 will be the last ""Traditional version"" . I've no idea what this means for the future but I do hope this means the game will be simpler to play. I for one am rather nostalgic for the good old days of Championship Manager where you could play a whole season in a couple of hours .",1705451569,1705451569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The match engine is the best it's been in a long time. You can make all kinds of interesting tactics work well, it's not a case of having to play in a specific way. With one exception - the pressing, I'll explain that below.

The core issue is that fatigue has a pretty low impact in order to have fewer injuries and generally be less of a problem than it should, because players always complain about injuries. If you try it, you'll see you don't even need to rotate that much, long injuries are rare and you can play pressing all season by just giving players rest days from training. The side effect is that even crappy AI teams can afford to play a hard press all season with relatively little drawback, and of course pressing hard makes them more effective than they should be able to. Other than buffing bad teams, this also leads to a climate of mayhem in the games because everyone is running around like crazy, and you get some wacky results and leagues.

One more issue is that morale is more overblown than usual. Goes for you and the AI. You can ride a morale wave to a season of invincibility, or you can have a rough patch just because a couple of guys complained about playing time, and your rival then rides the morale wave to a season of invincibility. Morale matters but in this version it's oversensitive.

One last thing I like is that in the match engine you can now make use of players who aren't fast or big, they aren't as useless as in the past. You can even play old players who are intelligent but slow and they can still do things even at a high level team.",1699287161,1705323621,True,2,0,0.536784708499908447,0,True,False,False

 + Pluses:
 1) I can feel the difference in game engine compared to FM21.
 2) Set pieces are not just improved, but I think have reached final form. 
 3) Performance has improved IMO.
 - Minuses
 1) I can barely feel that I'm playing a new game.
 2) Editor has to be free!
 3) three iterations later, the press conferences are absolutely the same! How haven't they updated a little at least?

Final thoughts - Some great improvements, but still not worthy full price. This is a DLC even compared to FM21. You should wait for FM25 which will be based on the Unity engine.

EDIT (played a bit* more) - Had fun during the holidays, and enjoyed the new/updated teams, but still same old...

I can waste plenty of time on it, but the underlying quality has grown so poor it's saddening. The bug reports forums, suggestions, raised issues, are either ignored or utterly dismissed.
I wish I'd looked further into the forums before purchasing. This is by far, not the first year this has happened, but it feels the biggest stagnation on important matters.

Do not waste the money until you are SURE SI is going to behave less toxically.

-Tactics are outdated and inflexible, some of the options only seem to be there to give you an illusion of choice, but they do nothing.

-ME is still a mess, 4 star players can make the most mind boggling decisions, and plays around and in the box are almost always the same, no matter what tactics you try to use.

-Away match handicap is way too OP. It doesn't matter what team you have or what tactical genius you're trying to pull. A defender will not start to pass to the opponent striker just because they are playing away. Wtf is this?

-Your losses are 99% due to moronic defender behaviour instead of brilliant attacker behaviour. It just feels really cheap. I would rather see nice plays, than idiotic mistakes during a game.

-Every single match has at least 4-5 minutes of added time. Feels like there is no exception. Of course the AI will use this to draw the match after the last minute.

-Player interactions are so bad it's almost comical. You get like 10 responses to respond but there is almost zero variety, you only get the extremes. You give the player time, he still complains for more time, can't even tell him that he is playing bad so p!ss off. 
They get injured for 2-3 months, get back to training and the first thing they do is complain that they are not starting matches???

-AI managers are just bad. Wonderkids rotting in the subs/reserves in clown leagues with 10M buyouts?",1703783349,1704745102,False,4,0,0.515448153018951416,0,True,False,False

Here is a (very long) review from a player who is:
[list]
[*] Loves playing sim and tycoon games
[*] Coming from FM22, and played FM20.
[*] Plays only on Indonesian league, where most players attributes at its peak is below decent compared to european standards.
[*] Playing create-a-club mode
[*] Uses a custom DB (5 level Indonesian Pyramid and much more leagues) with :
[list]
[*] Starting point at Indonesian 5th division
[*] 200k+ players
[*] 50+ leagues active (at least top3 nations from each continent is playable for the top 2 level, 80% of available asian nation is top 2 level playable and below that is view only)
[/list]
[*] With PC specs as follows:
[list]
[*] R9 5950X, 32GB @ 3200Mhz, RX 6800XT
[/list]
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
    [*]3D match engine for Players is an absolute banger. Improved significantly compared to FM22. 
[list]
[*]Player animation is smooth, way more realistic (their body actually lean, twists etc depending on their required movement), and expressive (had a CB showing his anger by throwing his hands towards my GK that made a stupid pass and regretfully hold his hands behind his head). 
[*]GK actually do saves by every single part of their body. 
[*]Tackles and shooting movement is much better, players getting tackled is (most of the time) no longer like a bugged pedestrian animation in vanilla GTA San Andreas. 
[*]Ridiculous rubberbanding (when defender with significant pace-related attributes advantages or attackers with ""winds up opponents trait"") like a Need for Speed's cops is no longer happening. 
[*]RUNNING IS NO LONGER DRUNK, in FM22 my players (in vertical scroll cam) almost all the time NEVER RUN STRAIGHT, in this edition however, their run is actually straight enough to be called as sober.
[/list]
    [*]3D match engine for THE BALL is an amazing improvement compared to FM22. 
[list]
[*]The ball now has A REALISTIC TRAJECTORY where its movement is based on the last contact. No more ball turning and moving along with the player without making any contact. 
[*]Swerving ball is now much more realistic, its spinning speed is equivalent to how much swerve the player put into the ball.
[/list]
    [*]Simulation engine is way faster and responsive. My FM22 save has 160k players enabled and I would confidently say this edition is ~35% faster despite having much more players included, but take this as a grain of salt, it could also be the custom db that makes this point, but overall, the speed improvement is noticeable and much more enjoyable playing my FM24 save than the FM22.
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
[*]Realism outside the squad, staff, tactics, and match management is lacking because there is no physical evidence of the facilities other than our home stadium. For example, a club has a very small capacity stadium with terrible condition field, but its training and youth facilities is superb, corporate facilities graded as top, junior and youth recruitment is exceptional, it just don't make any sense because mostly we can't see the physical evidence of this facilities. Making my club has its own training and/or youth complex different with its stadium (like Real Madrid, including after several long saves in FM20) so far is not possible.
[*]The 3D match cameras is basically stagnant for the last few years. Director camera has the MOST VARIETY OF ANGLES, but the chance of it chooses angles other than the default TV-like camera is insulting. If this camera was meant to be ""PoV of your club's director/president"" then it should not have multi-angle views during highlights. If this is actually a 'directed camera', then make it like the way most in-game esports titles has its own automated action-directed camera. I also don't understand why there is no ""Player PoV"" camera, or better yet we can control the movement of our character during the match if using 3D view. It would add so much flavor and realism inside the game. I sincerely hope FM in their new engine for future titles have this.
    [*]The game's managerial aspect is getting deeper and more accurate to its counterparts (for example, the set piece coach, set piece routines, and squad planning feature, which is good), but it is mostly graph and text. We are a text and data, not a character. We don't know how our clubs complex looks like, we can't even roam our club's stadium in our free days and/or during/after the match, interaction with players titled ""put hands on his shoulders"" but no animation or anything. For me, sometimes this creates a certain level of boredom. I want to see my clubs whole facilities in person you know? Since I've worked hard for most of that.
[*]Going from amateur to pros gives me some stupid contract issues (or if it just GM features that still stupid). Two legitimately funny (and frustrating) case is 
[list]
 [*] one of my player is on youth contract, I instruct my GM to extend its contract, it was fine, but when the actual contract trigger date happens, the news shows the player as ""going professional"", with ""N/A"" contract values, and his status is actually a free agent, what the hell?
 [*] all of my staffs is in amateur contract except my technical director, I instruct TD to update all my contract staff just to find that 60% of my staff never wanting to make it full contract, while the other 40% getting a new full-time contract, with N/A salary for a few years, which when I checked by ""change contract offer"", the salary values is actually 0. What is this? Modern slavery?
[/list]
[/list]
[hr][/hr]
[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
This one has matured in most of its features and aspects.
If you love or want to try a football club management game, this game is worth to buy, even more when it's on a discount or you can get it below the standard Steam's price, since the next FM will be using a new engine and I would sure it won't be as smooth as this one.",1704461060,1704462235,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* Do you guys remember about Sponsorship that you get yearly and the end of your season? I don't think I've ever gotten those in FM23, in fact, I don't remember getting it at all. The sponsorship money could be HUGE and helpful for your Overall Balance (in Finance) -> really help paying my players wages.
* Saudi League actually buying expensive transfervalue/wage players -> HUGE.
* FM24 actually BUYING your players more consistently.. They most likely gonna buy your players starting from 23y/o to even 32y/o -> HUGE, because I never got offers for my players in FM23 and they are all above 25y/o.. They will also most likely retire in my club.

Even after 10 season of perfecting an overpowered team, planning the same tactic to the last detail, improvising staff to perfection you still get equalised in a late minute in a final.

However there are still some bits needs to be ironed. Transfer market is ridiculous in sense of player versus ai balance. For example, I control United, and Rashford really shined in my last season 21 goals and 18 assists, when we won all the cups except Carabao Cup. And now he stands around 100m as market value, Real Madrid interested and make an offer for 95m  , he is interested, I dont want to sell him easily then negotiated the offer for 150m, moderate yes in today's market. They found it unacceptable, completely end their interest Rashord became uneasy and etc. By the way they already sold Vinicius for 250 to City so they had the need and the money. But the same Madrid went and spent 180 something to ridiculous player, who never had the value or the career of Rashford. So; I understand the conditions of market but engine plays awfully unbalanced against the player. AI always spends ludicrous amount of money to players and and demand the same from the player but always rejects to pay event the market value of a star player. This needs to be corrected.

One other issue is the emotions of the players and the promises. I had a young player which I loaned for the season, in return I promised him I will upgrade this states from prospect to impact sub if he got this amount of goals or assists. He did well, ƒ± was happy, he was happy but it was the end season when he returned right. The bloody idiot started complaining for not been able to get matches during the off season. I tried all the options in conversation nothing worked. I had to sold him for almost nothing. Even board complained about the price. So, what went wrong? The game engine could not recognise that there is no game available at the moment and forced this crazy emotion aspect of the game until it become meaningless. This also needs to fixed. 

Final issue, the new additions to the game needs to be more clear how they work. 

Still I suggest this game a good improvement to the series.",1703140894,1703140894,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously,  this type of release should be celebrated,  there is a bunch of QoL improvements and the match day presentation is just so much better.  Players do not move like stick figures anymore,  there is so many small details that have been improved. 

I hope with further iterations they improve the squad dynamics options,  I would love to see SI leverage AI to make those ""press conferences"" or ""player interactions"" more meaningful.  They start to feel stale after a couple of seasons.

I think the in-match animation is the biggest difference from the previous FMs, it's so much better. You'll want to watch ""comprehensive highlights"" just to see the new animations.

DF's do seem to be more imtelligent about making transfer offer for players to cover positions your squad depth quite isn't there. Also the updated setpiece setup is so much more better than the previous versions.

One thing to note though, they haven't improved the DF's ability to sort out a loan for youngsters once you put them on the development list, and AI will frustrate you with transfer offers that are below the player's value.

After the patch came out you go into ""runs"" of form where u can go on a run easily of even 30+ games winning.
But as soon as you lose a couple of games all kinds of random scripts go into effect for instance opposition team manages to score from 0.4xg 2+ goals etc , you dont score from 3+xg even one goal etc..BTW I know even irl this happens somestimes but not on a *REGULAR* basis. Players cannot cohesively defend and world class centerbacks like Vitek (who would of been one of the best in the french league on another patch easily , probably at least 155+ ca already on my lyon save) got 6.7 average rating..Random nonsence starts to happen where all of a sudden on ANY tactic with almost any players (unless maybe you have a absolutely world class squad of every player on 170+ ca) start to play absolutely in cohesively for no reason at times. With the very same tactics (which still work good even on this patch btw if you are on a good run) I won triple for instance with fiorentina first season serie a+ copa italia+ conference league and i went on a 58 game win streak on my ajax save with these very tactics but on my lyon save all of a sudden after a couple of losses to psg team went on a scripted ""run"" where i conceded random crap from rubbish sides.

I still think Miles blatantly lied in his advertisements of the game and on twitter, but that is a character issue for him. The game was not refined, and still feels behind FM23.2 in some ways. I recommend the in game editor for some occasional bugs, or at least don't force disable it in your save.

Negatives:
- The AI still doesn't rotate well so you can run into very tired teams somewhat early in the season.
- They stated on the forums that some player development issues such as FB/WB crossing are engine issues that can not be fixed so long term saves are still...odd.
- Goal scoring is still a little higher than I would like to see, but its also up in real life so who knows. I just know parking the bus should not consistently result in 3-3 draws.
- Defends just don't do anything sometimes? Can't tell if its a match engine or display engine issue, but they will refuse to challenge an air ball giving attackers free headers.

Pros:
- Managers do sub somewhat intelligently. I had teams bring on defenders to hold a win, or forwards to chase a point. The subs are early enough to make a difference, with some coming as soon as half time.
- Beautiful match engine overall. Outside of the defender issue above, I love the bounces and player gestures. The deflections feel real, and it hurts to concede from them...but that is realistic.
- Injuries bring a challenge without feeling game breaking (lol at Tottenham IRL). Forces me to use players and formations I might otherwise not for a few games here and there.

Ridiculous own goals and mistakes from defense and GK
Attributes mean nothing in away games, your players play like sunday league in 8 away games out of  10
Opp GK regularly get 7+ rating against you for no reason, then returns to be subpar against other AI teams
ST roles are purely there for decoration. F9, TQ, AF, P, DLF, they all behave the same, they stay central, sit in the box, run in behind more or less depending on the duty, and they don't roam no matter which instruction/PPM you give them
Winger roles are designed to make you lose the ball, they get pressed down too easily and forget how to dribble or pass 8 times out of 10
This game should be renamed table foosball manager, the whole AM strata behave like they're linked by a metal bar and they all move and attack at the same time, same for the ST roles
The through balls in this edition are so badly executed it hurts
The average decisions, even with high attribute, specially in away games, are mostly rubbish
The instructions ""roam from position"" and ""move into channels"" do not work
The players stay static in their zones and make this edition boring to watch
Most AI manager play with either IWB/IFB or both even when they don't have the staff for
The final third imposes a hidden timer on your players (based on tempo), once the timer is over the player with the ball shoots no matter what (again rubbish decisions).
Once you get to the final third, there is no role in the AM and ST strata that is intelligent enough to pull back or wide from the box to recycle possession or draw defenders. They all behave like bulls and sit in the box.",1701811505,1701811505,False,25,12,0.627316296100616455,2,True,False,False

This game is incredible as it has been for awhile now, I absolute love the data base and realism of players and their attributes. Only issue this year would be feels abit to simular with the same questions asked from the media and players asked ever time. It would be nice to have some real life scenarios thrown in (eg - player caught out all night partying and how we deal with that). 

So my opinion, Its still a great game but could be better.and feels very similar to last couple years.

A patch was released that addressed about half of the bugs, while introducing a few new ones. This remains a title not in a fit state for release.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ The match engine looks and arguably plays better than previous versions.
+ Runs a little faster than previous versions.
+ The ability to import a savegame from FM2023 is very welcome.

+/- The player interactions are absurdly unpredictable to a comical degree. Players behave like self-sabotaging morons much of the time, and while that is hilarious, the spread of low morale through the squad from such an interaction can be a game-killer.

- Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. Everywhere. Why wasn't this title properly tested and fixed before release?
- The inclusion of fully-licensed Japanese Leagues was a heavily advertised selling point. The leagues are present in game, but many players, badges, etc., are missing because the licensing wasn't comprehensive. Shame on you SI for false advertising.
- Denuvo DRM. Thanks for incorporating such an unnecessary form of anti-consumer cancer SEGA.

Verdict: Not worth it in its current (Nov 2023) state. Wait for fixes, and comprehensive feature completion before buying. And perhaps even then, wait for a sale, because ... let's face it, do these clowns deserve all your money for a botched product?",1699429561,1701428312,False,44,1,0.681676089763641357,0,True,False,False

On my save with Tottenham Hotspur, my signed goalkeeper (Emiliano Martinez) has made so many unbelievely shocking errors leading for me to be out of the FA Cup and the Carabao cup in the 2nd and 3rd rounds. As well as that, my corner tactics aren't working. Although, I wanted balls to be hit to the back post, all of my corners head straight to the keeper at the near post. My last problem, is that the price of the in-game editor is getting more expensive, hence why I won't buy it this year. Overall, I could change opinions on this, it could probably be better than last year but unfortunately I would not reccommend this for the price of ¬£44.99. I hope some of these problems can be easily solved. However, the game is so addictive and I will still play it.

-improved AI squad managements/transfers = no substitutes, wonderkids rotting in reserves at 24 years old, buying players for 50+ mil to play 2 games in a year
-J league kits/players not complete at release and even still isn't (zero communication external, internal cheeky adjusted the text of j leaugue from the website)
-most attributes dont matter, speed and physical all the way ,every, year.
-ME is improved a bit, lets wait till they fuck it up again in the next patch
-ONLY gegenpress(see fm arena) is overpowered AGAIN
-tactics creator is just outdated and just flat out bad, user has no control or little, feels scripted (due to attributes hardly matter) and the instructions are so rigid, feels old, inflexible. adding new roles like ifb and changing HB, FB dont matter, they are all hard scripted roles, which means that you can put any player in the position and they play the same, if there attributes are not too far apart.
-Too many goals 2024 is hockey simulator
-bugs like set piece coach wage cant be raised, not able to hire a set piece coach for the reserve and youth team (but you can train it with normal coaches?)
- great improvement of player interactions and media handling, so much fun!!!! /s
-goalkeepers hands that break from touching the ball
- and other countless bugs(from previous editions) im tired to mention (see fm community forum)

but no this is the most polished version ever, maybe in recent years it is the best, but it worries me that they market this as the best, when released in this state. worries me for future games of SI, jk you lost me this year as a customer

Also, one of the most bizzare things happened here, 2-3 down, min 93', corner, the keeper comes up too, cross in, headed away, then my keeper gets the ball, shots for the edge of the box and scores a magificent goal, I am also surprised, only for a few seconds when he gets sent off directly with a red card for apparently handball, wtf!?!? And this happend to me twice already, I find it weird
   Now on a more serious note, from all the titles I have played (ever since 2007), this one seems to be the one with the least new features added, I see some new players reactions tho which are kinda funny and I love the new intermediate that helps me sell the players, but  I hate that players are such crybabies now, after every teamtalk where they were absolutely trash and played nothing, losing badly, if I go and criticise them, there are always a few getting offended and become unsettled. They usually get over it in a few, many months, but what if its one of the nest players in the team in the last year of contract that you haven't renewed yet and cannot afford and want to lose?

Player interactions are an utter mess, players are throwing a hissy fit at smallest things. Wage demands of players & agents are also completely broken and unrealistic because they are just based on the reputation of your club & league, which makes the game infuriating to play. 

For example, after managing Benfica for 5 months Joao Mario feels like he deserves a new contract to reflect his ability as a player, despite him having 2.5 years left on his current contract. I save scum to try every single option to persuade him to change his mind and none of them work. Then I tried to negotiate a new contract, which I can't because of completely unrealistic wage demands that are far above of what I can offer. Now majority of my players are upset because I didn't give him a new contract that he 'deserves'.

There are some new features, but what I like the most is on how they change color scheme/style when playin on 3D mode. Its refreshing and for me the match engine like how players moves are more fluid and natural.

You can save money for FM25 next year that SI said will have new engine and much more new features, for this year you can get custom database from many FM site like fmscout so you can still play FM23 but with new market transfer for 23/24 season.

Set piece specialist is a good idea. However it has been implemented as well as it should. More or less par on the course. No ood and aah. But nothing that makes the game less enjoyable, either. A seed for future development, I guess.

The most satisfying new feature for me is the ability to play FM23 saves. With all the tactical innovations that pour out in the real world each year, FM inevitably is always one year behind.

Sure it works and is fun to play, but I'm starting to see a trend, the same trend FIFA started showing all those years ago.

For example; The Squadplanner is completely useless and they show no effort to even fix it.
""But I can use it? I haven't noticed any issues with it?""

If you haven't noticed issues with it, it is because you are not rigorously using shortlists.
Whenever you have really huge shortlists the performance of the Squadplanner gets ruined for whatever reason. When you open the Squadplanner, the game slows down to a crawl and in worst case scenarios, the game can even crash if the shortlists are big enough; I've witnessed it myself.

This is a bug that has been present since FM23 Beta. Worst part? It was reported on their bug forum way back then and I did my own post in FM24 Beta. But it hasn't been fixed, it's still in the game.

Even though they say on the forum that they will look into it, they don't. Hence, the same bad feeling that FIFA started to give me years ago, where it is all about fixing superficial issues, issues that the broadest range of players will encounter.

It's the equivalent of a car, they fix the frame so it looks all nice and neat but under the hood there are glaring issues in the engine department that they don't seem to care about fixing, because most players might not even open the hood. Which is why you see constant fixes to the match engine, because all players are exposed to it.

I don't know, I think it's a really bad path to be on for this franchise.
Despite how many bug reports we do, it doesn't seem to matter unless it is a widely experienced issue or superficial at first glance.

There are other issues with the Squadplanner as well, such as that it auto populates, absolutely ruining any usage it might have, since it is used to create plans, but if those plans are constantly altered, then what is the point?

They also pushed into it some really important stuff such as the Comparison screen that is important as well as Assistant Reports etc. But forget about using these if you prefer to use shortlists for scouting purposes and to target players for your club. The bigger your shortlists, the less performance all these things get, since they're all under the Squadplanner main category.


The game is playable yes, but for how long? Some features aren't working and it looks grim in the future due to negligence. Squadplanner was one of the flagship features of FM23 and it hasn't been fixed since the FM23 Beta.

It smells a lot like FIFA and I don't like it.
They need to change course and start caring more about the quality of their product, not how many sales they'll get, otherwise history will repeat itself..",1699959107,1700258428,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but I was 3 months old at the time, not that old promise!!!!!!!! hahhahha give or take 30 years!

Dalgleish Management, think was first on ATARI, Sensible World Of Soccer, Amiga 500+, which became my world during these times, as you could build facilities,  expand stadiums, ticket prices from games to hotdog and burger prices, and so many more great stuff! 

Miguel Nadal, Del Piero, Totti, Torres, Messi, Inzaghi, Ballotelli, Cavenaghi, Tevez, Saviola annnnnnnnnddddd so so so many greats!
  Then the Champ Manager series start up, Which became the foundations for the GREATEST game in the gaming world!
Certain instalments have been major improvements, 2009, 2012, 2014 and now i must admit this is the 
                                         'BEST FOOTBALL GAME IN THE WORLD CURRENTLY' 



With all the negative reviews amongst the good, ill admit, 50-50, about the new FIFA and PES being just DLC'S From last few years, plus the management styles have dropped massively since the start of Fifa management programme! Plus within one week, the player costs had risen by 25,000 FUT points. With one X user ""SAYING THIS COULD BE THE FIRST YEAR SOMEONE PAYS OVER A Million for a player?????"" Showing money still is the main theory being these games, that cost money to improve, yet, you need to spend loads to just get into the Youtubers, Twitch and other socials level!

                                                                       SO  NOW
FM24 became the game no one, ever thought would be as good as it actually is, ME, player roles, player movements, the intertwining of roles interacting, with others. One thing is ive not been 100% is the long range shots or back passes that seem between the 18 yard box and halfway line always go in, the keeper will stand and watch or chase it in. Second set pieces is great but feel less control over everything. Thirdly, any time the balls played behind the defence, they cant get back or even if goal side, do nothing! Seems a gkitch!

Apart from that its a respectful 99.9% from me, and would highly recommend this game to any sports fans, or strategy fans, it can tke days, weeks, months away, and if your not too well, like myself, its the NHS, SPIRE, BUPA ALLLLLLLLLLL IN ONE!

This year, Sports Interactive has focused on making the game more accessible to new players, while also adding in a number of new features and improvements for experienced players. 

One of the biggest changes in this years iteration is the new transfer system. It's now much easier to find and sign players, and you have more control over the negotiations. You can also now set specific targets for your scouts, which will help them find players who fit your style of play.

Another new addition is the ability to create your own set pieces. You can now design your own corner kicks, free kicks, and throw-ins, which you can then save and share with other players.


Overall, FM24 is a game that will appeal to both new and experienced players. It's packed with new features and improvements, and it's one of the most addictive and engrossing management sims ever made.

Here are some of the pros and cons of Football Manager 2024:

Pros:

More accessible to new players
New transfer system
Ability to create your own set pieces
Improved match engine
More exciting matches
Cons:

Can be overwhelming for new players
Some of the new features are a bit buggy

love that the game has still stuck to it game play its had for many years. Gets you involved in nearly everything of the running of day to day football club. tactics are a huge change but a good one, a lot more involved and lot more options. 

I have played this game for years and highly recommend it, especially if you love football and like a challenge.

anyway have to give this a negative because of the insane morale bugs that are present in this game, and yeah hopefully they fix them soon, but it blows my mind that nobody from SI noticed these bugs were in the game.  i found them after 5 hours of playing in the early access

players go apeshit over the most random things and you cannot fix their morale no matter what you do, you can make promises to players and fulfill them but it will still count as failed and the player will hate you (has happened to me at least 3 times, i learned the valuable lesson of make 0 promises EVER)
what else, oh i gave a harsh team talk after a bad loss once and i had a player make me promise to improve my team talks, ok whatever i will.  months go by he's happy with my new team talks then for no reason decides i failed on my promise and starts complaining to his teammates about me.  months after the team talk.  
captains demanding i sign more depth with 5 games left in the season despite not needing more depth (oh and by the way, i tried signing more depth to get him off my back and i failed my promise of signing depth and i had to get rid of that player)

theres a lot of really bizarre interactions like this in the game that drive me crazy, i can't recommend this game until they fix these and even then i'll still be upset they released the game and expected us to beta test the game for them

(besides the morale issues the game is fine, i like some of the new changes they added from 23.  theres a few weird match engine things that i wont get in to but nothing so big that it ruins the game experience)",1699405933,1699741852,False,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Only problem is opponent manager's AI is still too powerful, they usually make an adjustment after half time or after conceding too many goals, after that adjustment suddenly their team will score, sure this is a good feature but a little bit sense of randomness where the adjustment fail is needed.

if you haven't played before than this is THE BEST Time to try it.
I have been more than ecstatic with what i experienced and without a shred of doubt i will recommend it every day...


Well gather along gentlemen as it's that time of the year again. ""Football Manager 24"", Well The Arabs are here and they mean Business.
Starting off i'd like to just outright put it out there that FM24 is Actually by-far the most complete and if i may the ""Definitive Edition"" of FM. There are a lot of features in this title update and this has been so far my smoothest experience for FM till date. SI has huge plans for FM25 and i have never been less hyped for it than now after playing a good chunk of FM24.
FM 23 was an actual turd when it came to what new features it brought to the newer title but this year FM is as feature packed as it has ever been. There is everything that you need and plus there's even more that you might've never thought you needed but it's still here.
Starting off with the actual gameplay, IT'S SO FUCKING SMOOTH, i have been just watching the football roll left and right and bounce everywhere and god am i edged already. It is an orgasm to our eyes how well the player motion and football motion is this year.
The lighting is brilliant as well and some of those evening matches look as good as they'll ever look.
Hiring intermediaries is one of the most needed features as well especially when you need to get rid of sergio roberto like deadwood with ceiling high wages.
The overhaul for set-piece training is also a very good touch, i haven't totally indulged into that but great to know it's there when i need to.
Setting Targets, guys hear me out. Please set targets!! i can't explain the feeling when a player asks for unjustly high playing time and then i set a target for him to complete if completed he gets the play time, if they actually play like that then looks like they actually deserve it and mostly when they don't neither do i have to promote them and nor do they reject the contract and shake the team dynamics.
The Real World career mirrors the first season transfers and limits the transfers for the rest of the window and it is such an amazing and true to life way to play and goes miles towards actually feeling like a real life manager of your favourite team!",1699379484,1699379484,True,12,4,0.580111563205718994,0,True,False,False

The Changes:
1. Tangible changes to set piece system and addition of set piece coaches. Set pieces have always been important in FM and this year the updates to the system help me feel as if its not a liability if I'm not changing them with every sub in match.

2. The in match graphical changes are nice but not hugely noticeable. 

3. Changes to the transfer policies help to move players move on even if at a cut price. I still have some issue moving players on which can be frustrating but is realistic and should remain in the game. Interestingly it also appears that players with transfer arranged seem to dip substantially in training rating and form. 

4. Changes with press conferences, team talks and player reactions. These are nice but sometimes these features can feel a little tedious after 50+ matches. Some of the changes are realistic but more annoying than engaging. With players arguing that conferences are getting stale, or forcing moves because they didn't like what you said one time. 

5. At the time of writing I have not loaded a 23 save game but am excited to do so when I decide my main 24 save. And hope to meet my old club at the precipice of European football.

THE TLDR: FM24 is a ton of fun and when I got access to the release and beta I was sucked in for entire week and 100 hrs of playtime. This years changes are more substantial than last year, but its still up to the player to find new a unique ways to challenge themselves as a manager.

Sadly, just like last year, Sports Interactive marketed well only to under deliver on their much promised 'most polished version ever'. Currently the game is a mess. AI squad building (key feature this year) is terrible; players are still being bought and not played, youth teams become empty, squad rotation doesn't happen. 

Player Interactions (another key feature) are just as wild. 

Match Engine (another key feature) is wonderful in attack, yet defensively is a nightmare. 

And the Japanese A-League (super feature) license is... half-baked. 

Sadly, Sports Interactive and SEGA are the defacto football manager game at the moment, so they can get away with these terrible releases. Its a shame really, as the ME (defending aside) looks great this year and the processing speed is lightning fast, even with a huge database. 

I just wish someone would muzzle and reign in Miles Jacobson from over promising every damn year, and let the team fix legacy bugs before adding new half-finished/forgotten features that cause new issues.

Licensing issues. A mess. The much hyped Japanese ""fully licensed"" leagues are - guess what? Not fully licensed and so players who want to experience them are out of luck until SI gets its act together.

AI squad building. A mess. AI still signs multi-million pound players for obscene fees and with no logic whatsoever to the deals ... and then doesn't play them.

MOST TEAMS DO NOT MAKE SUBSTITUTIONS ... yes, you've read that correctly. Almost all substitutions in the game come as a result of injuries or fatigue and happen from 85 minutes onward. Spot the tactical substitution and win a star prize. And this is WORSE in the academy section of the game where entire weeks go by without the AI subbing ANY players at all which destroys the late game.

The Champions League new format, which worked fine in 2023 version, draws clubs from the same countries against each other ... what a joke. No-one in-house at SI spotted that before release? 

I could go on and on. The game has been out for a fortnight in Early Access. You HOPE that some of these issues will be resolved on Day One ... instead, nothing. And some vague promises about a patch somewhere along the line, which probably means weeks. 

There is NO WAY I can justify recommending this title. And I have often added a caveat to that sort of statement ""at the moment."" But this is a joke. So I'm not changing this review later on. The release version is unacceptable. It's dire. And a lot of people feel conned by the Japanese licensing thing. 

No company except for Creative Assembly is in more dire need of a rival to snap them out of their complacency and arrogance.

That feature is the ability to import your save(s) from the previous version; that feature alone makes this version worth buying for anyone with significant hours invested in a save from FM23.

Getting a new database update each version/year is fine, until you've played a few seasons in your save, as it will have diverged so far from reality that it doesn't matter whether you started with 'real' players or a completely random database of players. Ten seasons in, and most clubs are unrecognisable from the ones that started the game. The enjoyment for most long term players is taking a small team/club and transforming them over a number of seasons, often twenty or more, and watching the rise and fall of players you've brought in and nurtured into superstars. You can now carry on that save from year to year without having to start from scratch each time.

The rest of the game is basically the same old story. Tiny improvements, some screens moved around, a couple of changes to the UI here and there, and an up to date database of players and staff. The match engine has got a bigger facelift than normal, and is a lot more fluid and 'feels' realistic for once, however, it still looks like it was made in 2002 using assets from Kevin Thom's Football Manager on the spectrum - but I suppose small steps and all that.

Price-wise, again, it's at least twice as expensive as it should be for what you are getting in terms of upgrades. Owners of previous versions should be getting a hefty discount of around 50% for this as it simply isn't worth the money over previous versions. If you do not own any other versions then ¬£40 is reasonable, although ¬£30 would be fair.

As I said in last years review, we have zero choice, the game has no realistic competition so if you want to play football manager then you get this whether you like it or not.

And the in-game editor is now ¬£6.99, for something which should be included for free. You can buy fan made editors for less than that with more features, although slightly less convenient.

With Unity coming to FM next year I originally was going to wait, but maybe the PR or whatever the case was made me so excited for this years edition. So here are some points: 

 SET PIECE COACH AND SET PIECES- WHAT a massive improvement!!!! Like game changing and for real the best change I have ever seen!

Match Engine- Oh my the match engine, from movements of players to great looking shots to the whole 9 this has been a massive immersive change and a well needed one. Fantastic change that really makes me love watching the games and when Unity gets implemented I'm excited to see what it does.

Speed- So much more optimized then previous FMs its crazy. I mean its quicker then its ever been and it still runs great on both my laptop and my PC

Final Verdict: This will easily have the most hours I have ever had on FM by the time FM25 comes. A welcome change and I can go on and on but I need to go back to my J1 team I brought from J3. Go Fukushima!!! Get it, its worth it this year.",1699330616,1699330616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the frustrating parts for me are the obvious lack of intelligence when playing the computer

1. Transfer deals are insanely favourable of the computer clubs, if you try and sell a player at their value, 96% of the the time, you lose. It doesnt really understand form/morale/consistency/loyalty
2. The amount of dumb involved if you play in lower leagues is STILL total shit, for example, a club promoted to the premier  league CANNOT attract better players even if they are promoted with lots of time left in the season, you have to wait until the new season actually begins and your clubs rep is increased. This completely hinders squad building, is completely unrealistic, and changes the game massively.
3. Squad dynamics is hosed, normal people do not, just lose their shit from being removed as vice captain, or not instantly getting a new contract, or not playing for a couple of months at aged 17 because you signed them from some brazilian team for 250k, or because you told them all they played like a bunch of 10 year olds in the sunday blind league and lost 7-0 to barnsley at home, and then the result is half your squad descending into complete depression and hatred for your management style despite you being 3rd in the league and clearly in contention for the title.
4.What the hell is the point of repeated, duplicated questions in press conferences which are CLEARLY designed to influence morale and in terms performance, there is such massively OBVIOUS weighting in your responses to these its painfully, boring af and makes me want to scratch my eyes out with a rusty spork. SORT IT OUT SI. The press dont repeat the same nonsense in real life and the answers are far too limited, theres a complete lack of AI and general intelligence here, it WAS cool for a few years, but ive been answering the same question and ""smiling warmly"" for far far too fucking long just to maintain my squads unbeaten 7 game run.
5. Coaching ""your players are unhappy with training"" - except, it doesnt actually matter wtf you actually do here, they are always unhappy, regardless of how well your team has done being promoted 3 times on the bounce and establishing yourself in the premier league within 5 seasons.
6. How have you STILL not developed a tactical editor which lets you MANUALLY position your players with complete freedom! Have you ever actually tried to position 3 centre back together in a 352 manually during a game !?!?!?!?! lmao
7. Chairman/board negotiations are STILL DUMB!!!! oh you have 13 coaches and have won the league and the champions league 6 times in a row, have built up 500 mill in the bank, sry m8, nah you cant have another coach on 4.5k a week , gonna ruin us.
8. Mangers need more control!!!!!! real managers, manage football clubs from top to bottom, if i want to sack margie the tea lady and old bill the 1 legged kit man so i can free up 500¬£ a week to give my star striker in the caravan south east div reserves then I SHOULD BE ABLE TO!!!!! thats some basic ""heres a slider, redistribute the wealth as you see fit"" functionality.
9. MORE THINGS IVE FORGOTTEN
10. I will continue to play, i love it, but where are these basic things, more camera angles, chairman and owner mode,more customising, youve got ALL the footballer details spot on but its like playing the same game over and over every year without updating the tiny realistic business details

New feather of the transfer market makes the game even more realistic, it's good.

I propose SI in the future update the game not each year, but twice or third year once, and instead sell for new season just a DLC, it is better.

Now, you don't need to manage set pieces before every match and with every substitute (or leave them as is with a loss of efficiency). Still, it's disappointing that the limit is only three routines per type; that number is clearly not enough for corners.
Woodwork is (partially) fixed, yay! Now you can score (a lot) of goals off the frame. Better than nothing. Too bad it took almost 20 years to do that.
Also, SI gets bonus points for licensing J-League and the possibility to import saves from FM23.
There are some quirks with the match engine, for example, too many critical errors by goalkeepers, but it's nothing unusual for an early release. Everything should be stable around 24.3 or 24.4.
So, to summarize. Don't miss the last classic (non-Unity) FM. Honestly, I planned to skip FM24, but set pieces, J-League, and support for old saves convinced me otherwise.",1699286415,1699286415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
