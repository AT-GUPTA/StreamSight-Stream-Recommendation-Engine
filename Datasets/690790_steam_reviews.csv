Note: I played DiRT Rally 2.0 with my wheel, the G923. I don't have experience of playing this game with a controller. 

[h2] Career [/h2]
The career mode in DiRT Rally 2.0 is kind of basic in my opinion. You do rally, you do another rally, you do more rally. The only big difference between the career and  custom events are the thing that the career gives you money. I played the career, but I doubt I'll play it ever again. Daily events are just more fun for me. 

[h2] Daily/Weekly/Monthly events [/h2]
These events are fun. Especially the daily events. These events are a stage/rally/multiple rallies with a specific car class/car.
The best thing about this is that it makes you try different cars you might not have tried, if this wouldn't exist. And also, these events give you money. Daily event rewards are okay, but when I completed a monthly event (which was about 3 hours long) I got about 300 000 credits. And my position on the leaderboards wasn't even that good. Now, lenght. Daily events are often 1 stage, weekly events are multiple stages or 1 rally, and monthly events are very big, maybe even having more than 6 rallies. 

[h2] Historic [/h2]
Historic is another career-like thing, but this time, it's from cars from the beginning of rally all the way to today.
It's a pretty nice mode, especially since the older cars are often slower, and the newer cars are faster, so I found it helpful with me learning to control the faster cars. One sad thing though is that it doesn't give you a lot of rewards. 

[h2] Stages and Cars [/h2]
The stages in DiRT Rally 2.0 are good. They don't feel empty, and they look good. The game of course has DLC to get more locations, the ones I like are Sweden and Finland (Since I live in Finland).
The cars look good too, I like the interior view. 
If you are going to buy this game, I recommend you to get the Game Of the Year Edition, and on sale. I got it for about 10 euros I think. 

[h2] Handling [/h2]
DiRT Rally 2.0's handling is what I would expect. It feels good to drive, isn't extremely hard to control and gives a good experience. Some say that the tarmac handling isn't good, but I don't see anything wrong with it.
Force feedback is nice, it's good and feels connected to the game. 

[h2] Sound [/h2]
The sounds in DiRT Rally 2.0 are very good. When in interior view, it actually sounds like you are inside the car. There isn't soundtrack when you are driving, but the menu music is good (in my opinion). 

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]
DiRT Rally 2.0 is great to look at, feels good to drive and sound good. The only problem is that there isn't enough things to do other than do rallies. I like the daily events, but for now, I will give DiRT Rally 2.0 a [b]9/10[/b]. Now that you hsve read this review, I recommend you to check out other reviews.

Both [i]WRC Generations[/i] and [i]WRC 2023[/i] are mediocre compared this one. And you can get the GOTY edition regularly for 10 €, so it is also a lot cheaper than the WRC games. You cannot imagine what people in the community would pay for a DLC for this game with 5 new rally locations.

Pros:
* Excellent physics.
* Great selection of tracks and cars.
* Nice car tuning options.
* Great graphics, the tracks look stunning in some of the weather conditions.
* Well optimized, runs fine on older hardware.
* Lot's of dirt and gravel tracks, which I love. There's also tarmac of course.
* Career mode, custom championships, free roam, and everything else you would expect. I like time trial.
* Still active servers and new daily, weekly, monthly online events.
* Support for VR.
* Good support for steering wheels and pedals. One should keep in mind though that you will not be able to hit buttons for handbrake and shifting up/down on the wheel, as you will be turning it back and forth at very high speeds all the time in rally racing, so a separate shifter [i]and[/i] handbrake is almost required. I have both.
* Also plays very well with a controller. I played with XBox controller a lot before I got my wheel. I would strongly suggest not to play such a game with a keyboard though.
* Cheap: often available for 10 € during sales/in other shops, including everything (GOTY edition).

Neutral:
* includes RallyCross events. It's well made, and if you are into it, you will like it. I'm not particularly interested, I prefer pure Rally. Therefore I think it's great that they put it into a separate Rally Cross career, so I do not have to do it if I don't want it.
* The career mode is okay, but nothing special. It's all about driving, no story or management stuff. I actually prefer it this way. I don't want to manage mechanics, I want to drive rally.
* I would prefer less cars and more rally locations instead.

Cons:
* No difficulty settings in main campaign (only assist on/off, but nothing affecting AI difficulty), and some pretty harsh difficulty spikes. This is really minor though, since you can create custom championships in which you can configure the AI difficulty from 1 to 100.
* UI could be improved. In general too few explanations and too little documentation, starting at the game settings, over missing information on the weather conditions and length of a daily event you are about to accept, and ending at missing explanations for the car tuning options. Makes it even tougher for beginners. Watch youtube videos on D2R car tuning if you struggle with the RWD cars (which you will).
* Too much RX (rally cross).
* Team upgrades are too expensive, it takes ages to get them all. An option to decrease repair costs would also be nice, as career mode exposes you to quite expensive and very dangerous cars (Group B) very early. In general I would not start the career mode until you have at least 30 hours in the game.

This is the gold standard for rally games, no doubt about it. If you are only slightly interested in Rally and do not own it, get it. [h2]9.5/10[/h2] in total for me. Keep in mind though that this is [b]not[/b] an arcade racing game: you [b]will[/b] have to invest some time to master it. I now have 80 hours in and I know most of the tracks and can drive them more or less consistently in okay times without major crashes in most conditions with no assists using the lower to mid tier cars. I still have some way to go to be able to handle the power of the latest cars though. I can say the game gets better and better the more you play it, it's amazing.",1701536694,1708937353,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In 2009, after finding himself without a co-driver for the Jyvaskyla Rally in Finland, he kidnapped a homeless man and forcibly strapped him into the passenger seat to ensure that the two-people-in-each-car rule was complied with. The stunt only came to light when onboard footage taken during the race revealed that rather than reading the ‘pace notes’, the Finnish co-driver was in fact screaming the words ‘Oh shit!’ over and over again, occasionally interspersed with other phrases including, ‘Watch out for that house’ and ‘Slow down, you mad bastard’.",1708505362,1708505362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dirt 2.0 also in some regards is graphically superior to the latest release and is better optimised (though still far from were it should be, still miles above most AAA these days, as the new EA WRC 23 proves once again), so Dirt 2.0 you can crank those settings up much more reliably then the new release were even though for the dated graphics it should run butter smooth with max settings on older harder = it obviously doesnt and dirt 2.0 easily wins in that comparison.

Dirt 2.0 is more likely to be compatible with your sim devices out the box, unlike the new EA WRC 23.

Dirt 2.0 also has VR, which if you have VR you wont want to ever go back to non-VR once you try it, it makes the whole multi display setups redundant for the full sim experience. Meanwhile the new EA WRC 23 has no VR... not surprising when it doesn't run as good as dirt 2.0 and doesnt really look better then Dirt 2.0, so obviously some serious issues under the hood = yea thats not a good combo for VR, so if you want VR and the best sim experience best bet is Dirt 2.0 by a large margin.

Dirt 2.0 is still missing some features other games have that would certainly take it up a grade, but with EA in charge = never happening, its now a console game franchise, so sim gamers and PC users are just an afterthought, so the current top sim games for rally hasnt changed, anyone who says otherwise is obviously just wanting a more easy casual experience, its as simple that. virtually every youtube positive review which says its got better physics etc etc, repeats the same tag line and never goes into the details, never focus on this and shows proper examples, why? its just what they want to believe or what they have been paid and promoted to say...  often the latter, hence the copy/past review dialogue, because they are told to say it and like wise... not say or do other things part of the review which would obviously show they are in denial or just shilling for publisher perks, as after all early access to games for review and preview = $$$.

still worth pointing out though dirt 2.0 physics aint perfect either, its not a perfect game, but its decent and compared to other games certainly in the top 3, something which already suggested EA didnt change with its 23 release, but also EA WRC 23 aint the worst either, but Dirt 2.0 is definitely better for sim and best with a wheel indicating its sim focus, were EA WRC 23 is fine with a controller for obvious reasons, indicating compromises were made in simulation, track/vehicle physics so console players would not rage quit, so its not that hard to choose which game is right for you depending on your play style and setup.",1708390735,1708390735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game's actually pretty awesome. I have a new PC now with faster hard drives and ram speed and I don't have any stutters at all. 
This game's is pretty/
The cars drive really well with a controller and you have plenty or every custom setting you would want. So far I've won around 5 or more races in a row so I think it might be easier than Dirt Rally which is fine because sometimes that game seems unfair
From what I've played, I beat the first round and have done 2 races in the second and this game's excellent.
Seriously, I should have bought this game a long time ago, lol.
I bought it on my other account, 'BillDrat' but I thought I should change my review because my mind has changed with what I think of this game.
My new PC is quite a bit more powerful than my old one so it may be due to that that the game runs so well or perhaps due to updates or maybe both.
GG- get it, probably worth full price but I've just started so its too early to say but its worth the sale price right now for sure. 

I went from a gtx 1070 to a 6750xt
an 1800x to a 3800xt
I think maybe I had it on a mechanical drive and now its on a fast ssd, mx500.
My ram speed is also much faster, I don't remember what it was but now its fast ram. 


This game stutters every around 5 or less seconds like it has a virus. On my system which has a vega 64 saphire nitro- with 3 fans that doesn't get above 50 degrees oced, and a 1800x with 32 gb of system ram all oc'd and holds the game barley working my computer at 85 fps and all I want to run is 60 fps, I get a stutter......and its like a virus or something. Like if you get a virus your computer acts up, and doesn't act normal, like that.

    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]I really enjoy the graphics in this game. Many locations are really well detailed and look really unique from each other. The skybox depending on the time of day and weather can look incredible. Also the vehicles models are well designed with a good damage model. The UI is clean and simple, and fits the game aesthetic perfectly. I have to say though that most rally stages are not demanding or technical. The only locations I had struggles on are Australia, and Argentina.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is actually really good. The overall driving is really challenging and fun, especially if you are a rally fan. There is no rewind in this game so if you crash, you can just go back to a certain part and redo your mistake. I like this because this promotes serious and focused driving that punishes mistakes. The older titles (besides DiRT Rally) had a rewind mechanic and it never really felt challenging in my opinion. You have a good list of vehicles to choose from and they all feel pretty unique from each other. You also have Rallycross which I enjoyed a ton especially with friends. Rallycross also has a good list of cars and a decent amount of tracks. The rally stages though are pretty disappointing (for the base game). The base game just lacks a good amount of replayability because the stages are not super long, and you don’t get many locations. I highly recommend getting the Game of the Year edition. I’ll even say that it’s essential to have! If you get the GOTY edition, then yes will you have double the amount of rally stages and even more Rallycross stages. You even get more rally and Rallycross vehicles to choose from. The overall physics is pretty well done. The gravel is really well done and feels slippery, especially on wet stages (which are the best for gravel). Speaking of wet, the tarmac stages in the wet are horrible. I do not like the tarmac physics that much here. It feels floaty and just doesn’t feel natural. I'm also not a fan of the tire and damage mechanics. It all feels forgiving and at worse, and afterthought. For example the suspension never really gets worn out on long rallies. You still have to be somewhat cautious on damage, but it's not as brutal as some say it is. Also the AI can be really inconsistent. Like the AI feels the same in terms of speed even in different weather conditions. I feel like they should be a bit slow at night or in the wet. While you are struggling to see in the rain at night, the AI just rockets away! It’s freaking annoying and makes it feel unbalanced at times. I usually have to play on a lower difficulty just to somewhat balance them. It could be a skill issue, but I see many people complain about it so it may just be a design flaw.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The campaign mode is pointless. I don’t really see a reason to play it. It’s linier, boring, and doesn’t really offer anything fun. You can’t even make your own team car livery. It feels like an afterthought. Also you don’t really get any unlockable to use. The progression is also non-existent. At least allow me to truly make my own team, and not just hire mechanics. You do have daily and weekly challenges which can be fun, but why is this tied to the campaign? Like I have to buy certain cars from the campaign just to use in the challenges against other players. Why not just make it its own game mode separate from the campaign. It doesn’t really make much sense.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The playtime is pretty solid here. You can add a good amount of time if you enjoy a good challenging rally game or if you are a fan of rallycross. You have a decent amount of stages (even a good majority don’t feel long). It can get kinda repetitive since the campaign mode doesn’t really add anything of value.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is so incredible! Every car feels impactful and truly immersive. The loud pops and bangs and hitting the rev limiter sound awesome! The voice notes sound really good so I have no problems with that. The overall sound in this game is a banger and definitely one of the best sounding racing games out there.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven't really encountered any bugs. The game felt pretty well polished. I’m sure the game had issues early on, but now it feels really good.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]I had a pretty good performance. I tweaked some graphics settings so I am playing on mostly high settings and now getting a solid 60 fps. Also I get no stutters or crashes so that’s a big plus![/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]DiRT Rally 2.0 is a fantastic rally game for the most part. Yes, it has some serious problems like the lack of a good campaign mode, and the AI being OP in certain situations. Besides its flaws, the game plays really well with controller, you have a good list of stages and vehicles, and provides an immersive rally experience. Pick this game up if you want to dive into the Rally world and explore what makes rallying so awesome and terrifying. If you are a Rally fan than definitely grab this title as well![/td]

The game is also unplayable in VR unlike advertised, even on a 2023 high-end build - between the constant unexplained framerate dips which cause reprojection issues and stuttering on every model of headset, ruining all but the most casual of runs. These issues will never be fixed because Codemasters/EA never cared, and none of the community's attempts to fix these issues really work (custom dlls, shaders, placebo cfgs, gpu driver settings and more). The physics are also a simplified, unnatural mess.

Edit: After some more rallying I found the pacenotes quality and consistency to be lacking which means you can't trust the pacenotes and push, sort of defeating the purpose of having pacenotes. Look into 'Dirty Pacenotes' plugin where you can use custom pacenotes. I even wrote a little python pacenote editor app seach for 'pacenote map video editor' although the time required to update all pacenotes turned me off. For what is meant to be a focussed rallying game there really needs to be some control over pacenotes: Min & Max call time/distance configuration, max stackup, detail level etc.",1661091308,1706483943,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- realistic driving physics and car dynamics (one of the best games for this)
- an immersive rally experience
- be your biggest enemy
- become a better driver irl (my own experience)

The one more or less big downside is:

- the lack of diversity -> more locations and cars would have been strongly appreciated.

The 1 ABSOLUTELY annoying thing:

- Dirt Rally's registering of gear shifting. You have to shift like in super slow motion. Otherwise the game won't register it and you land in neutral. So you basically have to shift twice into the very gear to get one gear up or down. And that happens to many times to count... So beware of that.

Solution: That problem can be corrected by editing the deadzone of the clutch in the settings.

Anyway, I can recommend the game to everyone who is curious to try it.",1683748884,1706483438,True,37,2,0.801687121391296387,0,True,False,False

First up, i'll state the good things [b]I like[/b] about DiRT Rally 2.0:
It feels very satisfying to play, and a lot of times, having those close-calls during flat-out moment is thrilling, intense and dangerous, just like any rally person would tell you including Colin Mcrae himself. And surprisingly, it runs 30 fps on my crappy 2013 laptop equipped with A10-5740M despite this game release in 2019 which is a plus in my book. And content wise, this game has plenty of them, and even more surprisingly is that all of the rally/rally-cross maps are [b]based on real-world location[/b], something even extremely rare for me to witness it from a rally game genre. (No, don't tell me other games can do that with ""mods"", cuz I'm talking about the base game content, not community creation content.) For car varieties, it is plenty enough to play in my opinion.

[b]Edit: After more playing and some research from other player feedbacks, yes, indeed I am aware that the game physics are not entirely simulated, the center of gravity/pivot point of vehicle is and always located at the center of the vehicle no matter how you drive. And secondly, about the FWD vs AWD vs RWD statement I've made, I accept that it maybe as close as it gets to ""real-life"" handling which I cannot judge since I only drove on asphalt roads irl in Perodua Axia 2014 and Toyota Vios 2013 E spec vehicles. Buuuut, I will keep my ONLY statement about tarmac, ESPECIALLY ON SPAIN rally tracks. Other than that, I believe it's mostly nearly feels like how rally/driving should be[/b]


And for the Rally-Cross, as any player who played any driving games back in 2000 era, you would know how horrible it will be in this game as well. Because, this game made them more idiotic, literally any AI driver that is one position in front of you will try to ""block"" you aggressively by pushing you towards walls when driving side by side, while any one position behind you will try to ""cut"" you off by pushing you off the road like no big deal. (which makes me mad and fu*king rammed that as*hole sideways off the road) Therefore in return only encourages reckless/aggressive driving to obtain a better position.

And last problem I had is the one and only, ""CONNECTING TO RACENET"". Like christ, I understand they don't want anyone to tempered the game files to accelerate or cheat the progression system, but at least make Quick Play, Free Play, Historic Championship, and Colin Mcrae career accessible in offline... (Unfortunately, that will not be the case, Greedy EA and lazy Codemaster got their a*s tied up by arbitrary corporate agreement conditions)

[i]Edit: The reason I put this game in a ""sim-cade"" category is how the game physics interacts with the in-game environment and player input doesn't translate ""realistic"". Any veteran or real drivers playing this game will point out how ""understeer"" is practically minimal to non-existential at all. The vehicle you're driving will turn no matter how aggressive you slam your wheel to full left/right, it will still turns fairly easily which defeats the purpose of consciously minding vehicle weight distribution at all.[/i]

The game continues to have a lot of immersion breaking visual and audio bugs since launch. Has gotten better over time, you can now actually see the track, but it's still jarring when navigators' voice changes between sections. I'll leave the rest as was 3 months since launch.
-----
Even after preordering, I think my patience with the game has reached the end. I so much wanted to give this game a positive review, but I just can't. We are now over 3 Months after launch, they have reluctantly patched the FFB after fan backlash, but most of the issues with the game from launch are still there. 

The main one from the start was, Racenet, no matter how you try to spin this, always online career makes this game abandonware wainting to happen. This wouldn't be such a problem if it wouldn't make the overall experience so laggy/slow. Instead of instant menu navigation quite often you get this wierd lag while racenet synchronizes.

Even 3 Month in, I still can't see where I'm supposed to drive on some track/conditions combinations. The lighting and reflections have been an issue since day 1, yet, other than very minor changes some tracks continue to be to dark or too bright. The developer that thought that dynamic brightness is a good idea needs to be fired. Also the guy who thought making grass reflective. On each track there is at least 1 situation where the track is pure white(flood lights in hairpins on wet track) and you can't tell where to drive. This used to be a big issue at launch where 80%+ of the tracks were either night or rain. Now it still is a lot but was dialed down after backlash.

3 Months in, Pace-notes continue to be inconsistent with different recorded sessions, pacing, and some calls are wrong. Even with pace notes pushed to as early as possible there still are some corners where you are in them when the pace note gets said.

THE killer features of the game, tire type and track degradation are a gimmick right now. Use soft tire everywhere! Having played this game for some time so far, I can't say I've ever had ""challenge"" from track degradation. So let's call these features what they are, gimmicks.

The challenge is also a joke. Once you upgrade your team, penalties and repair times are basically non-existent. I honestly wanted to restart my profile a couple of times and just not upgrade the team, it's that bad. Without the upgrades a penalty kills your championship, with them you go from minutes worth of penalties to mere seconds. Same goes for car repairs. Without updates you can't completely fix your car after an event, with, fixed car after each service session.

So overall, the game is very inconsistent, some issues are very jarring instantly pulling you out of immersion. 

On the plus side, Physics are a big improvement. Cars drive better, handling is better, but the overall presentation makes these good parts moot. The game overall is an improvement over Dirt Rally, but if just feels so unfinished, unpolished and inconsistent most of the times.",1559923903,1704983872,True,0,0,0.523327469825744629,3,True,False,False

In that sense it captures the thrill of rallying very well, and cutting corners while going as fast as you can is an awesome feeling.

The sense of speed is good, the car damage is pretty nice, nighttime looks decently dark.

It does fall short in a few places though.

The tracks can be a bit dull and especially samey within the same region, with not a ton of variety, and an almost randomly generated feeling at times.

The car liveries are quite meh too, with videogamey 'Dirt 2.0' logo's on your car, and the interface kinda sucks. There are way too many steps between finishing a custom event and selecting a new course and car and unless you set up a playlist in advance you will have to go to the main menu every single time to set up a new quick event.

And finally, I miss my Toyota's.

Still a decent game and there's absolutely fun to be had.

Right now I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.",1704522903,1704671883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And you might be saying 'boy, it sure looks like it has the word Rally in the title' and you'd be right. Problem is, the franchise name implies that there is at least some progression to run through, some sort of team managing, sponsors or even an arcade section to pit you against AI-based times and ultimately other players. And there really isn't much of that here. At all. You're pretty much given all the content at the start and are expected to run through it at whatever pace you like.

Of course, as a rookie, the difficulty is set to 1 (very easy) with all the assists on. The Argentina stages shocked me with narrow roads and lots of open and hairpin corners. I restarted numerous times because of punctured tire, falling off, steaming radiator. I managed to survive the first 2 stages and thought I'm getting the trick. Then the 3rd stage came, a pitch black night with heavy rain, and my screen turned black in less than 20 seconds after I hit the rocks of the 2nd corner due to slippery road. Yes, the headlights are gone. I drove carefully and slowly after being taught in a tough way in that stage. I learned making to the finish line in one piece is far more important than being recklessly fast, and you will be fast by driving smoothly.

With that out of the way I am going to give DR2 (with all DLCs included) a resounding thumbs up. The physics are good but not sadistically hard to get to grips with, even if using the keyboard as a controller. Having said that, some of the RWD cars in particular, do need some setup adjustments to make them less oversteery if not using a wheel and pedals.
The pace notes sound a lot more professional than those in DR1 to my ears, and the stages and rallycross all feel a bit more polished and realistic. Online daily/weekly/monthly challenges are all still very active with several hundred times being clocked in each event every day.

Even with only 32 hours of gameplay at the time of this post, i can confidently say that this is one of my favorite games to play when my friends aren't online. The only complaint that I have about this game is that you really need to invest in a bunch of the DLC's in order to make money. Without them it becomes a challenge, especially when first starting out. although, the DLC's go unlock some fun events and tracks, they take a while, but even if you play for an hour a day, you will be able to finish 2-3 monthly challenges if you have the tracks and vehicles purchased. The races can get a little long, for example, when you first start out, if you pick a 10 mile track, you may take upwards of 15 minutes to complete it. This is not the case most of the time however. You will usually get a track anywhere from 2-7 miles, with a 8,9, or 10 sprinkled in between every 1-2 events inside the monthly or weekly challenges. I can 100% recommend this game to a friend. The experience is so amazing with a racing wheel, and if you were to buy this game, I would recommend thinking about investing into one for this game. It doesn't have to be expensive though, and can be a very basic entry wheel. Some thing like the Thrustmaster T248, T300, or even the Logitech G920 or G923, which as of now, are all under $400.00. I would confidently say this product is worth the price, and even better than WRC 10.

Dirt Rally brings so much more.
A racing game with dirt and grit,
Where every turn demands your wit.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,
Drivers race, the stakes reach the sky.
The roar of engines, the screech of tires,
Ignites the passion, fuels desires.

Tracks unfurl with twists and bends,
A challenge where the bravest contends.
Gravel sprays, cars dance in flight,
Mastery here, an art takes flight.

Precision steering, throttle control,
The game demands your racing soul.
In mud-splattered glory, cars revved high,
Adrenaline rushes, painting the sky.

From vintage classics to modern speed,
Dirt Rally fulfills the need.
For rally fans and those who crave
The thrill of races, the roads they pave.

In this digital rally world, you'll find,
A visceral rush, leaving worries behind.

The graphics are fantastic, cars are plenty, and driving sensation both on a wheel and controller are immaculate. FFB is not as good as you'd expect, customization of those settings are minimal but enough to give a decent driving feel and experience. The stages are well crafted and fun to drive on, however aren't as diverse as the real life roster. The reuse of stages from the old Dirt Rally is also a bummer.

The only couple gripes is that the pace notes aren't always accurate and aren't as early as some might prefer to be, the earliest setting can still be late at times. and the DLC structure of the game is baffling.

I uninstalled this game a month ago because I felt that I was putting time into it that could have been better spent on my very extensive backlog of other games. With 240 hours played, I clearly like it! I wisely chose the GOTY edition at €10 on sale, which has enough variety of tracks and cars for 1000 hours. I would have ""upgraded"" to the new WRC game, which is essentially a sequel to DR2.0, but the Steam Deck is not powerful enough to reach the level of graphics that I would find adequate for that game.

As many other reviewers have noted, the handling is not perfect, and is the least good aspect of the game, especially on tarmac tracks. Specifically, the back end of the car may unexpectedly slide out for no apparent reason, or more than it should, due to the position of the ""centre of turning"" of the car, which can ruin a stage and thus an entire rally. If you only play this game and not any other racing games, it is possible to adapt to this phenomenon to a large extent, and the quality of the rest of the game compensates for this issue.

You really need to set up each car correctly for each track - using setups by such people as Rally Technical on YT, if you are not already proficient in technical minutiae. I wish that there were an easier way to configure the cars, because there are literally thousands of different ""optimal"" setups, taking account of the 82 cars, 169 stages and multiple weather situations in the game. If you could import setups from a file or online, that would greatly improve the game for most players. You CAN play with default setups, but you will be at a great disadvantage 99% of the time.

I don't have much more to say - this is a great game if you want a fun but very challenging rally experience, with lots of variety and few negative aspects, and at fantastic value when on sale. That being said, if I were rich and had a powerful enough PC, I would get the new game instead - it is recognised by more or less all reviewers to be an improved version of this game in every way.",1701997384,1701997384,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Its all caused by the DLC's since they give you the vehicles for free, but there is no option to start from scratch. So career mode is just a glorified time trial mode.

I have put many hours in other games such as Warthunder, Warzone 2 etc, however I only felt myself playing them for the sake of it, with nothing better to do and just to progress skins and research trees. However this game provides something more when you make a turn cleanly or finish first. Big crashes also make for a good look at the replay and often look lethal in first person.

My specs (Asus rog G20 purchased in 2017): i7-6700 CPU 3,40 Htz, 16GB Ram, GTX 1060 6GB Ram, Win 10 home 64 bits, 256 GB SSD + 1TB mechanical HDD.
Triple screen configuration : 59 Htz 27  inches (2560 x 1440 f per screen = WQHD)
Resolution used for Dirt Rally 1.0 : 7680 x 1440
Resolution used for Dirt Rally 2.0 : 4580 x 1080

Yes I recommend this game if you have the adequate PC. Mine is fine at a resolution of 2560 * 1440 (medium details everywhere excepted textures and shadow in ultra) or in 4580 * 1080 (medium details nearly everywhere excepted textures and shadow in high).
I cannot play in native resolution (7680*1440 with Nvidia surround), details are low or ultra low, a nightmare.
Bug inside : some stages are really dark (New zealand)  and nearly unplayable. this isssue doees not exist in the  original Dirt Rally 1.0. Even if you replace in the My documents/Dirt Rally 2.0 settings ""HDR  1,0"" by ""HDR 0,1"", there is no change.

Game is fun, there is no need to play the ""campaign mode"", just play  solo in ""time attack"" mode, so that you run against your own  ghost. Do not play on line since you play alone and you just compare your time with those online. It is better to see the ghost of yourself and to beat yourself (there is a leaderboard showing your time agaiinst the best players in time attack mode).  There is also  a custom rally mode where you select the stages of the rallys you like including the weather.
I am an occasionnal driver so this game is perfect but a patch should correct the dimness in game. I was not able to  find a solution  on the net to fix this.
I also use the  sweet FX add-on from RaceDepartment so that image on screen is nicer (at a FFPS cost).

Dirt Rally 1.0 (created in 2015) is still useful since you  have a lot of details at native resolutiion with high settings everywhere, impossible to have this with Dirt Rally 2.0 (created in 2019).
i thought Dirt rally 2.0 could better run on my specs. If your PC is old, stick to the original game.
However at my resolution (4580 x 1080) DIrt Rally 2.0 (with vsync on)  provides a better sensation of speed than Dirt  Rally 1.0 using the same resolution (wiith vsync off). This is strange.

I am using a Logitech G920, it is recognized at once but be prepared to struggle to find appropriate settings on the net. It is less complicated on Dirt Rally 1.0 even if the default settings have to be changed too.

Dirt Rally provides more cars and circuits but their darkness is a real problem.
You do not have those issues in DIrt Rally 1.0.

I still enjoy dirt rally 2.0 but keep this in mind before any purchase.

Edit : Dimness issue solved thx to  Dirt Rally 2 VR eye accomodation fix v2.0.

Here below you will find what I did to improve the game after hours of researches for game improvement. I share with you the results, they are worth it!

Instructions to improve the game :
1. Apply shaders (reshade exe file) / use same exe file to uninstall shaders
2. Copy GTV-DR-2.ini into main Dirt 2.0 folder
3. Copy lut.png into Steam\steamapps\common\dirt 2.0\reshade-shaders\textures 
4. Change reshade.ini (in main Dirt 2.0 folder)
in [INPUT]
Replace ""KeyOverlay=32.0.0.0"" with ""KeyOverlay=113,0,1,0""
5. In game, type SHIFT F2 to get rid of top horizontal bar
6. If too much blue in reshade :  Open reshade, go to ""Lift Gamma Gain"" and play with ""RGB Gamma""
7. In main Dirt 2.0 folder, rename dxgi.dll into d3d11.dll (this is a big file, 3.385 kb to be kept)
8. To reduce dimmness, disable HDR, in My documents\dirt rally 2.0\hardware_settings_confg.xml --> edit it and replace <hdr level=""1.0"" />
with <hdr level=""0.1"" />. However this does not seem to work a lot...
9. Steering wheel saturation change: in  Steam\steamapps\common\dirt 2.0\input\libraries, replace lib_direct_input.xml with a file of the same name (the one with saturation deadzone = 1.0)
10. New audio : install audio directory (does not originally exist) in Steam\steamapps\common\dirt 2.0\game\audio.
11. HDR fix from Dirt VR (no more  excessive dimness/darkness in game) : copy dr2vrfix.cfg into Steam\steamapps\common\dirt 2.0 (do not copy d3d11.dll)
12. Add more FFB in Wheel (by default ffb_force = 1.0)  : in Steam\steamapps\common\dirt 2.0\game\input\devices\devices\defines.xml, change the line 
 <device id=""{C262046D-0000-0000-0000-504944564944}"" name=""lg_g920"" priority=""100"" type=""wheel"" />
into  :
<device id=""{C262046D-0000-0000-0000-504944564944}"" name=""lg_g920"" priority=""100"" type=""wheel"" ffb_friction=""5.0"" ffb_force=""1.2"" />

Files used:
* HDR Fix : Dirt Rally 2 VR eye accomodation fix v2.0 from http://www.kegetys.fi/dirt-rally-2-vr-eye-accomodation-fix-v2-0/
* Graphism update : Reshade setup 5.9.2 from https://reshade.me/
* Audio update (new sound effect enable more sounds all games from codemasters) : DiRT Rally 2 0 Colin McRae FLAT OUT from Racedepartment : https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/new-sound-effect-enable-more-sounds.36087/
* Wheel update : dirt 2.0 lib direct input from Racedepartment : 
https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/contoller-fix-add-saturation-as-missing.26692/
* Simhub 9.1.12 (to use tablet as 4th screen): 
https://www.simhubdash.com/download-2/
* Simhub SS Overlay M for Dirt Rally 0.2 transformed into a dashboard : 
https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/ss-overlay-m1-for-dirt-rally.30824/ 

Now the game is nearly perfect.
Maybe a new PC will be needed to get the same FPS in 7680x1440 but I am satisfied with such detail level and fluidity in game at 4580 x 1080.

Rally cross is a fine addition, more playable than in the original DIrt Rally.
Just one regret : to have purchased the game just 1 week before Black Friday, so I lost 30 € (it was 10 instead of 40, one the one hand all I had to do was to wait but on the other hand I am not sure all games get a discount at Black Friday).

I suck after about 6 hours of play time, but still win enough (in career mode) that I still get money and don't feel depressed about losing too often. There is lots of room to grow and gain mastery and I think i will get a lot of playtime out of this game. Its really just... thrilling. Going so fast and knowing the tiniest mistake will absolutely wreck you is a great (and terrible) feeling.",1701210220,1701210351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The difficulty  setting which is unavailable for the career mode is all over the place. A difficulty of 40 and a difficulty of 1 doesn't seem to be any different. The progress bar is unhelpful as it actually makes you think you're doing great through the stages but then you'll fall back in positions when you finish the stage. And judging by the ""class leader"" AI also seems to pull off some impossible speeds. It seems scripted to me as i can see the class leader always getting speed and loosing speed at the same parts of a stage. 

The historic rally championships shouldn't have been locked to a podium finish in order to be able to move on the the next car category since each of these cars will become progressively more difficult to drive. The career mode gets repetitive and it lacks structure, also needs more rally locations. Buying more locations will also not expand your career mode!

I guess i can't complain too much since i've paid like 5 euro for this many months ago. It's arguably not as great as the positive reviews % might make it seem like. It's a bit of a fake echo chamber. If this game had released exactly like this in 2022/2023 it would be a completely different story. It's perfectly playable on a controller and it runs well. I guess you could get something out of it. So its not a total loss. A great handling model alone doesn't make for a great game.",1700679671,1701186455,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has SEVERE physics bugs - the weight & inertia of vehicles is calculated for the total of the vehicle ONLY, and as such there is no inertia to the vehicle corners, only the centre of gravity.
This makes all the cars EXTREMELY skittish, EXTREMELY unpredictable and EXTREMELY prone to flying into the sky after driving somewhat near a pebble.

This is an arcade racer with artificial difficulty from physics bugs, NOT a sim.

One can never have enough confidence to fully rely on the co-driver pace notes to drive fast - they are just too inconsistent. Sometimes the calls are way too early, and other times too late (either there is not enough time to brake, or he calls  mid-corner). Seriously? IRL if co-drivers were so bad half of the WRC drivers would be dead. BTW, it's not Phil Mills fault - it's the way Codies integrated that into the game.
When the pace notes are right DR 2.0 is a pleasure to drive - it gives you a taste of what could have been. When they are wrong however you are either in the trees or off the cliff - it's so frustrating. I don't have time to memorize every stage - and in rally that's not the point!

However, the game also has a bunch of some pretty questionable UI/QoL issues, such as inability to fix car damage in garage, etc. Furthermore, I also had an issue with it repeatedly disconnecting my Xbox controller, despite it being supposedly natively supported, as well as what I assume was a memory leak that made the performance of the game tank after every couple stages, requiring a restart (or sometimes multiple) to get the game to perform properly again.

At a deep discount, it may be worth it, because when it works, it's definitely one of the (if not the) best rally games in recent years, but the constant controller issues and the necessity to restart the game several times throughout a rally event are just too annoying for me personally to keep playing.",1701001792,1701001792,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,2,True,False,False

So... I've only played DiRT Rally 2.0 in VR, and I had the chance of trying it out in SteamVR and native OculusVR support.

I own an Oculus Rift, and a VIVE Cosmos headset.

I mean, I really love it... Super fun and intense for me. I don't recommend playing with a VR headset whose resolution is too small or pixelated for your eyes, but here's my take on it at least:

I personally believe the Oculus Rift ran far better with the game in terms of performance as long its done in Oculus's own runtime. If through SteamVR, regardless if it was the VIVE or the Oculus headset, the game is really laggy in some areas, leaving me to turn all graphics down to bare minimum so its fluent enough. Didn't matter the internal resolution of the game, it just lags ALOT.

It became unplayable to a point where even the tracking system seemed to fail and became absolutely jittered.

My system may run a RTX 2060 Super / AMD Ryzen 5600X setup, but that shouldn't be the case. The game itself could've been more optimized if Codemasters still worked on it.

Now that they got a new WRC title to care for, I sincerely hope they will improve things once VR's been implemented.",1689265406,1700849290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

W np. Drit 4 było bardzo dużo możliwości dostosowania poziomu trudności, od zmiany po prostu na łątwy lub trudny do różnych opcji relizmu, ilości cofek i restartów czy zablokowania kamery.
A tutaj w trybie fabularnym czyli głównym bo jakiś customowych odpałów nie będę opisywał, poziomu trudności nie ma i wszyscy grają sobie od samego początku w je**ane dark soulsy...
Da się tylko pozmieniać jakieś opcje dotyczące realizmu ale poziomu trudności nie zmienisz. W silnglowych eventach jest limit restartów a w daily czlendźach w ogóle się resetować nie da.
Dalej niektóre poziomy rally mają zwalone AI przeciwników tak jak w 4 czyli mimo, że mapa jest w cholere trudna to AI robi ją zajebi**cie prosto a następna która jest bardzo prosta nagle masz minutę przewagi...
Kupiłem chyba w bundlu za 20zł z dirtem 4 i mimo, że rally 2.0 wygląda lepiej i jest lepiej zoptymalizowany to są to je**ane dark soulsy i nie polecam.

edit po ~20h
twórcy h**a widzieli a nie rajdy
jeżeli robi się grę, która ma być w pi**ę realistyczna to dajmy możliwość, żeby gracz sam mógł wyjechać z przysłowiowego pola kukurydzy a nie od razu go respawnować z karą...
spadek z mostka na kamyczki to też nie jest terminal damage bo normalnie ludzie ten samochód wyciągają i jedzie dalej i sam gracz też by mógł na lajcie wyjechać ale jest je**ny deathwall

The feeling of sliding through gravel, the responsiveness of the steering, and the impact of each jump are meticulously crafted to offer a genuine rally experience. However, this attention to realism comes at a cost—namely, a steep learning curve that can leave even seasoned racing game veterans struggling to keep their cars on the track.

The tracks themselves are beautifully designed, winding through diverse landscapes ranging from dense forests to mountainous terrains. However, the picturesque scenery can quickly become an adversary, as tightly packed trees and unforgiving terrain turn what should be a scenic drive into a chaotic ballet of rolling vehicles. It's not uncommon for players to find themselves airborne one moment and careening into a tree the next.

The difficulty of Dirt Rally 2.0 lies not only in the precision required to navigate the tracks but also in the unpredictable nature of the obstacles. The game seems to revel in catching players off guard, with sudden turns, hidden jumps, and deviously placed trees conspiring to send your car spinning out of control. The frustration peaks when, after a particularly challenging section, a simple mistake sends your vehicle tumbling like a pinball, leading to a series of rolls that would make a gymnast jealous.

While some may appreciate the high stakes and the thrill of overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges, others may find the difficulty level excessive and discouraging. The lack of a gradual difficulty curve may alienate casual players, leaving them feeling more like crash test dummies than rally champions.

In conclusion, Dirt Rally 2.0 is a rally game that lives up to its promise of delivering an intense and challenging experience. The realistic physics, stunning tracks, and heart-pounding moments make it a unique entry in the racing game genre. However, its unrelenting difficulty and penchant for turning a relaxing drive into a chaotic mess may not be for everyone. If you're up for the challenge and have a high tolerance for frustration, Dirt Rally 2.0 might just be the adrenaline fix you're looking for. Just be prepared for a fair share of rolling on the ground and colliding with trees along the way.",1699733295,1699733295,True,16,1,0.722322404384613037,0,True,False,False

I wouldn't call it a simulator, not in the physics sense. It's a simcade with heavy immersion (would call it ""immersive sim""). 
The content and graphics are there but the physics hinders it.

With the starter FWD cars I had no problem but once I got to the RWD and AWD cars. It slaped me. The cars really wanted me to slide into the magnetic clutches of the ditches and valleys a#s first. It just feels really off on gravel and asphalt.

+The co-driver loves to read very late on some stages (like you would need to slow down 50m before the hairpin and he calls it at 20m)

But those moments when everything just connect and you forget the problems and just RATATATATATT VVROOOOOOMMMMMM. Feels great.
+1 point for the singleplayer content.

If you got DR1, maybe hold off cause this seems like its just a more optimized DR1. Unless if you LOVE these games, then pick it up.

Championships have several Events, and the Events have, so far, 4(maybe up to 6 stages/races)

Co-Driver calls: Good and customizable so they could give callouts earlier or later (Again, I havent played DR1 and I dont know if DR1 had it or not.)
Starting an event, they give a layout of the track, the length, the elevation change, the weather, and the terrain so you can plan your tuning setup later.

Graphics: There's several options and it runs very well on High settings on my GTX 1060 6gb, and i7 cpu. I had 60 fps with 1 instance of it dipping to 45 fps over these 8 first hours. I've done maybe 16ish stages/races so far. 
You can change Vsync, multisampling AA, turn on TAA separately,
The minor tweaks you can make involve changing: the mirror fidelity, crowd density, tree LoD, ground cover, skidmarks, weather effects, motion blur, god rays, abberation, bloom, lens flares, light streaks, and lens dust.
Shader, and Texture Detail reflections, shadows are all 


When you start your 1st event, the initial event at least gives you 2 repair stops... which are free until you start experiencing heavy damages I assume.
There's a penalty, which I havent triggered yet once your free repairs goes over 30 minutes of pre-race prep time. This should motivate you to Take it slow and steady as you race to avoid crashing too much. 
Once you begin the 1st event/ race, it prompts you 1 last time to Tune your car and change your tires.
The setups aren't casual or barebones. I'd say they're just right as they give you the gear ratios, suspensions, dampers, and


I haven't played the MP nor do I want to. I may later... but I just enjoyed Colin McRae Rally 04 when I was 9 so maybe I'll attempt it when I get a wheel and pedal system. I've only played the 1st championship with 6ish events on an xbox one controller and I enjoyed it in third person. Later this week, I'll attempt the game on a Logitech G920 Wheel from 1st person mode and see how it handles. I'm excited since its my first wheel. 

EDIT: I may update this review after I've gotten my G920 wheel.

Some of the issues from my OG review still exist and still annoy me. But most of the bugs (invisible objects) are long gone. Still some bad callouts, and there is one corner that just doesn't have one lol (and its a square 2 left no less lol) But setting up a custom championship and just playing when I feel like it, this game is now the best rally game, and has been for quite awhile. Here's hoping WRC can take its place.


-----OLD REVIEW BELOW From 2020-----

Meh, the physics are better than Dirt rally, I would thumbs up this game... BUT, they again made career mode only fun for a limited time by not having difficulty options. So you either keep playing forever, or play it once and never come back, you're fine, but if you are like me and like to come back to games later on, career mode will only be fun the first time around, and then not fun at all once you come back to get dominated lol.


Update April 8th, 2020.

After returning to this game last month, and having all the DLC's now that they reduced the prices to a reasonable level, I can say, that me and this game have a love hate relationship. There are few games that give me the same level of intensity and fun in one go, but simultaneously, there are few games that can make me rage in an instant due to poor game design or bugs.

There are bugs where you will hit invisible objects, sometimes right in the middle of the road/track, sometimes they will just slow you for a moment and then you are good, other times they will fling you off the track or just blow out a tire for no apparent reason. When this happens during a good run, it's easily one of the most infuriating, and disheartening things I've ever dealt with across all of gaming. (This honestly would be easily made less frustrating if the game had rewinds, but the community for this game is apparently too weak minded to not use something they don't like so they basically demand they be left out of the game entirely) 

There is also a problem with loud, inaccurate and just flat out wrong stage notes (Think ""4 left, 3 right"" etc) Some will be 300% louder than all the other callouts, which is distracting to say the least. Then others you will get ""3 left into 3 right"" and the 3 right will be twice as sharp so you fall off a cliff. And then there are some that are just wrong, like one stage on Germany where the callout is ""4 left, tightens to 3"" and it's actually a 3 left, opens to 4. All of this gets better as you learn stages, but there are a lot of stages and once you quit playing for awhile, you're screwed.

I had one genius tell me I should learn every course so I'm thinking 3 turns ahead lol. This line of thinking in my opinion is absurd, because there are 100s if not 1000s of turns in this game, and not many people are going to /only/ play dirt rally and nothing else.

Then comes the problem of multiplayer, you cannot set up a custom championship with rallies and stages you want to run, and run it with a friend, quit mid way and come back later. You have to do the entire championship in one setting. You simply don't have the option to continue the campaign with the people you were playing with, though you can continue it alone, which is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a game in the 2010s/2020s when it comes to multiplayer.

Me and my friend have been forced to run a few rallies then quit, set up a new championship when we come back run a few quit, and then when we finally finish the championship we wanted, add up the points between each set for us and the AI to determine where we finish. Its silly that we can't just continue the rally.

I don't want to use racenet to set up random rally championships, so don't bother suggesting that. I want to pick each stage individually because I have tested the ones we run to make sure there are little to no loud call outs.

Single player Career mode, I give a 1/10 because I can't play it offline.

Single player content usable offline including custom championships I rate 8/10, the game is a lot of fun when it works properly, and its challenging. Would be a 10/10 for me without all the bugs and poor stage notes.

Multiplayer - custom championships and such - 2/10 because you can't continue once you leave the lobby.

Multiplayer through race net - NA/10 because I don't give a damn about that.

Overall, 5/10. The physics are for the most part great, its a hell of a lot of fun to play when the game is working properly. Unfortunately multiplayer options are trash, and there is a ton of annoying bugs and other issues that ruin an otherwise great game. 

Their focus on E-sports ruined this games multiplayer IMO.",1566075798,1696889990,True,0,0,0.511111080646514893,0,True,False,False

ive played not 3 but ~50hrs 2.0 and a few hundred hours the first one. you can tell the devs care about high quality a lot. 
this here is currently imho the best game/sim out there to drive/race with controller OR +5k $ sim rig. well optimised for both (force feedback amazing, vibrations actually helpful). would not recommend for keyboard/mouse!
very, very good and realistic car/road physics but easy to get into even for people who cant drive yet i assume since ai very forgiving and all realistic driving assists are available (traction control, break assist, stability control etc). with this game you can learn drifting irl in the easiest, safest and cheapest way possible afaik. and if you already can drift - you will have a blast. the closest to the real thing, very satisfying.
great feeling of speed, great visuals and the best audio ive experienced in car related games.

Negatives:
-Always online requirement for a SINGLEPLAYER GAME meaning:
	-If you have no broadband or an unreliable ISP you can't play at all, mid stage connection loss? Tough luck, back to the main menu.
	-Steams weekly scheduled maintenance means you can't play at all during that time.
	-The game has to wait for validation with the server increasing load times when starting a rally, entering the race events menu, accessing cars in garage menus, uploading a leaderboard time at the end of every single stage etc.
	-Career progress can be reset to 0 for some people when servers detect discrepancy between local and cloud data.
-After losing connection to servers trying to reconnect can crash the game lol. (Only happened once).
-DLC model which recycles content from Dirt rally 1. Thankfully all DLC can be obtained at once with the GOTY edition.
	-DLC locks out legendary rally vehicles like the Lancia 037, Subaru Imprezza (2001), Subaru Imprezza S4, Peugeot 206. There's a lot of rallycross car DLC too.
-Lack of modding in a SINGLEPLAYER GAME compared to Dirt rally 1 due to DLC files being unalterable (cant mod DLC car liveries and even base game cars have only 1 or no liveries that can be replaced. Why not let us add to the list of liveries like the game Art of rally.)
-4WD up to 2000cc class consists of entirely DLC cars.
-Few real liveries for vehicles

Postives:
-Very good physics on all surfaces, not perfect but very good.
-Stages are based on real life locations
-Great voice acting from the English Co-Driver Phil Mills, all of the throat clearing and changes in the tone of voice to sound more scared when the car is being thrown around a lot/ moving at speed adds to the feel a lot.
-Much more rallycross content than the first game (granted rally is what most people play for)
-Plenty of cars and rally locations with all DLC
-Good graphics

Overall the game is great but the listed problems warrant a negative review.
Handling is great on both controller and wheel and there's not really any other rally sim substitute other than RBR which is from 2004 and no longer sold

I picked up the GOTY edition for €8 on sale. Well worth it but an always online game isn't worth any more than that because when they stop hosting the servers you won't be able to play it anymore.

After comparing to DR1 I uninstalled DR1 and moved that into a library category called ""recycle bin"". I'd call it DR 1.5 rather than 2.0, or basically what DR1 should have been.

The FFB got a lot of hate but (nowadays) it is much better than DR1's and there's no way I'm going back to that. People say DR2 is harder but with the FFB no longer working against me and all forms of logic I have much better control of the car. DR2 also looks a little better, has way more cars and other content and a much improved menu system.

Unfortunately the leaderboards are effectively useless. You can't filter them to list just the times driven without assists and cutting the track is commonplace. This kills any desire to improve your times to get e.g. top 100 or top 10. Always online also sucks but it isn't worth sticking with DR1 just because of that. I do have a great internet connection and it hasn't caused any issues for me thus far.

I like the improved damage model as it forces you to adjust your speed to stay within your capability to control the car. It's very easy to get a puncture though - or in US English, a flat tyre. If you aren't a very experienced simracer you'll have your work cut out for you to learn how to not hit a tree every minute. It's not *quite* a true sim like Richard Burns Rally but still a very, very difficult game. It's sweaty. It takes a lot of effort and focus and therefore, energy.

Little did I know that those dreams would become true in the form of this insane, beautiful, challenging, rewarding game.
The driving experience here is so visceral and extreme that my glutes sweat and my heart pounds...
I've always wondered what it would be like to drive unrestricted on narrow roads/paths through the woods and here I can experience just that without the fear of death or injury...though the realism and danger are what make these types of things most enjoyable, the simulation is good enough to where the threat almost feels real too.
All in all with a Logitech G29 wheel, pedals, and shifter (yes I'm starting with the Lancia Fulvia HF and it is an absolute JOY to drive), the gameplay is so much fun and immersive. The force feedback connects me to the vehicle and the surfaces beneath me, something that flight sims (I'm more of an aviation guy than a car guy but still) just can't give...I'd say the experience is much more intense here as #1 you are quite literally on the ground and can FEEL the relative velocity, and of course #2 you can feel every vibration/shock/grip/rock-in-the-road/bang/crash/slam on your hands and it is SIMPLY AMAZING!
Nothing is as satisfying and taking a turn at the exact required speed/angle/timing, and accelerating outwards, zooming through a narrow gateway and out into a straight away into 4th gear, while the New Zealand countryside flies past in all of its glory.

Correctly deciding your speed when approaching a turn, when to start the turn, whether you handbrake, what gear you're in, etc, naturally results in a higher position in race results, as there are a lot of opportunities for mistakes throughout a race. This is all to say that It's a different style racing game that puts emphasis on keeping your car intact and staying on the road. I feel like I'm always flooring it in other racing games, not being rewarded for throttle control. I suppose this is why racing sims exist lmao.

For me, this means the game isn't fun enough, as a beginner in sim racing/rally, I'm always in the bottom 5 of the championships, gets boring and frustrating really fast. You can create custom championships and bot ""difficulty"" can be changed, so there is at least some sense of success (I set it so I place around ~10th and I have a carrot on a stick then)

Time trial is good, you can restart as many times as you want, and you can practice and improve.
It would be a very nice UI feature to allow practice of any track+time+car+weather combo with a few button clicks for career or daily/weekly/etc challenges.

As a rally sim, Dirt 2 is GREAT! If you are into this, I DO recommend it. Arcade players play something else, or stick to time trials, and dip your toes into career later.
I really like how this game gives force feedback on the steering wheel, it helps to feel the car a lot.

edit after 34 hours of playing:
there are still grudges I hold against the game, such as the missing option to turn off damage so I can simply drive and learn the map+car (I don't care if those runs wouldn't end up on the leaderboards); this mostly means headlights at night, and punctures - I'm fine with breaking the rest of the car when kissing a tree, don't misunderstand me.
There is definitely a ""git gud"" aspect of the game, the difference between 1st place and retirement can be rotating a car too late or mishearing a call. As I definitely have improved over the last 20 hours, my experience improved as well. I keep the negative review in place for the time being, but at this point a simple ""yes or no"" isn't enough. For arcade players who just want to drive around on dirt and have fun, this game isn't gonna cut it. For sim racing players, rally fans, and ppl with lots of time on their hands (and willing to practice a lot, watch guides, etc.), it's an excellent value for your money. You have options to choose from, never really forced to do anything.

edit after 55 hours:

I just tried VR mode, works well, however it does require a high-end PC to run smoothly on high settings, and medium is... a little low. I have to emphasize that VR mode is good and fun, I can peek at the pace notes, I feel more immersed as I look at Phil and yell him silly things. Also, somehow the car feels better to drive around. Small bumps and dips are way more visible, the higher FOV helps you precisely control where your car is.
Crashes are not fun, though :) I am sensitive to motion sickness, but VR in this game is really pleasant - when it's not lagging - and I feel perfectly fine after playing 40-50 minutes. (yes, my brain knows that when driving a car, I sit, that certainly helps)

The VR experience, combined with the fact that I keep coming back to and enjoying the game, makes me change my review to a thumbsup.

I still hold grudges because I can't turn off damage when I just want to practice a stage.",1690672958,1695408898,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

On first startup you're forced to waive all rights of ownership before even being allowed to play, and singleplayer does NOT work offline.
In fact the only reason i bought the game at all is because of its VR support, which works really well. I come back to this occasionally because it is one of the only racing titles that gives you the proper sense of immersion as well as a lower amount of time spent in menus than simracers often force you to. I never stick around for long though, because it usually takes less than a single race to completely crush my spirit, and the rally series does not take kindly to restarts.
About the driving itself tho: i drive, and i have driven the regular joe versions of some of the cars portrayed in this game (one or two even on dirt lanes, through woods, slightly too fast) and i refuse to believe that this is a realistic portrayal. Regular cars are not as difiicult to control as this game makes them out to be, even if boosted to the eyeballs and with straight-cut gears and everything.

I am not going to get into the seasons debate even though I was less than happy about it. However, as a early adopter to DR I can safely say I have played and know this game well. I was not going to purchase DR2.0 after the debacle of Dirt 4. I gave them one last chance to redeem themselves and that's on me.

Let me say that this is the best racing game to date imo. I say game as I am tired of the whole ""sim"" debate. Unless the so called ""sim"" enthusiasts are using a 25K plus hydraulic cockpit designed for ""sim"" racing, its just a game. I have severe nerve damage and health issues and I am consistently in the top 500  (most times in top 250) with a Xbox controller. Owned expensive wheels before but it has never been like true driving to me.

Buy one of these or another brand for 25K then brag about your sim racing: https://www.cxcsimulations.com/purchase/

With all that said, the pathetic ridiculousness of RaceNet from day 1 has finally made me post a review and stop playing. I love the game, but CM has done so much crap to tick off their customer base and Racenet is not helping. Its so pathetic that it can't even keep cheaters from getting unheard of top times. They need to do away with it being tied to every function of the game, every click, every menu, every screen. To make matters worse, they throw all their other games on to this craptastic system and ruin it for everyone. I am not the only one complaining about this consistent issue. Read the discussions, here, and elsewhere, people are sick and tired of the broken Racenet and CM's inability to do anything about it. I have a 500Mb connection and have no issues with any other game or streaming service.

All they care about is selling more DLC instead of fixing what has been broken from day one. IMO stay away from anything from CM they are a shell of what they used to be like so many others. This game will cause you more aggravation than joy  and its not worth your money.

If they ever actually fix RaceNet and you can deal with the craptastic DLC and season crap they pulled then I would say go for it. As I stated it certainly is the best racing game when it works properly.",1571078747,1693847707,False,12,1,0.509087085723876953,0,True,False,False

Of course everyone's already talked about the anti consumer feature which is that the career mode is always ONLINE, wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't taking sometimes as long as 30 seconds to connect, which happens when you click into career mode from the main menu, or when you somehow lose connection in career mode, which happens way too often for it to be a real annoying issue once in a while.

the worst sin of all this game has (aside from my gripes about the ugly italicized font and ultra lame soundtrack), is that modding liveries is severely limited by the devs for their anti piracy measures, which wouldn't bother pirates since they get the whole ass game for free, and does effect anyone who buys the game, seriously limiting your choices, so that have you to chose which default livery (which in most of the cases are the best livery for each respective car) to replace, instead of just replacing many of the repeating slopveries on most of the cars with actual aesthetically pleasing and historically accurate ones, which is possible in dirt rally 1, where it also has unique alternate liveries that are mostly good to look at.",1693835570,1693835570,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game-playing mechanics are incredibly hard but based on a very realistic scale of how it is to drive these cars. As for the graphics and scenery they can be anywhere from a game from the 80s to a professional photographer’s pièce de résistance. The game's attention to detail on the cars is truly a spectacle.

-Incredible audio (engine sounds, tire noise, dirt hitting the chassis, etc.)
-Large selection of locations, stages, and vehicles (including historic FWD, RWD, and 4WD, Group A, B, etc.)
-Traditional stage-based rallies as well as rallycross
-Daily, weekly, and monthly challenges

It is punishingly difficult if you are used to arcade or simcade racers, especially traditional circuit racing with very wide tracks. By comparison, there is less traction, way narrower roads, and of course fixed object obstacles often only feet away from where you must drive. But all of that makes it so much more rewarding when you get a clean stage in. I put in the first 25 hours on my Steam Deck and the next 25 hours (so far) on PC on a sim rig. I still play on the Deck sometimes when not at the house and am only marginally faster on the wheel, although it is more fun on the wheel of course.

It runs beautifully on the Steam Deck, despite being ""Unsupported"" at the time of this writing. I run it on Medium with a rock-steady 60fps but it will also run high/ultra settings locked at 40fps, but the visual difference is minimal on the Deck's screen, so I prioritize frames.

From the get-go, you're thrown into a merciless world of rally racing where every corner feels like a life-or-death decision. The precision required to conquer these treacherous tracks is both infuriating and addicting.

The realism here is off the charts. The way your car hugs the road, the dirt that kicks up with every skid, and the dynamic weather that turns a serene forest into a mud-soaked nightmare – it's all uncannily true-to-life. The engine roars, and I can practically feel the vibrations through my controller. Speaking of controllers, don't even get me started on how much better this is with a proper wheel setup.

The career mode's progression is a masterclass in keeping you glued to the screen. From the humble beginnings with underpowered hatchbacks to conquering the iconic rally cars of history, the journey is a thrill. And let's not forget the online challenges – they're the ultimate test of your skills against other speed demons.

If you're into rally or just seeking a white-knuckle racing experience, Dirt Rally 2.0 is the ultimate fix. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who dare, it's an exhilarating ride that'll leave your palms sweaty and your heart racing for more.",1604899044,1692439292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rally stages are procedural what it means is that every rally is different but also in a single rally you will come across the same U turns, 1, 2 etc. This isn´t bad in it self but Codemasters have screw up the co-driver.

The co driver is a mess, he calls the turns very late sometimes so when he is telling you about a 1 turn (very tight, slow corner) you are already flying down a cliff or you are hitting the apex and it is already too late. You can configure it to call turns earlier but it is not enough. Also there are some wrong calls, him telling you about a 5 turn but he never told you that it was after a minor jump so flying you go again. It gets very frustrating. There is also the 5 turn that is more like a 4 or a 3. What the codriver thinks is a 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 changes depending where you are rallying so you never know. He also calls turns that are barely there and you will be left scratching your head as to where was that 6 turn he called a while ago and of course you will crash because you don´t know what to expect ahead of you.

Maybe you think you can put up with the crappy codriver, how about an always online DRM service? Dirt 2.0 has you covered. Nothing like losing the progress of an offline championship because it didn´t match up with the online save they have on their severs. 2 hours of my life down the drain. The game is more of a ""communicating with server simulator"". At the start of the stage it checks the server, end of the stage, check the server, want to check your cars in your garage, let the game check the effing servers again. If you have an SSD you will be more time contacting the servers than on loading screens. And if you or their servers go down and it can´t save your progress after a stage you are effed, no local save for you my friend you might as well not raced that stage.

Physics are good, but it is ruined by the codriver, the only way to be very fast here is to memorize every single type of turn and all the tricky bad calls.",1626808112,1692366048,False,3,0,0.506578922271728516,2,True,False,False

Let's be honest, fellas. All of us have wanted to satiate that twisted, primal fantasy of taking our grandma's 1998 Toyota Camry out rallying and demolishing its undercarriage in the process. It's a part of man's innate nature to feel the wind smacking us in the face going 90 miles per hour, down a winding, wooded road on the mountainside, with nothing but the smell of pine trees and motor oil being siphoned in-and-out of our nostrils.

--- Communicating with Server...

They've ruined this game.
Get ready to wait, and wait, and wait, and wade through repetitive, boring and utterly useless cut scenes before and after every... single... race.

People rave about the game's physics being oh so realistic... No... they are not.
I've driven multiple cars through multiple snow storms... that is not even close to how a real car behaves in show.
If you slam on the brakes before a right or left turn, your car will systematically start turning right or left, without you touching the steering. That's not good physics... that's the stupid game getting in the way!
I don't have a force-feedback steering wheel which I assume, makes the driving a lot more difficult. They should have thought of that.
Some of the races are just ridiculously hard with a gamepad, and I mean ridiculous to the point of being no fun at all. Rear wheel drive Porsche, in the rain and mud, with a gamepad... just nope...

Some of the races are good, some are not, but overall the ""--- Communicating with Server..."" ruins it.

I spend most of my PC gaming time on driving sims and had for some reason avoided rally racing until I felt confident-ish with my ability on other Racing Sims (Assetto Corsa, ACC) as I've heard how frustratingly difficult this game could be. 

Honestly I'm glad I did this as the fundamentals of driving on the track help in training you on some key fundamentals i.e. when the car starts to lose grip and how it feels to regain it.

You see a cool car in the shop? 
Too bad, you can only use really specific cars the game tells you to race with. And the one you like is not one of them. Instead buy this spaceship looking Citroën that costs half a million.

I admit at first I never really took to it.
I've only played a few hours or so and now having taken my time I see how addictive and good this game is.

I'm not great at rally games but nonetheless I am doing OK.

Not a problem in its purity but that of it takes a little time when all that you want to do is play.

My co-driver and I know what counts in the championship, not the rear punctures we suffer, the noise of our Group B engines, nor the terminal damage we make. We know that it's the drifts that count, we will drift...

My co-driver is human even as I, because he is my life, thus I will learn him like a brother. I will learn his weaknesses, his strengths, his ridiculously late/early calls, his chin and his stubble.

Great racing game that helps you to understand basics of driving, lets you win in kid races then smashes you in the face with increasing difficulty levels of career. If only Assetto Corsa had such a great ""single player campaign"" :)

Tiene sus cosas, como que el copiloto es el ser mas inútil en la faz de la tierra  o que  el juego decide cuando dejarte usar los limpia parabrisas (aunque el parabrisas nunca se ensucia ) y que las luces no solo igual, se prenden cuando quieren, sino que son marca 3 fuegos (no iluminan un carajo).
El juego me encanto, 
-Los coches tienen su dificultad a la hora de conducir, pero no son tanques soviéticos ni autos de plástico. 
-Tiene eventos diarios/ semanales /  mensuales donde jugas contra otros corredores para ganar dinero (obviamente gana mas plata los top X , pero aun estando en ultimo (como yo =_) ) te llevas una buena tajada para seguir jugando y destrozando tus coches!!  ), 
-Los autos tienen un sistema de rpg donde mientras mas conduscas con este desbloqueas los planos de otros motores para ""tunear"" el auto (ni idea si cambia algo o no, pero me gusto el concepto ), 
-El auto es TUYO , a que refiero con eso?  hacelo mier si queres.. las reparaciones salen de tu bolsillo te voy avisando. (tranqui, porque para evitar un p2w / softlock el juego tiene el Lancia Stratos (creo que es ese) que se repara gratis y jugando un campeonato en solitario podes ganar suficiente plata para reparar y seguir jugando otros autos)
-Y tiene un modo offline, si, no subís de lv el auto ni ganas dinero, pero las reparaciones son gratis (si mal no me equivoco) y podes jugar sin problemas si el internet explota un día. 
Sinceramente un juego muy bien pensado y entretenido.

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH

This game goes on sale for a STEAL at just 5 freedom dollars every so often.
The depth rally has to offer is quite amazing, as you will learn the calls for every type of turn ranging from 6 (shallow) to 1 (tight) as well as square turns and hairpins - all of which much be handled differently based on preceding turns and the speed you approach them at as well as what comes after. Not to mention elevation, terrain, and weather differences. And there is also comprehensive vehicle tuning and tire types to choose from on top of all of that :)

DiRT Rally 2.0 is not easy to play when you first start, and I have to admit I found it frustrating at first, but there is a lot of great documentation and videos online that, if you use them, will help you a lot.

The tracks, racing conditions and cars are about as realistic as you can get.  Which means, every car needs to be setup for the track and your style of driving.  For example, jumping into your new Porche 911 Ralley car, feels awesome as you wait for the countdown to start.  Then you find it is way too powerful unless you know how to setup the car for the track and to maximize stability.  Even then, it was too much car for my level of experience so I went back to less powerful cars and once I set them up found that I was no longer finishing in last place every race. :)

One other tip, the best way to rack up your credits is to enter the Daily event as often as you can.  Yes, you may find that, for many of them, you don't have the car needed to enter the race, however, paying Steam (on average) 2.49 for the car you need is a small price to pay and now you own that car.",1686982047,1686982047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

L, R: Left corner ahead, right corner ahead.

1,2,3,4,5,6: The number refers to the severity of a corner ahead. The spectrum goes from 1, referring to a slower, first-gear hairpin, to 6, which refers to a flat-out, sixth-gear sweeper.

+, -: Modifiers that adjust the above numbers slightly, giving the driver more detailed information.

: Opens and tightens, two notations that help describe an upcoming corner's intricacies.

40,50,60 ... 200: Numbers from 40 to 200 represent distance (in yards) between instructions and features on the rally stage road.

&: ""And"" represents a distance shorter than 40 yards.

->: ""Into"" represents a very short distance that requires the driver to transition directly from one action to another.

Cr: A ""crest"" is something you can't see over or a feature that will likely unsettle the car.

Jmp: A ""jump"" will make the car come off the ground.

/: When you go ""over"" something, you need to take action while going over or through a rally stage feature.

OC: A corner is ""off-camber.""

Slippy: Slippery section of road.

Grip: Section of road with a lot of grip.

Care: Difficult road ahead.

!: Caution means there's a higher-than-normal probability there could be a crash.

!!: Double caution means there's a higher-than-normal probability there could be a crash and that crashing will total your rally car.

!!!: Triple caution means there's a higher-than-normal probability there could be a crash that could kill you.

Turn off all the assists, timers, visual pace-notes etc to minimise distractions from your driving and each time you improve get that little rush of dopamine as you realise you can drive after all!

Less hardcore than Dirt Rally (1), balances somewhere between arcade and simulation for rally games.
Decent graphics (not the best optimization tough), wheel and controler support, quite a few cars and a multiplayer mode.
Downside is no FIA WRC licensed stages/cars, somewhat clanky physics (both car damage and driving when colliding with obstacles), flat out boring Rally Cross and not that many stages after all (each event has like 4-5 ""original"" stages that are cut, remixed and reversed into more stages).
All and all, still worth buying on sale and playing, definately better than WRC series junk up to Generations.
Good fun with steering wheel but not impossible with controler.

Once you're familiar with the controls and concept of the game I would recommend the following settings:

1) all assists OFF
2) manual shifting
3) turn off HUD pacenotes
4) first-person POV
5) set your FOV correctly (google FOV calculator and look for one that supports DiRT Rally 2.0)

Do you need a wheel and pedals? Eventually, maybe... probably. I myself use a controller, but I've hit a skill wall now that I don't think I can get past without these devices (I usually land in the top third to top quarter of players in events). So I do think a real sim rig is in my future. I do know there are controller players out there that are able to get in the top 1% on a regular basis, so it's definitely possible to play with a controller, but I would imagine it makes the game even more difficult this way.",1685994184,1685994343,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

one downside is that to play in career mode you'll have to be online....yeah....other then that game runs really good.
with ps4 controller it's ok, you can win a few 1st places here and there.

I do recommend getting the DLC if you want to compete online though.

One con is the fact that you have to connect to the web in order to play SINGLEPLAYER, I have personally not had issues with this but many people report having connection issues.

Game is very anti-consumer, with basically all content updates being in DLC form. Not so much of a bad thing tough, since they are optional and you don't have to pay for them in order to experience the game fully.

Game starts you off with a FWD H1, which is nice because you get to learn with a car that doesn't have much power, but gives good control. Repair costs are free on base cars, but cars that you buy you have to pay for repair.

If you're searching for a racing game that pushes your limits and demands every ounce of your concentration, look no further than Dirt 2.0. This game takes the concept of difficulty to a whole new level, delivering an exhilarating experience that will leave you breathless and craving for more.

From the moment you start Dirt 2.0, you'll quickly realize that it's not your average racing game. The developers have masterfully crafted a challenge that will put your skills to the test. The difficulty curve is finely tuned, gradually increasing as you progress, ensuring that you are always engaged and never complacent.

What truly sets Dirt 2.0 apart is its realistic physics and handling mechanics. The precision required to navigate each turn, conquer treacherous terrain, and maintain control of your vehicle is simply awe-inspiring. One wrong move can send you careening off course, adding an intense level of consequence to every decision you make. However, once you start to master the mechanics and find your rhythm, the sense of accomplishment is incredibly rewarding.

The variety of terrains and weather conditions further elevate the challenge. Whether you're battling through mud-soaked rally stages, drifting across icy tundra, or racing under a torrential downpour, each environment poses its own unique difficulties. Adaptability and quick thinking are key to success, ensuring that no two races feel the same.",1684722776,1684722776,True,4,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,False

Difficulty curve is mostly about learning to listen to your co-driver (unlike old DIRT games there's no minimap), and un-learning to keep gas floored at all times.

Bunch of tips for beginners:
[list]
[*]Starter car, Lancia Fulvia, costs nothing to repair.
[*]Do Daily/Weekly/Monthly events if you have cars for them. They pay bonus, so you'll make profit even if you're still bad and repairs bleed you dry.
[*]For a starter focus on getting to finish line in one piece. Even driving like an old lady is faster than consistent mess ups. As you get used to driving, you'll be getting gradually faster without noticing.
[*]If you keep getting distracted and making stupid mistakes, disable HUD so it doesn't take your attention from things that matter. Hood cam will help you focus on road ahead.
[*]It takes hefty impact to completely trash your car. Avoid smashing into things head on at full speed, and you'll be fine.
[*]If in doubt... slow down. Taking wrong turn, spinning out, or flying out of road will cost you a lot more time than playing it safe. You'll eventually learn, likely the hard way, which corners are not what they appear to.
[*]You can't steer or brake while airborne. Take jumps only if you're sure you'll land back on road.

It's a game that lives or dies off driving and handling, but this aspect is sus imo. The way the cars drive isn't exactly flashy... on one hand drifting and powerslides are extremely fast and easy to maintain, but driving in a straight line is extremely unstable and you will easily wipe out. But then when you do wipe out, the damage is mostly cosmetic, unless you lose a tire. Obligatory comment that tarmac sucks, but I think all the surfaces are pretty much equally flawed, its just that you don't get many mainstream racing games that focus on modeling snow and gravel.

for the sale price nowadays, with the GOTY edition generally somewhere between $15-$10, there is just so much to dive into here. benefit of patience, i guess, as this game had mixed reviews for a minute due to the DLC making you pay for things that should have been in the game in the first place. but now? yeah, it's a no brainer.

the wealth of classes, biomes, and the rush of a season playthrough where you can't repair your car between rounds is enough to engage most for a while, but the additional challenges (including what basically amounts to an entire second campaign dedicated to recreating iconic moments in Colin McRae's career) really make this a heavy, feature rich experience.

as for everything else, you already know the deal: the game is hard as fuck because it's a fantastic rally simulation, demanding patience and focus and excellence. but the rush of knocking out a clean run with your time on top is fantastic, and a feeling i generally can only find in games like Trackmania.

in my humble opinion, a racing game like this that demands so much of you but then rewards you in spades with deep content and satisfying end results (plus beautiful replays to make you seem even better than you really are) isn't as easy to find as it used to be. which makes the fact that this fantastic rabbit hole is generally the cost of a fast food meal, or maybe something a little nicer if you get the GOTY edition, all the more satisfying.",1684523746,1684523746,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Gears sometimes don't change if you release the clutch to fast. It's even understandable. While it's unforgiving and there is little to no feedback that it happened, I could live with it, if not for the second issue.
2. The engine cuts out CONSTANTLY. Unless you push gas (to high revs) and then release the clutch, you will be doomed to waiting some time for it to start again. And if you've driven cars in real life, it will probably happen again and again, until you switch to this zero-one mockery of a simulation.

+ Good graphics (subjectively)

- ALWAYS ONLINE requirement 

Dirt Rally 2.0 brings Rallying simulation to a better level with improved physics, the cars now feel more planted to the road and weight transfer has more inertia to it. Graphics are also improved but to me, the 1st game still looks better and let me explain why. 
The shading in the Dirt Rally 2.0 maybe be better but sometimes it looks to unnatural  and ""game-ish"" (a taste thing) also there's some shimmering regarding draw distance, an unpleasant effect like semi transparent meshes and  this shimmering affects the track also. I don't know how to get rid of it and at the same time not to tank performance to much. It really disappoints and affects immersion in a pretty harsh way because it looks cheap and out of place for a 2019 racing game (considering it have been patched and no more updates for it will be out) with 107 GB of space. 
The track degradation and improved physics  are really two key improvements over the 1st game and that's a great thing but I feel that Codies could've done it a bit better in some other areas like one mentioned and a better career mode played in OFFLINE mode!

It's a great package nonetheless, especially  for 5 bucks (GOTY edition). Recommend it for every rally fan out there!",1648641321,1684033120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Fun gameplay

-Beautiful locations with fantastic lighting

Vehicle upgrade system is a good idea but ends up being a mindless credit sink

So what is taking me to DiRT 2.0 and have no need to look around for another rally game?

Years after release it still looks good, with full DLC bought on sale, you get some credits to get you going and cars from almost every class so you can jump in from the start in daily, weekly and montly races.
Career mode can be hard at first, but like many have said.
Start slow, get accustomed to different surfaces, cars with different drivetrains and build up speed over time.

Community is still alive and kicking, there are clubs you can join, connect with other players and have your own championship.
You can level your staff, yes you get staff that speed up and lower the cost of repairs after you crash, and you will, open tuning for your vehicles before certain stages.
There are tons of tuning setups for all the cars in combination with all stages that are in the game.
That all costs ""money"" so that little boost you get from full game pack really becomes handy.
And this was the thing that got me to stick with the game, because with tuning a lot of cars actually became drivable, I wasn't that bad after all.

So in the end, if you like rally, and can get the game on sale, try it out.
Who knows, maybe you get hooked as well and join in this crazy little circle of DiRT players.",1681560266,1681560266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, if this game isn't on sale I wouldn't pay the full price of it. Based off other reviews it seems that the single player aspect of the game is limited due to the DLC additions. Overall the game has been fun to play even as a first timer into rally (as shown with 100hrs on record) but, there are some quirks here and there. There have been times using my G29 where the game will ""lose connection"" in a sense with my wheel/pedals and it'll drive itself into a wall. Along with the fact you have to have a rather steady internet connection to play the game. Lastly, there seems to be a lack of content in a sense of what to do, there are the challenges and such but if you only want to play solo career it starts to get repetitive over time. Other than those quirks it has been a good experience, I would still recommend the game despite the flaws but hey, it's a 2019 release game and it still holds up rather well.",1681541964,1681541964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

❌ Biggest problem this game have is pace notes they are all over the place, from straight up wrong calls to changing call form way too early to way too late in a span of ONE STAGE
❌ Problem with sound or rather co-pilot calls – changing volume and jumping from speaker to speaker
❌ No proper support for sound systems
❌ Game does not support any type of modding it’s another BIG MISTAKE by devs
❌ Spectators still can’t move even when they see wreck coming there way … maybe in 2095 devs will poses still alluring technology. Art of Rally did it WHY NO ONE ELSE IS DOING THIS
❌ Still you will be respawn after you go offroad
❌ Manu is ok but there is still many slowdowns like watching how you “rank up” your engine or those MEGA slow showcases of driver before and after every RX race/quali and there no way to skip this
➖ Damage model is still very forgiving 
➖ For me personally RX is boring, annoying and physics there make zero sense to me I hate it in DR1 and I hate them here
➖ Why not take Nicky Grist as co-pilot voice? Overall I think they could cast way more people to do the voices
➖ Still many legendary cars are missing
➖ Replay system is poor everyone should learn how to make a good one form Art of Rally

Its a STEAL and if you were going to buy each DLC individually it will cost you ~$52. You literally get all 98% of all the DLC for only $3!!!!! with the game of the year edition.

Plays really well with a controller, which is not something you can say for other titles towards the sim side of the spectrum. Turn ABS, TC and stability control to a light setting, and its a very fun, challenging game you can play on the couch. I didn't find I had to tweak sensitivity settings, but they are available. 
I love career modes, and this one seems solid, albeit a bit on the light side (light on ""careeriness"", not on content per se). But I'm just happy it's even there, you can't really expect anything from a PC racing game these days.

To really get a kick out of this game, I recommend playing with a steering wheel as it offers a much more authentic experience and allows players to better control their vehicles.

The game features several different modes such as career, a number of single-player races and also several online modes where you can compete against other players around the world. Career allows you to progress from the lower level competitions to the most challenging and important rally events in the world. You can modify, upgrade and customise your car to make it as fun to drive as possible.

Driving in DiRT Rally 2.0 is very challenging and requires precision and patience. When you play with the steering wheel, you will have to pay attention to every detail such as speed, traction, ground and other factors that affect your driving. However, the game is very well executed, so players can enjoy an authentic rally experience that is almost identical to the real world.

The game's graphics are also very well designed, with beautiful landscapes, realistic vehicle models and detailed effects such as tire tracks, dust and more. Engine sounds and other sound effects are also very authentic, making DiRT Rally 2.0 an unforgettable experience.

All in all, DiRT Rally 2.0 is a great rally game that offers players an incredibly realistic experience. If you're looking for a challenge and love authentic driving, then I definitely recommend playing this game with a steering wheel.

1/ GRAPHICS: You are joking, right? You really given up haven´t you?  How did Codemaster not only managed to not make textures and overall graphic better than an 8 year old game, but make it ACTUALLY WORSE is absolutelly beyond me. Texture wise it doesnt even stand a chance against 2009 Mcrae Dirt 2, it actually looks like Mcrae Dirt 1 made in 2007 !!! Like literally looks the same even copying its annoying bloom effects

2/ HANDLING: While a huge selling point was improved handling and dynamic tracks, i dont see it realistic at all. Somebody probably forgot that rally cars are much lighter than stock ones and handling in this game actually feels like you are driving bone stock car with trunk full of potatoes. A realistic feeling i got in Dirt Rally where 800kg car actually handled the same as my real life 800kg amateur rally car is LONG GONE. Now every car feels like school bus on slicks.

Those aren't the best aspects of it though, I would want to take note on how good the keyboard optimization is in the game. Since its a full on simulator game, it still offers viability for keyboard players and due to this, I could still set top 100 times on leader boards by just using a keyboard even with no assists! I'm very impressed on how well it performs on a keyboard which makes every other platform have a chance to conquer leader boards without needing an expensive sim set up. Overall, this is one of my most favorite racing games currently and I hope to Dirt rally 3 to be better.

As far as I know, there is no way to turn off DLC maps in the campaign, which means that you are literally unable to play single player at all unless you buy the DLC. And since the DLC maps are literally the same ones from Dirt Rally 1 that I had already put a ton of time into, I didn't exactly want to do that.

Now, it's not very expensive anymore, and I've satisfied myself just fine with the online events, so if you're into this kind of thing this game can still be a good buy. But this is just too preposterously stupid of an oversight for me to click the thumbs up.

You have obtained FF machines in the lower category, and you will start career mode with these two machines.Regarding repair costs, in the previous work, the prize money was deducted from the prize money after the tournament was over, but in this work, you can either repair the parts and pay the money before participating in the next tournament, or you can pay the money without repairing the parts. Now you can choose not to pay.The co-driver can choose from languages such as French, German, Japanese, etc. in addition to English (a man who seems to be British English), but the English woman who was in the previous work is gone.Rather than transforming the staff themselves into highly capable people, we invested in them and updated them.As for the course, the rally in the United States (gravel), Argentina (gravel), Australia (gravel and a little tarmac), New Zealand (gravel), Poland (gravel and tarmac), Spain (tarmac), snow and the stages of the previous work are so far. None (Monaco and Sweden will be added to Germany in a future update),Rallycross has some courses that have disappeared, but courses that were actually held such as the Catalunya Circuit and Silverstone have appeared, and the overall number has increased. is the emergence of Also, in the previous work, if you were in the lower category, the qualifying was omitted and you started with the semi-finals, but in this work, even in the lower category, you will be able to do it from the qualifying, so you will have four 4-lap races, and 6 laps in the semi-finals and finals. It will be in the form of doing two races.Also, in the previous game, low-difficulty tournaments didn't have rain, night courses, or long-distance courses, but in this game, it's raining at night from the beginning. Since it is a course over 10km, difficulty seems to have disappeared.Regarding the rally stages, the automatic creation that was in the previous work is gone, and the stages are pre-made like the previous work, but they are all well-crafted courses just like the previous work.Regarding the rally, elements from the previous work have been added, such as the car in front of you stopping on the side of the road due to a breakdown, and even after reaching the goal, you have to stop in front of the marshals to finish. Also, in the previous work, the sky was somewhat bright even on the night stage, and even if all the lights were broken, the road could be seen, but in this work, there is a midnight stage, and it becomes pitch black and you can't see at all, and the tire is punctured. And burst, and in rainy conditions, the grip and maneuverability are lower than the previous work, making it a severe one.As for the machine, the 2010s WRC rally car that was in the previous work has disappeared, and the new machine of the previous R5 (WRC2) will appear instead, and the Hyundai will be replaced by Citroen, Skoda, and Volkswagen.In addition, old rally cars such as Volkswagen Golf, Datsun Fairlady Z, and Citroen DS21 have been added to the GT category, while new categories such as Porsche 911, Aston Martin Vantage, Chevrolet Camaro, and Ford Mustang compete. rice field.However, unfortunately, no Toyota cars have appeared, and Japanese cars are Subaru (Group A Impreza, All Japan Rally Championship WRX, Rallycross WRX), Mitsubishi (Group A Lan Evo 6, All Japan Rally Championship Lancer Evo 10), Datsun Fairlady Z only.The rallycross machine has been changed to the latest in 2018, and the machine from a few years ago that appeared in the previous work and the previous work is not recorded, but it appeared in the previous work and was not recorded in the previous work. The Subaru WRX has been revived as the latest model.No other 21st century WRC top-class machine has appeared so far. I look forward to the update.The setting is almost the same as the previous work, but for some reason it is not possible to distribute the driving force of the AWD machine (front 30, rear 70, etc.) (other LSD settings can be made). As a new element, you will be able to select tires, and you will be able to choose from four types of tires: hard, medium, soft, and wet. If you make it softer, the performance will improve, but it seems that the tire will be more prone to puncture when colliding with an obstacle (I don't know if it will wear out in normal driving).Regarding the setting, in the previous work, if you install a device that assists driving such as traction control, anti-brake lock system, automatic transmission, the prize money will decrease, and if you do not install anything, the prize money will increase, but in this work Gran Turismo and It has become a system where the prize money does not change even if it is installed or not.Regarding the price of the machine, it is basically the same as the previous one, the older the machine, the cheaper it is, and the latest machine tends to be more expensive. Group A and R5 cars are several times more expensive than you might think, but if you win a rally overall once in Group A, the price is affordable.The RWD Group B, F2 kit car, and 2000s WRC rally car that were in the previous work and the previous work are gone, but looking at the career mode score results, a driver riding a 2000s WRC rally car appeared, and in the update seems to be added.It's a small detail, but perhaps because of the American version, in the previous version, Center was written as Center, and Tire was written as Tire, so it seems that it was changed to American English instead of British English (however, the distance is in the metric system) is used by default, and it is possible to change the metric system to imperial system in the settings).Although there are many problems, the machines from half a century ago, such as the old Mini Cooper and Alpine A110, to the latest R5, R2, and rallycross machines are recorded, and stages (although there are few countries) and races The content of the game is well-crafted, and if you like rally games, I think it's worth buying.",1679827661,1679827661,True,13,1,0.559736371040344238,1,True,False,False

I hope now that Codemasters has the WRC license we'll get something amazing coming up.

Edit: I see some people have issues with the VR. VR worked best for me by dropping fps down to 80, and I installed the reshade mod to sharpen the image in VR, which helped a lot.

The game features a variety of rally tracks from around the world, as well as a wide range of rally cars, each with their own unique handling and characteristics.

One of the game's strongest features is its focus on realism. The handling of the cars is incredibly precise, with each vehicle feeling different from the next. The game also features realistic physics and damage modeling, which can greatly affect the performance of your vehicle. This attention to detail can make the game challenging, but it also makes it incredibly satisfying when you finally master a track.

The game's career mode is well-designed, and takes players through a series of events and championships, each with their own unique challenges and objectives. The mode is engaging and keeps players invested in their progression, as they earn money and reputation points to upgrade and customize their vehicles.

The game's graphics are also top-notch, with detailed environments and well-crafted car models. The sound design is also excellent, with the roar of the engines and the screeching of the tires creating an immersive racing experience.

Dirt Rally 2.0 is one of the many games that supports VR headsets like the HTC Vive, which can add an entirely new level of immersion to the racing experience. By using the Vive's motion controllers, players can steer their virtual vehicle as if they were actually behind the wheel of a real rally car.

Overall, Dirt Rally 2.0 is a must-play for fans of rally racing games. Its attention to detail and focus on realism make it an incredibly satisfying and immersive experience, and its career mode offers endless hours of replayability. Despite its flaws, Dirt Rally 2.0 is a well-crafted and engaging racing game that deserves to be experienced by anyone who enjoys the thrill of rally racing.",1579422016,1679530169,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons: Slippery and somewhat unrealistic physics, Always online requirements, weaker force feedback, Rallycross online doesn't have collision

Pros: Slippery and somewhat unrealistic physics, all locations have an unrivaled amount of quirks and features, graphically beautiful, Sound design is phenomenal, Cars all have unique engine characteristics and handle VERY differently depending on engine layout and drivetrains, VR is native and well made, and there is a ton of content.

This game is very hard. The slippery physics punish late brakers Without mercy.

Leaving my previous comment up.



I hate to give this game a bad review as the driving physics (on dirt and gravel at least) have definitely improved but its not worth a AAA price tag.

Force feedback does not compare to its successor.

Connection to racenet has always been sketchy, it can take multiple tries to even download online events in Dirt Rally. 
Deciding to require an internet connection to play offline is a very shortsighted choice.

Worst of all however, was hitting a pay wall within 2 hours of playing the game. 90 CDN $ for an unlocked game is outrageous in its current state.

Hope to play this game someday I guess.

But boi was I wrong, after spending more than a hundred hours in the game, the sluggish UX is really getting to my nerves, everything you do in career the game needs to communicate with the server, and the process is far from fast. And worst of all, CM if you want to make it all online, FIX YOUR DAMN SERVER, my championship has been reset 3 times in the past 2 weeks, and considering how much time each championship takes, it's just frustrating. 
Do a quick Google search you'll see this problem dates back to the launch of the game, the fact that this problem has been acknowledged for so long and still exist, is just not acceptable.
It's just a shame that small problems like this constantly overshadow the amazing gameplay, it's like they had the chance to make a perfect game, but no we had to add in some flaws because reasons. I doubt this comment will make any differences, since I'm already late to the game and the game is already sold so well and highly rated, why would CM care about a comment from a single user after so many have already failed?

Edit: Just happened again, after 55 stages, only 5 stages to the end of the championship, reset again because of discrepancy between local save and server F***

Edit2: 6/23/2022 Championship reset again. 5th time since I purchase the game

Edit3: 6/26/2022 Championship reset

Edit4: 6/29/2022 Reset, am I doing something wrong? or the game is just broken?

Edit5: 7/17/2022 FYI the problem didn't just disappear, I just gave up career mode at this point, I only play daily/weekly challenges, which is still a ton of fun and challenging. What pissed me of again is that the time trial mode, you know the mode that records your best time and updates to a worldwide leaderboard, one of the only aspect that make sense to connect to server, DOESN'T RECORD YOUR TIME half of the time, imagine pushing yourself to the limit avoiding the tiniest mistake, and finally finish with a personal high score. Yeah the game just says F you and ignore it half of the time, the inconsistency is just.... Why is this even a problem codemaster?

Edit6: 2/16/2023 Gave the game another chance, started playing championship, play through 4 stages, turned off the game to take shower, came back 40 minutes later, started the game, ""championship has been reset  blah blah""... great job game.

Edit7: 2/23/2023 Man, I was so close to finishing a whole game and then it strike again... I think I'm done with the game, it's fun while it lasted, but it's also frustrating and a waste of time when problems that shouldn't even exist hits you, CM knew about these complaints but they chose to not doing anything about it.

[i]Do you need the original Dirt Rally?[/i]

DiRT Rally 2.0 lacks the HIll Climb mode (2 time-trial runs up, Driver-only) from the original game. If you'd like to take historic and more modern cars up Pikes Peak (both dirt and semi-paved) options, then you'll want the original game too.  There are a few cars in the original that weren't included with DR2.0.  The rally areas are all included in DR2.0 with Monte Carlo getting an overhaul on its surface. If I had to pick one, I'd pick this game. The original often goes on sale at the same time for a pretty low price though, so if you have the means to pick up both, I would for the Hill Climb mode.

[i]Do you need all the DLC for DiRT Rally 2.0 or just the base game?[/i]

I recommend everything. At a minimum, you want the DLC that adds all the rally areas. This is especially important if you want to play the online events (daily / weekly / monthly community challenges), or if you want to join a club.

[i]I heard the online-only format of the game causes problems - Is that true?[/i]

When the game launched, and when DLC originally dropped, there were some hiccups with the online requirement. However, I have not faced issues with that since.  

[i]What game modes are there in this?[/i]

A lot...Some highlights are below...
• Rally career mode where you pick the class of car and AI difficulty increases as you progress through seasons. Rally is a single car on a stage at one time, with a co-driver providing notes about upcoming turns and obstacles. Damage to your car is carried over from stage-to-stage until you reach a service interval where repairs can be made within a set time period. Stages can be dirt, snow, pavement, or a mixture of all of the above.

• Rallycross career mode. Similar to the above, but with rallycross.  Rallycross is multiple cars on a closed circuit, doing laps on dirt and paved surfaces. Strategy comes into play with timing your Joker lap, which is typically a long path around a portion of the stage.

• Daily / Weekly / Monthly events competing against times set by AI or real-life drivers around the world in a cross-platform environment.

• Time Trails - Pick a stage and a car and see where you rank against drivers around the world or your own ghost.

• Clubs - Join an existing club or start your own where events can be scheduled, stages and conditions can be set. Aside from community events - This is my favorite mode as it allows my extended family to set up events where we challenge each other, and are able to play as our schedules allow (rather than trying to all be online and available to play at a given time).

• Colin McRae challenges - Try your hand at scenarios against AI competitors. There are a lot of these to do. Some are 1 stage, others are multiple stages. You may need to finish in the top 4 with a heavily damaged car, or you may need to come in first even after getting a 10-second penalty, or you may need to finish a series of stages without damaging your car at all. You can set the difficulty in this mode.",1676857844,1676858320,True,18,0,0.710795700550079346,0,True,False,False

I played NFS around 200x and tried some Collin Rallies back then then Dirt Rally and now this.
(I never learned to do the nice rally tricks like handbrake hairpins correctly i will definetly learn to do now with this game;-))

The game is so beautiful and rich. 

Very Positive:
The whole atmosphere from sound to graphics gravel hitting your mudguard to Co Driver sounds (a lot better than Dirt Rally and in more native languages now)
Hope i can play this on VR someday.

(negative for me since i only want to drive:)
(positive for others who want more sim):
- you have to do setups on your own, no workshop ""Download great Tuning setup"" like in Dirt Rally
- Read the guides or videos and do it on your own.
- I have to buy or build a SIM RIG now ;:_)
- Wheel support (Fanatec) worse than ""old"" Dirt Rally on Linux Mint (19.x)
-Online Racing is not working out of the box
-EA Forums for ""problem research"" are ""locked""

Oh i love this game if only it worked well with Fanatec Wheel out of the Box on my Linux Mint System.
Proton as recommended.
Soft/Hardware Setup:
Fanatec DD Pro Wheelbase + GT Wheel with pedals.
Linux Mint 19.x (Maybe on newer Sys better i might change the review).

Overall: Strong Recommend worth the money i think i will play this for some 100+ Hours.

When I first started I was on controller, and even then was having a blast. (I recommend turning off all assists, and as many hud options as you can. They can distract from driving well and immersion.) 

Then I got a wheel, a logitec g920. And will be trying a g923. The feed back is amazing once ya get It tuned. Stock settings are a bit over the top when ti comes to force. In a later review I will post what settings that  found I like. One feature that blows my mind if your wheel supports it is the game's SOFT LOCK system.

If an old car, that had far more rotations in the wheel you will have to use the same exact ratio. Well on new cars that is not the case. And per that, each car is set to it's real life steering set up. This extra bit was so fun to experience.

New update on this review I made months ago, 

on even moderately great hardware like for exemple, a R7 3700X paired with a GTX 1060 6GB, this game runs like a breeze, I can record wonderfully my gamplay using the dedicated hardware encoding on my gpu while having the game run in 1080p, with the near maximum graphical options of this game ticked. Truly, what I'd call a very lifelike looking game, 

Congrats Codemaster, not only have you made my days with this game, (which I now can't exactly let go of any more), you've outdone yourself with the coding / optimization aspect of the game. 

can't wait for (possibly) a DiRT Rally 3.0,

The game is great at letting you get behind the wheel and driving cars from every generation up to 2019 R5 cars. The career mode is bare bones but does its job. However, the constantly cycling daily, weekly, and monthly challenges give a great chance to compare yourself to others. They also vary from single stages in daily challenges to multiple events across up to 5 different locations in monthly challenges, so there is good variety. On the negative side, the tarmac physics feel like the gravel physics with the grip turned up. They are still fun once you understand how to drive them. I recommend using toe in on all cars on tarmac. Tarmac does not match the other surfaces in terms of quality. Luckily only 2 locations are full tarmac and one is about half. The other negative is the AI in rallycross. The AI will react to you to attempt to block you to such an extreme degree. You can intentionally take a horrible line, the AI will block anyways and then miss the corner because of it. When the AI is behind you it is much worse. They do not react to you at all and will simply drive through you if given the chance. Tracks with joker splits near the start line will cause all sorts of collisions when the AIs and the player don't all choose the same route. 

Overall, I still highly recommend the game especially if your main interest is the rally side. It may be hard at first depending on your rally sim experience, but give it some time. Take it slower to learn and not crash, then start to send it. Don't restart every time you make a mistake and remember, ""In order to finish first, first you must finish.""",1674353999,1674353999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar

4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The graphics are top-notch and the gameplay is incredibly realistic. You'll feel like you're really behind the wheel, dodging trees and jumping over rocks. The controls are tight and responsive, making it easy to navigate through the treacherous terrain.

But don't let the realism fool you, this game is also a hoot and a half. The crashes are so satisfying, and the sound effects will have you laughing out loud. I especially love the way my co-driver yells at me when I take a turn too fast. It's like having a real-life rally partner, minus the yelling.

One piece of advice though, make sure you have a good steering wheel and pedals setup. Otherwise, you'll end up spinning out of control and crashing into a tree (trust me, I know from experience).

Overall, Dirt Rally 2.0 is a must-have for any rally racing fan. It's challenging, funny, and incredibly addictive. So grab your helmet, rev your engine, and get ready for some dirt-slinging action!",1673780306,1673780306,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

and for that reason alone, probably, they can't give this thing away on Steam. if you wait for a sale (it's nearly always on sale), you can score this AND the DLC (which is key; that's where you get the snow levels) for maybe 5 bucks USD. that's criminally cheap. 

every racing fan should give this a try at that price point. it's so different from everything else I've tried in a racer, and DEFINITELY from something distributed by someone enormous like Electronic Farts.

I bought this originally with only an Xbox controller and the game was unplayable imo. could not get steering or traction with it. So i bought a Thrustmaster t300 wheel and pedal setup and that made this game good. i was having loads of fun. the feeling of the ffb in the different environments is wild. ice to asphalt to snow back to ice you can really feel. I just bought a VR headset for myself for christmas and immediately loaded up DiRT rally 2.0 and WOAH. It is absolutely incredible and if you like these games YOU MUST TRY IT with the wheel/pedal vr combo. You will gain time. Major time. I went from 15th-20th place to 5th-1st with a couple hours and im absolutely stuck now. If you have this combo already this game is an absolute MUST!

Use a steering wheel and a VR headset and you'll be rewarded with the most epic feeling there is.
No other Rally game comes close this is as close to reallife as you can get.

I managed to place 39th globally on Argentina, and I am proud of myself.
Not too mention I used a RWD car and you can really feel the weight and force coming from the rear when you corner.

At first I was turned off by how incredibly difficult and punishing it can be, but I found my enjoyment of the game dramatically improved once I turned off the progress bar on the left and the time differences at each section. Instead of getting frustrated 4-8 times throughout each stage, I simply drove as fast as I could without crashing. Funny enough, my times started improving after that.

Although I played a lot of this game on a controller, the other thing that dramatically improved my enjoyment was adding a racing wheel and pedals.

As far as the game itself, I just have to specifically call out the sound design. It's just spectacular, and the way your co-driver's voice changes based on the bumps you're going over or your speed, it often feels like there's a real person right there calling out pacenotes.",1672694124,1672694124,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At about 20 hrs you really start to internalize the co driver commands and directions and things start to flow. 

I enjoy this game, but it's definitely for those who value a high degree of realism. It takes a lot of focus and time to even become playable at the lowest level. At higher levels, a small lapse in judgement will cost you a 40 race series.

Dirt Rally 2 is the most broken generic nonsense I have encountered on steam in a long time.
Hopefully the developers will listen to the community and fix the game, and put post release development in it, and by post release development I do NOT mean DLCS. We do not want those.

What is wrong with this game?
- The sound cuts out mid track sometimes, making it not possible to normally finish the stage.
- Boring 5 long 6 extra long tracks that feel generic, where is the bad camber?
- Mirrors are always black
- Copilot is the most generic uninspiring garbage ever
- The AI seems broken, way too fast at times, and then super slow on other stages, very inconsistent.
- Boring generic steam achivs

I could go on and on and on..
After DIRT4 I kinda lost hope in this franchise and unless they actually will fix this game, they have lost a long time Dirt / Colin MCRae fan. GG

2022 EDIT:

After buying all DLC on a sale for about 10 pounds and actually having access to the game, I have played it a bit more.
The cars are very floaty and there is no real connection to your environment.
The black mirrors and sound cutting out are fixed.
A large part of the tracks are still boring 6s and 5s, sometimes a 4 tightening if you are lucky.
After purchasing the DLC, some steam achivs do not unlock anymore.
I think that if you get the complete game and DLCS all for 10 pound on a sale, it is worth it.
But it still is certainly not better than DIRT Rally 1, that has been delisted from steam by codemasters.
After EA purchasing codemasters recently, I think it is probably best to forget about Colin McRae / Dirt series.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

What they did over previous rally games is make everyone extremely slow so that you try to take courses more conservatively, you can't endlessly restart and cliffs are ramps that flip you every time and hills are magnets, if you coast 10 inches off of a hill you will get sucked down.  You instantly get reset and penalized with time which means you have now lost the race, same for flipping.  Making everyone drive conservatively might sound cool and realistic, but it sucks the fun right out of the game.

I'm also sick and tired of rally games that think they are smart and clever for starting you off in the most absolute garbage, trash, snail slow 1960s euro-italian 4 speed piece of ---- that they could find, like how every time you beat a rally game it is your first time playing so they have to ""teach"" you again.

I'm slaying opponents in Rally Cross by a factor of 30 seconds in a 5 minute race (because the car was made this millennium) but I can't drive the starter car you get in Rally for more than 20 seconds without flipping it.  I'm literally going to go make some youtube videos on rally games and show you how flip happy the physics in this game are.  Also, if you so much as tap a chicane (supposedly made out of bales of hay) your lights will instantly break, this is instant game over if you are at night.  They mount the lights on the nose of the car.  WHY is THAT in the game?  Mount them on the top of the hood.

Game's a joke and I would refund it if I could, but at least it was pretty cheap as I got it on sale.  I have been playing Rally games for 25 years and I have never played a game as flip happy as this.  Utter trash.",1671214831,1671359459,False,3,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

What to expect:
A challenging rally game with stunning graphics, lots of content, and overall a fun experience.

Cars:
There are a lot of cars from the original rally cars from the 60's, to group b all the way up to rallycross cars. 
They look, sound, and run great.

Tracks:
There a lot of tracks in the base game featuring gravel, concrete, and tarmac. They all have their characteristics whether it be mud, logs, bridges and many other hazards. The tracks are interesting and fun, some can be very technical and have a ton of turns and some have more straightaways to get higher up on the leaderboard.

Driving:
My one problem with the driving is how it feels like you are driving a flying carpet compared to a rally car. There is not much grip. If you can get used to this style, driving is good and is a lot of fun. Powerslide through turns and drifting around hairpins feels great.

DLC:
There is a lot of DLC and every single DLC is great. Where it be new maps, new cars or the Colin MCrae expansion pack. I suggest you buy all 4 season passes when they are on sale. as you get everything (but 2 small dlcs) for around 10 dollars.

Modes:
There is a career mode which you can win courses and championships and get money to purchase better and faster cars. There is free mode where you practice your skills on tarmac, water, jumps, and gravel. There is a historic mode where you go through the different eras of Rally history, you can race for your Race.Net club, custom championship mode and finally the FIA RX championship mode where you partake in Rally Cross championships.

Pros:
Lots of base content
Stunning graphics
Great DLC
Great sound design
Good modes
Fun challenge

Cons:
Driving physics.
Most DLCs are small and should be free.

If you plan to buy any DLC, i recommend waiting for a sale, as the Deluxe Edition (Base game and all 40+ DLCs) costs 10€ in sale.

You could argue that its a greedy move of the developers and that's hard to deny, but in that case, its 6 more countries many more cars for 5€ more. The Sweden DLC for example, initially very unforgiving with narrow roads, is now more fun as you're not constantly stuck in snow. What i want to say with this is that they did not just copy paste the rallies into part 2.0, but arguably slightly improved them.

Everything in this game just seems way more polished, the UI, the feeling while driving, so i can absolutely recommend this game, EVEN FOR CASUAL PLAYERS.

Liked it so much that I bought this GoTY edition for $10 and it was totally worth it. It's a racing sim so don't expect Need For Speed type gameplay. In-fact getting around a corner when you're first starting out is an accomplishment in itself. It works well on controller, but I imagine a wheel would be even better. The physics are really well done, cars feel weighty and different from each other, but not overly heavy and hard to control. Newbies should start out with a 4WD car and gradually switch to RWD as you learn how the physics work.

Personally I liked Rallycross the best from Dirt Rally and Dirt Rally 2.0 really expands that aspect. Not sure what content does and doesn't come with, but this game has many more tracks and soooo many more vehicles available for Rallycross than the first did.

I also really like the new way the repair system works in Rallycross this time around. It felt like you had way too much time in the first game and it was just an extra menu to go through between races. This time you get half the time, 30 minutes, and multiple ways to fix the car. You have a standard fix which is a pretty detailed standard repair. You have a replacement option which takes the longest but completely replaces the part, these usually take 20 minutes or more of your 30 minutes so use it sparingly. You have a 'quick fix' this time which is much faster to do but is basically a jury-rigging for the part meaning it will work for the next race, but need replaced before the next race. This all adds up to a much more detailed and in-depth repair system where you're having to make tough choices and make sacrifices, which the first game lacked except in the most hardcore of crashes.

I still have yet to play any mode besides Rallycross but I'll try to update the review when I do.",1669871193,1669871338,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But this is in my honest opinion the most approachable racing sim out there and I love it. And even though the game allows you to set it to be easy on you: I much prefer the more difficult presets. These cars feel great, when you do every shift yourself, when you drive without aids, when you try to do the ABS on your own. And even with just a controller and no force-feedback trough a steering wheel, the game gives you plenty audio, haptic and visual aids so you know how your car is doing.

My only huge gripe: the co-driver.

Don't get me wrong. He is - like everything else - a night and day difference between the already very solid co-driver in DiRT Rally 1.0. He has much more useful calls about the road geometry and he speaks them clearer and with more engagement so you are less likely to tune him out in the heat of speed.

But: his timing is sometimes just jarring. I've seen calls for a 4 turn (so something you kind of have to brace for, because it is relatively tight), that are more then 6 seconds ahead of the actual turn, witch only slows you down, because you do too much anticipation and there's also at least one call for an unseen turn 2 (so a tight corner you can't anticipate without a call) right after a long straight, that is 2-3 seconds ahead the actual turn giving you no time to react.

Wrecking a run because of such things is really frustrating and I'd love to have the option to fine-tune these calls during a trial ahead of the timed run.",1669722086,1669722086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't care much for the fluff and presentation of a Forza Horizon. I like relatively technical driving that feels responsive and realistic, with varied and complex tracks. It hit the mark on each of those aspects.

Plenty of options to fine-tune the driving experience and difficulty, Rally-Cross to ease you in before you crash into a ravine 2 minutes into your first attempt at rally... More than enough content as well.

The weather-effects (rain, sun, reflections) are so cool that I'm always waiting for the next rainy stage! This is also true about the night-stages, before Dirt Rally 2 i didn't like the night stages, because somehow i felt blind, despite the working reflectors. Here in DR2, the night stages are more visible, and also look better, so they are not so dead-playtimes than in DR.
The control is easier than in Dirt Rally, without any assistance is easier here, than with full assistance in Dirt Rally. Codemasters certainly decided to develop a game for a bigger audience, not just for the rally-experts or other masochists. So if You want to play, not to struggle with the physical laws, Dirt Rally 2 is here for the normal people too! :)
(But after 30hrs of play I see now, the control is not easier, it is the same, just the stages don't have those funny obstacles (rocks, logs, parking cars :) in every inch near the road, which were whacked our times in Dirt Rally, but the bad news is, the cars and the stages are insanely fast, so without obstacles, the reach of elite level is a tricky task! And as your speed grows, those tricky-funny obstacles will come back on the edge of the stage...
I read the negative reviews, and somehow i understand them, they are not lies. Either me think that DR2 is the perfect sequel of the legendary Dirt Rally, but how can You give thumbs-down? Please thumbs-downers, think again about how reasonable is to give thumbs-down to a game which is the greatest rally game of the present? Legitimate criticism is right, but a thumbs-down for this game is a strong exaggeration. Especially when we know, thumbs-downers will play this game in the next years too, as the thumbs-uppers will.

Pros:
- Graphics are wonderful, beautiful in bad weather and also in night stages. Sun-rays with rain are unimaginable before You see this beauty! :)
- Engine sounds - incredible 
- Rallylike long slidings - which were not available in DR1
- Thrilling speeds (really thrilling!!!)
- Each of the 6 countries have different road surfaces, and the difference aren't just in the colors and textures, but their grip, and the run on them are palpably different.
- The DLC locations - the classics - are wonderful! 4-5 EUR for each of them is nothing.
- Lifelike price for the mistakes in career mode - expensive repairs, irreversible terminal damages because of the not unlimited restarts
- Better gravitation effect than in DR1 - no moon gravity (edit > sometimes there is moon gravity)
- Wonderful replays
- Great to see the Class Leader's position on the progress bar

Cons:
- The RaceNet requirement in singleplayer is incomprehensible. I lost several good results because this ""connection failure"". Moreover RaceNet had an about 15 hours meltdown, while the players couldn't play with the Career mode - and this is totally unacceptable if i see my 115 EUR bill for this game+deluxes.
- My gamepad doesn't vibrate. After the big FF update, everything was fine, my gamepad almost blowed up, but after 2-3 weeks, it doesn't vibrate at all - only on 1 stage in 30 - that's why i know my gamepad works fine.
- Lack of english female assistant! ( How rude from Codemasters that they give us female pilots, but don't give a sweet female assistant voice who would guide us in the hard lefts and rights! )
- You won't see your car's whole appearance until You start the rally. You can see only the front view of your car, and You select a paint in this view, and later You'll regret it when You see it from behind - for hours until You complete a championship, because You can't change it between the events.
- Restricted options in volume settings. Why can't we lower some sound types below 50%??? This was the same in DR, and i hated it. I always have to ALT-ENTER and adjust my system sounds to DR1, and now I have to do the same with DR2... this is an unnecessary restriction.",1551827525,1669309273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been 3 days and 12 hours later.
OG Vive with lens mod makes this AMAZING. I understand there is the WRC game but with no VR I'm not even going to bother. The sound/ notes of the engine are crisp and tells you exactly what the car is doing.  I use a gamepad and this is really important the the sound of what the tyres are doing is my force feedback, giving the ability to apply more power or brakes. The graphics using VR on a 10900k, 3080 OC'd are excellent on high and I'm able to keep a steady 90fps with some dips at very rare and odd times (possibly background apps).

Lots of favourable reviews here but I really hate the feel of the cars in this game.

Most of the time they over-steer at low speeds.  Some cars feel like there's no weight to them at all and skid for miles, especially when driving slower.  

I've come to dread tarmac and cobbles!

I'm giving this a negative review because there's no feeling of satisfaction, I'm just terrified of the bizarre quirks of each of the cars.

This asshole is just infuriatingly inconsistent with his calls, most of his announcements are just wrong and vary from stage to stage, sometimes you can go flat out through corners announced as 5 or 6, sometimes they are baaaaaarely doable in 3rd gear and are more 2nd gear corners, too many irrelevant calls ""slow unseen right at tree two around bale"" and lack of important information, for example to keep to the inside when a cliff is on the outside. Weird timing aswell, sometimes he announces corners literally 10 seconds before you approach them, sometimes, especially in combinations, he announces the first corner, so you think great, left 4 no problem, and he is just silent while you approach it, but as soon as you cross the apex you see a left 2 following up instantly, which he THEN announces when you're practically entering the corner already. 

even the original dirt was 10 times better with this, you simply cannot rely on the copilot in this game period. and that is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad for a rally game, i would have beaten the crap out of this douche if he would do that in real life.

I've been playing in VR, and it's been a blast. the wheel feel definitely seems a little... i dunno. arcadey in some respects. it definitely feels like a magic black box of input going in and then making the car do certain things, like left-foot-braking just seems to flip a switch and the car magically wants to get sideways with ease, whereas in RBR, the physics seems to more precisely simulate each wheel individually and the results vary a bit when you do things like LFB or blip the clutch to get some oversteer. 

the wheel feel also feels kind of like it's in syrup... the FFB is strong, but it feels sort of sluggish and like it's over-damped. RBR has more jerky and sudden feedback to reflecting rough road/path surfaces and sudden forces like catching ruts, whereas in DirtRally2.0, everything feels very uniform and soft (still strong/firm, but like, mushy and smoothed out). 

still a very fun sim, and maybe an 8/10 on the realism as far as feel. the car tuning and setups are good without being totally overwhelming. weight transfer feels really good in the wheel force feedback, and it feels like it's easier than in some other titles to sense your speed on the track and stay within a reasonable speed for the space and conditions... some games, it feels like you just instantly go waaaay too fast without realizing visually or through the feedback in the wheel. 

I bought all the track/car DLCs in a bundle on sale, but haven't played most of it yet... but with all that, it should be a pretty nice bit of variety. base game probably leaves a bit to be desired though. Definitely easier to get into than some other sims as far as just installing, booting it up, and playing. didn't have to muck around with tons of troubleshooting to get all my controls to bind correctly or anything like that (although did have to set the binds up front).",1666982201,1666982201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm just gonna make short review
Steering:
Dirt feels more realistic in car control and it's so damn beautiful for simulator enjoyer. Every car got their own characteristic and somehow feels different. While WRC every car feels the same. The only difference is only on the Power and Grip. If you gonna say oh it's because they use rally1 car the latest rally car. No you were wrong there is some other car that you can use as direct comparison like Subaru impreza group A or the group b monster. Every car in WRC just feels grippy AF and this make it easier and more less realistic but not necessary a bad thing.

Stage
Even though  most of the DIrt stage is locked in DLC when I play the stage it kinda feels the same. Of course some stage got their own unique signature like high speed bump of rally finland or tarmac sliding of rally Deutchland, but overall most of them kinda feels the same. Mean while in WRC every stage feels like got their own thing. 

One more thing that i want to discuss about the stage is Dirt rally feels more brutal. When the co driver said don't cut it means DON'T CUT. In WRC you still can cut few corner or find some sneaky shortcut.

External Factor(Graphic, Sound, Car):
More car in Dirt 2.0 and each of them feels different in every ways(Control, Power, Technology, Engine sound) the sad part is no historically accurate livery not all of them some car still got historically accurate livery like mcrae and 2000cc class(You can fix this with mod)car but the older one none and no latest Rally1 car like no 2010-Now rally car. There are some but in R5 class not the same as rally1 car. In WRC they got all of the historical and rally 1 car but in the end they all feels the same(engine sound,Control). 

In terms of graphic Dirt 2.0 is better

So overall I wouldn't say WRC is bad and dirt is 100% objectively better. In my opinion if you just a casual gamer that just wanna play rally go for WRC. But for people who appreciate realistic driving thing or simulator enthusiast go for Dirt 2.0 like no joke Dirt Control is much much harder than WRC

Overall I gave this game 9.25/10.
If only they add rally1 car and more unique stage like safari rally. i would give it 10/10 but nonetheless very worth to buy

I couldn't believe how accurately the in cockpit view of my steering wheel mimicked exactly my wheel mounted to the desk.

Dirt Rally 2.0 was the rally game I came back for after the series went full arcade (firework phase). It went back to the roots and with good graphics to pair. Just before buying I got my first VR headset, I quickly noticed that VR + controller doesn't really work that well so I've invested in my first racing wheel as well. One of the higher end Logitech wheels + pedals and shifter. Mounted them with some wooden-build additions to my desk. Made sure my office chair was held in place by placing a table behind it. The true starter-setup.
Fast forward a full year later. I now own a racing seat, upgraded my VR-hardware. I've invested in Bhaptics suit + arms + head...

I'm in love.

Dirt Rally 2.0, with Trueforce ánd Bhaptics is something else. Is it realistic? Nah, it's a game. But in real life I drive a Toyota Aygo, so really anything that can move faster than my real life car is a joy. Add some turbo injectors, four wheel drive and the idea that you can drive 200km/h through a forest and magically stay on track if you listen to your co-driver VERY well.

In VR this game is a whole different thing. I'm driving in full 5K 120 fps and I'd say this is about the resolution you want before you start seeing too much detail that will break immersion a little. I'm currently running the game near highest settings and I can still see the grass load in, a hundred meters in front of me. I currently do experience a glitch where 1/5 runs my headset disconnects (???) for a fraction of a second which can totally kill your run. More so annoying if trying to stay in the top 100 of the month. A glitch I only experience in this game.

I'll not go too much into depth about the realism of the surfaces you drive on. It feels realistic enough, yet it equally reminds you it is not. The snow+ice event in the mountains is a good example how a good racing rig will make you feel when you have grip, and when you lose it. Switching terrain feels a little off at times, but it is good enough. Sim-racing is getting better and better, but we aren't at the level reality provides just yet, so I'm not demanding it.

A side-not is that it is a little mandatory to buy the entire game + all DLC or the game will remind you constantly you don't own all the DLC. The DLC provides you with extra cars that allow you to try a couple of disciplines you might not have enough (ingame) money for.

Here comes my biggest gripe with the game, which is both a good and bad thing at the same time: progression. It is very slow. Racing a montly event will easily take up a couple of evenings. Reach the top 100 and you generally earn back three times what you've invested in repairs and maintenance. That is, if you are like me and you still flip your car every now and then. But you don't crash your car anymore. You just witness how a pretty car gets banged up to the point you start to doubt your driving skills... but you are 30 seconds below the fastest time, which is much better than the 3,5 minutes behind when you first start this game.

I've completely stopped playing the single player events and started to push myself to do online events most of the time. I've set goals to improve my leaderboard rankings, I've pushed myself to drive a little slower so I can finish every run. I've strategically upgraded my crew so I can get away with driving a little more aggressive when I feel like I can.

My biggest issue with this game is that all the maps are hand-crafted. Which is a good thing for a proper rally flow, but equally, I always felt like this game gets close... but equally pushes maps forward with dangerous parts your co-driver doesn't even mention. Which is something that started to bother me more and more. Callouts that don't really match the scenario. This happens in real life as well, but not calling out having to stay on one side because there is a blind corner straight after a jump, or not mentioning sticking to the left side of the road because the dirt mounts on your right will crash you completely... small details that would have been mentioned in real life.

The addition of VR + haptics make this game feel like you are there. My headset has noise reduction so I don't hear the vibrating steeringwheel + suit either. Driving over cow-bars has never been as satisfying as in this game. VR makes this game even better. In rally seeing depth is even more important to judge the curve of a corner or to spot a detail that might mess you up later. It will equally scare the crap out of you the first couple of times you crash.

So is it worth investing 1000-2000 euro's to enhance your racing? If you aren't looking to upgrade to a 10k racing rig but would like to experience something that comes as close as possible, without actually being the same hardware? Yeah... it is worth it.",1664255934,1664255953,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently I bought a Steering wheel, as Rally 2.0 is quite difficult with the keyboard. So far I have to admit the wheel helps a lot and the game is really challenging, which has been said more than often.

What I find most anoying is fiddling with the over the board possibilities of car settings. I don´t have a degree as race engineer and I don´t plan to become one. And I doubt Rally 2.0 really helps if I change my mind.

And speaking of the car settings - as there are so many options to change - why isn´t it possible to change the tire pressure?[hr][/hr]

I grew up with the Dirt Rally games. The first Dirt Rally game I ever played was Colin McRae rally 2004. And I loved it. Compared to modern games today, it's graphics certainly don't look good now. But at the time they looked great. 

I've been comparing Dirt Rally 2.0 against it's direct competitor, WRC 10. And there are some differences. WRC focuses more on the management part. You're not only a racing driver, you're also the manager of your own team. Winning and losing events directly influence you and your team. It's a lot harder to maintain a well balanced bank account, and the team might quit working altogether. 
Dirt Rally 2.0 is more friendly, as it leaves the management completely behind. It directly puts you behind the wheel, if you win or lose, there's no consequence. Upgrading/buying new cars goes a lot faster. 

Another difference would be the track design. WRC's tracks don't look as good as in Dirt Rally, but they're much more fun to drive through. They have more scenery, more unique buildings. The textures aren't as good, but it doesn't really matter when you drive past them in a 150km/h race car. 

The physics in both games can be a bit weird though. In Dirt Rally, you often have too little grip, while in WRC you often have too much grip. In both cases, hitting a small bush can rip off the entire bumper and shatter your headlights. In both cases, caution is still advised in tight corners and pitch black darkness.

Dirt Rally also put more focus on the FIA rallycross events. They're great fun to do, fairly competitive, even against ai. 

Another thing Dirt has is that it lets you complete daily/weekly/monthly challenges, in which you try your best to compete against other players. Not directly racing against them, but with the fastest times. The quicker you are in an event, the higher your reward. 

In the end, Dirt Rally is easier to get into. WRC is still a very good game though. However because of the reasons I've named, WRC isn't as new player friendly. You'll focus more on management than racing, and it can get confusing quickly. It's more styled for those that are into a full simulation of rally, while Dirt is more casual.",1663505839,1663686169,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

How can vegetables even get a license to drive, nonetheless RALLY. The AI off the start in RX (RallyCross) will do whatever is necessary to overtake you in the first 5 seconds of the race, even if that means pit-maneuvering you, or slamming into you forcing you off the track. It's miserable, and occurs regardless of AI difficulty. It looks like its intended to ""make it more realistic/difficult"" but frankly it does neither. It's just annoying.

In Open and Clubman, its very manageable. If you're half decent at driving, you can get a way better launch and be out ahead in 1st or 2nd with no worries. One you hit Pro is where the water gets murky. Basically every start, if you don't choose to be slower and take a lesser position, you WILL get spun out. I've tried multiple cars (sedan, hatchback) across multiple car manufacturers and it makes no difference. It essentially comes down to RNG and the track you're on, that determines whether or not the AI will spin you out if you're pulling ahead off launch.

I'll have a wonderful start: in Position 3, I overtake Pos. 1 off the start bc better car/launch- only to be spun out for no reason. Which quickly turns into a 6 car pileup on the track as every car on the line slams into me. Other times, ill be in Pos. 1 with a great launch and have no trouble at all- in the end, the AI is brain-dead and has no sense of sportsmanship to not play dirty. 

Aside from RX; standard Rally offers a variety of new locations, and some new VERY challenging ones- no complaints there. Not to mention new cars to pick from for Rally too! The Daily, Monthly, and AI challenges are also unique and interesting. Overall a great game, but the AI RUINS it for me. 

Edit: I feel like this review is a bit unfair to the game as a whole, overall I really like Rally 2.0; the physics experienced in rally and the cars being driven is very fluid and well done. Just steer clear of RX, the AI is infuriating.",1653846779,1663198017,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Each track has something to teach you for sure, and there are a ton of them to master.

The Rallycross DLC is totally worth it in my opinion. I love the rallycross career mode. It's fun mastering a relatively short course and getting the best time possible.

Dirt has weird traction mechanics: for most of time the road feels like butter and not only for gravel surfaces but sometimes for asphalt. The lack of grip might be enjoyable for those who prefer drifting but it is far from what you would expect from your car in reality. (Well I would not expect my car to make 180 on flat surface just by turning left on 15 kmh). But yet it feels rather natural and even pleasurable on nordic maps with a heavy snowfall.
Other notices:
 + Xbox controller works fine
 + Graphics and effects are fairly good, so are maps
 + Big variety of vehicles (81 to be exact)
 + No need of Origin
 + It is possible to play short gaming sessions just by doing daily quests (each around for 10 mins)
 - DLC policy is cheeky
 - Risk of losing progress in singleplayer event due to internet connection
 - You can't press ""recover your car"" until you find a perfect spot where your car won't roll.

[b]Before I get into any detailed info about the review, I'd like to put in some pros and cons of 2.0.[/b]
---
Pros:
Great graphics, nicely vibrant, everything blends in very well, resulting in pretty stunning environments sometimes.
Decently optimized, although older graphics cards and CPUs will stutter if you have the game set too high. My 1060 does the job.
Far bigger car variety than in the first game. Tuning is easier to understand. Physics feel better aside the occasional bruh moment.
New maps, some of which are still pretty great (New England for example). Maps themselves also have more varied twists, turns and terrain types.
Cons:
Rampant DLCs (if you didn't buy the GOTY edition, they WILL annoy you).
Always-online is a big con. If you're playing on the train like I do sometimes, then you're shit outta luck, as you need a stable connection to even do a career race. Speaking of which..Codemasters' servers aren't really up to par and sometimes you gotta reset five or six times to even get your race rewards.
Downright insane initial download - 110GB isn't exactly small for a game like this, even in 2022. For comparison, my Dirt Rally 1 download is **35GB**.
The game no longer receives any updates and you're probably risking losing the capability to play it entirely in a couple of years.
---
DiRT Rally 2.0 is a game I have always wanted to get, but I was always too poor for it and had a bad laptop, so I wouldn't run it anyway. That recently changed, and the second I put the game on my wishlist, the GOTY edition popped up on a 76% sale. Fifteen bucks? Sure, I'll have a spin.
2.0 is much more varied than the first title in some regards, but also takes a few steps back. The aforementioned DLC rampage is quite frankly annoying, and I wish Codemasters wouldn't try to wring out every penny from my bank account. The final update was recently announced, and it was 15GB to introduce one car, one nationality and a bugfix that didn't seem to fix any performance issues on my end.

Sometimes the servers shit the bed and you lose your rewards. Sometimes you can get them back. One time I lost a solid 1.2M credits thanks to the servers borking. Great stuff. I don't think Codemasters ever gave me those back.

So why the hell do I play it?

Cause it's fun?
Okay, I'll elaborate. But first, you should get something in your head, and that's two things:

1) Trying to get first place in DR2 is not that important. Enjoy yourself.
2) Fastest times aren't gonna help you if you destroy your car halfway through an event. [b] Consistency is key. [/b]

Yeah, the game will frustrate you sometimes. Not exactly a bad thing - rally races work like that IRL as well. When I was little, I kept watching WRC and I saw some pretty nasty crashes at times. This applies to 2.0 as well - one small mistake and you're flying off the track. Yeah, you can reset your position sometimes, but that mechanic is just as janky as in the first game. Sometimes the game still thinks you're moving a tiny bit and doesn't let you reset, and that takes up another five seconds, and even on max skills, the game sometimes decides you should get twelve seconds added to your split time. Not much that you can do about it.
Sometimes the physics also feel kinda weird - you can be scooting on a perfectly flat, smooth, asphalt road and suddenly, the physics disengage and you're flying off into the nearest tree. It happens. 
Some cars are also great for newer players (Opel Adam R2 and the Subarus), but some are just deathtraps that I wouldn't drive even with a drivewheel setup. Yeah, I use WASD and a PS5 controller. Sue me. Porsche cars are fucking deathtraps, and I'll never touch my Rally Spec 911 again. Hell, just don't touch Rally GT unless you're really good at tuning, cause those things are borderline undrivable stock. With Group B it's far less brutal somehow, even though those were historically actual murderwagons. Try tuning the BMW M1 if you can get it. It's fun. And the Peugeot Group B one.
---
Would I recommend 2.0? While Steam only has yes/no, my actual decision will be to [b]consider the game.[/b] If it's under 20 bucks, and that's the GOTY version, then sure, try it out. If it's the standard edition under 20 bucks, then don't bother. The same goes if both the versions are above $20. 
[b] Rally's hard, and so is this game. [/b] If someone calls this the Dark Souls of racing games, I will actually lynch them with their sack up first. Don't ever use that comparison ever again, and especially don't use it in front of me. This game is MEANT to be hard.",1600425738,1662390871,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

I've loved Dirt Rally 1, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, GRID (the original), GRID Autosport. I've loved game after game from Codemasters, but this is the only one I really despise. 
Not because the gameplay is bad, I love it. Every minute that I [i]played[/i] has been incredibly tense and fun. I love Rally, in general, and I would love this game.

But the always online DRM prevents me from playing the game. Each minute I have spent playing a race, I have spent ""retrying"" to connect to the bloody servers. On my record, at this moment, I have 6 hours. I have completed 5 tracks.
I loved those 5 tracks, and when the game is working, IF the game is working, it's amazing.
I'm not playing multiplayer, I don't really care to. I'm not starting an online league, or a racing club, because I don't want to. I'm trying to play singleplayer, pop on my favourite music and enjoy the game.

But that's rendered impossible when the race ends with a ""connection to server failed"" screen preventing me from starting the next race. My internet connection isn't down, my internet connection isn't interrupted, but whenever I try to play this game, it just doesn't bloody work.

The co-pilot's pace notes are a definite downgrade, and it's not the fault of the voice-actor who is fine. It's the notes themselves, and that's on the devs. Takes some getting used to and they're definitely not as properly tuned and timed as in the predecessor. Regardless of your timing settings you'll get some compression and decompression that will leave you flapping in the breeze, and there are some instances where too much info is given about flat-lefts while the looming sudden right turn is sprung on you late and with little emphasis. Also, I prefer ""right three"" to this game's inverse terminology of ""three right."" Seriously.

Another step backwards is that they removed the ability to change cars between events during career championships. This removes variety and options and forces monotony into the mix. Why the hell would a game developer want to force such a restriction?

Physics feel nice, maps are nice, etc and so forth.

By the way -- does any of the core player base REALLY like the rally-cross aspect of these games? Who among us wouldn't prefer more actual rally and/or hill-climb content (the hill-climb content which was tossed aside in  2.0) in place of the rally-cross content?

I'm not into street racing games all that much, and I'm old, and therefore I appreciate it when games are not too childish.

I like the feel of the game, the user interface is very neat and clean. The graphics and the physics are amazing, the cars are beautiful. It's a lot of fun to drive with the sequential manual transmission, even though I play this game with a controller. I love that the game features real life rally course locations which feel real, and they are real (other motor sports games give little thought to this and thus feature fake and made up suburban cities that feel like ghost towns and look awful artificial, like nobody lives there).

This game features an offline play mode which is a very nice feature that I appreciate a lot. Just recently I had to spend a few days without an Internet connection and as a result I learned about the offline play modes which let you create your own private championships, which was cool.

The only thing I would complain about are that some of the DLCs cause the loading screens to take longer and they often cause game crashes. For example, I bought the Monte Carlo Location DLC and the Porche 911 RGT Rally Spec and they both worked fine. But then I purchased the Skoda Rally Fabia (a DLC car) and suddenly every loading screen would take a much longer time to complete and the game crashed about three times in less than a few minutes. So I removed the last DLC that I had purchased and everything worked fine again.

Overall I really really like the game, it's a lot of fun to drive the historic rally cars, and I've been playing nonstop.",1623002309,1661449295,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a casual-ish sim racing game enjoyer. I play with a wheel, pedals, stick and a VR. From all of the sim racing games I have played so far (AC, ETS2, this one and probably some others), this one is the best one by a long shot. The intensity this game makes is incredible and makes you feel alive as well as enjoy that fun of racing. No other game keeps you on your toes as you fly through the snowy Swedish roads with you Porsche 911 RS at around 180 km/h or when you stop thinking and just flow in the tracks of Poland while shredding the gravel in your Citroen C4 WRC. The intensity, the complexity and the variety really makes this my favourite sim-racing game.
The graphics are fine in my opinion, the immersion makes up for them. As when it comes to handling - seems pretty real-ish(I have had pretty wide experience with different drive-trains on different surfaces), though you can never really tell unless you have driven the same cars and make your own conclusions from there.
This game will test you, it will make you mad, happy and sad while you struggle to tame the beast these cars are in the game. This game is not for weak sissies, that are looking for a flashy racing game with drifting and high speed races. This game is for true racing enjoyers that are looking for a challenge with high reward.

When I wrote it I was using a logitech g29 wheel and was very dissapointed with the ffb. The ffb effects in DR2.0 are very harsh and ""square edged"" and in combination with the g29 gear driven motors it did not feel good. I'm now using a dd wheel with software filtering options and have after much tweaking found a way to make the ffb feel better. 

As for the game itself I've realized we gotta be grateful that we have a rally sim that can scale from controllers on low end pc's (and the steam deck) up to full motion rigs with dd wheels and vr support. There is nothing else on the market that can compete.

At the current pricing the game is absolutely worth it, recommended!

Old review below:
The force feedback in this game is horrible. No feeling of the tarmac, dirt or snow. Very far from being a simulator, this is an arcade game best played with hand controllers. Very limited cockpit view options. FOV is a slider from wide to narrow, not in degrees - I mean come on!

Graphics look good, but this doesn't feel like driving a car at all.",1585300029,1659523079,True,0,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

TL;DR:
Pros: CAR GO BIG FAST UNTIL IT FELL ALL OF THE WAY APART, BEST VR GAME EVER 10/10
cons: I've actually had to learn a bit about cars in order to fully enjoy this game. ... Neat, I guess?

This game (or dirt rally 1), in VR, with a full-rotation, force-feedback steering wheel, is the single-most immersive ""holy shit I feel like I'm actually there right now"" experience I have ever had from a videogame in my life.

It's the force feedback that does it. In other games? Firing a gun in VR feels like a toy, grabbed in-game objects have no weight... but a steering wheel? A steering wheel fights back. And in this game, you can feel the gravel beneath your wheels. It's a hell of a time.

[Years-Later Edit: Got a computer upgrade and, now that I can run VR at a solid frame-rate, I am suddenly a hundred times better at this game. And it is so much more fun. Car go fast beep beep, braking is optional when you tilt your car forward a bit in Tuning because all-wheel-drive go brrrrrr. How am I suddenly decent at this game, I still don't know shit about cars, 20.5 out of 10. Still my favorite racing game; I think the key for me is not having to memorize tracks, because the co-driver tells me what to do.]",1625259096,1659425029,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Legit game with good graphics.
Realistic Physics engine
Beautiful tracks ( some are DLC exclusive)
Variety of cars 
Career mode and set of additional events such as Colin Macrea career mode (DLC) 

Cons 

No newbie friend ,as even the practice track (dirtfish) is shite and it barely has anything that represents a real track, 
I wish they added a reverse option like in Forza Horizon 5. Certain tracks have tough corners where if you miss your car is too damaged to continue. Although this adds more realism to the game.
They stopped updates for the game almost a year ago. Although I never ran into a bug
Some of the best and beautiful tracks/cars/events are DLC's exclusive and hence stop your from ever participating, including some of the weekly events.


Conclusion- Great game but has many areas they can fix in the next one. Even though there are no updates anymore your will be busy honing your sim racing skills with this one. 

The only thing to look forward to however is beating top players on the leaderboard. Nobody really buys the game to play the career/ events 

Sadly, Dirt 3.0 is no more as codemasters is focusing on a different project.

One thing I dislike about Dirt Rally 2.0 is in Daily Challenge, you only have one chance. You cannot restart Daily Challenge. Please, at least make it 3 tries / chances. Only one chance is insane.",1657939583,1657939725,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like track sims too, but I think on a track usually the nuances of surface and handling are hard to convey through a game. This is one reason stage rally is so good for computer games. You can really see and feel a lot of what's going on in the various surface types, degradation and weather conditions.
Handling is incredibly well translated from reality to game according to me (I don't really drive real cars) and more importantly according to real life rally drivers!
Your input's have a lot of effect on the handling. From how weight transfer changes grip of the tires and to how throttle and break control allows you to go sideways with relative ease.
Going sideways in a car is more addictive than you might realise, and this is one of the finest ways to experience it without serious environmental impact.
You can enjoy fine control of legendary rally cars whether you are playing with a wheel and pedals or a controller. Some even play with a keyboard, though I find it hard to believe it can be half as much fun. I play with controller now but have also played the game with a wheel for a while which was a lot of fun!
The locations are plentiful, varied and quite challenging. I promise you will never get to a point where you can complete them all perfectly without any issues. There is always room for improvement, and all have their own feel and character to their handling that you can learn to master through hours and hours of practice.
And what keeps us playing this game for months and years you might wonder? It is the the way in which the game has implemented community curated rally events called ""Clubs"", and the living breathing discord community and live streams. Especially for me the Barrel Rollers community where rivals are also the best of friends and also like a family with generations of rally enthusiasts.
NB!: This is a game where you should definitely get all the DLC as there is a lot missing in the base game. Many locations and even classes of cars.",1657904005,1657904005,True,3,0,0.533926427364349365,0,True,False,False

its a nice balance of consequence that hardcore sims provide while still being accessible. you can be competitive with a controller if you give it the time and respect it deserves (i still enjoy the wheel more).

a lot of people have valid complaints about how they released the dlc cars and lack of content with the base game, i bought the premium whatever edition when it came out so i cant relate to those issues.

its one of the finest racing games i think i have ever played, the sensation of speed and ease of access is outstanding, its not all great. gravel is far superior in feel compared to tarmac, which feels clunky at times. 

the graphics are downright beautiful, although are slowly becoming dated. it could perform a bit better for what it is, i could make small complaints here and there but ultimately it has enough polish and replayability to warrant a thumbie upies

i give it a frog score of... a prestigious and never before seen 420/420.

690790,118856856,76561197970674314,0,14,362,0,362,1657896534,"I have always loved driving games from the early 90s Test Drive and Indycar to the phenomenal Papyrus NASCAR games around 2000. And of course the very first Colin McRae Rally which quite frankly blew me away. Until then I only know the terrible RAC Rally videogames and CMR was huge leap in quality. The modern iterations: aka DiRT series on the other hand didn't make quite the same impression. I'm jut not into this show driving style. 

By no means I am a skilled driver, although over the years it became a hobby of mine to go the different tracks and take courses to learn how to handle race cars. I have to admit some basic instincts with real life implications were developed by playing these games. So... based on my limited real life experience the physics of DiRT 2.0 is not as realistic as I would have hoped. My all time favorite the Richard Burns Rally, a nearly 20 year old game still blows this one completely out of the water. 

But that's OK, I could still have fun even if the handling or rather the response of the car is surprising sometime. Feels too light and unpredictable. I could still enjoy the hell out of the Rally Cross World Cup if the AI wasn't rubber banding and way too aggressive to be realistic. In some ways handling resembles the 2011 Milestone release WRC 2: FIA Rally World Championship. And you know what? With all of its flaws I had more fun playing that...

I could still enjoy the Carrier Mode if I could just restart my stage every time after making a mistake, but I can't, because there are only a handful of restarts available, after that you have to exit and reload the last save. That my friends is big, big game breaking issue. Why? Because I simply don't have time to sit through the long loading cut scenes. I don't have time to go through the shake downs and meticulous setup of the car. I just wanna drive and enjoy. Which means I am learning the stages as I go, no practice. But the game forces me to waste time. And that's where Codemasters have dropped the ball.

After about 6 hours of gameplay I think I gave it a fair shake. And it just doesn't seem to get any better. The beautiful graphics nowadays simple doesn't cut it. That's just putting lipstick on a pig.

This is the top of the pyramid. Cars that challenge you, [daily/weekly/monthly challenges]  require you to embody the car. Drive first person. Become the car, to master the terrain you're needing to conquer ;)

This game has so much finnesse. You need to tweak everything you possibly can. Focus, focus, learn, cockpit camera, then as you learn the tracks, your view of the road can change. You need to be on the level of the road to really drive as you think you can while staying in control.
ASSISTS: ON: CONTROLLERS? YES:  - as you learn, you can go down in the level of assist , but i think most people who do this in real life want to walk away from the event rather than dying there, 
I keep TC on  in real life too? so why not use the advantage, if you deem fit. After all, it's Off-road, :/ This is always going to be preference,. because everyone plays with their own hardware :) HAVE FUN> That's the motto, while you are learning this.

You need to be racing to earn money, if you drive like a hooligan, you will pay from your pocket, unless you use the Opel Astra 1.6, very awesome anyway,; Every single car is a unique experience too. Their sounds, the richness of everything,

This is the kind of game where holding accelerator down all race is not viable, as it will end up in your terminal car failure. It requires focus to complete these technical courses.

Tons of content, so much love and joy from playing this game
Incredible physics models, 
Great driving mechanics - Lots of assists - to keep OFF :) 
I like the co-pilot directing the course, it helps sync the images, with the track :)

Dirt Rally 2.0 feels lackluster. The improvements from Dirt Rally are minimal and it is still missing many features that are seemingly standard in most other racing games. After playing RBR for quite a while, I struggle with the weird physics of Dirt Rally 2.0.


I'm going to state up-front that I recommend Richard Burns Rally to anyone who wants a realistic rally experience.


Dirt Rally 2.0:

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

Looks fantastic. Great lighting and high detail.

The tracks are great. Beautiful environments.

The pacenotes are great. Clear reading with realistic sound and pacing.

Setting up controls for a wheel wasn't very difficult. It recognized my wheel immediately as well.

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

Physics are severely lacking. This is one of the biggest flaws with the game. The asphalt physics are notoriously bad. The cars feel like they're driving on ice. It doesn't feel like the tires are there or doing much of anything, giving you limited feedback. Certain tricks are unrealistically forgiving in their timing and difficulty to pull off. This may be a more arcadey sim game, but it sure acts like it wants to be a hardcore sim.

No replay recording/replays in general are terrible. Limited control over replays, have to use an external recorder if you want to save it.

Bloated game. 100gb file size because all dlc is installed even when you haven't purchased it. Nobody needs their drive space taken up by files they can't even access. This also means it's possible to hack the game and get the stuff for free because it's already installed.

Limited selection of tracks. While the tracks that are available are well made, there aren't many to choose from. In games such as this, you WILL eventually grow tired of doing the same maps over and over again.





Now on to Richard Burns Rally with the Rallysimfans mod installed.

[h1] Cons: [/h1] 

The graphics haven't held up all that well. It's game from 2004, so comparing it to Dirt Rally isn't really fair. That said, it doesn't look that bad for its age.

No menu built-in navigation using a racing wheel. You can only use the keyboard for navigation. However, [b] JoyToKey, [/b] a free to use software, can fix this. You can bind all the necessary keyboard keys to the buttons on your wheel and navigate the menus just fine.

The unmodded base game can be a pain to deal with and doesn't have amazing physics.

The pacenotes aren't great. They can sound somewhat robotic, and are lacking some information, as when the game was being developed, they tried to make it easy for anyone to understand.

Some parts of the game feel clunky.

The car sounds aren't very good. Some of them are for the wrong vehicle, and the volume can be weird.



[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(All of these refer to the modded version of the game)



Thanks to being abandonware, this game is free.

Rallysimfans mod is easy to install. It does everything for you, including installing the base game and mods. The guide on the site is easy to follow. The mod gets frequent updates, and is always improving.

The best physics of any rally game. The dirt feels perfect, and the tarmac is better than any other rally game. It feels like it should. It's not absolutely perfect, but it's a huge step ahead of the other rally games you can get.

Many, many cars. There is a wide selection of cars to choose from. While some have better looking models than others, they all drive great.

Enormous quantity of tracks to play on. Rallysimfans adds new tracks frequently. There is a huge selection of tracks, with more being added often.

My racing wheel was recognized immediately by the game. I didn't need to do much tweaking with it,

The rally school is great for learning how to rally.


TL;DR

Get Richard Burns Rally via the Rallysimfans.hu mod. It is a much more realistic rally experience, and it makes up for its flaws tenfold with what it does well.

The only gripe I can think of is that the physics engine becomes a bit subpar when flying around on tarmac but it isn't game-breaking considering the vast majority of the time, you'll be racing and sliding around on dirt or gravel.

With just about every memorable rally car in history as well as a wide berth of locations that span around the world, this is Codemasters' Magnum Opus.

I play using a Valve Index at 120hz and the feeling of flying blindly down a dusty track only knowing what's coming around the hill or corner because the guy next to me is reading it off of a piece of paper is just incredible. I got this on a sale and then upgraded it to GOTY because I loved it so much. I highly recommend you do the same if you don't know if you're going to like it or not. If you buy the GOTY afterwards you get all the DLC's just not another copy of the base game. Easy.

The graphics look great in VR and the sound quality is top notch which is important to me when spending time in VR. I want things to look and sound good because I find it to be more fun that way. The championships against AI are easy at first but the more you do the harder the AI gets. You'll go from winning events like I was to rarely winning any anymore. Why? Because the sim is quite difficult! But that's what makes it so fun. Between Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, and this, this is by far my favorite just because of how much fun it is. I'll include some controller settings to make things a little easier.

There is a career championship mode or you can create your own custom champtionships. There's rally racing which is mostly rural rough terrain tracks with lots of curves and hills and there's rally cross with are tracks that have tarmac and gravel. There are a bunch of single player modes you can play I don't need to list them all you will be pleasantly surprised by the variety. But best of all are the daily, weekly, and monthly challenges. They offer a wide variety of events with various types of cars and maps. I like playing these because it takes the decision making out of the equation for me.

You get credits for fininshing events. You can use those credits to buy cars, upgrade your team, or repair the cars you bought and roughed up on the track. The sim comes with some free cars you don't need to pay to repair and you can use those to accumulate more credits to buy better cars with when you're just starting out.

Dirt Rally 2 is one of the must-play VR games in my opinion. Nothing comes close to the feeling of flying and drifting down those tracks knowing you're potentially one mistake away from flying off a cliff! But you know what I love most about it? 

It reminds me of the 2008 fiat ponzi financial crisis and the housing market crash. There were huge areas in Florida where housing projects ran out of investment capital. There were these ghost towns of roads with street signs and no houses where the roads would just end and vast seemingly endless fields would begin. Me and my friends would drive out there in my Toyota Camry and tear it up in the muddy grass similar to how you drive in this simulator. When I first played I felt like I had some experience in this area :) Placing #6 on the leaderboard recently confirms that.

I initially wasn't very interested in dirt racing, but I heard good things and picked it up. It sat in my library for a while, but what made me actually download it and give it a try was it seemed to be the only game that had good VR with realistic manual shifting with an H-shifter.

You'll notice there seems to be only two reasons that people do not recommend this game.
1. You have to be connected to the internet, even if you are only interested in the single player modes.
2. The game is over 100GB because all the DLC is actually included in the game, you just have to pay to access it.
While I agree that these are both pretty abysmal practices, they have very little to do with the actual gameplay itself. [i]Even people who don't recommend this game admit that it is really fun[/i]. I'm not going to tell you that you shouldn't play this game just because of these two things. If you're able to look past them, give it a shot!

The one thing I will mention is this game mentions it has online PVP, which is misleading. If you're expecting to race against your friends, that's not something you can do. You are competing against each other's times on leaderboards and daily/weekly/monthly challenges.

Overall, this game looks incredible, feels amazing, and is just fun to play. If you have VR, this is a staple racing game for it and I highly recommend it for that. It's really immersive.

The graphics are great (not amazing, lacks a few things), the handling is good, even on controller. wheel support is a bit lacking and VR sometimes is weird.

7/10: too dependent on online connection (see other people's reviews talking about connectivity), graphics are good but physics are janky and inconsistent. I would put them in sim-cade territory with RNG slapped on, rather than anything near a proper simulation; with crashing forces (car stopping/spinning) being inconsistent, especially with Scotland's bushes and fences in every location. steering on controller has a set delay that a wheel doesn't have.

Recommended for:
Casual players despite the difficulty compared to full-arcade racers. 
And for hardcore players who seek something enjoyable with enough content for 200+ hours (including DLC and active clubs)

EDIT: after playing RBR for a while, and coming back to DR2 for a club event. DR2's physics feel even worse;
-the cars turn incredibly slow, and setting up for the turn results in either a very grippy corner, or sliding all the way through due to physics inconsistencies
-collision bounciness' inconsistency is incredibly clear, a nonexistent bump flipped my car but driving into a tree with my side does very little sometimes.

DR2 feels allot like an arcade game now, with the car turning on a pivot, the over-exaggerated physics and overall weird and hand-holdy controls that feel like the car wants to steer everywhere on its own (made even worse with a controller, but makes complete sense on a wheel)

Searching for something that feels like an actual simulation? i'd recommend the RichardBurnsRally installation from rallysimfans.hu; which objectively holds way more content than DR2+DLC.",1582690879,1656430122,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great rally experience; lots of cars; great physics and handling; lots of locations; be sure to buy the game of the year edition to get all DLC.

The good:
1, The graphics looks good on PC. Running on high settings with a gtx 1660 super and manages to hold a steady 60 fps
2, Good competition on the leaderboards for the most part
3, Good car variety if you own the DLCs
4, Controllers are usable and viable and not a utter joke unlike other sim type games.
5, A good variety of rally locations. It may not be as plentiful as WRC, but it is serviceable.
6, Good competition in the leaderboards.
7, A good rage game if that's your thing. 
8, The game is usually on sale, which means this game is dirt cheap for the most part.
 The bad:
1,The career mode is terrible without any meaningful rewards upon completing the masters championship. I've done masters multiple time on the ps4, and it was not worth it except for the challenge.
2, Bad co-driver call-outs at high speeds. If you drive fast enough, Phil may miscall his pace notes, which may lead to an accident.
3, Misleading call-outs at certain corners in the stage.
4, The DLCs are mostly Dirt Rally 1 content rather than original content for the game.
5, Not enough content if you don't own the DLCs. You won't even get snow locations without the DLCs.
6, Inconsistent suspension reactions. No matter how you tune the suspensions and dampers, it will always feel like a throw of the dice when you land from a jump or hit a bump. Your car will either land perfectly or bounce off the road and into a direction you didn't want to go in.
7, No meaningful progression since everything is unlocked from the get go in free play with Career mode being the only mode with unlocks, which is made almost useless since everything is in free play. It is only useful if you like running community events.
8,Poor damage model. The only severe damage you'll ever encounter are punctures, radiator and engine overheat, and the terminal damage when you crash head on into something. Even hardcore damage is a joke.
9, No grid girls. Hey, rally events still have them in real life, Codies. 
10,Floaty handling in tarmac. It feels like Codies never learns from their past mistakes.
11, Rallycross AI cars have different handling and weight. They will always grip the ground as if they're a gt3 car and you cannot ram them off the road,but they can do it to you which will lead to you throwing your controller out of your window.
12. Some serious bugs remain unresolved to this day, such as the milky rain bug and infinite loading.

 Overall, this game is a mixed bag. I would recommend it if you're a fan of cheap rally games,but the negatives are more glaring than the positives. I'd suggest getting this on a sale. I'd give this game a 7/10. If there was a neutral recommendation on steam, I would've picked that instead of a thumbs down.",1656246317,1656246317,False,2,0,0.51723480224609375,0,True,False,False

And what I got, was a New, Unique, and frankly Breathtaking take on the survival genre. This game is incredibly nuanced, with an extraordinarily deep, Intelligent, yet still challenging story, that will play with your emotions at every turn.

What this game feels like, is as if you gave an expert team of developers an infinite budget, and no time constraints, and told them to make what they want. Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

Everything from the sound design of the cars, damage physics, and graphics of the environment is second to none. Some might say it's arcady compared to other rally sims, but it certainly gives you a great rally ""feeling"" which even if you've got the most badass sim racing rig, I'd still argue that feeling offers more realism to the overall experience to those looking for it.

Be prepared that it's different from most racing games in the way that it's not designed for you to win 1st place every time. I think this is why you see so many people out there talking about how hard this game is. They expect 1st place wins like every other racing game where you can just hit restart over and over until you win.. you cannot have that expectation here. You will frustrate yourself rather quickly if you do. If you learn to be happy with your own progress and learning curve, [b]drive conservatively[/b] like it's your own car, learn to listen to the calls, and not slam into every tree and off of every cliff chasing 1st place, I promise you will find immense improvement in your skill and times, along with tons more fun playing Dirt Rally 2.0.

..On the other side of things, I'd never tell you not to listen to the rally legend himself. If in doubt, flat out ;) good luck!",1654576234,1654576234,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's a very difficult game and you'll crash a lot but that's the nature of rally racing whether it be real life or virtual. Those moments where you have a perfect run give such a level of satisfaction that you'd need to play to understand. 

It also has rallycross which is probably much more fun with people since the AI is ridiculous. They will sacrifice their position in the race to ram you off the road. When you try to ram them, it's like their cars weigh much much more than whatever you're driving. There's a little bumping in IRL rallycross but it's not supposed to be as egregious as it is in this game, it's like playing Wreckfest sometimes.

Definitely recommend a wheel. I played on controller for a good while but it's only good at teaching rally racing concepts. Actually performing things like heel-toe braking, Scandinavian flicks, or driving almost any RWD car will be borderline impossible on controller.

This is the best rally simulator you can buy right now hands down. Beam.NG may someday take it's place but that's going to be a long long time from now.

Pros:

1. I think that the game's physics are amazing, I never really found myself being betrayed by the game's mechanics, the engine or even bugs, for that matter. After playing for 83 hours, I can't really recall myself seeing any bugs, the game runs very well almost at max settings on a gtx 1080 with antialiasing enabled.

2. There are a lot of really well detailed tracks and locations, as well as cars, all of them look really authentic. Almost every country feels distinctive, apart from maybe New Zealand and Australia, for obvious reasons. And the cars have high quality sound and detailed cockpits, which is pretty surprising considering how many cars are in here.

3. 'm also fond of the soundtrack, especially that menu music, always makes me excited to open up the game and to hear that chill tune. This isn't an important part of the game, since you can only hear music between the stages, and in the main menu, but still, it deserved a passing mention.

4. But what I like most is the racing wheel support. I think it has been implemented here about as good as a sim racing game can, really. I've played some other racing games, and I really haven't found myself enjoying driving as much as I have Dirt Rally 2.



Cons:

1. I consider the game's biggest hindrance being not able to play offline, as indicated by other reviews, which I don't really mind, but I get why people are upset about it, and thought I'd warn you as well about this major detail.

2. This game is lacking some features, like being able to save replays and photo mode, as well as the UI being confusing at times when creating a custom championship for example. The last one is subjective, but the first two are a shame, since the game actually looks really beautiful, and being able to screenshot yourself drifting through a corner, or saving your replay of that one race where you've aced all of the corners.

All in all, I can say that this is probably one of my favorite, if not favorite, racing game for now. And you should really consider buying it, while the sale lasts till June 6th.",1653770742,1653770742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is absolutely gorgeous fun to drive. It looks great and there are a great range of cars and tracks. I still feel it is a bit too heavily focused towards the hardcore masochist gamers but some small changes make it more fun for more casual gamers like me. I think it is worth getting the Game of the Year Edition as there are significantly more cars and locations.

[h1]Standard Edition vs Game of the Year Edition vs original Dirty Rally[/h1]
I bought the Game of the Year Edition when I saw the massive wall of DLC and concluded the base game must be a hollowed out shell of a game. Looking at the details now this is not true. The base game has more content that the original Dirt Rally but I do think the Game of the Year Edition is the better option.

The standard game rally locations are all new. Most of extra ones in the GOTY Edition are revamped versions of the ones from the previous game. The standard game does not include any snow or ice rally locations. 2 of the rallycross locations from the previous game remain in the standard game and the other one is included in the GOTY Edition. The hillclimb mode is completely gone which is a shame. I’m not really sure what the point of the free roam location is. Given it is based round the DirtFish rally school I’d speculate it was intended to be a tutorial level but it never got finished. The extra locations in the GOTY Edition integrate into career, time trial, custom and FIA World Rallycross Championship modes. They integrate into the daily, weekly, monthly events but these are heavily weighted to the standard game locations. These locations do not appear in the historic rally mode.

Most of the cars from the previous game are are still present. A few have been replaced with slightly different versions but a few have fallen by the wayside such as the Hyundai i20 and the Mini Countryman. With one exception, all of the extra cars included in the GOTY Edition are new classes of car not in the standard game at all. These are:
[list]
[*]Group B (RWD)
[*]F2 Kit Car
[*]Up to 2000cc (These are late 90s early 2000s cars)
[*]Group B (Rallycross)
[*]RX Supercars 2019
[/list]
The extra cars in the GOTY Edition integrate into career, time trial and custom modes. They integrate into the daily, weekly, monthly events but these are heavily weighted to the standard game cars. The extra cars do not appear in the historic rally or FIA World Rallycross Championship modes.

[h2]Other[/h2]
As well as the new locations and cars the GOTY Edition also includes a bunch of extra starting money. All of the extra cars and a handful of cars from the standard game are unlocked from the start. This is nice as it really cuts down the amount of tedious grinding you have to do to save up for new cars and gives a lot more variety in the early stages of the game. The GOTY Edition also comes with a series of challenges based round the career of Colin McRae. These are really nice as it adds variety,  these challenges are not just about winning, they include goals like finishing without taking damage or finishing above a certain position when starting with specific damage.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
I think the extra tracks and cars are well worth getting the GOTY Edition. The more difficult question is should you still buy the original Dirt Rally as well as this game? I’d lean towards yes, it is not as polished as this game as this but you can get many more hours of gameplay out of it. Also I can see that these games are not going to appeal everyone so if you can pick up the original game for cheap in a sale you can save yourself the money of buying this one if it turns out to not be your cup of tea.

[h1]Review[/h1] 
My comments here are through the lens of what I thought about the original Dirt Rally which was that the driving experience was fantastic but it pandered too much to the hard core gamers and lacked the glue to make it into a great game.

So let’s start with the good. I cannot overstate how much fun the driving is in this game. There are so many different classic cars that are noticeably different to drive. In this game the weather and tyre wear seem to have a more significant effect. The tracks are nice and varied. The game looks and sounds gorgeous. The achievements are a bit more varied than the previous game which makes it a bit more fun to collect them.

Career mode was the main focus of the previous game but in this game I barely touched it. It is still too difficult and focused on grinding to unlock the tuned up version of the cars. It is however improved from the previous game. The levelling up of your crew is a bit nicer. The daily, weekly and monthly events are now done with the same cars you use in career mode. This makes the grinding for career mode much less tedious as you can have multiple events on the go at the same time and switch between them. Because you are racing against other people in daily, weekly and monthly events it is a much more level playing field. If you do a relatively smooth run with a few mistakes you will finish in the top 20-25% of a daily challenge against other people but dead last against the AI. It is way more satisfying to finish in the top 100 on a challenge against other people that it is to hopelessly thrashed by the arbitrarily difficult AI. There are a lot more of these events than the previous game too.

I really like the addition of Historic rally and FIA World Rallycross Championship modes. For me these were where the most of the fun was to be had. You skip all the tedium of career mode and can just get behind the wheel of all your favourite cars but with a nice sense of progression as you unlock more events. I just wish this section of the game was bigger and featured more of the extra content of the GOTY Edition.

A few other minor quibbles. I didn’t like the new co-driver I found him too animated in his speech, I preferred the previous less emotional, consistent directions but I got used to it. Still no Toyotas, I realise this is probably due to some boring licencing agreements but in my head it is because someone in the team is still holding a grudge from the 1995 WRC. Being able to set the name that appears on the car is a nice touch but why not make this work with the realistic liveries as well? In a similar vein it would be nice if the cars had decals specific to the different rally locations. I still think it would be nice to have more of the assists from Dirt 3 like the time rewind to make this accessible to more casual gamers. It would also be nice to have a bit of AI in the spectators. It does break the immersion when you crash and the spectators just stand there indifferent to their inevitable demise. I realise getting them to all jump out the way like in Driver San Francisco is a bit of an ask but they could at least react to the car.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
So there are a few things I would have done differently if I was in charge of this game but overall this has to be one of my favourite racing games.",1653248966,1653249001,True,60,1,0.858288347721099854,0,True,False,False

And I fell in love!

This was one of the few racing games I really enjoyed. Every little attention to detail, from surface degradation to the shaky voice of your co-driver, is just PERFECT. This title certainly is on par with Richard Burns Rally, and the GOTY edition is worth the price (if on sale). Playing this on keyboard was certainly a challenge, but if you are a die hard rally enthusiast... this is the game for you.

10/10 with no doubt in mind

I could no longer win races with a damaged car because I could not replace parts to get the car back to 100%.  While I understand there is a time limit to fix the car between stages so you can only fix what you have time for is a part of real life rallying, not being able to get the car back to 100% after an event is finished is not.  This is the only issue that I had with the game, other than that, the graphics, sound, physics and realism are excellent and it would have been an excellent game if damaged parts could have been replaced when a car was not competing in an event.  I bought the game soon after it was released and stopped playing it a week later because I couldn't fix my car.  I played the game over a year later and while I had more options to replace some of the parts, I still could not get the car back to 100% and was extremely disappointed and never entered another race and deleted the game.  If Codemasters think that gamers would prefer to race damaged cars that cannot win races because in some fucked up pipe dream of theirs they feel that it adds to the realism, then as far as I am concerned they can take their server hardware and take turns shoving it up their asses while they all smoke crack.  The fact is that race teams will replace anything and if necessary everything on a car to get it back to 100% when the car is not racing in an event and that's a cold hard FACT.  If Codemasters want to make a 100% realistic rally game, then they should allow players to fix their cars properly, just like race teams do in real life.  This fatal flaw made the game unplayable for me after about 17-18 hours and I will never buy another Codemasters game ever again because they could have very easily fixed this very obvious flaw, but chose not to.

EDIT: I Have been enjoying this game as you can see by the hours that I have currently logged. I would however advise against getting it at this stage in the game. The main campaign has some worthless online requirement which means if their servers are down then you can't play your offline campaign? 

That's a great and incredibly grifty way to force players to buy new games. While I've been enjoying DR2.0 I'm not getting any more.

EDIT: I've logged 57 hours since my last review. If they kill single player in this I will likely uninstall and if the next Dirt Rally game is grifty won't buy. If it's not a grift I'll re-approach it then. But my hopes are not high.

I am so torn about this game, having recently got back into it I both love it and want to strangle it if that was possible.  As a driving game you can just drop into to have fun this and the original Dirt Rally are my favourite driving games.  I don't pretend to be any good though.  

Yesterday I came 6th in Germany the first time I've got points in 2.0.  Dirt Rally lots of times or even most of the time but not as easy in 2.0 as yet.  However this morning the games server failed and when I went back to my career it wiped my career out totally.  So however good the game is I can't recommend it because it relies too much on the internet and screws up.   I did nothing wrong and I have good fibre internet.  The original Dirt Rally used the internet as well but in what must be hundreds of hours I never had a problem once.

Prepare to go into the trees more times than you can count but the joy of nailing a section or a stage is incredible. 

Sound design is top-notch and graphics are good as well. This is where Codemasters uses their expertise in creating casual simcades like the F1 games and the regular DiRT series comes into place where eye and ear candy take precedence over physical accuracy. And it is where a lot of the simulators falter. This game also has great creature comforts like automatically detecting my (very common) Logitech G29 and I can go through all the menus using the wheel (unlike for example Assetto Corsa which still expects you to use your KB/M).

Multiple ways you can enjoy this game, either play solo against bots, play the daily/weekly/monthly challenges or join a club where you race championships together.

Your career money?
$0 unless you're connected. 
Just finished a time trial race?
Be prepared to wait for 3 minutes for it to ""Connect to server"" if the server is down.
Wanna restart a race?
Same. Wait for 3 minutes if server is down.
Start the game?
Same. 3 minutes if down.
Starting a race?
Same. 
Going back to main menu?
You guessed it.

What kinda bullshit? How dumb is this implementation? Won't recommend this dumb game. You're better off Arr-ing this game if you can't even play it when their own servers are down.",1649752853,1649752853,False,11,0,0.593086779117584229,0,True,False,False
