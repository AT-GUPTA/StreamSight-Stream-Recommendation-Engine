Im editing this comment i made basically shitting on this game. i 100% believe this game and the publishers/creators deserve all the backlash that comes their way

ive gotten to kill all of JL. i have yet too kill Brainiac, i cant even get a chance to kill Brainiac. Every time i launch the game i get some glitch where the Menu wont load up, none of the Characters pop up. I can hit continue story but when i load into Metropolis I get nothing but a black screen. Its been bugging out for days and when a game Ask for more then $60 for BASE game I and probably so many people expect better execution. Not even mentioning the fact that skins in this game r $20 or more YES they look cool, some atleast but that is way too much for a skin in a VIDEO GAME. This is a really bad look. 

The missions are all the same concept wise. the enemies are very Basic and super repetitive. Thats ok, theres nothing wrong with that. but your missions have too be fun and i can assure you, they are fun but for almost EVERY MISSION. its Insane to think someone would love this for years+ of content.  

MULTIPLAYER AND THE SERVERS. This isnt no helldivers 2, no ones trying too connect to this game and i can say that for certain. Ive sat in the Game for an hour with open lobby CONSTANTLY SEARCHING  for someone too join but no one ever did. This gets into my other point where if No one is playing with you and no one is GOING TO BC EITHER MULTIPLAYER DOESN'T WORK OR UR GAME IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. So why in gods great name do i have to CONSTANTLY BE CONNECTED TO A SERVER TO PLAY.  u can and will not be playing this game with anyone or offline. 


Im a simple man. i don't mind doing repetitive. i actually like the City even if it feels like a sand box to just move around in. noting crazy happens by chance or anything like that.

Only problems I found with this is that it is an online all the time game and the choice to make this an open world game as well.

The game needs to be free of the shackles of the online only aspect because it messes with loading up the map and the progression of the player.

The combat is extremely satisfying and molds super well with the movement. It's the main reason I bought this game and especially the reason I played til the end.

The story is...mediocre and if you take it as canon to the Arkham games I can see why people get upset over some of the events but the cinematics are nonetheless entertaining and the [spoiler]Batman[/spoiler] boss fight was one of the coolest moments in the game.

The endgame/live-service aspect of this game is where it fails horribly, currently there's essentially nothing to do except repeat the same 4 or 5 different objectives over and over again until you reach x mastery rank. Personally I just bought this game to experience the main campaign and move on but I still hope Season 1 brings more enticing content although I'm not hopeful. WB also said this game ""failed to meet expectations"" so don't expect more than the 4 seasons they had planned.

In terms of performance, I can't say I experienced the same issues most people are saying they've experienced. I have an RX 580 8GB, an i7-9700 and 16GB of RAM yet I usually maintain 60 FPS w/ FSR2 on Quality which considering how new this game is and how outdated my hardware is - that's pretty damn good although I hope they implement FSR 3 w/ Frame Generation eventually.

Overall I think it's a 7/10. If you can get this game for $30, maybe $50 maximum, I'd recommend you buy it. There's only about 15 - 20 hours of content right now (obviously not counting the end-game) so it's hard to justify paying the full $70.",1708998091,1709013616,True,2,1,0.455527544021606445,0,True,False,False

However, constant game-breaking glitches make it impossible to leave a positive review.

The worst for me has been the world failing to load after you get rewards for any completed mission and constantly having to force close the game and restart, including another shader-compilation and services sign in, just to get back to the rewards screen again and hope it loads ... and hoping it doesn't force me to complete that same mission again, which it did on a late-game boss battle ... not to mention random progressions stops in missions forcing restarts, had at least 3-4 of these).

I won't get into a diatribe about ""live service"" games, but will say they offer nothing to improve the experience here and are likely a key contributor to how the game has been received.

A game worth playing and with good build up potential. Sad thing is, it will flop for marketing reasons. DO NOT HEAR ANYTHING. As a DC comic and Batman fan for more than 20 years and Arkham fan from the first days of Arkham Asylum I can tell that this game must be played by anyone that likes hero games. Every time I here about how Batman got killed disrespectfully to Kevin Conroy and the Arkham series. It is not true, after all is just an other story. They are cooking something, let them give as a result. Don't judge a game in just 12 days of release, give it some space. They will not leave a world with out Batman and Justice League. We have a FUCKING MULTIVERSE to see being developed don't be a crying baby be PATIENT.

My opinion about Batman's death: It's beautiful like a poem. We have an active Batman for at least 17 years. For seventeen years is beaten up by many villains, physically and psychologically. He got dosed by the joker serum and a good number of times with the Crane's gas and he fucking survived this. Five year later after he lost his manor his parents legacy, his secret identity and living in shadows trying to protect Gotham he came out of the shadows to be a team with the Justice League. After some time in the league he lost by Brainiac and he brainwashed him. Please forgive him for loosing a battle with an inter galactic super A.I. alien, it will not happen again. As for his death I believe that he holds back. He can kill the squad anytime. If you notice he watches them secretly. If he wants he can get a BAT-sniper and pop their heads like balloons. We have seen Batman beaten badly in every way. Do you believe at the moment he is sitting at  the bench waiting to be killed by the moron queen, that he can do nothing? He just have some consciousness in there and waiting patiently to be killed because he knows that no one can stop him. That's it. Feel free to write your opinion. Thank you for reading.

[list]
[*]Combat is a blast. Yes, it's different from the Arkham games, but it scratches an itch. Despite the fact that the encounters can feel a bit repetitive, the combat remains fun and I almost never pass up an opportunity to get into a fight because of how much fun I have with it.
[*]Each character has a different traversal mechanic, and they're all really fun to use.
[*]I enjoyed the main campaign and I'm eager for the promise of continued support.
[*]The Games as a Service aspects are very light and I didn't feel like I needed to engage in them to have a good time. New Content is apparently free? That's awesome! Looking forward to it. Cosmetics are whatever. I don't need them right now, but if they start coming up with some awesome new cosmetic content, sure. 

[b]Mixed:[/b]
[*]I haven't yet felt the need to really optimize my loadouts or engage much with the weapon crafting systems. I'm sure it comes into play with the endgame content, but I haven't quite gotten there yet.
[*]The writing sometimes come across as a little cringey at times, but I also find myself cracking up more often than not.
[*]As mentioned, combat encounters and missions can come across repetitive. They're still fun and the missions are well designed, but it lacks some of the depth of missions from the Arkham games.

This game will unfortunately follow the footsteps of anthem, a broken mess at launch that the team couldn't fit at all and let it become obsolete and anthem was actually better at this stage since it was actually playable.

I didn't expect the traversal and gun play to be good but there are some issues.  Overall a lot of performance issues on pc which is something that Warner Bros generally struggles with even with other Arkham cannon games unfortunately. So I would recommend either waiting or getting a console release for the time being. And people also are complaining about the online service which is working fine as-well on console so again for the time being I would heavily suggest buying the console release.  Also I would wait till the opening month for this game to be over . It's overall not worth 70$ but more like 40$ or 50$ so far.

Gameplay: A lot of people are complaining about the definitely different game play from the Arkham series which is true this game has shorter combos with melee being weaker but overall the combat isn't terrible.  This games pacing is pretty good so far with you being able to choose how much you progress in killing the Justice League, but along with this the game should be played on the hardest difficulty just like all the other Arkham games that have struggled with boss fights and difficulty (something that rocksteady has always struggled with before this game so I don't know why people didn't expect that) I like the gear aspect and the different ways of playing according to your skill tree that is a great new addition to the franchise. But overall so far the game play is fun enough to repeat. It would have been cool to see tactical missions but also none of these characters except Dead-shot are really known for that kind of style. The enemy types are good and keep you moving and string together pretty well in my opinion. Another problem I found was after cut scenes sometimes sound that's non-dialog would bug out but honestly a few bugs for a game release that doesn't make the game unplayable is kind of good for now a days sadly.

The Story: The characters are well written, the dialogues a bit weird at times, but other than that the campaign is pretty good but one thing I have seen people don't like is the Batman's death. Batman's death, first off Batman in this game is great but a lot of people don't like how he died. In the game I was honestly more scared of him than Superman he stalks you and kicks your ass in the beginning and is overall a big threat even over the Flash, Green Lantern and Superman. He helped them kill 2/4 of the Justice League members and himself as well as he teaches them that they need to work together and trust each other to be able to beat him. So personally I don't think they entirely disrespected him. Also they use the decoupler in the battle against Brainiac (The first) and beat him so without Batman, I mean they would have died off without the Batman. and I think it's in better taste to kill him then rehire a voice actor for a different Arkham game about him. The story where you kill Brainiac overall is like 10 hours not sure about 100% completion and also that is without the Finite missions that are coupled in with the story.

And they have a tribute to him at the end of the game which is pretty non-disrespectful to the character and Kevin Conroy even though I wish they did more with him as he is great as Batman. R.I.P.

Overall if Arkham city was a 10/10 this game is probably a 6-7/10 with a game like Arkham Origins being a 8/10 solid. Wished Batman would have been the only person to escape Brainiac in my personal wants but I guess not. Right now I wouldn't say the game’s terrible or really good, more like a mid-score between recommended and not but we'll see what happens in the future.",1707619522,1708898840,False,0,0,0.430524379014968872,0,True,False,False

The game offers a pleasant continuation of a great series although it is clear that one should not expect the same quality level here. Nevertheless the storyline is gripping and succeeds in being at the same time dramatic and entertaining. The characters are vivid with distinct personalities that are also expressed by different playstyles. The gameplay itself matches the plot tempo quite adequately, something is always happening and the battles are very full of action. 

Of course there were made significant drawbacks in the game concept, as I think. The whole interface suggests that you are playing a MMO game, which does not actually match the idea of that game/series even though it features a coop mode. The unfinished and presumably yet to be finished finale could not alsso be called a good decision. Having to defeat the final boss 13 times can never be percepted as something positive.

This was my first entry into this game studio, and maybe thats why I dont have much negativity towards the game as im seeing it from a different point of view.

At almost 40hrs the game is extremely repetitive in the sense of doing the same exact missions over and over to gain currency to enter ""gRifts"" (For all my fellow Diablo 3 Players lol). Even though I can spend hours doing the same thing on Diablo 3, something about SS that just gets stale and boring fast. I think its lack of exciting item drops and very small loot tables compared to other games ive played.

As much as I enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it at the moment. There is currently a game breaking bug that stops you moving on after a mission completes and ends up with you having to replay entire boss fights.

This is a game with a lot of different problems, from it being a live service game to fans not being able to accept that Harley Quinn could kill their precious Batman to game breaking bugs.

I actually enjoyed the story, the writing and the characters. It was fun and I found myself laughing quite a few times at different dumb things that happened. It's nothing groundbreaking storywise but a game doesn't have to reinvent the wheel to be fun in my opinion.  

This game should not be a live service game though, it is a huge disservice to the franchise and characters. With the cost of living and the state of the world, who has $30 for a skin in game that will eventually get shut down like all live service games do.",1708850530,1708850530,False,7,0,0.50294727087020874,0,True,False,False

The gameplay loop is rather simple in that you basically have a few types of missions and they reuse them with different conditions and locations. Many people have an issue with that however since it is a live service game I dont see much of a problem especially once you add the difficulty of the different conditions to them. 

The story itself isnt as fleshed out as the other arkham games in I feel like it really took a back seat to the gameplay loop. As somebody who really enjoys story I was really hoping for more and was left disappointed and wanting more, especially with how they brought Batman back from retirement.

I have had a few connection issues playing solo which is rather bad sometimes. Even with cross play disabled and making it so not even friends can join me I often get disconnected 2-3 times a session which pushes back progress and loses items. More recently however, with the update, I cant even play a mission with out it being unable to load the map and I have to quit and rejoin losing all progress.

Lastly I had to contact customer support for a promotion WB Game were having where having with twitch drops. Considering this is a live service game I thought they would be a bit faster with what they were doing and a bit more helpful but I was left kind of shocked an soured with their customer support.

All in all, I wouldnt really recommend this game, its overpriced, repetitive and at this point I cant see it living past the first season pass in March especially if they keep the price that high

Also, as a side note, I have no experience playing with others in this game as I chose to play it solo, so I will not talk on the potential issues players came across with that as I experienced none.

When I watched gameplay of this title for the first time, I was a bit skeptical about it, but also thought it looked pretty interesting. The movement seemed really fun, and although the gunplay appeared kind of basic, I was still interested in it and ended up trying it out for myself. 

Overall, I thought it was fine. 

I played it at my own pace, and genuinely had a lot of fun travelling through Metropolis. Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang were my favorites to play as while exploring, though I ended up finding each character's movement abilities and bonuses interesting enough. Plus, for me, it rarely felt like a chore to swap to another character for a mission for bonus experience. Gunplay and combat was fine, I definitely think the amount of effects you see on the screen can be a bit much at times, and the enemy characters could definitely use an AI improvement. But, I still enjoyed dashing around the field and shooting a ton of enemies.

The story is okay. Aside from a lot of the known issues from public reviews, I really didn't mind the story, a bit cookie-cutter, but it wasn't really trying to be anything exceptional. Personally, I wasn't as upset with the premise, though still respect those who were. For example, I definitely feel like the ending of Arkham Knight was a better sendoff for Batman, but I also believed that it wouldn't really be the last time we see him, or the developers will find some way to make him a bigger character later for the game. I knew going into this game that we would be killing the Justice League, considering it's in the name. So when it came to the moments where characters like Batman died, I stayed fairly neutral about it. However, I do also understand that seeing these beloved characters die in such blunt and uninteresting ways does damage their story, so I can definitely see that that aspect of the game could have been better.

All in all, I thought it was pretty fun. Definitely not the best game I've played this year so far, but was still entertaining enough for me to have a good time. Movement was very satisfying, and the gunplay was still entertaining enough to keep me playing for a decent amount of time. If you're willing to look past some of the plot line's flaws, I think you can still find things about this game to enjoy.

You can tell that Rocksteady really did not want to make this, executives at WB saw the Arkham games' success, and likely just ordered Rocksteady to make it. They made the story entertaining, there aren't really any bugs I've come across, but my god is the story itself just bad. I haven't even completed it yet, but its hard to enjoy unless you're playing with someone else. The gameplay is mediocre, the best way I can describe it as a Captain Boomerang main is fortnite mixed with the speed of titanfall. $70 for asking price is wayyyy too much for its current amount of content, which is just the campaign. It's a looter shooter but just feels like they crammed the loot system in last second. I can't believe I'm saying this, but as an Arkham veteran, I genuinely hope that this game fails completely so they'll go back to making single player non live service games. This failure is definitely on Warner Brothers, not Rocksteady. I really, really wanted this game to be good, I was excited and bought it on day one. But It's just not worth it right now. I don't consider this game at all cannon to the Arkhamverse in the slightest, either. It completely removes the point of Batman's joker story arc in Knight. And the first time we see the Justice League in an ""Arkhamverse"" game is one we have to kill them in? What a load of horseshit. Make a batman beyond, superman, or flash, or hell, even green lantern game(not mentioning wonder woman because she's getting her own game outside of the Arkhamverse) instead.

SPOILERS:
Game wrote by activits that care about how to change the game, not about how the universe is or works.
Absolutely disrespectful to me as a fan who loves ALL of the good guys and wanted to at least witness their fall in style. The gameplay is average with poor writing, watching all male characters die like idiots, having only 5 seconds after death to be picked on by a bunch of losers. Superman survives kryptonite in the chest from Wonder Woman, only to find out he's allergic to bullets from the criminals and instantly drops dead. Batman has a 2-minute Scarecrow-like boss fight from the Arkham series, only to be dragged onto the streets, then executed and picked on on a bench. Lantern gets his finger cut off and is left naked, only with underwear, only for KingShark to force the lantern's rings to it's will which is total bullshit and so on. Only one majestic death for Wonder Woman(her name should suggest why). Great. Also, the LGBT flag with the message ""We welcome all heroes"" and the lines about being an independent woman and other WOKE garbage you hear through the entire fricking game from especially Harley. The rework of Harley is going on for a while leaving joker for Ivy and so on. Love it. Was it worth those 70 euros or 60 dollars? OF COURSE! I've watched all the gameplays, all the videos, and trailers. I SHALL NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT DISGRACES THE FRANCHISE AND ADDS WOKE SHIT TO IT!!! It is everywhere in our society, and I will not have it! I want to believe that there are still good people who see what, how and why this game is what it is and that i am not the only one. I do not condone hate towards games or studios, but this really touched me as an adult deeply and my childhood... growing up with the franchise only to see that it will be destroyed because of some political or greedy views really hurt my soul. As a bonus, repetetive gameplay with average combat aimed toward younger audiences. Of course people who somehow like this will go mad and bite back. You are a few against many. How this can get positive rating is beyond me.",1706910408,1708686548,False,52,0,0.518929123878479004,2,True,False,False

The mix of traversal with gunplay and different feeling characters are good. Framerate drops during cutscenes are the main negative so far with mostly stable performance in gameplay. So far I'd give it a 7 out of 10 which is decent to good. Certainly not a must play but if you like action games with shooting this is worth putting some hours into.

Edit after 70 hours or so, game completed and a decent amount of endgame played :

The game is very fun but there are freezes which take your joy out of the gameplay, a bug that after you finish an incursion metropolis doesnt load so you need to restart the game and the game takes a while to get into the action when you start it, so thats doubling down on that issue. And since launch theres an issue where you cant play higher than the basic 3rd difficulty of incursions. Apparently you can join someone elses game in order to fix that - you shouldnt have to, so another big fix needed for that else it takes a lot away from endgame progress. So while I enjoy the game, while these issues are unfixed im going to have to give the game a thumbs down now.

-Moving around the city is great, each character has a different maneuvering scheme
-Combat feels amazing and fast-paced
-Extra trials to unlock some things in-game
-Story overall as of now is good

Cons:
-Challenges can be a headache (ex. can only kill enemies with a critical hit, anything else will instantly heal the enemy. Critical hit can be a headache as all the movement that going all in-game and heads being small asl)
-Boss fights are bland
-Really not a lot of weapons options available
-A lot of enemies can spawn during missions, which can be annoying (especially snipers)
-A lot of story events doesn't align with thins and facts within the DC Universe (ex King Shark just takes 
 Green Lateran ring and puts its on, even thought he is evil)
-Not able to Skip Mission briefing for any of the Story or Side missions (annoying especially if you already know what to do and it prolongs the game)

While this game doesn't live up to its arkham predecessor, its still a fun, grindy game to play if you aren't worried about quality over quantity. While the story is mediocre at best and arkham batman's send off was poorly done (rip Kevin Conroy), this game has some ups. the loot, while poorly done, is fun to play especially the infamous/notorious items. The traversals are also fun (I personally like boomerang and Harley, but mostly boomerang), as they give you different play styles to work with. The map is also fun to fly around and just find small cannons and enemies to fight for quick exp. An annoying issue I have is that there isn't enough quest variety. While yes, it is fun to log on and go take out the giant cannon first, or go fight different waves of enemies, it also feels repetitive. Which makes the grind boring for the finite crisis. But I personally find those missions fun since there is better loot that typically comes from it. All in all though, at the end of the day, I still enjoy the game at its current point. Overall if you're someone who is looking for a grindy game with a bearable endgame or just someone looking for a generally hero/anti-hero story, then i recommend this to you.

OK so, I have put way more hours into the game since writing this review and given the time period, a lot a has changed. For instance, the player count has dropped. Why? cause they have been releasing updates that somehow in some cursed way, create even more issues. For instance, the loading metropolis bug. This bug basically makes the game unplayable since after 3 incursion missions I believe, you get a pop up that says ""Loading Metropolis"" that never goes away and you have to relaunch the game. Pros? You keep loot. Cons? You don't earn the next mastery level. An even bigger concern I have is if anybody at RS is even reading the bug reports. For instance, a youtuber named cloud plays who has basically been going over this game since launch posted a video going over the possible downfall of this game (The link to the video: https://youtu.be/opiikKmRX5g). In the video, he explains a part about someone placing a bug report on the loading metropolis bug and somebody did get back to them!.. But in the least helping way possible. They basically wrote ""We closed your ticket down. go to our reddit and upvote a similar issue"". I don't wanna rant a whole lot more but in short, the way the game is being handled is not looking good and my one hope at the moment is to at least be able to update this review and talk about the joker dlc and maybe new fixes. Now would I recommend buying the game. If you're looking for a game to past the time and you are willing to look past the stupid bugs, then sure go for it. But if you're looking for a fun looter shooter like borderlands, I would wait and save for an arkham game or when the game isn't at a state like this.",1707104945,1708669295,True,4,0,0.437941253185272217,0,True,False,False

Overall the story is not good if you really want to know what happens read the title of the game do not buy it. I can't understand why this game has so many people recommending the game and then commenting on the price. The price is insane for the amount currently in the game, I understand future expansions are free but I feel like the game could have launched with more. After the most recent patch every time I finish a mission I have to force close the game. I spend so much time just trying to get into the game with the standard GAAS optimising shaders BS. There is not a single redeeming factor to this game. The shooting and movement are fun-ish I guess.

I do not recommend this game, if you also love Arkham games forget this one. Gotham Knights also published under WB is much better or just play through the originals again.

- Lots of Random Missions


- CONS -
----------
- Co-op will periodically cause the game to crash completely
- Staring an online server will often eventually become disconnected and force you to singleplayer which is a problem because then you have to start a mission that you were on over again
- Co-op tells you that you need 4 unique players but nine times out of ten you'll want to be the character you like the most
- Lots of strange glitches like the camera freezing up and circling after a cutscene causing you to restart the entire game, there is also one time the screen and hud disappeared somehow, another time I had gotten stuck on the finished mission
- Enemies will sometimes often become unkillable even after using your special skill abilities
- A lot of the missions feel the exact same like they're reskinned sadly even though it is fun in this game at least
- Missions will sometimes get stuck and never show the next step to finish it
- Drivable Vehicles are broken as heck, can no longer enter it from above, have to stand next to it pressing enter Vehicle button several times nearly getting killed just trying to use it for missions.
- glitchy and laggy as heck, 4090 started sputtering out oddly with massive fps drops
- most of the time multiplayer doesn't even really ever work and just kicks you out back to the main menu
- the game's ending is pretty disappointing and could have been done better so as not to mislead and I don't wanna go into details mainly not to spoil the ending, it was decent, just not what I was believing after getting to the end game and defeating the justice league to go against brainiac. I thought he would have been a lot tougher too.
- Gotham Knights Bosses are way tougher than all of these Sucide Squad Bosses
- Sometimes the game will randomly kick you to a Just A Sec screen that gets stuck there
- One thing that really disappointed me heavily during the game is that there really isn't that many side-based missions through the main story other than the random missions placed on the map. There's a few leading up to killing the justice league and eventually tackling brainiac but once you get to killing them all there are maybe 2-3 in between and I feel like this should have taken a lot longer to become strong enough to take on each of them whereas instead what we got was oh here's an idea on how to kill them, here's what we need, go get or do this, then go kill the infected justice league member which was essentially boiled down to the 2 maybe 3 missions in between each. I recall doing one mission right after the killing flash and then I was able to go take on green lantern even though I was able go after him first but I was still learning the game at the time and doing random missions on the map.
- It's also possible to end missions early if you reach certain locations quickly if there is a waypoint almost like they should have been tougher to clear to finish those areas. 


= VERDICT =
==========
Good Game but it just needs a ton more work, hope to see some fixes, so I suggest waiting for a sale or some more updates to the game but the story is pretty good so you'll definitely enjoy that part with some very funny stuff happening. This still stands upon beating the game even though apparently there is more to come to it in the coming months but I'm not going to spoil that part.

Gameplay is not TERRIBLE but its NOTHING like the goated fight style of the Arkham Games. The characters are nice and funny and I enjoy the cutscenes. The combat gets a little repetitive after like 2 hours but its fun non the less. Biggest issue is the performance on pc. I just don't understand why they struggle with this so much. Also the tone and graphics do not fit with the Arkham universe whatsoever. The boss fights are lazy and boring and they are just stupid. Overall game is not that bad but not a stepdown from other arkham games, its a face plant. They fumbled so hard.

I understand the frustration of ANOTHER live service game and i appreciate people's frustration on a game with a $70 price point for it to be live service. Definitely agree the price should be lower if its gunna be live service. HOWEVER, do not forget that the ""battle pass"" is entirely cosmetic, all the additional characters, extra stories, new weapons, etc is free. You don't have to pay extra unless you want skins and the like, which changes nothing about the game-play. As someone who loves any ""fashion simulator"" game, i think this is the best choice if we HAVE to have a battle-pass.

As for game-play, I truly do not understand the hatred people have for the game-play. The combat is fast paced, action oriented, quick response fights, I've never had a game make me feel like such a bad-ass just for turning and shooting. Most of the complaints i see are about doing ""the same 3 missions over and over"" well clearly you haven't reached the endgame. Spoilers ahead

---SPOILER START---
[spoiler] Once you've defeated the first Braniac you get access to 3 missions that reward you with different types of gear, this portion is SLIGHTLY repetitive but to be honest I only had to do them a few times as if you continue doing them on harder difficulties you rank up faster, and once you hit rank 30 you unlock the kill Braniac mission and 2 endless missions for 5 different incursion missions, as well as constantly changing normal missions for Hack, Penguin, Ivy, Hiro, Lex-2, and Rick Flag. So way more than 3 same missions over and over, there are at least 11 different mission types not to mention all the random encounters around the city. [/spoiler]
---SPOILER END---

Now for the story. Personally for a comic book franchise story its pretty solid, I like it a lot. Suicide Squad has never been one to be heavy on the story, its always been an IP specifically for the crazy action and humor of a bunch of DC villains being forced to work together. The jokes are great, the character interactions are fun, my only complaints are the repetition of the same story dialogue instead of the seemingly few unique dialogues between the characters as well as the kinda anticlimactic deaths. like i expect a LITTLE pomp and circumstance for killing a superhero, not them just falling over.

Lets talk multiplayer. Personally I'm a huge fan of being able to do these missions with my friends, and the ""Squad Leader"" mechanic is super fun to me. The idea that each mission we compete against each other for a high score while helping each other is so fun, leading to the winner being the squad leader until the next mission. The anticipation after each mission to see whose Anti-Hero shot is gunna play is so fun. I also like that you can complete Riddler objectives on your friends maps too, so you don't have to wait until you play solo to collect your trophies. 

Now finally for performance. Performance is a little surprising, I have the highest end gaming computer money can buy(as of 6 months ago at least) and even with my NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti i have to cap the game at 60 fps and medium quality to avoid massive stutters and even then it sometimes drops to 40 fps. This is a tad disappointing but i only ever encounter it while traveling around (never during combat) so I can excuse it until they patch the issues. But it's definitely something that needs to be patched ASAP. Now granted the look of the game barely changes from max settings to medium settings so i don't mind terribly.

All in All I give Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League a 8/10. It's fun, engaging, has great replayability and makes you feel like a total bad-ass with its combat. There's not much i would change aside from the performance issues and the repetitive dialogues, but my PERSONAL wishes I'll include down below.




---PERSONAL WISHES FOR THE GAME---
1. let us mix and match outfits, not restrict them to outfit ""groups""

2. Any costume worn in game should be a selectable option(I'm looking at you Boomerang Boxers from Flash canon fight mission)

3. Playable Riddler, after all of the Riddler's complaining let him suffer with the Suicide Squad too

4. Weapon Transmog system, If we own or have owned a weapon we should be able to glamour our weapons with them. I.E. Bane weapon but it looks like a Black mask Weapon etc.

5. World Selection, I know this one is silly but just for quality of life, an option to pick one of the party members save file as the world we play in before going into the world. instead of just whoever formed the parties world.

The team's banter and dynamic throughout the game was very engaging and fun. The kid in me really loved walking through the Hall of Justice engaging with the holograms of the members of the Justice League. This was a highlight of the game for me and I wished there was a better opportunity for us to experience the Justice League in their true forms before turning; in a similar way that we had with The Flash and Wonder Woman. The acting is pretty great to say the least. I've been a big fan of the concept of the Suicide Squad ever since the animated Arkhamverse Suicide Squad movie and they did a stellar job at capturing the raw connections of each character. Each playable character had me laughing through cut scenes and missions. The member's of the Justice League were very well portrayed and I just have to reiterate how incredible it was to see them finally realized in the Arkhamverse.

In regards to game play. The combat flow was exciting, however, once I played enough as one character; the play style was too difficult for me to switch up when changing characters. The only comments I really want to stress in regards to this game is the repetitive missions. Outside of the story, which does have a lot of repetitive missions still, is systematically the same thing. I still had fun playing the missions, but not for the missions themselves; rather for the action and smooth mechanics. These missions are VERY repetitive and I am not 100% confident I will be able to stick it through the forthcoming seasons if this is all we will get, but with new characters. The Boss Battles were relatively exciting, but underappreciated due to the fact that there were really no incentives to killing them. At the beginning of the game, there was a looming threat of the Justice League being impossible to take down, and I was excited to see how we could even accomplish that, but all it was was some new fancy bullets or devices that basically made them vulnerable. In the context of this game I suppose it makes sense, but The Justice League is supposed to be the biggest threat and yet easy to take down due to simplistic story reasons. I felt that there was a missed opportunity to create a really intense game where we sleuth through Batman's data on each member and work towards dismantling each member in a more realistic way. 

And as for Batman....
If you grew up with the Arkham Games as some of your favorite games to play, I think we can all agree that this game did not do Kevin justice. Batman's whole gimmick is that he is the greatest mind to out smart the strongest of heroes and villans. He has been conveyed and portrayed as an impenetrable force to be reckoned with through the most dangerous adversities. There was a deeply under-utilized role that this character could/should have played. Granted, I absolutely loved seeing Kevin come back and wear that cowl once more and I was thrilled to have the ""Batman Experience"" although it was short lived. I genuinely hope there is more of Kevin in the future DLC's; but am not expecting much.

This game does have flaws, however I wouldn't advise skipping over it if you are an Arkham Fan. Wait for this game to lower in price and even perhaps wait for the DLC content to be released so you can indulge in the better aspects of this game without the steep price point. It was fun and I am optimistic, however there will be a longing within me for a stronger game and a better BATMAN.

have ever played. I don’t know what I was expecting. I certainly wasn’t expecting this game to be on par with the quality of the Arkham games, but I guess I was expecting just a fun game with addictive shooting. Instead, what I got was a greedy, generic, and unfun mess of a game that is lacking in the most basic of features, and is an insult to anyone who liked the Arkham
games. This is going to be a long review that tackles almost every gripe I have with this “game”, so if you have a low attention span or aren’t in the mood to get a little upset, I suggest you keep scrolling. This review will also contain major spoilers for the story, so you have been warned.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
For me, this was the main selling point for this game. This game could have had the worst story, cringiest dialogue, and the most outdated “hyper realistic” visuals, but as long as the gameplay was good I’m all for it. The movement is really what sold me on this game. Even if the gunplay for the 4 playable characters feels pretty samey, each character had a unique method of traversal. Deadshot has a jetpack that is fun to use while shooting, the shark guy whose name I can’t remember can leap on to other buildings, Captain Boomerang (yes that is his actual name) has the same power as the Flash, which is combined with his teleportation ability to allow for more experimentation in traversal, and Harley Quinn’s grapple hook swinging feels more fluid and fun to use than Spider Man’s web swinging in the Avengers game. However, that’s about where my praise ends for the gameplay. For the most part, the combat and gunplay is pretty boring. All of the playable characters just have guns, even the shark guy who definitely seems like he was made specifically for melee combat. Furthermore, the enemies and even the bosses present no challenge whatsoever, and just devolves into unloading bullets until everything dies. I would at LEAST like to see some higher difficulty in a game like this. In fact, a higher difficulty would fit this game like a glove because the story of Suicide Squad has always been about facing impossible odds, but I guess then game journalists would give it a lower score since any game that has even the slightest amount of difficulty is considered to be “THE DARK SOULS OF _____”. In the end, the gameplay is just copying the homework of much better games like Sunset Overdrive and Insomniacs Spider Man, except 1000x more repetitive.

[b]Visuals[/b]
I don’t really have much to say for this part because the visuals are nothing special. They give the illusion of unique visuals by throwing a bunch of seizure inducing vomit colored tik tok brain casino machine effects whenever you kill something, but that’s all they are. Effects. Adding those things doesn’t make the visuals any different from something like Destiny or Borderlands, and it just comes off as a desperate move from the developers to add life to this shriveled corpse of a game.

[b]Story/dialogue[/b]
This is probably the single worst aspect of the game. I don’t think that it is controversial to say
that 90% of superhero stories nowadays range from mediocre to abysmal, and Sesame Squad: Kill the Franchise is no exception. The Justice League has every chance to easily kill you, but the Suicide Squad is able to beat all of them by shooting them with guns. This begs the question, are these the same people who wrote the Arkham games? Those games were very accurate to their source material, and even improved the development of characters like Joker and Red Hood. In this game the characters feel like one character trait they had from the comics made into their entire personality. Every character is so one dimensional and bland that you could swap them out with any other character that is remotely similar, and the story would be completely unaffected. I don’t really understand why Rocksteady had to set this game in the Arkhamverse, since the only reason they did that is so they could kill off Arkham Batman. They could have easily set this game in a different reality where the Justice League turned evil, and the Suicide Squad are the only ones who can stop them, but NO! They just HAD to set it in the Arkhamverse to kill Batman. And before you say anything stupid, the problem is not the fact that he died, the problem is HOW he died. They literally drag him out into the street and shoot him like a rabies infected dog. It is absolutely pathetic for the death of a version of Batman that is widely considered to be among the best. If they were always going to kill Batman, at least give him a heroic sacrifice. Make him pull Brainiac into a pit or something as the only way to kill him. Show us that you have some respect left for this franchise. But I guess that’s too hard to do, then it wouldn’t appeal to the edgy teenagers who begged their parents to buy this piece of crap. The dialogue is also horrible, along with the line delivery. Everyone besides Kevin Conroy just sounds so bored and uninterested, and it doesn’t help how the writing is equally terrible. Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang are so f*cking annoying, and they do not. Stop. Talking. Every time they kill an enemy or move around or open a door they always have to crack some bad joke or catchphrase just to stop the toddlers who play this game from getting bored and looking at their crusty ipads. Overall, the story feels like a fanfiction written by an edgy middle schooler who hates the Arkham games just because everyone else likes them, and I’m willing to bet money it is the exact same story that would be told if the people who defend this game wrote it.

[b]Microtransactions/Live service[/b]
Genuinely, what is the purpose of the microtransactions, Rocksteady? You are already charging full price for this absolute travesty of a game, and you still want more. Not to mention the $100 DOLLAR DELUXE EDITION WHERE YOU GET SOME COSMETICS THAT AREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD LOOKING. Of course, this game also has to be live service. I mean, that didn’t turn out well for Overwatch 2, but whatever works! They will also be giving the game free content updates, the first of which will be adding the Joker as a playable character, because you can’t be a superhero product without bringing some dead character back to life and butchering their character. Here’s a bright idea, Rocksteady: how about instead of spending weeks coding in useless, greedy junk like paid cosmetics and drip feed content that you know is going to make your players upset, you actually use those resources to improve the actual game, flesh out the mechanics, and not make the story an absolute train wreck. Then again, they didn’t do that, and we got this.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
Sucky Squad: Revenge of the Fallen is an unfun, messy, rushed, corporate, lazy, childish, and downright insulting excuse for a game. The problem isn’t that Sushi Squad isn’t the same as the Arkham games, the problem is that it fails it create it’s own identity or deviate from those games in any meaningful or unique way. It baffles my mind that there are people who will genuinely defend this game and ignore all of its obvious flaws for whatever stupid reason they made up. Anyone who says this game is anything above a 7/10 is a brain rotted consumer who has no standards and continues to buy these games and let these companies continue to get away with making subpar at best products. Please stop giving your money to these corporations who don’t care about you and give it to people who actually care about this industry and want to make good games. If you like the Arkham games, play something else. If you like the Suicide Squad, play something else. If you like superhero games, play something else. If you like just good games in general, then I beg of you, play something else.",1706917442,1708473403,False,27,0,0.536236941814422607,2,True,False,False

I'm the kind of person that I don't mind spoilers so I'd looked to see what happens and yes, it's a bit disappointing on how they treat the justice league characters.

But you really can't compare it to the Arkham game, it's not trying to be an Arkham game even though it's set in the same universe. If you buy the game expecting it to be in the same style then yes you're not going to have a good time....it's different.

This very much feels like a game that's meant to be played with other people (I'm not that kinda player myself I much prefer single player games) and it might very well be more enjoyable with others. The skill trees are...well....odd? And to some degree feels rather pointless.

The basic story premise is ok, but I think it could have been made far better. The way the suicide squad is handled I think is nice, and the characters themselves are fun. The amount of cut scenes or interaction, to me anyway, feels like you're involved in the story and in that sense it's well done.

The game play itself is fun, however some of the missions I find irritating in the sense that you can only kill mobs for that mission with say critical damage only, anything else does zero damage. It can make some of the fights a bit frustrating. Some of these fights I've found harder than killing the Flash or Green Lantern which again is disappointing.

Is it worth the money? I think I paid about 20 pounds too much, I'd say a good price for it would be 40....maybe 35.

So TLDR all in all would I recommend getting it? If you go into it expecting Arkham gameplay then no, if you go into it with an open mind for a different kind of experience with those games then sure. It can be fun....but it's not without it's problems either.",1708466320,1708466320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's poorly optimized for PC, well for my PC since I have a pre-built and it's 2 years old. 2. Boss fights were too easy. 3.

Artistically the game shines. Excellent modelling, animation and texturing give it a nice balance between realistic and comic book. The main story is excellent and well scripted. Missions are not massively varied but once you get into a rhythm you can find that hours of fun have passed. It rarely gets the skill curve wrong. Sticking with one character until the main campaign is going to make the game less frustrating than trying to bounce between characters to level them all up at the same rate.

You play as Task Force X, a team made up of four villains with the mission to kill the justice league, who have been possessed by Brainiac.

The characters: Each one of the characters can move in the air freely while attacking. In fact you are encouraged to do so with some of the upgrades you can get for your character (critical hits, combo increase for mid air kills). Mostly I move from rooftop to rooftop to kill enemy spawns. You can play as one of four characters (at least until the next season comes out): Harley who can grapple onto buildings and gets a one time air grapple, Boomerang, who can teleport a medium distance in all directions or a short distance multiple times in quick succession, Shark, who has strong ground pound attacks, and Deadshot who can fly and stay airborne while shooting. They are all pretty good but Boomerang was the least fun to play out of the 4.

Weapons: In addition to each characters melee weapon (Deadshot has a wrist cannon but it acts in the same way) There are pistols, smgs, shotguns, assault rifles, heavy machine guns, and sniper rifles. A good variety but for the boss fights (other than Batman) you really cannot fight them with anything but the assault rifles and sniper rifles (I will explain why later). But for all other enemies you can choose weapons that fit your play style and your skill level. One thing to mention at this point is that I didn't have a huge problem with using a keyboard and mouse even though the game doesn't recommend it, but I did need a five button mouse to bind evade. There are different weapon tiers besides common, uncommon, and rare. Epic weapons have the highest stats overall, while legendary ones have lower stats than Epic but with some rare abilities (e.g. ignore armor, etc.). Infamous weapons have high stats and nice special abilities depending on its theme. For example Deadshot infamous weapons have an ability to afflict burn damage on multiple enemies if you shoot 3 of them within 9 seconds.

You can also upgrade your guns if you use them often but they don't really explain this because they call it something stupid like Nanotech mods instead of gun parts.

You can also equip different grenades, melee weapons, shields and ""neck bomb mods"". If you equip two of a particular set (character themed) they get additional abilities.

Speaking of the shields, you don't have regenerating health you need to regenerate your shields by shooting your enemies's feet and then meleeing them. This makes combat more rhythmic which is great. Your weapons can also have afflictions courtesy of Poison Ivy which are rechargeable special attacks that can do elemental damage to your enemy or make them attack each other.

Enemies: You get a medium sized variety of enemies, you have grunts, snipers, big brutes that hurl projectiles at you, possessed gunships, grunts with the Flash's abilities. The most variety you get is from the missions where they place restrictions on how you can kill your enemies (e.g. only kill when powered up, only kill with afflictions, take out crystals before they respawn, critical hits only [others heal]). These missions encourage you to change your loadout but they aren't very fun.

Story/Setting: Many people dislike the story because you play as the bad guys and do what is on the title. But I thought it was pretty funny and enjoyable. I love the Arkham games and I was expecting Metropolis to be as fun to explore as it was in Arkham Knight. It wasn't. There aren't really any distinguishing features in the Metropolis nor do you get any interesting conversations or lore from NPCs like in Arkham Knight or City. Also as soon you beat the final boss Brainaic, he will ever shut the fuck up. I am not sure why he is still talking to you after you killed him but he keeps just taunting you like crazy. Batman was much more interesting to listen to, considering how he has degraded himself to serving Brainiac.

Conclusion: I think they did almost everything right in this game despite what others may say. But I don't really see myself devoting a massive amount of time into the post story content. If the new seasons's worlds are just the same missions but with a different setting then I don't really want to continue. But I will remain hopeful, the gameplay is very fun despite the mediocre setting and story.

Bonus Superman boss rant: As I said earlier, other than Batman you really need to long range weapons like a sniper or assault rifle. Especially against Superman. He was one of the cheapest bosses I've fought against. First of all he moves really fast across the map, he stands still for 3 seconds. He will keep spamming two attacks a tornado attack where you have no choice but to run away, and a super breath attack where you have no choice but to run away. Both attacks will take all of your shields but the super breath attack will give you confusion and you won't be able to see easily Superman for a bit. Also while he does these attacks he can also laser beam ice blocks he gradually builds which deal massive damage when they explode anywhere near you.

The worst thing is that if you enter the fight with Superman, as far as I know, you cannot quit the fight. If you leave the session and come back it will just spawn you back at the beginning of the fight. So if you go in unprepared you may be softlocked, unless you can get out of it by choosing an earlier chapter.

I was able to beat him after a couple of tries but I never thought I would hate Superman so much. He also hurls insults at you as he fights you. The other Justice League bosses do this as well but Superman sounds like such a douchebag when he does it with his superior attitude.",1708407383,1708407383,True,6,0,0.484567552804946899,0,True,False,False

I will add that I am judging the game strictly on its game play,because as of making this review I haven't beaten the main story yet. Of what I have seen I like where its headed and the voice acting is really enjoyable. Feels like every actor brought their A-game to the recording booth. 

To sum up if you liked the Arkham games and are looking for the exact same experience game play or story wise then of course the game will disappoint. So don't waste the money.

The story is fun, Rocksteady has managed to channel the almost whimsical brutality akin to James Gunn's Suicide Squad movie. The squad members have great chemistry together and their development as a team flows naturally as the story progresses. The Justice League is actually very well done as the villains of this story. I know that most of the haters of this game from the Arkham fan base are really not happy that Batman, the hero of the past games and has grown so much as a character, is now brainwashed by Brainiac into being a pseudo-Arkham Knight for Brainiac's forces. They feel his turn to villainy, him brutally murdering civilians in the streets, and[spoiler] his unceremonious end [/spoiler]are a bummer way for his character to go out. But I would like to remind these people that there is still more to be said in this story through the seasons planned ahead, and there could be more to be said about the fates of our one time heroes ([spoiler]there are loose ends like good Flash missing a finger but bad Flash has all of his fingers and Green Lantern's ring going underwater when it canonically always shoots up to space to find a new Lantern[/spoiler]). All that being said, this game's story is written in a way that allows space for expansion, so judging the story of this game at launch is like judging a book by its first chapter. There are still many twists to be had, if you are patient enough to read the whole book (which I am).

The gameplay of this game is probably my favorite thing in this game, which is fantastic because it's a looter shooter after all! And that's something the Arkham fans need to keep in mind. You are not playing as Batman. You are playing as villains. Villains use guns. Villains kill. IF YOU LIKE THE GAMEPLAY OF THE ARKHAM GAMES, THIS IS NOT THE SAME TYPE OF GAME! STOP HATING ON THE GAME BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BATMAN GAME! IT IS A SUICIDE SQUAD GAME! LET IT BE A SUICIDE SQUAD GAME! If you like playing looter shooters though, this one is fantastic. The combat is wild, chaotic, and extremely fast-paced. Bosses are challenging and have commanding presences. Each character feels distinctly their own, which actually forces you to change your approach to combat for each character you play. The wide variety of gear and skills to be earned in the post-campaign offers more than enough incentive to keep on grinding for those specific pieces you need to take your character build to the next level. This game is honestly the most fun I've had in awhile in terms of gunplay, and I'm looking forward to dumping a bunch of time into this game.

And now for the philosophy of the game. Probably the #1 reason this game is hated is because its a live service looter shooter instead of the brawler games like the Arkham games. The whole live service genre is demonized as this type of game where studios are constantly adding content behind paywalls to the game with the expectation that the playerbase will lap it all up like dogs. And this is true for a lot of studios. The first example I always think of is Destiny: a game that is free to install but asks for $60 a season to get access to any of the new gear, maps, quests, dungeons, etc. And they don't even let you play the old seasons either, just the current one that costs you $60 to get now and lose when the next season rolls around. But this isn't what Rocksteady is doing. They have been more than transparent that the seasons following the campaign of the game will be FREE to access for EVERYONE. No new character they release will be locked behind any paywall, and the campaigns/new gear that comes with them will be free to access too. On top of that, you'll be able to replay past seasons to both replay your favorite missions or grind for that gear set that you missed last season. And yes, there will be battlepasses for the seasons, but these will only be for cosmetics. And I should note that not all cosmetics in this game are locked behind the in-game store. There are several pieces to unlock through gameplay (ie: doing in-game challenges or completing certain missions). This trend will also continue when new campaigns, so there will always be new cosmetics to be had that won't empty your wallet to get. I'm actually impressed with this step that Rocksteady has taken here and I hope that we get to see this game get to its fullest potential.

But I know the real question is this: ""Should I buy this game?"" If you like looter shooters, yes. If you don't, then probably not. If you think the game is too expensive, remember that your buying the base game and at least 4 seasons of content ahead of time. Compared to the competition in this genre, you're getting an absolute steal (you're getting the game for a quarter of what the competition would ask for in the long run). And if you're interested but are being dissuaded by the loud minority that's trying to hate this game into the ground, please just play this game for yourself. If what I've described in my review sounds like fun to you, then I'm convinced you'll have a good time.",1708401556,1708401556,True,2,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Just like everyone else is saying, it costs way too much for something so currently skin deep and short. 

The bosses are paradoxically too easy and too hard at the same time, with Flash and Superman really being the two ""hard"" bosses that I wish would just stop moving more often without something exploding or hitting/knocking you back before you can get a decent shot in, but then, if you DO use a sniper or pistol against them in frustration (they both deal insane damage on single shots, which is all you'll get in against those two) then they get trivialized and die in around 6-12 hits, or perhaps actually die as quickly as intended, because otherwise they're unhittable, don't stop moving, and barely take any damage (literally over 2,000 hits if you use a minigun, rifle, smg, or shotgun, for some reason). On the other hand, Green Lantern and Batman are fine fights, because both are still a lot of the time and don't need to constantly be countered with the counter gimmick at very specific times in order to become damageable, and in batman's case, is the one boss big enough to be hit decently with any weapon. Tldr, it's all over the place, and Flash and Superman really only die to Snipers and Pistols.

UNLIKE everyone else, however, I really do get and see what they were going for here outside of that. The tone of the game is far brighter, casual, and goofier than the Arkham games, and all the characters are either cracking jokes that may or may not be funny to people, or... are Waller, Brainiac, and the generic second-in-command guy who are all really overbearing and annoying. That bright, casual goofiness, as well as the annoyance, actually extends into the playstyles, skill trees, and even the loot system, and yes, it's a lot to go through.

Each character has their own playstyle, movement option, 3 innate skills, and like 2 skillpoint builds each that actually make sense for them. They've also got restrictions on which weapons each one can use for some reason, which is more annoying than it is helpful. In the end, though, the majority of your build will ignore the skill tree completely (totally not because half of every tree is based on the combo mechanic that doesn't work that well with the minion spam and op single units the game has) and will rely mostly on the loot you get, which...

Loot in this game is probably confusing to most people. Instead of following the usual upgrade styles where you get better loot as you play, nah. If you get a legendary in the first few missions, you're basically set into the endgame, which is both silly, but also kinda nice, as it cuts out the extreme farming that a lot of other games have, BUT...

...then you get to the extremely repetitive and gated endgame. My god it's actually worse than Warframe's grinds. You initially get 3 missions to get some currency to do 3 other missions, then you kill Brainiac, who's a repeat of Flash with extra mechanics (although his arena does allow for more than a sniper to be used, I still reccomend using a sniper or pistol, minigun if you're playing king shark) except his flash fight is better than the one that came before it, I think it's down to the arena being better, but, anyway, you kill him, and then... Get a screen saying that's it until they release the next season, then you get into the boring, rotating grind of doing the 6 missions you already did, one at a time, at very, very gradually harder difficulties so you can unlock more difficulties over and over and over until you get to 20 on all of them, except, instead of going by, say, 5s, they went by 1s. You do all the missions on Mastery 3 and you unlock mastery 5. You do them all on 5, you get difficulty 7, and all the while, your gear isn't changing, and all you're getting are skillpoints for a meta tree straight out of a roguelike, if you actually got anyone to 30 and kept playing them.

Thus, in the end, it's more bad than it is good, sadly. The loot system is nice, the guns and traversals feel great, but the characters are 50/50, and the grind is terrible, even for just leveling everyone to 30, and it gets stagnant way too fast. You can't even directly matchmake with other people to somewhat alleviate this, you have to go out of your way, into the matchmaking menu, open up YOUR game to other people, and then either wait for them to filter in and start doing things if they chose the same option, or go in and have them go along with whatever you're doing at some point, point being, there's no quick-joining here despite the flat loot and power scales and the genuine opportunity to just drop in and go regardless of level, skills, or what have you. There's even clans/guilds ffs, but no real reason to get them together. (You can just use other people's characters in your game with a wacky social bot system, so, it's just weird, though maybe also helpful..?)

It also likes to freeze randomly for varying amounts of time.

Wow, simply wow.
I'm sitting here thinking how did this happened? I'm utterly confused and lost in many levels and so, I'll drop my honest thoughts about this whole ordeal. Keep in mind I'm not a reviewer, just a customer with little to no ins and outs for game development. Here we go.

Let me start by saying: no guys, this is not a soulless cash-grab. This wasn't a hate project at all. There is talent here, genuinely impressive at times; the voice acting is excellent, the attention to detail for each Squad member is cute; each have their own very distinct body language, for example, the goofy Boomerang is hardly holding his back straight while the professional Deadshot maintains an imposing posture, crazy Harley's always frenetic and moving incapable of holding still while the enormous King Shark is as slow as a tank. Small details like this are what make me smile.
The characters are the heart and soul of the game, which should come to no surprise. 
Each team member rambles left and right with each other and is genuinely funny at times, I was smiling and even laughing on multiple occasions. 
The fact that each member has a very distinct way of moving through Metropolis is also very cool, each method plays to the characters personality; Harley's athletic body, Shark's massive mass, Deadshot's tactical positioning and Boomerang's speedster. 

Metropolis has it's own life- even if the streets are empty, it still gives good visual story telling; survivor hideouts, dust statues of civilians running to safety, graffiti calling the League out, the big Lex Luthor influence in the markets, the way it's citizens painted the League as gods. It's futuristic architecture; it's bright in full contrast to Gotham; while one is depressing, the other is hopeful.
All that sounds cool huh? You wanna know how much of that you learn in the story? Whoops- nothing. This is due to the game's core movement mechanic; you will see Metropolis flying around and so every rooftop looks the same and tells you absolutely nothing about the city. It will get old. Fast. 
I only noticed such details due to taking my time in actually walking and analyzing, which I assure you only 10% of the players will ever do.
One could argue the incentive to explore the city comes from Riddler's Riddles but there's a big problem with that, this riddles are sorta vague and talk about very specific buildings that you 100% missed due to jumping around, so you'll find yourself spamming the Riddle Scam key at every single place like a headless chicken- it is very annoying. Now trophies! They are back! And they are very disappointing, in Arkham games said trophies were placed in very smart places, where locating one was just part 1 of the puzzle. On SSKTJ? trophies feel so randomly placed, they're just sitting there, no challenge to reach them at all. You will stumble a lot of these by mistake on multiple occasions.
And so, map exploration is a mess and will be ignored by most of it's players, meaning it will grow old fast.

I already briefly talked about the main characters but what about the side cast? Well, everything previously stated (voice acting, animations, details etc) still applies-
HOWEVER, the more you play, the more you realized how each character is just dropped around with no context or explanation and then just forgotten to being a Vendor in your HQ.
And I got some good questions hehe...

WHY THE FCK ARE WE KILLING THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE WITH A BULLET?????!!!!!!
WHY THE FCK ARE WE KILLING THE INTERGALACTIC SPACE COP WITH A BULLET?????!!!!
WHY THE FCK ARE WE KILLING THE WORLD'S GREATEST DETECTIVE WITH A BULLET?????!!!!
WHY THE FCK ARE WE KILLING THE MAN OF STEEL WITH A SNIPER RIFLE???????!!!!!!!

HOW IN GOD'S NAME DID WE KILL A INTER-DIMENSIONAL GOD-LIKE ALIEN WITH A MACHINE GUN??????!!!!

I am so sorry, but those last are for the writers, you guys weren't smart and creative enough to answer the questions: How does one kill the Man of Steel? The Fastest Man Alive? Etc.
All you did on that drawing board was ''uhhh...idk- magoffin this, magoffin that- GOLDEN KRYPTONITE BULLETS''.
There's no questions asked around the premise ''what if these gods turned against us?''. No creative smart philosophical disputes on the matter.
Honestly, this pissed me off so much.
Read the game's title: Suicide Squad: KILL THE JUSTICE LEAGUE- part of the reason why I bought this game was to find out in what crazy creative ways could these nobodies kill gods? I did not expect to kill The Flash with a bullet- seriously, I invite you to say that out loud, FLASH GOT KILLED WITH A GUN.
That's just depressing, lazy and creatively bankrupt.
Well okay Gabby, you say, the League dies by guns but at least their powers were put to the fullest in adrenaline rush battles, right?- well dear reader, I gotta tell you something, come here, come closer...OF COURSE NOT!
If you think adrenaline rush is just shooting a tiny little pixel 500kms away or a massive bullet-sponge figure, then yea, that's very exciting. What a complete waste of potential. All these battles are either: Sit around and wait for X to stand still and shoot him or spam bullets to giant dude until he goes down, while also dodging baby's bullet hell.

And the music, oh god the music. YOU'RE KILLING A GOD!!! MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING PLEASE. Why is it that the boss themes are just some stupid generic 30 second drums loop? It's just sad.

The treatment to these characters isn't any better, I did not need to see Batman, one of my childhood heroes murder a woman or break some guy's neck- it's just there for the wow factor and not even the good kind, it's just the edginess for the sake of being edgy.
Yes, it's the game's premise, they're evil, they're gonna do horrible acts- but come the fck on, at least treat them with respect and dignity they deserve. Superman! The allegory for what humanity needs to strive for! Reduced to nothing but a psychopath who kills one of his best friends without second thought.
It's lazy, it's gross- it's awful.
They will 110% bring back these characters with that BS other dimensions plot but it's little too late- you ruined it.

And the final boss for the vanilla game, Brainiac! This is it, the big bad guy. This is gonna be epic. After grinding every side quest, doing all possible things before the battle. I was so ready to take him on.

I entered his arena, his gaze so glamorous and badass, the excellent voice- sassy, narcissistic and smart. This is it Squad let's- wait what's that? Hold up, what do you mean your body got modified? WHY DID YOU TURNED INTO PURPLE CRYSTAL DIARRHEA FLASH?! WHY THE FCK IS THIS THE SAME BOSS FIGHT AS THE FLASH?!
Yes, they reused the same Flash boss for Brainiac, the same boring-wait-for-him-to-stand-still-Flash.
What a joke. And not to mention, I was so decked out I killed him in under a minute.

Rocksteady you made a Live Service looter shooter okay. Fine. Tell me the loot is good- wait what? It isn't?
This is probably the worse loot pool in any looter-shooter I've ever played, the guns lack personality, I can't for the love of me tell you of a single gun I got. This game is lacking it's Destiny'ish Exotics, big personality guns. Something DIFFERENT and CREATIVE. I need to get excited when something drops! And there's none of that here.

Okay, boring guns but at least the enemies are cool, right? NUH-UH.
There's almost no enemy variety in the whole game; small dude with gun, small fast dude with gun, big dude with cannon, big dude with big arms, tank with purple acne, chopper with purple acne and annoying ass sniper.
1 faction and it's the most boring and lacking in personality ever.

The positives don't outvalue the negatives, they still don't make it worth it.

Main story is a great fun time and the endgame content is a fun grind with great gear and rewards the further you get. Really fun and addicting game play and traversal movement. My favorite part about the endgame is earning higher difficult levels and mastery levels making the game more difficult and challenging. Putting your gear, load out, and talents to the test.

Should you wait for a sale?: 
Sure. If you want to. Or if you really want to give it a try buy the standard edition and refunded if you don't like it. 

Can the objectives get repetitive?: Of course. But the grind to earn all the end game Bane gear, difficultly levels, and fun game play make up for it. Honestly the objective are not that bad. If you have played Destiny 2, you are use to doing the same objectives over and over again.

Despite all the negative reviews for this game, I'm a firm believer that this game is genuinely a good product and allows for a good amount of fun regardless of if you play solo or co-op. I think that the looter shooter aspects were done excellently and the grind for higher tier weapons feels very worth the time. Now as for the story, I have to be honest when I say I didn't expect such a laughably bad story from Rocksteady, especially how disrespectfully they killed off Kevin Conroy's Arkham Batman. I am completely aware that the name ""Kill the Justice League"" outright tells you you're going to be killing off Arkham Batman, but I wish they had a remorseful side to the Suicide Squad at least, I wish they had a moment where they realize that they are just a bunch of crooks killing the worlds greatest protectors. I've heard a quite a few people mention that this is the Suicide Squad and the Suicide Squad has no reason feel anything towards the Justice League, but I  feel they could've at least made the player feel bad, rather than giving us 5-10 seconds to mourn and then move on. Overall, I can confidently say I DO recommend this game to people who want a fast paced PVE shooter with playable DC Comic villains, but I do NOT recommend this game to people who want a story rich Arkham Knight sequel. I love this game and I know a lot of other players do too so I know I'm not alone when I say, I want this game to succeed. I respect the people who do and don't like this game, but if you hate it, don't shame others for loving it. I'd rate Suicide Squad Kill The Justice League 7/10 overall, 4/10 for the story and 8/10 for the gameplay.",1708294976,1708294976,True,2,1,0.491816312074661255,0,True,False,False

I'm not going to sit here and act like it's flawless however, because it's not. I'll break down all the areas of the game I want to talk about and go over each briefly.

[b][h3] Story [/h3][/b]
The story is one that obviously doesn't really make a whole lot of sense and relies on a ton of plot armour or explanations to things that happen out of convenience to keep it moving forward.
I'm not too familiar with DC to begin with so this didn't really bother me, nor did I go into this expecting a story that would be realistic in universe so this is more of a personal gripe, decide yourself whether that's a deal breaker.

In general what I can say to sum it up, the beginning half of the game felt pretty fleshed out all things considered, characters got introduced and had build up.
The second half of the game feels the opposite, characters have a lot less screen time and impact. You never have a minute to take in what you just done because you're already moving forward to the next thing.

[b][h3] Gameplay [/h3][/b]
The game introduces things at a good pace throughout, you're constantly having upgrades or new things to experiment. 

The world is genuinely one of the best parts of the game, there's a sense of scale and each characters traversal around it feels great. It's also just beautiful to look at and each area of the game feels distinct.

There's enough enemies in there that get introduced throughout the game to keep things feeling fresh, but they all end up looking the same because they're all Brainiac's enemies. A second faction could help break this up but it wouldn't really make sense in the story as Brainiac has taken over the world.

[b][h3] Bosses [/h3][/b]
Flash and Green Lantern's fights were actually great, I love how chaotic it gets throughout the phases of the fight. Flash's fight was grounded with Green Lantern's focusing more on height and shooting up at the sky. I do wish the last phases lasted a bit longer however because their health bars are too low to let it overwhelm you at that point.

Batman's had such a good build up and visually looked amazing. In terms of gameplay it's sadly the worst by a far margin, it doesn't build as the fight goes on unlike the previous two and ends so abruptly.
There's so much more they could have done. My personal suggestion would be to make numerous platforms you have to jump from because they're slowly crumbling or have Batman destroying them. Make weak spots around his body so that you need to use your traversal abilities to get around him to reach.

I'm left feeling mixed about Superman. I do like how he's constantly flying around making him a hard target to hit, his array of attacks are also varied but there could have been more spectacle towards the fight. It also has the most anti climactic ending unlike Green Lantern or the Flash's fights.

Brainiac, where do I begin. Why the hell did they think this was a good final boss for the base game?
I do want to see harder Justice League fights and there's no real complaints I have with the fight itself, but this should've been saved for DLC seasons.
I was expecting an actual fight with Brainiac with unique attacks, what a huge disappointment.

[b][h3] Difficulty [/h3][/b]
This game is just too easy, despite playing on the hardest difficulty I never struggled at any point. I've only lost due to modifiers with side quests that required me to swap weapon or affliction that would allow me to kill the enemies.
As a quick example the burning affliction doesn't allow you to shield harvest, so Hack's missions that only allow you to kill them with shield harvests become a pain in the arse.

The game never feels like it's challenging you, because of this it doesn't require you to experiment with builds or look at synergy with abilities and weapons. It's definitely there but not even needed, this can all be fixed with a bit more challenge on the hardest difficulty, or just add a new harder difficulty for those like myself wanting it.

I was really hoping the boss battles with the Justice League would be a challenge, requiring me to have numerous attempts to beat, sadly that's not the case. Season 1 of the game's live service does specify new boss fights, implying the final boss fight but with the other Justice League members instead of the Flash. The thing is the Brainiac fight also is not hard either.

[b][h3] Performance [/h3][/b]
The game doesn't perform as well as I would have hoped for a game of this scale. My computer is of the upper end and I can run various other visually rich games perfectly fine, yet with this game I need to lower my graphics to the minimum to have a consistent frame rate of 60.

There also is various instances of crashing or low FPS when I have a ton of enemies or particle effects going off, this is a problem that I hope gets addressed.

[b][h3] Monetisation [/h3][/b]
I don't think this game is worth the full price tag they ask for despite there being a clear large amount of money and talent poured into it, I'd highly recommend waiting for a sale if you are considering purchase. I don't think there's quite enough here to justify it as of writing.

The shop included in game is fine, it's only got costume colours available and as far as I'm aware will only ever sell cosmetics so I don't see an issue. The game also has stated that all future DLC content will be released free so I genuinely have no complaints here if they're making all their future profits from cosmetic micro transactions.

[b][h3] Conclusion [/h3][/b]
Overall I do enjoy this game and am left feeling happy with my purchase, I'll continue to play it for as long as they choose to support it. I did have a fun time playing through the game with friends and there's for sure fun to be had. I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as the vast majority of the internet seem to make it out to be.

I would recommend waiting for a sale if you're reading reviews to know whether or not to buy it, or maybe even wait and see what the public reception is to the game in a year or so to see how it's doing then. I do hope for the best for the game and look forward to season 1 onward.",1708285171,1708285171,True,3,1,0.49656340479850769,0,True,False,False

***UPDATED***

If this game was cheaper it probably would have gone a lot better. I think the game is really good in terms of the story, game play, and loot.

None of it boils down to being, errr ""perfect"", but it's got legs, you clearly tell they care about this game, they're trying something new, and when Arkham Knight came out everyone hated on that game too and they tried to make that game right as well. My copium (since everyone who is a massive hater calls it that then takes a dump on something then beg for it to fail for reasons unknown instead of wanting things to be good) is they (Rocksteady) bring that mentality to this game and try to over correct as they did with Arkham Knight, because it's kind of wild that 9 year old game got a skin in it three months ago.

I will say, the side activities, and even the tasks in the main story missions, are repetitive. Got to the place, shoot all the things, repeat. Not sure I expected anything else from it, to be honest. 
I think much of the negativity in reviews of this game is because people were expecting something they didn't get. People expected Rocksteady to give us more Arkham Asylum/City/Knight, and this isn't it. Having never played those myself (they're in my backlog), I didn't expect anything and I found a fun way to kill some of my precious few hours on this earth.

PS2: Due to haters there is not enough people playing the game, probs most play on consoles i bet, either way i'll be fine as they release these 4 seasons at least and add offline mode as they announced before turning off servers so i can play the game solo in 10 years if i'll want to come back to it.

Better than I thought. 

Haven't finished playing the entire game, but so far this game is rocking a hard B+ to A- in terms of game play grading quality.

Pros:
Closest thing to multiplayer Arkham Game since Origins but with Arkham Knight graphics and upgraded abilities, has Kevin Conroy, and a decent, somewhat smooth story. 

Cons:
Most annoying things are the repetitive music with each hostile encounter, some repeated lines the characters use if you play the same person for too long, other AI accidentally pass through enemy vision and engage without you initiating it which is super annoying, and naturally the Riddler challenges.

Everything else makes it more suited to an extended, alternate Arkhamverse, which is exciting - if that is the case, and holding hope for it, but also sad because of the late actor who truly brought Batman into games back into 2009, and can no longer continue his legacy - I hope they don't use an inauthentic AI voice modulator or think a meaningless writeoff to be their only solution.

Ideas:

Just wish they allowed players to play a Flashback sequence where they can play as THE Justice League characters, switching between them all, just to experience how the takeover happened - that, would of been amazing. Or LexCorp vs A.R.G.U.S turf war. That, and more option for specialised melee combat / takedowns that Rocksteady used to do well, per character, rather than guns and flimsy combat at times, because of the operatives in the story, but that's just me.

If I had to give it a grading right this second out of 10, it would be a 7.5/10 or 8.5/10 because it has Kevin Conroy.

Hope this helped.

- C

Revisting the game:

It's boring, story finishes and the game dies off with repetitive grinding missions. I don't like looter shooters. I like open world adventure through a DC world with combat that has been a standard for Rocksteady since 2009 in Arkham Asylum, not firearms.

Empty gem pinata.

1) Gameplay and gun mechanics are pretty good, traversal across the world is decent, it could be significantly better. Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while being a looter shooter. Similar in say to Sunset Overdrive and Saints Row IV. 
2) The world you find yourself in is very well built. Metropolis looks incredible at all parts of the story.
3) The story is pretty good, the only draw back on it like others said is the fact its connected to the Arkham Universe. I played a lot of the arkham games growing up and loving them. And this game doesn't seem to do justice to them too well.
4) A really big red flag is the fact that steam is deleting negative reviews. I've had to push myself through the repetitive-ness as a casual gamer who doesn't take it too seriously but really enjoys story based games. That being said the game is not incredible enough to have very positive reviews, and almost no negative reviews.
5) The game is live service is a major draw back to the game.

All in all, the game is good enough, but not at the price tag it's at. Gameplay is repetitive at times, and you often have to push yourself through just to find out what happens in the story.

The story has some great moments and personally for me a lot of good laughs. The voice acting and facial expressions are excellent.

I can totally understand that some followers and fans are disappointed due to the excellent Arkham series made by Rocksteady Studios. But for a looter shooter fan this game could be a good investment of time, getting into crafting, builds and challenge yourself with getting higher into the mastery levels. That's the specific type of gamer I mentioned earlier, which are not burned out to run the same missions over and over again for loot, materials and be confronted with the same mission on a more difficult challenge.

Unfortunately after fighting IGN bad review or any social media attack, I'm unable to defend it anymore. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND the game at all right now, maybe you can give it a try if you find it at 15 euros in the future once these issues and bugs have been addressed, unless server closes earlier.

UPDATE 16/02. Game is still broken, 2 days ago they release the first patch which is effectively  a nerf. 2 days ago Devs on Discord stated they DON'T KNOW the cause of the connectivity issue yet after 3 weeks, this is utterly disgusting.

The live-service portion of this game is goofy. ""Did you, fellow gamer, play Arkham games even after beating it? Do all the missions, collect all the riddler garbage? Then how about a live service game where we want you to do that, pretty please?""

It's not as toxic as most live service models, but the game would absolutely be better without it.

However, I still wanted to buy it for Kevin Conroys last video game performance as batman. I am sad to say I was about 80% right with this one and here's some pros and cons as to why:

Pros:
-The story told via cutscenes especially in the first few hours are absolutely fantastic, we get introduced to the squad one by one then see them interact together for the first time and to walk around some places that have a lot of lore about the justice league and even quite early on an area that gives you a quick reminder on the arkham games story and characters up to this point, So great stuff there but there are some downsides to this I need to point out in the cons column.
-Next, the batman sections are very scripted (this sounds like a con but compared to the other JL members it's actually a pro and feels more like what this game could have been if it was a complete solo experience) and feels like you are going toe to toe with the batman as he uses what he does best to take you down however, they do screw even this up right at the end. 
-The main squad feels pretty well done and they do have some humour here and there that works i especially like the dynamic between harleys jokes and king shark being the deadpan straight man and boomerang can be funny as they lean very into the Australian thing for him. 
-The game looks gorgeous and metropolis feels like a picturesque city that contrasts very well against gotham from previous games, its very bright and colourful and feels very 70s in areas but with a modern twist. That's all I can give for pros as it's all cons from here.

Cons:
-firstly I have to mention why those lore sections have downsides its because its a multiplayer game and as soon as you get into the first of these multiplayer is unlocked and it's not really all that fun for teammates to listen to 2-3 min long dialogue speeches and they will more than likely wander off and push the narrative forward or get annoyed at you meaning if you want to listen to all the lore and character reactions best to do it in solo. 
-This could also be a problem in the main story with cutscenes and randos but I couldn't tell you as I played solo. 
-The story also takes a turn at the end from being exciting to straight up insulting to batman's legacy and then expects us to sit in a situation that isn't actually resolved all for the sake of a crap live service style story without spoiling ill just say this Avengers release story ended better. 
-Next up is gameplay and man I wanted to like this one but it just gets so very repetitive with the same enemies, objectives and feeding into my next point same locations constantly over and over again (especially post credits). 
-The games map size is very small for this kind of game as you will have to do the repeating mission types very often in areas you have been before, you can travel the length of the map in about 2 mins it just feels so miniscule and the verticallity of the map barely matters at all as most of the map is on a low level and you can climb pretty fast anyway. 
-The loot absoLOOTly sucks for a looter shooter as you don't get levelled loot or loot with very varied stats the only thing that majorly effects stats is rarity of the loot and that's it, i used the same gun throughout the entirety of the game and i was still using it into the endgame, this could be considered a good point for those that don't care about looters and just want to experience the story but for those who do like looters shooters I doubt this will drag you away from other games that do it so much better because this games loot doesn't really make you change up your playstyle at all to compensate for getting a new more damaging gun.
-The character trees are absolute garbage that aside from 3 ability style moves (which are the same across all characters and 1 of them isnt even in the trees) its all just percentages and even though the game shows 3 separate skill trees this is a red herring as you get all 3 trees as you level up and you will sometimes have a choice of skill for that level. 
-Finally, the item shop and live service elements are utterly egregious the items in the store are way overpriced for some of the most boring skins I have seen for example the legendary versions of skins cost 2400 credits and you can only buy 1500ish or 3000 and they are both way more than should be expected to pay. 
-There's also a daily lootbox that you have to upgrade by shooting down 50 or so of these drones to upgrade the loot in it and this resets to common daily which is maddeningly stupid

After having completed the game about 12 hours in with all the side missions I decided to play the preseason for a while longer and I've got to say I got disappointed more and more towards the end. I will go back and check the game out again when season 1 drops to see if it is worth it in anyway post launch but I've got to say I doubt it. 

So for my score I'd have to go with and overall  5/10.

Story: 6/10 (beginning is pretty good but the end let's it down)
Gameplay: 2/10

- Hard to pick up, easy to master mechanics

Anyone who gives this game a low rating is because they expect it to be something it's not. People expect Arkham gameplay and because they don't get it. It get's them mad and they rate this game low.

If Destiny ( Because of its customization} and Guardians of The Galaxy (because of the combat) had a baby, you get Suicide Squad. What sets it apart is how abilities open up after you reach a 10x 20x 30x 40x 50x combo that create amazingly wild new abilities in your weapons. ( I won't spoil it)

Suicide Squad is a fast-paced action shooter who's focus is on fast action-shooting gameplay, character & weapon customization and cooperative play which don't exist in Arkham games. You can play hours of this game with friends and have fun looting, shooting and completing missions. Not in Arkham. THAT'S THE TRADE. The focus was not on story. The focus was on the multiplayer experience long term. 

A huge pro for this game is the ongoing content that will be released and potential to keep you coming back to this game for a long time. It has potential to be 10/10 with all the future content if done right. Gameplay is too much fun and even better with friends as you compete for the highest scores and fanciest combos

The other rip is on the voice actors who once you let go of the current actors you've seen on big screen ( Will Smith, Margot Robbie) you appreciate the performances. Just like in Guardians of the Galaxy.

Overall if you came solely for a single player experience, I would wait for the game on discount. If you came for a multiplayer game that has a ton of replay value because of the story ( i won't spoil it) I think it's worth the money and you will have a blast. 

The game opens up in the end like a game about it's potential like I've never seen before.

It resembles an arcade beat em' up a la Smash Bros rhythm and combat in an open world with a good story. I'm enjoying the game immensely, flaws and all. 

Pros:
====================
Massive map to get lost in. Lots of verticality (is that even a word? I hear it a lot) 
Great graphics. 
Good story.
Great controls.
Killer combat

Cons:
====================
Extremely repetetive missions
Lukewarm crafting system
Lifeless city - more locked doors than open, I just got out of Dying Light, so I'm fairly predjudiced about this one, also a long running gaming pet peeve for open world exploration games.

Make John Constantine a character

maybe some of the Doom Patrol and Invisibles

for one its not worth the price tag, and the ability to actually Change your squad is a downright lie, there are 4 characters with as far as we can tell planned 4 characters added. Continuously evolving? Not really?

The roster is a complete sausage fest with Harley Quinn being the Only female character, which results in anyone wanting to play a female character, automatically running into duplicate after duplicate and sometimes even ending up in a team of 4 Harley's upto season 3 there are no more females planned, and no real hope for Ivy being a playable as she is an NPC, which wastes a lot of her battle potential, including the fact of party variation.

 The next are Joker, Deathstroke, Freeze, Killer Croc, and Killer Frost which still wont resolve that plain and simple Problem, up until Killer Frost, which still leaves 8 males and 2 females. and No, this isn't Only about female characters, but having only 1 while promising you can make your Own team, and since release having only 4 characters, its simply not true. The game also forces you to train each of the 4, which is an underhanded mechanic of forcing you to play things you have no interest in playing, to lazily, get around the fact you aren't tending to preferences, in most cases you'll end up in parties with duplicates or playing things you don't wanna play, simply because there's no real roster to pick from(yet) and squad talents mandating it. 

Albeit a little hopeful, due to the game being really intoxicating and well done. Even just high fiving people has an odd charm to it. But starting at gender variation, and proceeding on to some people so capable they can do anything alone (Mostly Shark) and others being on the iffier sides of playing with and surviving. There is naturally going to be power gaps in the squad due to the lore, but the fact does remain, there is no real choice in what to play, since your preferences will most likely lock you into a specific playstyle only one squad member properly embodies for you, the problem with that is, that there are more playstyles than squad members, and this squad is hardly tapping into the magical and mystical aspects that add to the suicide squad being so unique. 

But if you're looking for the likes of Diablo and Enchantress tearing apart the city, you are going to be sorely disappointed with your options. And yes i know its Kinda a sequal to Batman, But in making this they also Kinda agreed to variate and really explore their roster options, and they simply have Not done so, even with the planning they're still sticking with Gotham leaving far more appealing and interesting playables to add, completely at the sidelines. 

The gameplay is Fluent, there's plenty to do, and it certainly has its ways to keep you engaged, it is simply that the roster for starters does Not have a lot of options to do the same. Earning your daily crates shooting down drones is alright for a day or 2, but it quickly becomes tedious, as does re-running the same things over and over and over including side quests you already did just because someone else Didn't.

And people are allowed to access things they have no capability of doing, like mastery stages while they haven't done Any side quests, for your convenience you Can see that on your map, as their side quests will show up, but you cannot tell Who's they are, and your only real option is to either carry em through it, or carry em through the mastery stage, even though they have no real right to be there. And they wont be much help. It is a great start, i just don't see people sticking around for longer than a week at this rate, because of the roster, duplicates, ""free""  cosmetics, half of which still in a store behind paid currency. Inability to actually chat / communicate, location markers (player placed) that keep vanishing. And actually surprisingly quick to finish story line so far. 

Now, don't get me wrong, the mechanics are lovely, each member does feel unique, it looks Great. It plays pretty much seamlessly. The interactions between Shark and the rest are already to die for, especially between him and Harley. But for example, a character like Shark, shines in melee, but mastery stages have the basic AND CONSTANT mutation of mobs blowing up in your face if you get too close, making that entirely useless. And these mutations aren't listed in clear sight, you have to press R2 to be able to read them, and half the players seem to be incapable of understanding what the glossary even Is. Either way you wont be using your melee. 

Another thing they semi-lied about is the weapon options, we were told we'd get a Choice between 6 weapons, to wield 2 at a time, and a melee. Now the Latter, checks out. But, the Former.. Each squad member only has access to 3 of the 6 firearms. Making it much less of a choice between 6 and more a choice of 2/3 to take. Which is another way they Force you to play a specific squad member as a main, for example, if you want to use a sniper, Harley and Shark do NOT have access to them. So you'll automatically be forced to play Deadshot or Boomerang.

 There's also no real way to combine your squad members in assault. There are no shared execution moves where 2 join up to murder a brute. Rather than 1 engaging it with a move and the other having to wait it out before engaging or shooting it while its doing so. IF you're looking for squad combo executions, you're gonna have to go to MARVEL! xD 

Speaking of brutes, they're so badly designed you cant even kill em properly, especially in mastery stages, their attacks have an impossible range, with no real ability to dodge them at all, counter windows that are impossible to strike if it hits you, and self destruction over a range that is legit BATCRAP on both damage and AoE, cuz you can be 30 meters away from it, if it blows up, it will still kill you, which is complete crap. they're constantly lagging out, abusing blind spots consistantly for no reason at all, and theyre entirely unkillable with way too much hp way too much defense, way too much damage, and no proper hit staggers or even reactions, there is no way to kill em without them blowing up, and if they blow up they kill everyone. 

How bout you START with actually making a brute properly combatable, you cant fight 3 brutes at the same time, let alone infused, while choppers are shooting you in the butt. None of that is even proper design, thats you admitting you're out of ideas and not meeting demands. And for the record, King Shark is Not the only creature that can fight off Superman. Superman has a weakness to Magic, any character of a magic nature or mystical origin can combat him, likely even kill him. 

This game feels like a great start, but it does not feel finished, it feels like you're waiting for a next chapter that never comes. Moves and usage of openings that do not exist(possibly yet). And characters they may shaft you on til the very end. Most already refunded or left the game, soo congratz, another great concept wasted only because you had to prematurely release an unfinished game.

After Arkham Knight, I kind of knew they were never going to make the next big Batman game for the series (just because that's usually the lifetime of series like that). I wasn't expecting this game to do any justice but to entertain me at least and yeah sure it did that.

Before playing this game, I watched every review known to man about how this game sucks yet I bought it anyways because I genuinely wanted to see for myself. There was moments that really were repetitive like every single mission excluding the boss fights but there were also moments in the story or gameplay that really shined (which I was not expecting). Obviously this game is not designed for an Arkham fan with maybe me being the only exception but as much as I hate to say it, I genuinely enjoyed it. It's not going to change your life but it'll be a fun time to sink your hours into single player. It's definitely for a different type of person and maybe I'm brain dead enough to like this change of ADHD pace. Regardless, I think it's worth a shot if you can get over the DC fanboy and rebellion for corporate greed in you. Oh and a spare $70 lying around. :(

Now, onto the gameplay. Taking control of characters like Harley Quinn and Deadshot felt like stepping into their shoes – each with their own unique style and moves. The best part? Switching between characters seamlessly during combat. It adds a whole new layer of strategy and keeps you on your toes.

But what really hooked me were the characters and story. Sure, it's action-packed, but it's also surprisingly deep. Getting to know the motivations and fears of our antihero squad made me root for them even more. And going head-to-head with the Justice League? Talk about intense!

(New Review) I cannot recommend this game to anyone in the current state it is in. I paid for deluxe edition early access. Day one of early access was locked out of mastery level incursions due to a known bug from progressing another players mastery levels while in online coop locking you out of your own. I said OK things happen, games brand new, will get fixed as the bug had been reported and mass voted for on the forums very early on. we are now over 2 weeks in. Developers release the first patch this morning and was excited to finally be able to play the game I bought a deluxe edition for. Open the patch notes and its like a 3 line Nerf to a build that was breaking the endgame for players who could actually play the game. NO MAJOR BUG FIXES. majority of players I've spoken to either cannot access the game past the first loading screen or have a major bug preventing progress. THE RELEASE STATE OF THIS GAME is actually unacceptable for a product that cost any amount of money let alone the amount this game did. I consider this game me getting scammed out of 100$+ as I was sold something that doesn't work. As i waited for the patch I levelled the other characters I wasn't playing and did some of the side stuff. The problem with that is now I cannot refund this steaming pile of game as I have too many hours. BUT if I could refund it I 100% would.

Game was working great for me till yesterday, now i cannot even connect to servers, but only 1/4 of the people are facing this issue. (just check their Discord). 
anyway, if anyone is deciding about purchasing, wait for a few updates to let things get stable at server side.

Pros
Movement - Movement is probably the biggest part about this game as being very mobile adds flow to the game like ultrakill people like that game mainly for its movement

Progression - to me the progression is very interesting with the fact there are so many things to do like getting resources to make better weapons to deal more damage against bosses and enemies but this can only be done by progressing the story, as well as getting to the point off being able to get Icon weapons

Story  - the game actually has a decent story which leads to things like weapon crafting and other things which i think are actually perfect as well as the fact some of the story is actually funny

I could go and talk about a ton of fun things about the game but I want to keep it short and these are like the main things

Cons
Movement - Yes I said movement was pro which it is BUT one thing i have a problem about it is ""momentum"" the game says Harley is based around momentum but she really isn't after one swing you don't increase in speed or anything which makes her feel so boring, as well as boomerang as after every speedforce throw or whatever you call it he basically stops, AND deadshots jetpack feels way too slow even if you can make it faster through leveling him up i find that way annoying like its a god dahm jetpack make it fast,

Resources - Short little comment but some missions give you next to no resources at all


Now theres a lot of other stuff but at the time of typing this i forgot most of it, 

Do I suggest this game to others? Well Its all based on if you like Dc or action packed movement games as well as if you like games that constantly get updates as this game will be getting a ton.

i play all arkham games and origins and i love them all and watch and read everything about batman

now let's talk about  Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League after i play it more than 44 hours
first i want to say i played a lot of looter shooter games and i never get hooked to a looter shooter game like this one ..
 

gameplay : the game have the most fresh gameplay i played for a long long long time .. i finish the story and and i'm still playing to max level all the characters and i'm still excited it and never get bored because the combat is fun and so addictive  .. even some people say it's repetitive and i never felt that because the combat it's so unique and fresh and u can play it in different ways with different characters and what's make me excited more it's live service game so i get to have more content every season and go back the game and play with my friends again .. ohh man i'm all in  

 the story : i love the story and suicide squad members they are so good and fun as hell .. i never laugh in a game like this in my life and the cut-scenes it's in another level in this game .. it's really fun story and i enjoy it a lot .. and it's crazy to me people say it's disrespectful about factional characters .. i'm almost 30 years old now and i don't give damn about how they treat factional characters as long it's good story and explained well and fun and Tbh damn they treat batman so good in this game .. he is Fn scary and will follow u everywhere

The story is awful and the justice league isn't even going to be important going forward so why wasnt it called suicide squad kill brainiac, and even if they bring them back like the leaks and rumors say, then what the hell was the point in killing them. Another thing is that this game should NOT have been part of the arkham universe since for one there are barely any references to those games and it makes absolutely no sense for batman to come back after the ending of knight. In fact the only arkham game that I've played is city and I went into this game completely blind without seeing any trailers or any gameplay from the other arhkam games and I understood everything, so the only reason I could think of for this to take place in the arkham universe is so that more people would buy it. The suicide squad themselves are thoroughly unenjoyable as well. Dead shot is just some guy and doesn't do anything worth noting, captain boomerang can be funny sometimes but obnoxious most of the time, harley sucks since they made her almost exactly like her new iteration with her new personality which I hate with every fiber of my being, and then there's king shark which is the best character from a personality and a gameplay standpoint but even then his personality dwindles towards the end of the game. One thing I will give the game credit for is the core gameplay itself as traveling from place to place is pretty fun though I only played as king shark and I definitely wasn't playing as harley since her movement sucks. The boss fights, while being terrible from a narrative standpoint, I found pretty fun from a gameplay standpoint surprisingly, except for batman and brainiacs fights since brainiacs is just a carbon copy of flashs and batmans is just really bad since he doesn't move, his attacks are so slow and easy to dodge, and the whole buildup to the fight took so long and was so boring and made absolutely no sense how harley even made the gas mixture to counteract batmans, it just made me not care for it. The leagues deaths are also pathetic as well since flash, superman, and brainiac all just flop on the ground with randomly physics, and in flashs case he gets pissed on directly after, green lanterns clothes fade away, leaving him in his underwear making me not able to take his death seriously along with the terrible king shark ring scene which makes absolutely no damn sense, and don't even get me started on batmans death, I could go on all day about how disrespectful it is to arkham batman and his game legacy, and how after harley shoots him with a revolver and yet a bullet shell can be heard falling on the ground (nice one) but it's just so bad I'm not even gonna bother ranting about it. Wonder woman's death is the only one that they spent effort on and even then it doesn't make any sense why the squad is sad about her dying despite wonder woman disregarding them through the whole game. They should've been sad about flash dying too since he saved their lives like wonder woman did so what the hell. The game makes the league look completely braindead as superman and lantern want to greet the alien arriving to earth unprompted in a giant metal skull with open arms. This then leads me to the plot armor since there is absolutely no reason why none of the league members just completely kill the squad immediately at any point especially flash and superman since flash could easily tear out their hearts like he did to lex and superman could easily use his heat vision on them from a distance but instead decides to hit them up close with cars, yeah that makes sense. This game should not be 70 dollars by the way, it should've been 50 at most especially since most of the game isn't even out yet and there is nothing so outstanding in this game to warrant the 70 dollars. Along with that there's overpriced in game currency that you can use to buy overpriced in game costumes with no way of earing the costumes or currency in game for free. Some other things to point out are how the skill tree feels completely pointless and doesn't do anything all that noteworthy to your characters, there's too many repetitive missions in the game, especially the escort missions where you wait for a car to move slow as hell on a straight path, Amanda waller being as unlikable as the squad which may or may not have been intentional, the riddler trophies and missions adding absolutely nothing to the game and to my knowledge it isn't even explained why the riddlers here or giving you these challenges, and the next few dlc characters looking to be as bad as the squad now with a joker who is too riddled with insecurities to know if he even is the joker, Victoria freeze instead of Mr freeze for some reason, Zoe Lawton which I can guarantee nobody asked for,(and I really do not care for dead shots and green lanterns beef with each other in the game, it equates to nothing and his daughter isn't even important at least not right now so there really was no point to it) and deathstroke which might be cool but knowing current rocksteady and how they handled most of the other characters I wouldn't be surprised if they screwed him up too. In conclusion, suicide squad kill the justice league is an overpriced looter shooter that was made to disrespect the universe it's set in and the characters it has set up and introduced, one literally being the main character of the game series prior to this, with unnecessary microtransactions, pointless rewards, missions, skill tree, and side quests, with an abysmal story with abysmal writing that either ruins any pre-established character development or ruins the characters later in the game, that has no right being canon to the arkham universe since it's so bad it actively ruins the legacy of the previous games (and ironically this game would've been better had it not been set in the arkham universe). You're paying 70 dollars for a game that's not even done and has a completely misleading title in the long run, and has a terrible main cast of characters on top of that. Do not buy this game and if you really want to, at least wait for it to go on sale first, like I said, this game is not worth 70 dollars in the slightest and youll feel disappointed and unsatisfied by the end, especially with the abrupt ending. It's a 4/10 at best and should've just been a justice league game from the start. This game is pointless.",1707872208,1707872208,False,18,0,0.505585908889770508,0,True,False,False
315210,158197706,76561198229880384,0,4,3405,27,3378,1708459067,"I have almost 100% complete Season 0 of this game (with Season 1 coming out in a couple of weeks) and I promise the amount of hate on this game is undeserved :D if u don't want to read all this just check out the TL;DR hahaha

I want to clarify that I have played all the Arkham Games and read all of the Arkham Comics, and despite there being a couple of moments in the story I didn't particularly like, it did not ruin the game for me or the Arkhamverse at all.

The game is quite honestly a ton of fun and I can see myself playing it a lot, however I want to explain why this game isn't as bad as people are saying:

Money Hungry? - This game is not money hungry. The ONLY thing they charge for at the moment is cosmetics. Which compared to the amount of content you get for free (including ALL the new characters they will be introducing such as Joker, Mister Freeze, Deathstroke etc.) is nothing. There's also obtainable cosmetics in game!

Story - This is another untrue thing I've seen a lot. The story obviously isn't phenomenal like RDR2 or Last of Us etc. but it's by no means bad. It's an average story with funny moments and some REALLY bada** moments. 

Boss Fights - The Boss Fights however I think is more up to your preference, if you're wanting quick time events or something similar you probably won't like them, but otherwise they're good and loyal to the characters. The way you defeat the characters makes sense, they explain it pretty well. Without spoiling anything, they make the Boss Fights so good cause you're not just fighting against a Boss, you're fighting against their Superpower/s as well. The only Boss Fight in the game I thought could have been better was Superman, but every other one was great. (Especially Batman).

Gameplay - The gameplay is pretty great (but don't expect it to be like the Arkham combat system, it's a Looter Shooter). Shooting enemies, juggling them in the air, using your special abilities and traversal all in tandem is super satisfying and feels awesome. To add to this, the AMOUNT of gear is unreal, there is so much and it's abilities are all customisable. There's even DC Villain Themed Gear Sets which give bonuses that allow you to become incredibly strong. The Endgame is also really good with a decent amount to do (and seemingly a lot more to come). I will say however, I can see why some people can find the Endgame repetitive, as it mostly consists of you repeating missions on different Mastery Levels to get better and better gear, but if you're like me and love farming for new gear then it won't be a problem. 

TL;DR

UPDATE 13/02/24 - As it stands I can't seem to get more than one hour through the game without constant freezing, and then it will crash due to a network error. This has been happening more frequently and has ruined some of the end game missions for me, and the resources it takes to do these missions do not get refunded or returned. So to rocksteady, fix your game before you aggravate even more players.


After what people are saying, I can see why they're frustrated and annoyed with this game. It is not a Batman game, and that's not a bad thing. But! The single player experience could have been better, and the missions less repetitive. The story is really the best thing about this game, but I am looking forward to the DLC in the future. If this game is on sale, and you're looking for a co-op loot shooter, great, you can't go wrong. I do feel everyone had high expectations for this game, and that's essentially the downfall. Rocksteady should have tried a little harder, but it is what it is.",1707495540,1707862883,False,0,0,0.510043621063232422,0,True,False,False

In terms of the storytelling, I enjoyed the Suicide Squad's banter and characterization - I think their development from hostility towards eachother to a more caring team mentality is handled pretty well.

FOR GAMEPLAY; it is disappointing, yes it is open world, yes it has ""UNIQUE"" mobility, and YES YOU CAN ONLY PLAY ONLINE SESSION even if you play alone,

 (spoiler?)Combat is basically a third person shooter that forces you to play melee so you can shoot them  LOL what a move. and the talent points allocation that leans to a build for combos is basically a preference for people who wants to fight longer, but the minmax or should I say the most appropriate build for talent point allocation are the ones that involves  the special moves which increses damage,build up etc. the combo oriented build is for people that don't want to use the special moves in which case the games ""only special feature"".

- Dynamic and fun, not so easily mastered but feels right when you start to get the hang of it
- More complex than it originally seems
- Very much a 3rd person cranked up Borderlands-like with a DC skin
- A fun ride with friends, but expect some bugs
- Actually respectful of the source material, it's a doomed universe, and despite the quirky tone, it's a pretty grim place. DC is full of these.
- A bit repetitive and lacking in enemy variety, as it's often the case in looters. Will hopefully get better over time.
- A bit too expensive at 70, but you do get the full content when you buy it (except for some cosmetics)

This game is NOT:
- A solo Arkham-like game
- A brawler
- A game where the heroes prevail
- As bad as the internet would like you to believe

Suicide has qualities and flaws that are mostly left out in favor of arguing about whether or not Rocksteady should have made another Arkham game instead, and/or if service games are ruining the industry, which are both pretty unfair ways to review it as they neglect what the game actually has to offer.

Suicide Squad is a fun shooter/looter, a bit unconventional at first due to the emphasis on traversal movement, but if you stick to it, you'll find it rewarding (if you feel flying/jumping/teleporting/swinging around A LOT while you shoot isn't gonna work for you, you should move on to another game, don't even bother). The story is fine, it's a doomed universe, everything goes south, you know it's bad when B-lister vilains are all that's left to save the world, no bright lights in the darkness this time around. It looks pretty good, animations, models and facial animations are incredible. The gameplay loop can be very satisfying and the gearing aspect of the game is suprisingly deeper and more engaging than expected.

BUT

It lacks enemy variety, biome variety, and activity variety. The gameplay itself is fun enough to keep you playing, but we could have done with a bit more overall diversity. The bosses are often underwhelming, not terrible, but not great either, but then again, you beat them for the story and you never see them again. The endgame is shooting, looting, powering up, rince and repeat with tougher enemies for better loot, as is always the case in looters. The game is pretty buggy in multiplayer, not game breaking buggy, but sometimes pretty annoying buggy. This should be fixed eventually. Not enough squad synergies, which is kind of a shame for a multiplayer coop game.

I know a lot of people are passionate about their Superheroes and the lore behind everything, but my knowledge is based off of either friends, other comments or just strictly cinema which we all know how that is.

That being said, this game is VERY fun to play. I thoroughly enjoy the vertical-fast-paced combat as well as the looter-shooter type weapon system, which initially caught my eye the first time i saw a video on it.

I think the story is very cool, I know I have been seeing some comments on how this being in the Arkham Knight series that it's a disappointment (never played myself but seen others play) or some disrespect to the heroes, but just going in oblivious to any of that, I think it was fantastic and fun. The characters mesh well and I really enjoyed all the side characters and cut scenes as well. I was engrossed in every cut scene and just enjoyed how the story panned out. I won't disrespect anyone's personal opinions on how ""Batman went out"" or any of of the various negatives that they see, but my mindset is just ""Its a fun game, whether its canon or alternate timelines, I'm just having a good time"", which I know is easier said than done.

Content in the game is cool, I see why people were bashing on the mission structure/variety of mission, considering there is only like 5-6 different missions at all (just spit balling, didn't really count), but the game play as a whole is so fun I didn't mind it all that much, though I understand why it is a sore point.

I have only really just started into the end game after the main story and I am excited about how to build-craft and see what types of weapons and gear I can obtain to see what kind of fun synergy I can have. The endgame missions themselves seem more of the same, with an added ""alternate dimension"" set piece that allows you to up the difficulty more and more as you play through, which I enjoy. 

Each character (while all having the main principle of swing around/shoot/melee/repeat) feels a little different, especially the more you play and learn their jump styles and movement, and that itself is just fun to learn. Each time I play another character, I get some sort of weapon or mod that boosts how I play and it becomes a new favorite.

All and all, I think this was a fantastic experience and wish it wouldn't get all the hate its getting. I do, however, understand that you can be passionate about stuff you like and when the product before you doesn't either meet expectations or downright is such an alternative to what you like or the vision you have, you are bound to have some resentment for it. 

I wish I didn't have to pay $70 for it, but I don't regret my purchase at all and am excited to see what the upcoming seasonal content brings to the table. This is definitely a game that, while I won't play 24/7 because at some point you've 'beaten' what you can, will be brought into my regular rotation of games I play.

Highly recommend that you try this fun game out and even if you don't agree with the story or setting, try to have fun with the game play that they have brought forth to us.

Game - 8/10

+ Beautiful graphics and usually solid performance
+ Yes, these aren't exactly the most imposing or infamous DC villains by default, but the squad is very likable, with great dialogue, and each character has fun aspects of their gameplay
+ Fantastic voice acting, love seeing Kevin Conroy and Tara Strong nail it as always

So I've updated to not recommend at this time, due to the nature of game breaking issues and poor performance experienced by everyone who has played the game.

I will be happy to recommend if these issues are addressed, as they have not been for over 2 weeks since early access release, other than comments from the developer and community leaders via Discord. No meaningful patches or server upgrades have been applied to the game.

I understand people were expecting something different from Rocksteady, but if you take out that expectation of it being another batman game, Suicide Squad is a decent game. Lets say if Suicide squad was made by a different studio, would have there been such negativity towards it??? I am not saying it's game the year, but the experience I have had playing the game over 30 hours, it was definitely worth my $70. The graphics and character models are some of the best I have ever seen. The missions are a little repetitive, but with all the traversal, there was good ways to make every interaction feel fresh, for me anyway... But I sometimes like a game where I don't have to think much and just shoot stuff... I loved the boss fights, especially the batman part, which I had almost shit my pants a couple times. I even felt the way batman went out was in good taste with the lead up to his final scene... Everyone was upset that Harley shot Batman, but didn't take account of what lead up to his demise. Also didn't Batman die in Gotham Knights as well??? Maybe I am wrong...

Another thing is I don't know how people finished the campaign in 10 hours... I mean, I did take my time and enjoyed the game, but it took me 20 hours to finish the story part and still hadn't finished all the side stuff... I also jumped back a forth to different characters so I have not maxed any of the characters out as of now, they are all around lvl 20 at 30 hours in... That's another thing I liked is I played most of the game solo, so I could jump back and forth from the different characters on the fly. Which is something that bothered me about a game like Guardians of the Galaxy, where you stuck with playing only as Starlord the entire game...

[list]
[*]Traversal - Each character is not only unique in how they play, but in how they [i]move[/i]. One of the reasons Anthem's failure was such a disappointment, was because despite the game as a whole being unfinished and unpolished, was that their core traversal / freedom of movement was so satisfying. This game offers a visually pleasing, open map with total freedom of movement.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Loot - The large majority of looter shooters on the market use an item power level rating. This means that as you level up, your gear becomes obsolete. You're on an upgrade treadmill. Here every single piece of loot you find remains relevant. This means that if you find a legendary at a low level, you can use that moving forward indefinitely. The variation comes purely from different attributes / rolls on your weapons, so that you can hunt for upgrades of that weapon archetype, or simply switch out items that focus on different builds / styles that synergize with your character talents, or other pieces of equipment.
[/list]

That said, you can upgrade and re-roll all of your gear to improve or modify it. The game gives you loadout presets to save, favorite, and experiment.

In addition to that, the loot isn't just flat damage or stat boosts. Some of the gear will change your combat approach, which makes theory crafting more interesting. Later in the game, you will unlock thematic 'Infamy' sets akin to Division's 'Gear Sets'. This means that the more pieces you have will unlock specific bonuses that will put varied combat effects into play. These gear sets have hidden interactions with gear.

The loot grind comes in the form of improving, tweaking, finding minor or major upgrades, instead of engineered obsolescence.

[list]
[*]Combat - There's a decent skill ceiling. There are ton of mechanics in play, and they do a great job of slowly rolling out and explaining them within missions as you progress through the campaign. There are special attacks, resources, the need to manage & generate health + shield, in addition to elemental affects you can utilize in combat from special weapon traits. The elemental effects apply a special weakness or affect to abuse the enemies with, however, each one [i]also[/i] has a downside, or a benefit for the enemy, so you have to utilize them intelligently.
[/list]

Once you start to unlock more of your kit, the flow of combat can be incredibly satisfying. For example, you might weave flying through the air, firing off a shot before you land, and then chaining directly into a cinematic 'Suicide Strike' melee hit while you watch your chosen hero clobber an enemy in their own personal style, before sliding away, scaling a wall, and resuming your killing spree as you reactively fire off counter shots. Once you start to get a feel for it, you'll understand the potential for flow you can develop. I've always enjoyed Warframe, for example, it fulfills a fun power fantasy, but the combat always felt loose and floaty to me. This gives the more 'grounded' combat experience I've wanted out of a highly mobile 3rd person combat game.

note - given how well they individualized the characters, if they keep that standard, I have high hopes for new playable characters down the line. There's a lot to play with there in both theme and gameplay (combat + movement). The first new hero will be Joker.

Graphics / Visual - The game looks great, there's not a lot to say here. With so many fantastic indie games coming out these days, you still can't help but appreciate the polish that some of these AAA title's deliver. Small details like really well done models & movement animations help make the experience feel cohesive. When I do a double jump / flip, and pivot the direction, the character sways, turns, and lands exactly how you'd expect.

[list]
[*]Story / Writing - The story is engaging and fun, and the writing is solid, and as expected from the 'Suicide Squad' franchise, it's funny. The banter between characters during combat and exploration, as well as through cinematic cutscenes is entertaining and on-brand for the characters.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Endgame - Games like this ultimately live or die by the endgame. As of right now, you play overworld events + increasingly difficult instanced missions to unlock new tiers of special weapons, which seemingly will vary based on seasonal updates. The currently available missions are limited, but the roadmap has promised a lot of content additions to the endgame, which will start with Season . [/list]

I'm going to deviate now and address my understanding of the criticism of this game that's been quite visible on different corners of the internet pre-release.

[h3] SPOILERS [/h3] This game is called, ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"".... so as you might imagine, the game revolves around killing the Justice League. There was a leak that revealed that you kill Batman in this game, and people did [i] not [/i] like that.

This is the canonical development of the Arkham games Universe made by Rocksteady, and quite frankly, I think the [b] moment [/b] this game was revealed as an online-only looter shooter, many fans of the game that wanted another offline single player experience were just ready to dumpster on this game. Simply put, this is a stylistic deviation on many fronts, and people wanted something specific from the studio. If you're into the Injustice timeline, it's a fun ride. We have so many standard hero games already, playing around in a universe where the world is permanently changed and demigod tier heroes go the way of the dodo bird is entertaining and weighty. The other fun part about the multiverse aspect of the franchise, is that anything can happen.

Additionally, Kevin Conroy, the legendary voice actor for Batman has passed away since recording voice for this game (RIP). Many longtime fans are clearly upset that after following the Arkham franchise, this is the send off that Batman receives; one where he's a villain, and is killed unceremoniously. His presence throughout most of the game is true to form, but the nature of his demise (how it's handled) is one that I understand is disappointing for many. That said, please note Kevin Conroy is an adult whom really wanted to play an evil Batman, and he was able to do that here.

In summary, these folks wanted a continuation of the Arkham series, they didn't want Batman to be a villain, and they certainly didn't want a multiplayer focused looter-shooter.

Unfortunately, the campaign against this game has damaged it before it could get out of the gate.

At the time of writing this (release weekend), the Steam player count numbers for a brand new AAA live-service title is borderline abysmal. It's a shame, because I have a feeling there are a lot of looter shooter folks that would have a grand time zooming around and blowing #&$! up, that won't even try this title due to the torrent of criticism it received pre-release.

It's [i] possible [/i] that console is selling well, but if it isn't enough (it likely isn't), a significant player surge would be needed for WB to not put this on life support by 2025. 

I'll play casually as long as there's a playerbase / the season updates are comprehensive (which it seems they are). They'll have to deliver the first promised year of content. Unless they can stimulate growth with fantastic Seasons updates or sales / free-weekends, I'll be keeping future development expectations low, but hopeful nonetheless.

In summary, If you're into fast paced combat, traversal mechanics, and sandbox style multiplayer looter-shooters with engaging (and chaotic) moment to moment combat, albeit with repetitive activities (like most looter shooters) it's a fun time.",1706990353,1707749580,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. The game is filled with too many bugs. This comes in many levels from annoying to straight up infuriating, which led me to this review. One of the most common to me is that my squad points keep resetting on their own, usually after an incursion, another very annoying one is that sometimes when you join a session your weapon won't be able to use it's affliction and you'll have to rejoin said session in order for it to work. The multiplayer is straight up unplayable at times, me and a friend reached 50+ in the Killing Time incursion and just about after mastery 15 or so we struggled through insane amounts of lag, to the point that we couldn't use abilities nor pick up ammo or shields etc. and all that time wasted for nothing in return, but that's another problem will get to it later. Now to the infuriating things, there is a chance that when you overhaul a legendary/notorious weapon, such weapon will lose it's augment, something that I'm 99.9% sure wasn't the plan, meaning that each time you want to overhaul your favorite items for a build there's a chance that the game will fuck you over and you'll need to grind AGAIN to find said item with it's augment back and redo the process hoping it works this time around. NOW, the worst of all offenders, I've noticed that sometimes when the servers kick you out for connectivity issues or perhaps because you stayed in a multiplayer lobby alone for far too long, there is a rollback, but NOT any ordinary rollback. Say you wasted all that currency on T.O.T.E.S. from Toyman in order to get the best stats for your weapons and you finally have the build you want, well if the game does a ROLLBACK, say goodbye to your carefully handpicked load-out and just to add some salt in the wound, the currency you wasted on those DO NOT rollback too, meaning you'll have to grind for hours all over again over something that's completely out of your control. There are many more bugs too that are apparently being addressed and be fixed in the 'near' future with patches etc., one can find those in the Rocksteady's SS discord server (THERE ARE A LOT OF BUGS, some that I didn't mention are achievements not working properly for others and more.)

2. Okay with that out of the way, the gameplay loop can be fun (when you encounter no bugs) but there is simply not enough variety to keep coming back for more. There are only 3 incursion missions, one horde mode with a hardcore version and Brainiac which as of now is probably the biggest waste of time when it comes to grinding and it's pretty much required that you have 2+ pals playing alongside you otherwise good luck wasting 1 and a half hours of your life for 8-9 mediocre loot. The Metropolis support squad missions are very repetitive as well and they offer nothing but promethium points, but the most annoying part is that they give you extremely useless weapons after a certain point which you can't destroy on the spot and your inventory will be filled with useless stuff before you'll even realize it. Right now, when it comes to builds etc. the game is mostly focused around the Bane set and it's 3 infamy tiers, which all revolve around the craze affliction, meaning if you want to go up the leaderboard and grind for more loot (and I'll ignore the burn meta bug since it'll get patched) you'll NEED to base your build around that which really kills other options, such as freeze and lightning, unless you want to be weaker but have more fun probably, in 10-20 mastery incursions, which in my opinion isn't really worth it, unless you really really enjoy doing those missions over and over again. Also, regarding it's repetitive nature, one of the biggest problems with this game as of now is that after you're done grinding for achievements, or an optimal build, or the Riddler challenges or to fill up the Codex there aren't many other things to do, and a lot of people, including me have decided to put the game down until more content gets released, only problem is that season 1 comes in March and all upcoming seasons will have a 3 month gap between them, but this needs to be addressed somehow cause if it only takes 10-11 days to pretty much 100% the launch product and then you enter a hiatus until the next season 2 and a half months later (not including season 1), the active playerbase will take do a nosedive and it'll probably hurt the game even more than it already is.

In conclusion, without minding the story, since it's seemingly going to be evolving with the coming seasons, the state of the game as of right now from a gameplay and technical standpoint, is not worth it's price.
I'd argue that even if you're a huge fan of the looter shooters and the Arkhamverse as a whole, you should either wait for a sale or for more content to be added further down the line.

It may not be perfect but If you can draw me in then you got my attention. I am not very picky. What I do love is the ability to have almost any weapon for any character beyond default. So I can pair a shotgun for King Shark when up close to get Shield absorbs easier and a Minigun for DPS Range attacks.

The Bane set later on you get feels like it fits King Shark and I like it, Sense I am already using an element built for it anyways. Bane and Posion Ivy set combo. I focused on a Tanky High Capacity Shield with spamming Shield Absorb for King Shark to keep him alive.

I hope to see the game improve over time, I also took the highest difficulty at the start of the game so I can test myself and I am glad I did.

Personally I would play the game yourself if you like it. When I used to play games back in 2000, I never looked at any reviews or others ""opinions"" I liked a game by just playing it without any influence. I would recommend the game so far. I cannot say for sure on repetitiveness or things over and over and over. I just enjoy causing massive destruction on enemies some of us like me prefer games like these sense we just have a strange addiction to repetitive stuff than others.

the fact that to do the side missions to level up before a boss fight is just regular boring gameplay with and added twist of not allowing to have fun with ""enemies can only be killed with grenades"" or ""shoot insect aliens to pick up a damage allower to deal damage for 10 secs"" is just an insult to players paying full price game money for a half arsed game.

First lets talk about the gameplay. There is variety with the gameplay but the one problem i have with it is the lack of boss fights and the lack of variety with boss fights. fighting other enemies takes some brain power but not much. The only fights that take some brain power is the side missions that you have to do for the side characters. once those missions are done that is pretty much it as far as difficulty goes and im playing past the hardest starting difficulty. Which goes into my next issue which is the lack of difficulty, its both a negative and a positive because the harder the game could be would just make the enemies more spongy to damage and i dont like spongy enemies. Again i do like the game and i like the grind and the mindlessness this game has to over but at moments it feels too mindless. Traversal is super smooth and almost seemless. This game took me a little over 20 hours to beat and that was me doing side missions and messing around with the riddler challenges and trophies. 

The story. The story is really good at the start and then it feels like they rushed the last bit of it because it flies by when you first defeat the first JL member. the cutscenes are really nice and the voice acting is really good too. overall i enjoyed the story and im very curious how they will continue it in later seasons. 

My response to the hate its been getting. Its not a bad game it has its flaws but it isn't terrible. you can see the amount of detail they put into this game, by they i mean Rocksteady. WB Games is the biggest villain in this game because this game screams corporate with its live-service business model and the unimportant micro transactions. Ever since Arkham Knight WB Games has been predatory with their DLC and Microtransactions. (i know Arkham knight never had micro-transactions but most of their games coming after Arkham Knight did Excluding Hogwarts Legacy to my knowledge)

Minor Spoilers for the story below

The other complaint i hear a lot is the fact that 4 Knuckleheads can shoot the JL members like nothing but that isn't the case. i was going into this hearing about that complaint but they explain how the Suicide Squad can combat these meta-humans. 

The other complaint is how they treated the Arkham Batman in this and this is the only complaint i can agree with because it was such a disservice to that character whom of which i and many of you grew up playing as. 

Now all in all i like the game and will continue to play it until they will inevitably shut down the servers because of low player count and low income but until then i will keep grinding to get all my characters to max level. I'm also a little disappointed that i haven't really played with randos so if you're reading this and wanna play with me hit me up id be super down.

I would be fine giving this game either a thumbs up or down, but gave it a thumbs down just knowing that more people will likely read it and hope they read a more nuanced review of the game, rather than just click on clickbait videos and type ""this game is trash"" before even watching the video, which likely actually praised the game, despite the clickbait title and thumbnail.  (seriously...so many clickbait hate vids on this game still praise quite a lot about the game) Clickbait gonna clickbait, I get it.

Preface: this review is based on the campaign w/ a slight touch on post-campaign endgame, playing solo.

Pros
- Excellent acting and directing.  Some of the gameplay set pieces are the best I've ever seen in video games.  Some of the cutscenes are great.  I'd like to explain more, but avoiding spoilers.  
- The Flash segments in particular I thought were AMAZING.  Most people don't realize Flash is arguably the most powerful earth-based superhero out there, essentially controlling time and space itself.  I think Rocksteady did a great job making me feel the true power of the Flash through setpieces, cutscenes, and the boss fight (yes, despite obviously us beating him [spoiler]w/ some anti-speed tech[/spoiler]).  Even him being [spoiler]invisible[/spoiler] was a nice touch.  Plus The Flash himself was very well acted and well-written as his non-possessed self.  
- Overall good writing.  A lot of lol moments.  Some characters were maybe a bit inconsistent with what I'd expect (Wonder Woman and Deadshot in particular), but whatever, they're serialized superhero characters.  Any writer can write them how they want.
- The basics of combat are good and interesting.  Combat sequences themselves?  Ehh...   But the foundation is there for some great combat, if missions/encounters were tweaked a bit.
- Characters aren't too distinguishable, gameplay-wise, but it is nice to at least have some differences in traversal, I guess.

Cons
- The most frustrating con that really makes me not forgive this game is the mouse&keyboard sensitivity bug.  It seems to not be too common, I've only seen a couple threads about it, but I have my mouse sensitivity at 100, even for ADS, and I still have to swing my mouse across my mousepad like 2.5 times just to do a 180 or look downwards while airborne.  IT'S ANNOYING.  Too many times, my hand/mouse is hanging off my mousepad.  
- While combat design itself is fine, encounters are just too poorly designed to make combat itself fun.  There's just too much going on and not enough to really track or understand why something is happening to you.  I can go into so many details, but it'd take up the max character usage for Steam reviews and I don't wanna add it after editing.  But just some missions and encounters, you don't know exactly what you are doing or supposed to do, you don't know where you are getting hit from, you don't know why something isn't working, snipers teleport for some reason, you need to do specific attacks just to heal/shield regen in a lot of chaos, etc. 
- So I just talked about encounters, but how about missions themselves?  Some missions are just weird and nonsensical.  The ones with specific criteria (nades only do damage, crits only do damage, etc) just seem to be inconvenient for the sake of being inconvenient.  
- Party AI is frustrating at times.  I wish I could assign them targets or have a ""gambit""/instruction list.  Sometimes I want them to just go to that other building and kill those mofos across the street.  Instead they just follow me around and shoot at my targets or just traverse around seemingly not doing anything.  Sometimes I can't really tell in all the chaos.  They'll maybe shoot at something else if I'm just standing there doing nothing.  I get this game is designed for co-op, but party AI can use a big boost.
- Characters being more distinguishable in gameplay would be nice.  Why can't Shark just do a full tank/melee build?  Why can't Boomerang have more abilities and mechanics built around his...boomerang?  I feel like Deadshot and Harley should have been the gun-focused characters with their own separate nuances, Harley maybe more of a hybrid or trickster character, while Shark and Boomerang should have been way more distinguishable.

Neutral
- While I love the cutscenes, there was way too many cuts to Squad members' faces for no real reason besides showing them confused, smiling, etc.  It sorta took away from some scenes.
- Some defeats of bosses are very anti-climactic.  I won't say that's a bad thing.  I've learned that in storytelling, not everything has to be climactic.  As major things in real life happen that aren't really climactic either.  I know this was a criticism for a lot of people.  It was kind of weird, but I won't dock it.
- I did not mind the ""lack of enemy variety"".  Encounters are so chaotic, I'm not sure that really matters.
- Regarding Batman.  I know some people are saying if he and [spoiler]Wonder Woman swapped roles[/spoiler], it'd be a lot better and ""respectful"" to Bats and...Kevin Conroy for some reason?  Either way, I can't disagree that for an Arkham game, [spoiler]it probably would have been better to have Bats be the un-corrupted assistant who died a heroic death in the game.[/spoiler]   That being said, I don't mind that it was [spoiler]Wonder Woman who was un-corrupted and died a heroic death and that Batman was sort of the continuous villain motif throughout the game.[/spoiler]   
- I'm not sure about the live service elements, but they seem non-predatory and pretty easy to get upgrades.  Non-FOMO Battle Passes and no p2w mtx are nice.  I could definitely see the endgame being unfun just due to the missions/encounters.  
- I forgot where I heard it, but someone said the campaign feels like a long tutorial for the endgame.  I could easily see that.  Various forced missions for crafting rewards are sprinkled in the game, instead of just wanting to go to straight to the ""kill the JL"" objective.

Anyway, I felt the story was definitely worth the experience.  I think playing it and ""feeling"" some of the setpieces would translate better than just watching a video on YT.  I have no gripes with writing, treatment of Batman, etc.  But too many missions, encounters, and the annoyance of kb/m just made the actual GAMEPLAY unfun too often.  

I would 100% recommend this game for diehard DC fans or diehard live service fans or fans of horde shooters even.  Anyone else?  Ehh...just be prepared for what you are getting into.",1707694167,1707694789,False,17,0,0.526797771453857422,0,True,False,False

Yet the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League made me as emotional as almost no other. Sadly for all the wrong reasons. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Rocksteadys Arkham Series is pretty much my favorite gaming series ever. If these guys finally came out with a new game, there was no way I wasn't going to play it. And if it ended up being terrible, I would want to see it for myself... which is exactly what happend. This game is a culmination of everything you would hate from this generation of gaming. An always online game as a service filled with microtransactions and battle passes. A lackluster package of a game with promises of seasonal ""free"" content. The story here can be completed in 10 - 15 hours. Which in my eyes wouldn't be a problem, if what was there was actually good and worth the time. But the story and sidequests are busy work and highly repetitive from the start.

Now to be fair to this game, despite what people seem to comment under every gameplay video or trailer. Not everything about this game is terrible. If you look closely, I think there still is a little bit of that Rocksteady magic to be found. First of all, I really like the design of Metropolis. I think it fits the universe and graphically it's really good. I would say the same for most of the character designs. The shooting mechanics and the movement is more than solid. The playable characters do feel somewhat different and out of the 4 characters at launch, Harley Quinn is the only I didn't enjoy playing due to the slow movement with her batdrone and grapple. The loot - if you care about that stuff - seems to be varied enough aswell. In solo play you can switch the characters almost all the time, which can help breaking the monotony. Monotony however is exactly where I think the gameplay falls apart. No matter if you're playing the main story or side content, it all feels the same. Kill enemies, press E to save civilians, go to point A or B to kill even more enemies. Kill enemies, but only do it with grenades or with melee attacks because... I don't know, someone thought it would be fun I guess.

The main story has one upside to it though. Where in side missions you would always be greeted with tutorial popups at the start of each mission, the main campaign features some real high quality cutscenes, that honestly look stunning. Character designs and animations are all top notch. What's not good though, is what these cutscenes will actually show you. I think the game starts relatively strong. The character banter is nicely done, voice acting I think is really good and a few jokes actually made me chuckle a little. This is true, until you start recruiting some truly cringe worthy support characters that will supply you with gear. And it takes an unholy nosedive as soon as you get to actually do what the game title actually promises: Killing the Justice League. The cutscene that plays after you kill the Flash is so retarded, I was lost for words. Captain Boomerang gets his ""Grayson"" out and wants to piss on the corpse. Deadshot wants to stop him, gets a good look and... congratulates him? Harley salutes him for it??? Who came up with this crap? You read alot online about how they disrespected the entire Justice League. I wont even go into that or the infamous Batman scene. But who thinks this is funny or an authentic thing for these characters to do? Or contributing to the game in any other way? I don't know what to say here. Well and if you get through all that, the game ends in an incredibly unsatisfying way. With a recycled boss fight that you already fought before and an open ending to the story, so there's an excuse to keep on playing and engaged in future seasons. I wont go into the endgame, because I simply couldn't care less about it.

One can only guess what they spent their 7 - 8 years of development time on. Content wise there's not alot here, and even less of it is actually good. I hope Rocksteady can recover from this, but I have my doubts. They should look back at what they were actually good on - story driven singleplayer games. And WB should look back at last years Hogwarts Legacy to realize, that this would not only be what fans want, but would actually get them some profit aswell. I think there is some fun to be had with what we ended up getting. But especially coming from something as good as Batman: Arkham Knight, this just is a huge disappointment.

""You've been a good friend. The best I could ask for. You were there at the beginning. And now, you get to see how it ends.""


Update from 11.02.2024:

So after playing this game for much longer than I expected and diving deep into the endgame content, I have to say that there is actually a lot to like here. After you finish the story you can increase the difficulty in the open world and its activities, aswell as in the incursion levels that unlock after the credits roll. As the difficulty increases the loot will actually become important. When you finally unlock all the skills - which might happen long after the story ends if you switch between characters like I did - you can create some interesting builds. You can start to develop new playstyles and master your builds. It's here where the game finally started to become fun for me. However once again, the main problem is the lack of content. There is not enough mission variety to keep the game fresh, as the objectives are the same ones you played, when you beat the main story. Depending on how long this game will be supported, this could be something that Rocksteady manages to fix in the future.

For now though, I still can't recommend this game in good conscience. The main story, which should have been the highlight, was a massive disappointment. After playing the endgame, the story rather feels like a long, tedious tutorial until you finally get to play the fun part. Still, if you like games like Borderlands for example, there undeniably is a fun core to this game, plagued mainly by uninspired mission design and an a convoluted user interface.",1706898501,1707684389,False,9,0,0.523526191711425781,1,True,False,False

You will LITERALLY have to just focus fire on a SINGLE grunt, but if your solo (like me) you're screwed. You simply will not have enough time to take out all of the enemies so you will just hit a wall. Also the A.I bots don't help at all on the higher levels. Most of the time I see them just standing around or just walking around doing nothing and just ignore the enemies. In my SSKJL is a fun game that I was really enjoying until the difficulty of the endgame missions just boiled down to increasing the health and damage of all the enemies until there is just no point in trying to continue the endgame and I no longer have a reason to play this until something new comes out, I mean you can only do the same 3 missions a certain amount of times before it gets boring.If your wanting to playthrough the story and just enjoy the world and not worry about super hard endgame missions than you may enjoy it.

1) the story for this game is boring and lacks any emotional value of the past arkham games.

2) thank sweet baby inc for this one but the woke elements in the game are insane disrespecting iconic characters e.g. batman superman even the green lantern its absurd and at times downright sickening with what happens to them if they wanted to kill of the characters like it says in the games title they should have done it with more respect and care instead of this trash.

3) the performance is terrible even on a high-end PC like mine i wish steam would show you what peoples PC specs are then they give reviews so that we could compare notes on this situation because at the minute many are in the blind with this and for new players who may want to buy this mess of a game they need to be informed that it may not work properly on there PC.

trust me there are many more reasons why you should not play this game if i think of more i will update the review or if the game gets better lets say if they patch the performance bug and other bugs it suffers with i will update accordingly but for now as i have said before  can't and will not recommend this game to anyone if the game goes down to lets says £20 or even £10 when i could say check it out but make sure you know the ricks before buying.

I commend Rocksteady for taking such a brave tone, and style with this storytelling. It is definately pretty unique in that side of things, and I do give it a value for providing such a different take. I don't rank this story above what Batman: Arkham series have, but it pulls its weight and gives me a new type of experience, which is valuable.
- as a sidenote, I do not value your modern lingo put in here. It took away immersion instead of adding up to it. Also big minus from breaking certain characters, Suicide Squad doesn't stay true to some characters. Lex Luthor is perfect example of this.

I enjoy the movement and traversal a lot, and it really makes the combat fun. The AI is good enough, both on enemies and friendlies. I wish you had done more on enemy variety, and it is odd thing to complain but really I mean it visually. You need more different looking enemies to keep this fresh, and make the game last longer. For a big studio, visual variety is easily achieved. Why didn't you?

Mission design is the weak side, and I really dare to claim that you had something happen with development cycle that took away lot of mission variety. You seriously didn't plan this set up all these years?

For a looter shooter, game has all needed item mechanics to survive. I personally thought build variety, and items are good! This is something that lot of live service releases have missed somehow.

I will continue to play, and see how I feel about the end game. Will also pay an eye towards future content, but I am worried what you will be doing with this game. You have lot of work to do in order for me to drop any money on top of the base cost. Feedback? Your cosmetic work is not up to its task.

While there are some issues with the combat a little janky, the gameplay being repetitive, and some mission's having BS stipulations on how you kill the enemies (for example, some missions say you can only damage enemies if it's a ""shield harvest"" attack), there are still a lot of positive things going on here, albeit I'm not /that/ far in. Biggest thing for me is how much the music enhances combat encounters and makes them feel more exciting. That and the performances from the cast are all incredible. And while it is a ""live service"" game (jesus that term seems to be thrown around like the boogeyman to scare people away), it's a huge W that they stated there won't be time restrictions and that it won't require daily chores and grinding to get the seasonal content, as it won't be leaving after 3 or so months, similar to how Deceive Inc. handles their battle passes. There's a decent amount of good here, don't let the negativity scare you away from a fun time! Although yeah wait for a discount unless you genuinely love the Suicide Squad and DC comics.

Edit: Now that I've ""finished"" the story, the end-game is very odd. We have to wait for the studio to put out the rest of the story. If I had to guess, I'd say 2 boss fights per season for 6 seasons? We'll see. But yeah still fun, especially with the end-game loot which feels very satisfying to use. I think one thing that's actually hilarious, for those that watch Cr1tikal's vids, his main complaint was that the ""second half of the game was all escort missions"" when there was really only 4 or 5 that just take like 5 minutes each.

This game had a lot of hate and scepticism leading up to release and I think it was because rocksteady only seemed to show the bad.
Put simply, the game is fun to play if you don't mind repetitiveness in combat and missions, although I'm certain there will be more enemy types and missions added later that will spice things up.
The game looks great, the character designs are really cool, especially for the league and Brainiac, and the game was actually really funny at points.
I had slight nitpicks as I was playing through the story and completing side-missions to get better gear, but all that was shoved to the back of my mind when I finally finished the story and realised the game actually wasn't finished.
It baffles me that you can literally do exactly what it says in the title of the game, and still not be able to finish the game. I sat speechless as I ran it through my head that a small portion of this games story is killing the justice league, and the rest, which will be released over the course of the next couple years, is just killing Brainiac over and over.
Members of the justice league will be available to fight with each season that comes out from my understanding so the game still technically is about killing the justice league, but it's still weird that you can complete all you're set out to do, only to get slapped in the face with the revelation that there are more Brainiac's out there to kill.
Speaking of, the first Brainiac fight we have access to is underwhelming, as it is a re-skin of the flash boss fight with added basic enemies to give you something to do in between Brainiac needing to take rests I guess.

This game is fun, and I do see myself keeping close attention to the game as the updates roll out over the next few years. I hope that the game does end up being worth the price, but it's annoying we have to wait for the rest of the content.",1707632706,1707632706,True,1,0,0.495260685682296753,0,True,False,False

BUT

The amount of bugs we've experienced in our first 6 hours is honestly unacceptable. So many soft-locked missions, server disconnects, crashing... for example, the first battle when you're released on Metropolis - the enemies spawned and sat there waiting to be killed. These bugs range from annoying to sometimes genuinely game-breaking. Keep that mind. 

I want to leave a positive review bc I really do like this game and want to counter the unwarranted hate, but at AAA price, the bugs are not worth it. Wait for a sale.


EDIT AFTER COMPLETING GAME
Crashed 7 times. Last crash was after we spent in-game money to do an end-game mission. Froze and crashed. Lost money. Broken. I gave this game so many chances. Traversal and combat are awesome, but FUCK this game. I have yet to play a modern game that has crashed for me more than one time. This game is so poorly optimized. Do NOT buy this shit.  


EDIT AFTER I CALMED MY HORSES
Crashing sucks. It happens way too often, but for the love of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I still love the traversal and combat after 16 hours.

The game is decidedly not built to play alone. Even in single player you have “lives” and need to wait for the bots to revive you. Multiple times I’ve had them just dick about jumping over me and missing the ledge where I’m downed so I’m just waiting for a long time to be able to play. I don’t want an end-of-mission screen that tells me who did the best in the squad. It’s me. I’m playing solo. I KNOW I DID BETTER THAN THE ZERO OTHER PLAYERS. There’s also a LOT of sniper enemies in the game, and in solo, it amounts to most combat encounters having 5-6 sniper lasers pointed at you, and only you, the entire time. They also stand far enough back on ledges that if you aren’t above them, you can’t hit them, and then when you get to where you can hit them, they teleport to a different ledge.

Don’t forget, every character also has a unique way of getting around the city. Also don’t forget, every one of them is made INCREDIBLY limited and input-intensive so that you can’t move too much faster when other players are around. As everyone is playing solo, however, this just serves to make the movement around the city INCREDIBLY cumbersome. Even moreso when you realise there’s only one fast travel point on the entire map, and it’s in one of the far corners, not even the middle.

The 4 characters lack identity. Why do I want to play any one over the others? They all play exactly the same way. They share the same guns between them, only each character is limited to 3 gun types out of 5, they share grenades, their special moves are just 1 aoe damage and 1 single target damage move. There’s nothing that sets them apart. In terms of personality, they are all VERY one-note. If I have to hear about Deadnot having a daughter one more time, I’m gonna hunt her down and feed her to Braniac myself. Every character has a perks system, every perk is just “at combo, do more damage.” No perk has felt meaningful, or worth changing your playstyle to use more efficiently. It's worht mentioning that there are unlockable cosmetics for playing, however I now have all of them, and only one outfit for one character doesn’t look like absolute shit, because obviously they want you to go to their store to buy the half-decent ones.

The actual gameplay is ok for a while, but it gets stale fast. It’s one of those games where there’s about 4 enemy types, and then later they’ll pretend there’s new ones by reskinning the starter enemies and maybe giving them a little gimmick. There are short, infinite missions for crappy rewards, but they highlight how shallow the gameplay is because every single one is just “kill 10 of one enemy type,” “kill with gun type,” “use status effects.” Later in the game you receive a SECOND constant batch of the exact same missions. Why? Dunno, they feel just as worthless.

The actual missions also feel samey; just kill shit, sometimes with a gimmick about “only this attack does damage,” sometimes with a basically meaningless collection aspect. No mission so far has felt significantly different from any other. The actual bossfights against the League are super underwhelming, almost all of them just being “keep shooting while they repeat the same 3 attacks” followed by the League member just doing the most default falling-over animation ever when their hp bar finally runs out, and that’s the kill.

Early game, most of the combat is spent re-climbing scyscrapers, because that’s where all the enemies are, and if a helicopter gets involved, they WILL freeze you, which throws you all the way down to ground level before you’re allowed to break out of the ice. Tanks are allowed to perfectly track and shoot at you through multiple buildings.

The loot system sucks. I’ve basically just glazed over and only read the DPS and unique passive because there’s so many meaningless stats. Also, it’s 2024, where the hell is the button to scrap everything in my inventory below a certain quality? I’m getting popups of “stuff was sent to the mailbox because your inventory is full” because I have to go through and manually mark 300 crap-tier pieces of junk for scrapping. And it’s not just “go to your inventory and scrap.” You have to go to each individual character and go into each slot to delete the items in that category. You can’t scrap Harley’s melee weapons while looking at Boomerang, etc. It’s a slog.

Speaking of slogs, there’s a daily reward which can reach high tier equipment, and to get it, all you have to do is spend over 2 hours every day hunting about 100 of one type of flying drone that spawns scattered over the map, hundreds of meters in the air. They are not interesting or rewarding to kill on their own, their only combat is to start a teleport to flee. Have fun! Also good luck grinding them if you’re trying to level King Shark, because all the weapon types he can use are TERRIBLE at killing them.

There are status effects which are genuinely terrible. I’ve played for 30 hours, and EVERY weapon I get with good DPS has this stupid “Black Mask” effect which sets fire to nearly every enemy. This stupid burning effect disables your ability to gain shields from enemies, which means you very quickly run out (they don’t regen in combat without pickups) and more importantly makes certain missions downright impossible when the enemies ONLY take damage from the shield-harvest move. At this point I’ve been relegated to using lower damage weapons just to not have the basic survivability tool fully disabled.

Additionally, there are some modes where only crits deal damage, which is fine, but all other damage causes enemies to heal instead. Several of these missions involve tanks, which only take crits on their weak points. In solo, this means you can destroy all of their weak points (bar the one on their back because you can’t hit it when they target you instead of the bot teammates 100% of the time) but the bots will just fire indiscriminantly, keeping their hp at 100%. You literally cannot kill the tanks around your teammates healing them.

Riddler exists again. Except this time, because your characters lack gadgets or interesting gameplay mechanics, his trophies just sit on the ground for you to pick up. His “races” are all less than 30 seconds long, and the only ones I had to repeat were due to the next ring being hard to spot, not hard to reach. After doing all of his stuff… nothing. No “I’ll beat you next time!” no confrontation, he just stops calling to nag you to do his stuff.

And look, all of that is without even touching on the fact that to go between the main base and the open world, you need to walk through a hallway of propaganda every time, or that they race-swapped a character who is established in the universe. Oh yeah, that other Floyd Lawton, the one who shot people from across an entire city, bouncing bullets off helicopters, and who went toe-to-toe with batman twice? Yeah uh… he was… an imposter! Yeah, that’s it.

Also I forgot, how many decades are we into gaming? What the fuck is the excuse for forcing players to stand around, locked into walking speed, unable to leave a rooftop, EVERY TIME people want to rant long boring instructions at me. TALK WHILE I MOVE, I DON'T WANT TO STAND STILL AND LISTEN TO EVERY LINE OF ""GO HERE, SHOOT THIS"" DIALOGUE.

One more edit, and I'm not one for spoilers but this is something that prospective buyers NEED to know before they commit:

A tremendous amount is set to be locked behind ""seasons"" which, looking at the sales and player stats, will not happen.

Because at the end of the day, It is a Looter shooter. If you like looter shooters, you will like what this game offers. The schmovement in 3rd person adds a nice touch that I haven't seen in an ARPG before.

Is the game grindy? Yes. Are looter shooters grindy? Yes. If you don't like grinding, you won't like this game. But if you are ok with games like PoE, Borderlands, Diablo, or any other true ARPG, you are going to enjoy the progression and power creep offered in this game.

Too many people wanted this to be Arkham but with the Suicide squad. I'm personally glad they took a risk with the mechanics.

My best guess is Gothem Knights did not perform well for WB and they wanted a Service game. So they forced the developers of Suicide Squad to make a replacement. I'm not necessarily upset. But it feels a bit obvious this game was quickly turned into a Service game. That is my only gripe.

Edit (After 50 hours of total game play) -
I'm editing this to address every complaint about the game I've heard, and countering it having played for a long amount of time and also played many other looter shooters, Below is the looter shooters I've played and for how long, as well as a Total. Also, the reasons i am listing are not directly copied, but simplified.

Borderlands 1- 83 minutes
Borderlands 2 - 82.9 Hours
Borderlands : The Pre-Sequel - 28.9 Hours
Borderlands 3 - 83 Hours
Tiny Tinas Wonderlands - 67.7 Hours
Immortals Of Aveum - 6.7 Hours
Wayfinder (Early Access) - 8.6 Hours
Relic Hunters Legend (Early Access) - 51.9 Hours
Remnant 2 (Not truly considered a Looter Shooter, but has many elements of one.) - 94.4 Hours
Destiny 2 - 137.56 Hours (Partially through Steam and Epic Games.)
Redfall (Yes, i did play this for sometime using Game Pass.) - 20 hours
Warframe - 3.4 Hours

Total Playtime (Not including SS:KTJL) - 583.89 Hours
Total Playtime (Including SS:KTJL) - 635.89 Hours


People's Issues -

""Rocksteady didn't send out early access review codes"" (Heard via ENDMIONtv on Youtube.) - Video Game companies don't have to send out Early Access review codes, and it dosent mean that the game is bad, and it is not a red flag for them to do this. Rocksteady's reason for not sending out codes is that the servers for the game wouldn't be live until Early Access for Deluxe edition owners kicks off, which is a good reason as it takes resources to keep the servers up and online. Additionally, there was a press event where media outlets like IGN and alike could play, so there was no real reason for them to send out review codes for those outlets and others since they had already played and been given a time to see it in action and give a review on it. Granted, these outlets did not have many good things to say about it, but take into account that these reviews came out a while ago, so there could have been changes made based on there opinions.

""Even being a looter shooter and its own thing connected to the Arkham games, it isn't even good at being a Looter Shooter. (Heard via Tiktok.) - This is just pure false, because many Looter shooters like Borderlands strive via their endgame, where you are given the oppurtinity to unlock better gear, as well as higher rarity gear to make your build better for your playstyle. Looter shooters are meant for Building your best Character/Playstyle to do many things, such as :
Tanking high amounts of damage
Dealing high amounts of damage
Healing high amounts of Health
So saying that SS:KYJL isn't a good looter shooter, isn't a valid statement unless you have gotten and played the endgame content for a long time. Additionally, SS:KTJL is a good looter shooter, as it is going to expand more and more and release more content and Equipment for people to make builds out of, such as Scarecrow, or Bane (Current one).

""Gameplay/Missions get's repettitive."" (Heard from Tiktok) - It is a looter shooter. it's going to get repetitive, your meant to grind the same things multiple times so you can the equipment you need in order to fit your build best, and the missions in this game are genuinely fun, and you unlock more and more different types of missions as you progress through the game and story, making it fun to see what type of mechanic or gameplay element you need for the new missions you unlock.

""It's Live Service."" (From Tiktok and Youtube.) - Many games nowadays are live service, Borderlands 3 was live service due to the endgame content and Strikes you could do online. Other games like Overwatch 2 is Live service. Destiny, Warframe, Fortnite, Palworld, Dota 2, World of Warcraft, Rift, Final Fantasy 14, they are all Live service. A lot of games that have heavy multiplayer content are live service, and even then in a lot of them you can do a lot of the content solo, including SS:KTJL.

""There are number's flying everywhere, and the combat is sloppy."" (Heard from Tiktok.) - Again, it is a looter shooter. Many looter shooters have a lot of numbers involved, and it's to show whether your damage/healing is increasing or deacreasing, and there is a setting in game to turn off damage numbers.

""The HUD covers up a lot of the screen."" (Heard from Tiktok.) - Okay this one is just wild, i can barely see my HUD, and there is no setting to increase the size of it. This just isn't true.

""There's barely any enemy/mission Variety"" (Heard from Tiktok and Youtube.) - Just like the last complaint, this just isn't true. a lot of the variety like the Poison Ivy missions are found via story progression, and give you more game play mechanic (For example, Poison Ivy gives you access too Afflictions (AKA - Status Effects), and enemy variety is also unlocked through story progression, where you unlock ""Infused"" enemies that have the same powers as the Justice League. Granted, the only ones currently available are The Flash and Batman, but there is going to be more released upon Season 1 launching.

""The writing isn't good, and they disrespected many of our heroes."" (Heard from Tiktok and Youtube.) - The writing is genuinely good, and the main things people are upset about is Batman getting killed so easily. Batman was brainwashed in the story, and he was killed in front of Superman's Statue, which to me is pretty respectfull to be killed in front of one of your friends big memorials. Another one cry babys have pointed out is that The Flash gets ""Peed on"", however if you actually watch the cutscene, it is a funny moment between the four characters, and The Flash is not peed on.

""They Race-Swapped Deadshot."" (Heard/read via Youtube Comment.) - Who cares? The race of a digital character who isn't real doesn't actually affect anything in the game.

""There is a battlepass/Not every game needs a battlepass."" (Heard from Tiktok and Youtube.) - The battlepass is ONLY cosmetics, and gives no ptw items, it is just cosmetic like the Deluxe Edition. I do agree that not every game needs a BP, but it's not like it's a major thing that alters the game significantly, and unlike Overwatch, all DLC characters are unlockable for free without use of the BP (Meaning you don't have to go through the BP in order to unlock them.) Additionally, all story content is also free, and so is all the equipment, riddler challenges, enemies, endgame content. 





Another thing, i will be going through and talking about TWO of IGN's opinions in their early access review.

""The Flash is too fast/The Boss fight is annoying."" - Buddy... It's THE Flash... also if you read the Boss fight mechanics that it shows you before you click ""Okay"" and continue the fight you might've undestood how you're supposed to fight him. That is a major thing in Looter Shooter's, Boss Mechanics, and DPS phases.

""You ENSLAVE a Child version of Poison Ivy."" - NO! you don't ENSLAVE her! I'm not going to go into detail of what happens, but you'll find out via gameplay that she asks you for things (AKA, you unlock new Missions to do for her.) Where she gives you more gameplay mechanics.

The game itself just feels very grindy which has made me lose interest in the end game content. The boss fights were anti-climactic as well. Almost all the bosses felt very similar and I honestly went through the game without any game overs which speaks to how challenging this game is...

 I feel like if they just made this a single-player or co-op experience it would have been a lot more fun. However all it feels like right now is a cash grab and Rocksteady really needs to prove themselves again on the next game they create if this doesn't ruin them.

- Stylistically this game looks worse than Arkham Knight, a game from 2015
- Gameplay loop gets boring quickly. Lack of enemy & mission variety kills the potential.
- Story, oh god the story. Who ever wrote this story had no respect for the characters at all... Listen just find a video essay online to explain why. They'll do it better than I can in this review
- Voice acting is fantastic, it's what carries at lot of the dialogue which is badly written

As someone who grew up playing the games from Rocksteady, I think myself and many people had high expectations, Perhaps too high. I wanted to think despite what I was hearing from people online the game was not as bad as they are saying. 

[h3] I was wrong. [/h3]

This game is not a Rocksteady game. Even the Rocksteady that developed Arkham Knight clearly put so much more effort into this franchise more than whoever is taking the lead now. The original studio founders are gone, and WB have put the online service b******t into what remains in that studio.

While this has been negative I do want to say that this game had one moment that made my day. When you run into [spoiler] batman the first time. Me and my younger brother were playing (We both played the Arkham games growing up) [/spoiler] That encounter was amazing for us, so unfortunate it was short lived. On that note, if a game out of the 10 hours of story and gameplay has only one notable 7 minute segment, I think shows just how bad it is.

I bought it because I am a huge Arkham fan, and although even I believe it shouldn’t have been in the Arkhamverse, I saw gameplay and it looked very fun. Boomerang’s traversal specifically. And I was right. It is very fun. The traversal in the game overall is very fun. All 4, including Harley. But the action of the game is alright. I like shooting at things on PC, not controller. And the sensitivity is VERY low, even when putting it to 100 and changing the sensitivity of my mouse. It’s very slow and feels like controller. So that wasn’t very fun. Still fun? Yes. But don’t pay $70 just for the traversal which is VERY fun, but then just repetitive gameplay where it isn’t too much fun because sensitivity is very slow. If you play on controller and you like shooting and aiming on controller, don’t know because personally I don’t. I also saw that the JL isn’t actually dead and that there will be a years worth of content, which I would line to be there for. But right now, it ain’t too good.

In conclusion, fun game. I do recommend BUT NOT FOR $70! Either wait for a discount or wait for more updates to come out because despite there being a years worth of content, we don’t know if it’s any good.

The gameplay is very fun and the traversal is unique. I haven't found it repetitive yet and I've played 21 hours so far. I found the combat to be very smooth and fun to play, no matter what mission I am playing

Now it does NOT come without flaws. The story can be poorly executed at times, although I did have fun playing it and appreciated somethings. Missions are fun but are lazily made, all boss fights are the exact same.

They did Batman dirrrrrrtttttttttttyyyyyyyy in this one.

but overall

A fun game that kept me wanting more and to continue playing it. Would I recommend? Probably not, it is definitely not worth the price it is, but it is a fun game for me and I love all of the Arkham Easter eggs.

Edit after beating the game:
[b]TL;DR - The story might not be great, but the gameplay sure is.[/b]

I know a lot of people aren't a fan of this game's story and I one hundred percent understand where they are coming from and if I'm being totally honest, even after ""beating the game"" there wasn't really a feeling of satisfaction.

[u]So why am I still giving this a positive review?[/u]
[b]The gameplay is definitely the game's strongest point.[/b] Exploring Metropolis is really fun, the city has a lot of great detail and is nice to look at, seeing how much it changes as you progress through the game is actually pretty cool and I love how fluid the movement and combat is, although it definitely took a bit to get used to, it's so satisfying once it clicks. If you dislike the story you MIGHT enjoy the game for the gameplay alone.

When it came to the story there were moments where I was like, ""meh"", but there were also moments that I did genuinely find enjoyable and funny. The character banter can be interesting to listen to (when it isn't playing at the same time as the radio chatter) and a lot of the time I wanted to hear what they had to say to each other.

I think my biggest complaint in the game so far has been some of the support missions because they ask you to kill enemies a certain way and it can be fun but also frustrating at times, like one support mission you can use a flying car and go nuts on enemies and then another will be like ""only grenades deal damage to enemies"" and the grenades just aren't dropping. Luckily you can kill enemies however you want outside of support missions. 

The end game loop is like most games with a live service approach, you pretty much repeat doing the endgame content, gearing up and getting stronger until the next update arrives. So far the end game consists of doing missions to raise your world level and increasing difficulty to get better rewards while trying to gear up your characters to make them stronger, kind of similar to Diablo with torment levels and Borderlands with mayhem levels. If you like those types of end game loops you might like this ones as well.

I'm looking forward to how they'll handle the seasons for the game, [b](END OF GAME SPOILERS):[/b] [spoiler] since the story doesn't really end when you ""beat the game"" and continues through seasonal content, it's still possible for the story to improve (fingers crossed).[/spoiler]  I think the fact that they'll be adding more playable characters in the future is a pretty big draw and I'm hoping the game just get's even more fun when Season 1 starts.",1706917838,1707594367,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Notes:  
* Playtime: There's a good 20+ hours of main mission/story, and easily another 20+ to max level.  Haven't played any coop yet, but single player is still a blast, and while you'll be carrying you team bots, they are more helpful than hindrance.
* Graphics:  Seems to be pretty well optimized for PC, runs smooth with high setting, ray tracing and DLSS (on 2080 TI).  In game graphics are nice, character animations are some of the best I've seen.
* Anti-cheat:  ""Easy Anitcheat"", like they picked the first anti-cheat out of the phone book, rears it's ugly head again and is still the absolute garbage you expect, tainting everything it touches; causing the game to crash randomly and without explanation, typically false flagging and choking on common stuff like RAM RGB lighting.  So be prepared to go poking around in task manager killing random drivers/services it thinks are suspect until the game runs.  Sadly it's probably there to stay even in single player due to leader boards and whatnot.  Hard to fault the game though, the devs and designers did a great job here, but all it takes is one dip shit in a suit to buy into the whole ""easy anti-cheat"" scam and risk all steam reviews gone bad for reasons unrelated to the game itself.  Unfortunately this complaint is necessary; if we don't complain, it won't change.

Something just clicked and I played so much I finished everything...even getting all achievements. This is something I almost never do, if ever. I know reviewers are trashing the game...but if you have even a tiny bit of interest, the gameplay is really fun and addicting. The hours I put in, even after finishing and writing my initial review were anything but boring and it's down to the combat and traversal, it's that good.

The gameplay and story were fun. Story isn't going to win any awards but it did keep me interested. The Squads humor was pretty good as well. Gameplay imo is great with traversal being the real highlight...clunky at first but once you get used to it you'll be zipping around like it's nothing.

Everything you do during the story is what you would end up doing over and over in the endgame, things do get really repetitive even with there being a lot to do. I could see coming back and playing from time to time but nothing long term. After finishing the game and reaching the endgame I'm ready to set it down for awhile.

This isn't the utter failure people seemed to be hoping for. It's not Marvel's Avengers, granted it is live service but this is much more... user friendly/consumer friendly. You can tell they went back and reworked a lot of the game due to live service tanking in recent years...and it shows, there really isn't enough here for the amount of time it was in development. Is it terrible... No, but it isn't great either. It's ""alright"".

Very little woke nonsense, mainly relegated to one flag and some... terribly written codex entries you can tell were written by purple hair activists that have no idea about the lore they are praising (Wonder Woman codex entry) at least it's hidden away there. Any outrage over things you do in the game (Read the title of the game, it tells you what it is)... outrage over that is infantile levels of cringe. Any outrage over ""sending off Kevin Conroy's Batman this way"" is just as pathetic. The man worked on the game, knew what it was about and was even glad to have worked on it. Acting as if this is spitting on his legacy is childish and says more about the people complaining than the game.

At full price, I don't know that the game is worth it unless you're the biggest DC fan as was my case. For others, it would be worth waiting for a sale...possibly even waiting for an offline mode.

Will it be worth it in 3 months time when it probably goes 10-20% on sale to kick off a second Season? Maaaybe?

Will it be worth it in a year when the game has dropped down to like $40-50AUD? Probably.

It's honestly going to come down to what Rocksteady/WB charge for the post-launch content, and whether or not the content is different enough from the base game to warrant putting in more hours than the initial story.

Gameplay is fast-paced and fun at the best of times, traversal feels fun but can get a bit tedious, and at the worst of times engagements can feel a little repetitive - Not much worse than your average looter-shooter, and I imagine there'll be some more variety as they roll out new seasons.

Overall the story is alright, the comedy has it's moments, and I imagine a lot of people wouldn't be trashing the game so hard if it's links to the Arkham series weren't so concrete.

[Scene: The living room of the Banks mansion. Uncle Phil, Aunt Vivian, Will, Carlton, Ashley, Geoffrey, Jazz, and Hilary are gathered around the TV. The room is filled with anticipation as Uncle Phil prepares to play Exit Kun.]

Uncle Phil: [Holding the controller] Alright, everyone, it's time for me to show you how it's done. I'm going to conquer this game like I conquer the courtroom!

Will: [Grinning] Oh, Uncle Phil, you sure you're up for the challenge? This game's got more twists than one of your legal cases!

Uncle Phil: [Smirking] Don't underestimate me, Will. I've got the eye of an eagle and the reflexes of a panther.

Carlton: [Excitedly] Go get 'em, Dad! Show 'em who's boss!

Uncle Phil: [Proudly] That's the spirit, son.

[Aunt Vivian chuckles as Uncle Phil starts the game. The screen flickers to life with vibrant colors and quirky characters.]

Geoffrey: [Dryly] Oh, I do hope this game doesn't test your patience too much, sir. It seems rather... stimulating.

[Ashley and Hilary walk into the room, curious about the commotion.]

Ashley: What's going on? Is Dad playing another one of his video games?

Will: [Grinning] You got it, Ash. He's trying to conquer this one, but it's giving him a run for his money.

Hilary: [Smirking] Oh, this I have to see. Dad, don't break the controller this time!

[A few minutes pass as Uncle Phil encounters his first anomaly in the game, followed by another, and then another.]

Will: [Smirking] Looks like Uncle Phil's legal eagle eyes are struggling with this one.

Carlton: [Excitedly] Go, Dad, you can do it!

[Jazz interjects with his usual flair.]

Jazz: [Laughing] Yo, Uncle Phil, you're slower than a snail in molasses! Let me show you how it's done.

Uncle Phil: [Annoyed] Jazz, I've got this under control. No need for your... expertise.

[Jazz starts backseat gaming, offering unsolicited advice and commentary as Uncle Phil's frustration grows.]

Jazz: [Laughing] C'mon, Phil, you gotta be quicker than that! Even Carlton's dance moves are faster than your progress in this game!

[Will, Carlton, and Ashley exchange amused glances.]

Carlton: [Whispering to Ashley] Dad's got this, right? He's just warming up.

[Geoffrey maintains his composure, observing the chaos with his usual dry wit.]

Geoffrey: [Sipping tea] It appears the game has proven to be quite the challenge, much like trying to teach a fish to ride a bicycle.

[Uncle Phil's temper reaches its boiling point as Jazz continues to tease him with his antics.]

Uncle Phil: [Furious] That's it! I've had enough of your nonsense, Jazz.

[Without hesitation, Uncle Phil strides over to Jazz, grabs him by the waist, and hurls him through the nearby open window.]

Jazz: [Screaming] Uncle Phil!

[The room falls into a momentary stunned silence as Jazz sails out of sight and crashes onto the lawn outside.]

Will: [Laughing] Classic Uncle Phil move!

[The family bursts into laughter as Uncle Phil closes the window with a satisfied smirk.]

Uncle Phil: [Smirking triumphantly] Now, where were we? Ah, yes, conquering this game like a true champion.

[The family settles back, enjoying the spectacle of Uncle Phil's gaming prowess, as the screen fades to black.]

(Verse 1)
Every now and then
I get a little bit lost
In this maze I can't figure out

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit confused
Spotting anomalies without a doubt

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit anxious
That I'll miss the exit, oh what a plight

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I get a little bit frantic
But then I spot the clue in plain sight

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then
I miss the mark

(Chorus)
And I need a hint tonight
And I need a clue more than ever
And if you only guide me right
We'll be finding the exit forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be lost

Together we can navigate to the end of the line
Your guidance is like a compass leading all the time (all of the time)

I don't know what to find and I'm always in the dark
Searching through a puzzle and making some sparks

I really need a hint tonight
The solution's gonna start tonight
(The solution's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was finding my way
But now I'm only getting led astray
There's something I can't see
A total eclipse of the clue

Once upon a time there was light in this game
But now there's only spots that look the same
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the game

(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know I'll never crack the code
You always wanted to hide

(Turn around)
But every now and then
I know I'll always be the one
Who'll seek the path that's deep inside

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no easy exit
As tricky and mind-bending as you

(Turn around)
Every now and then
I know there's no challenge greater
There's no other game I'd rather pursue

(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Every now and then I miss the mark

(Chorus)
And I need a hint tonight
And I need a clue more than ever
And if you only guide me right
We'll be finding the exit forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be lost

It is kind of bullethell like rollerdrome with doom with heavy emphasis on traversal and movement, quickly acquiring and prioritizing targets and moving to avoid damage. Makes it much more niche then the normal rocksteady games which is why its getting shitted on. 

However it is very impressive that they managed to make this game and not feel noobish about it, they must have made some choice hiring, it is pretty awesome. 

Season 1 is bringing promising content in a month and current endgame includes 5 more world tiers, new game +++++ mechanics, tons of gear to get and a set to grind, nightmare dungeon/rift things with infinite difficulty levels and a rogue style endless horde mode that increases difficulty, you can extract when you want (gotta get to the portal though) but if you die you lose everything including the xp. Havent made it there yet I'm leveling all the characters at the same time on hard, about halfway through the story. It is a joy.

Edit:  I just got to the endgame, it looks really cool like the whole story was a tutorial to set you up for these. I have to rip myself off for work tomorrow mornign I'm already running at 3 hours but the first elseworld gave me a second wind.

Edit 2: Now I'm 40 hours in, hitting the nightmare dungeons and starting my build. The game is getting better and better it's a non stop ride. Still improving the traversla naturally, mixed with making a build and finding better and better loot this game is completely unreal amazeballs. Controlled chaos. Just played online for the first time too and it was really nice having a partner in the mayhem.

Final Edit 85 hrs: 

 some endgame criticism that the double edge of the sword of the bane set items being like 80% drop rate and theabundance of resources and ability to roll basically perfect gear is that the gear progression seems very pigeonholed to bane set.

So it kind of ends at mastery tier 60. After that you can go into fire but it's much cheesier and janky and they are going to change all of that 60+ balance with season 1.

. So if you don't want to cheese higher difficulty then you can play your other characters, which is fun, but with the same sort of craze builds the characters feel less unique as the difficulty becomes more gear dependent.

So other then that all I can think of is to play with characters and make worse builds and see how far you can push them for variety. So yea I'm still going ti play my main at 55+ and I can't wait for the joker and the new endgame content, but the hooks/progression/honeymooon pleteus at this point. For me it was 80 hours so I'm definitely not complaining that's a real nice value for a honeymoon, I loved every second so much.

I do prefer that tbey made the gear easy to get and respected my time. I think that is refreshing compared to say outriders (which did have a better story gameplay [mission and boss] wise) where the endgame is endlessly grinding for the best loot. I like the more casual approach, like how I love DMZ in concept and even feel as much as I like tarkov, it is refreshing to have a more consumer friendly casual approach available then a brutal hardcore grind sometimes. And I did still get those ""omg loot"" moments when I found my mastery weapons.",1706902928,1707542875,True,6,2,0.446253776550292969,0,True,False,False

So let’s get to the start and just throw it out there, while Suicide Squad is set in the Arkham Universe complete with returning voice actors in the form of Riddler, Batman, and Harley Quinn, it is NOT similar in any way in terms of gameplay.  Thats not necessarily a bad thing but don’t go into it expecting stellar beat em up and counter mechanics that defined the Batman Trilogy. 

So let’s talk gameplay, its fast paced and frantic with massive amounts of enemies on the screen at once allowing for combo multiplyers galore.  Shooting from a third person perspective with guns and melee combat complete with character specific specials and abilities.   In an openworld setting of a war torn Metropolis your tasked with completing missions to gain new gear and completing contracts to gain resources and money as well as xp to beef up your preference of character.  I role with Cap’n Boomerang as my main but you should really try all four out to see what fits you.  As a looter shooter , the grind is never ending but after putting almost 30 hrs in at this point it seems fair for the work you put in. 

Visually the game is openworld so the details aren’t going to blow anyone away but considering how chaotic it can be, I think it is more than acceptable for the framerates that your going to see.   Its also very rewarding to just see all the damage output from you displayed on the screen.  Metropolis is new and fresh and definitely contrasts from its neighbor Gotham, and it really paints the picture of just how bad Braniac messed the city up.

The Story and characters are where the game really shines.  The character bantering and dialogue between the main cast is fantastic and while campy at times, I really found myself chuckling quite a bit in any scenes featuring Boomerang and King Shark. It doesn’t over do it either, best example I can compare to is the square-enix Guardians of the Galaxy game, which in my opinion was a little overkill.  I’m not sure how long the main story line was but if I had to guess somewhere shy of 10-12 hrs and then the endgame starts.  However, I enjoyed every hour of that damn story and it was better than any movie either DC or Marvel has put out since Avengers Endgame.

That being said, If your looking for a game thats groundbreaking or revolutionary, spend your dough somewhere else.  However,  if your curiosity is peaked, give it a shot. Its fun and you can lose yourself earning new gear and xp for hours. It does get a little repetitive but hell what game or activity doesn’t… take a break, go for a walk, play something else to cleanse your palette.  I do feel the price can scare off some people and I get that but if thats the case wait for a sale and cop it when it does.

At the end of the day, don’t let harsh reviews spoil this one and appreciate it for what it is.  Its a solid title that has potential. 7.6/10

For starters, the game isn't ""horrible"", it's just not great. To my understanding, it doesn't fit the shoe of the expectations that come from the same developing company, nor the genre itself.

This is Rocksteady's first jab at a looter-shooter styled game and it definitely shows. The intro started out pretty good for a modern day live-service title and for the first couple hours, I forgot that's what I was playing. The grounded reality of a single-player game was there, until the world opened up for free-roam and multiplayer. 
When hearing the game was going to be live-service, I was really hoping to see Rocksteady incorporate a Halo style couch co-op that you can play with two controllers, or online. This is NOT that. This is a mediocre port of Overwatch objective style multiplayer ""missions"". 
The story is in the background of the game, quite literally. To continue the game, you must go out of your way to find the real objective. Anywhere else you look, you find daily rewards and microtransactions to remind you that this is not a game made for the fans, this is a game made to turn a profit.

I have zero idea of what I'm doing and I'm just not guided at all. There is crossplay but it's hard to even accomplish. I love the dialogue, but why couldn't they save the Justice League? Make them playable characters, would bust out my credit card for that. For the Comic Accurate suits it's just a weird Deadshot suit that feels like a low quality image, Boomerang is honestly nice, Harley Quinn's is nice, and King Shark's honestly feels weird.

ABOUT THIS GAME
From Rocksteady Studios, the creators of the Batman: Arkham series, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a genre-defying third-person action shooter where the ultimate band of misfits must do the impossible to save the world: Kill the Justice League.


Join the newly “recruited” members of Amanda Waller’s infamous Task Force X (aka the Suicide Squad), Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and King Shark, as they set out on an impossible mission to Kill the Justice League. Drop into an expansive and dynamic open-world Metropolis ravaged by Brainiac’s invasion and terrorized by the heroes who once protected it.


Each Squad member brings their own traversal mechanics to help them navigate a sprawling and battle-torn Metropolis, combining free-roaming exploration and combat verticality for an unforgettable experience. Players are free to experiment with a variety of different play styles to unleash maximum damage on their enemies. Whether in single player or online with up to three of your friends, players can take on this suicide mission their own way.

Post-launch, players can expect a continuously evolving Metropolis with free new playable villains, environments, weapons, in-game events, and more, all included with purchase of the base game.

Not worth $70+. Game play becomes repetitive. I currently cant play solo due to a bug that only allows me to play when others invite me to their server. Just not worth the hassle, wait till the bugs are fixed and its on sell.

Just play another game. The peaks of this games fast movement and slick shooting doesnt make up for the lack of enemy variety and pointless open world. The story is also subjective as to if you'll like it or not but the moments of actually killing the justice league never feel rewarding.

Some say the game play gets repetitive but if you save every side mission for last then sure but if you space out the content as you go along then the game is really enjoyable and challenging at times.

Pros
-Fun as hell, movement focused combat. 
-Awesome art direction. (Always a sucker for art deco) 
-Great sound design and voice acting as expected from Rocksteady. 
-Nice amount of unlockables without being too annoying like previous games in the franchise. 

Bad
-Support Sqaud mission can be brutal, in a cheep and annoying way. 
-Dumb companion AI that won't hinder a single player experience, but do absolutely nothing to help. 
-Yet another video game with an understated score. Rarely noticeable. 
-Online connection is dodgy on release week, frequent disconnects and desynced Riddler trophy's and progress. 
-Controller is a must. 
-RPG mechanics are simple, and disappointing to someone who loves heavy and deep systems. 

Subjective
-Story can be cringe and at times edgy and tryhard, but not as bad as the first movie and the performances really sell it. 
-King Shark is made to be a less annoying Drax. I would have chosen a different direction for him. 
-""Live Service"" is a slur so I'll say it's far more Borderlands 3, then Destiny 2. While I adore both game's I'm really glad this one is far more the former rather then the later. 

My review might change after the release of the first season. B+ with room to grow.",1707298833,1707523735,True,7,2,0.381482928991317749,0,True,False,False
315210,157957386,76561198256844048,0,2,745,5,739,1707887813,"Disappointing is the short version of this. But I will go into more detail in case this helps anyone's decision. 

If you're looking for a story experience like the Arkham games, this has about 5% of that and only in terms of quality of visuals and presentation. I can tell I could like these characters, including the non-braniac versions of the Justice League, but there just isn't enough juice. I was hoping for a lot more from the Justice League especially considering they're the villains. The Flash at least has some build-up to his fight, but overall the boss fights went by super quick leaving me thinking ""that's it?"". And the story being so underwhelming makes doing-the-name-of-the-game feel terrible. I would honestly be fine with it if it was done a lot better. This is where the short length hurts the most because the story just couldn't fit and also be effective. After the hall of justice museum holograms, I was way more interested in seeing them in action as the main focus in such a big event. I hope this isn't the last we see of them, even Batman recast would be fine because I don't like how he ended up after seeing how happy he was with his new friends. I think they should honor his legacy and end it on a positive note (RIP Kevin Conroy).

As for gameplay, it probably won't thoroughly satisfy the majority of people. Sure the movement is decent but stopping to shoot (because it's your main source of damage and the majority of the combat) kind of ruins the flow a bit. Also the performance being so bad probably limited how fast they let you go. Harley's movement is great for comparing to other games that get traversal right (not that I dislike it in this game, it just has more potential and is bogged down by the other gameplay elements) like how much better a regular swing is in Spider-Man compared to Harley swinging from the bat-drone, or even just looking at Arkham Knight's traversal and how much smoother and visceral it was when you did things to speed up. This game's grappler reminds me more of Gotham Knights than Arkham sadly. Another huge miss is not having supplemental mechanics to the main traversal mechanics so you can move along faster and smoother. With Arkham, you can dive bomb to get more speed and distance and also grapple boost to aid in gliding. An example of how they kind of had a useful mechanic to keep the movement interesting is Shark's boosted jump after landing. Like letting Deadshot wallrun sideways would be a small but impactful change. There's just a lack of chaining and it feels unsatisfying being forced to land over and over (not that we should be able to literally fly, but it just feels like we're spamming the same move over and over in a straight line). It's in this weird middle ground where it feels like you can kind of go crazy with movement but they also want to limit you, so neither the experience of being grounded nor in the air truly reaches the potential. It might be a map thing or maybe how they approach the characters' unique traversal, because they all feel like they just help you clear similar gaps rather than moving uniquely through the city. It's a part of the issue with games that have strict molds that every one of their characters has to fit (if we got a Justice League game, I'd want Batman to feel like Arkham Batman but the others should feel like they came from their own game). If you want examples of extremely well executed movement, Spider-Man, Prototype, and Just Cause are great (obviously there are other games that have good movement, I just mean at this scale and with this much speed). 
A big reason why I say the grounded combat isn't great is because while the game pushes you to be mobile with enemies being aggressive, agile, and spread out so you can't really stay grounded, it also has terrible melee. I completely disagree with the choice to make it only a tool for getting shields, breaking shields, or knocking an enemy into the air for a combo. At first the combo thing was cool, but when there's a lot of enemies I didn't find that strategy to be ideal. I appreciated them giving us a direct way to get shields, it wasn't perfectly executed but I like the idea. I just don't understand why they didn't let us melee combo enemies, especially because of how great the Arkham melee is. And I think having the game be 50/50 melee and shooting would at least take the load off of the shooting so the combat can be a little more dynamic. It would even give the devs more opportunity to differentiate the characters by making some more or less melee focused or even give their melee's a niche in the combat (I liked Shark's drop but I think the slam should have been more effective instead of needing to use your traversal attack to really deal damage). It is very possible to mix melee and shooting in interesting ways, and I think a way they should have implemented it in this game is similar to Evil West. If you think you liked chaining the single melee attack with shooting in this game, Evil West lets you combo a lot more and in more satisfying ways. 
It really is unfortunate that the more and more I realized the issues with this game, the more I felt like it should have been almost a different game entirely. Their decisions limited the game's potential so much, exactly like the Avengors game (typo on purpose, those aren't the real Avengers). Every mission has to be played with 4 characters who have to be able to do the exact same thing and they have to have their weapons and gear and movement without any interesting deviation like a story moment that let's you use the ring as Shark or play as Wonder Woman for a moment, or actually give us unique weapons or equipment to use against the JL instead of just shooting and shooting and shooting (the only time they actually gave us something different was for 2 seconds in the Batman missions where they just restricted movement). This reminds me that the vehicle aspect was completely useless and I assume they had to give up on having more than one and just tone down the usage of them overall. It would be a nice change of pace to be able to hop in a vehicle every once in a while but no.

The games as a service stuff was such a bad move. You can tell they were afraid of the looter/gear elements (rightfully so, they're bad in the vast majority of games) so you don't have to focus on it at all to beat the game. And since the shooting is easily the least interesting thing, it's ridiculous to have so many resources devoted to loot. It just isn't possible to make something as good as a triple A game like Arkham Knight while also doing the whole multiplayer, waste-your-time, repeat mission simulator that these types of games always end up being. The hilarious thing is, they don't even have to do all of that nonsense to make the game replayable. And not every game should be designed to be played over and over. Sometimes the big business heads need to realize they can't milk everything for profit and that infinite growth isn't sustainable. It's not like video games don't make money, they just don't all make billions of dollars because there's only a couple that reach that and you absolutely cannot fabricate what it takes to make an insane amount of money.

They don't actually allow you to fight him. As for the Flash fight, they constantly warn you not to attempt it and instead grind out the same 4 side missions over and over and over. 

In these 9 hours we have experienced several soft locks that will force you to quit the game and re-launch it, only to then RESTART the mission as there are NO mid mission checkpoints. 

The combat is fast, frantic and responsive. The story is interesting and the chemistry between the squad and possessed JL members is great. Although the amount of banter can get annoying, often having multiple voice lines playing over each other. Be prepared to have Batman say the same 12 lines of dialogue as he taunts you over your comms during ALL combat encounters.

 There is a game in here somewhere! But after spending $100 on the standard edition for both my friend and I ($200 Canadian total), I just can't recommend this game.

I'll edit my review as time goes on. I'll definitely finish this game with my friend as her and I have been doing every single side quest available. We love looter shooters and wanna see this story through to the end.

For now, it sits at a 5/10 for me personally. I love the combat but the live service aspect really does hold this game back.

EDIT 1: The Flash fight was the easiest thing I have done in the game. It's weird how the game discourages you from fighting these bosses. Cool enough fight I suppose. IGN was just salty when they said they didn't like it because ""Flash was too fast"". The high you experience after killing a JL member lasts for a minute and then you realise that nothing has changed. They immediately introduce an enemy that has speedforce abilities and runs around with a shotgun. Leaves nothing unique for the boss fight you just had...

EDIT 2: So the Green Lantern fight was meh. The cut scene that followed was absolutely incredible but as soon as it's over....you have to escort an ice cream truck from point A to point B while killing enemies. That's all this game is. It has maybe 5 mission types that are re-used but just given a new look. It might be an ice cream truck, a bus, a bat-mobile or whatever but they ALL play exactly the same. The batman fight was the worst of them all.

My friend, despite having a $4000 computer with components like an RTX 4080 and a 24 core CPU, has crashes multiple times a night and he isn't even running it on max graphics like he was originally. I myself have only had one crash and I have a 3060 with only 6 cores of CPU, but I have to run the game on the lowest settings possible and even turn off anti-aliasing, which sucks considering I can run red dead 2 and other heavy games like resident evil 4 on max settings with no issues.

the only valid criticisms are 1. missions do get repetitive, 2. it can be very over whelming to everything on screen. 3. 70$ is expensive for every AAA game not just this one but i have no regrets spending 100$ for my self and getting 2 friends a copy as well.

The story isnt bad its the suicide squad, so its supposed to be funny and not taken seriously but has some serious moments. the characters are written well. and superheros can die, most people cant accept that. rocksteady took a chance that most people dont do cause of backlash this game got undeserving before it came out.

Where this game shines is the core gameplay, which is addicting and fun as hell, which make the repetitive missions still enjoyable.

the end game was really fun to get all the unique gear. this is a lootershooter and they had enough gear to keep me looking  for the items i wanted to keep me playing for a while but 80 hours in i pretty much have seen all the gear so far till future updates. now im just looking for Master versions of the gear i want.

for a live service game just starting out i think its doing a good job cause it had enough end game content to keep me playing. and what they have laid out for the future FREE content has me really interested to see where this goes.

this isnt a perfect game and its not for everyone, but if you like fast pace traversal combat. then this game is a no brainer to pick up. if you just get it for the story just wait for it to come on sale while more story is unfolded in future seasons.",1706923980,1707500040,True,2,0,0.532163739204406738,0,True,False,False

I've seen and read a lot of reviews and while some have positive points, in general everyone agreed that this game is not good overall. I wanted to have my own experience to judge it so I bought the game, only to ask for a refund 105 minutes later. 

From what I've played, I didn't like the game. I mostly played as Captain Boomerang because I really enjoyed his traversal on the map and I enjoyed using his boomerang as melee weapon but overall, that's pretty much the only two things I liked. I really didn't enjoy the gunning at all and to be honest I think it was a mistake to add this in the game. Beside Deadshot who should only use his arm machine guns and maybe Harley with a pistol, I feel like these characters shouldn't use guns at all. I don't remember seeing Boomer using a gun in comics and I'm pretty sure King Shark only use his fists and teeth to kill his enemies. They should have followed the same path Avengers used. Each character has an unique iconic weapon with a skill tree to unlock new abilities. That would have been so much more fun this way because now it is just a gunfest and playing a different character is pretty much useless. Also, guns are just guns with different skins. None feels unique to use.

I didn't enjoy the gameplay neither. The game reminded me a lot of Sunset Overdrive which I really adore but there is just too much going on on the screen. It's almost nauseous. The gameplay itself is just the same thing over and over. Go to point B, cutscene, attack enemies, cutscene, repeat. That's it. Not fun.

Storywise, the narrative is ok but not great. Humor is passable but a bit cringe at time. I feel like this game wasn't made by Rocksteady but by People Can Fly. About things that happen in the story, I believe that what are have seen so far isn't the true ending. I think a lot of people only believe what they see so while certain things happen to certain characters in the game, if you look closely to small little details like cutscenes and dialogues, you'll understand that these things aren't what they seem to be. Since the game is live service and will have future content but also because the game talks a lot about multiverses and elseworlds, I believe that some characters will come back, one way or another.

(Anti)-Hero customization is pretty limited and that's a real bummer. I was expecting something like Destiny to be honest. While it is a bit better that Avengers, it is pretty similar to Gotham Knights. It's cool that each skin has different variants of hair, clothes and shades but it's a real shame that you cannot mix these variants between skins. 

So yeah, overall I'm happy to have tried the game by myself but unless the devs changed a lot in the game, especially the gun system, I have no more intention to play it. Even if it was free, I wouldn't replay it. If you enjoy mindless looter shooter and don't care about the story or the characters, you might like the game otherwise, very unlikely.",1707498990,1707499335,False,14,0,0.53895491361618042,0,True,False,False

It did not impress me as some of the other games did but it gave me something to work with. The best part of this game is the gameplay and traversal. The guns feel surprisingly good and the traversal flows together very well. However, I definitely still have issues with the story, specifically Batman (SURPRISE!!!). It feels like a lot of his development from the previous entries is thrown out. Like this Batman would never have gotten on an alien ship without knowing whether or not they are friendly. Anyway, I also have an issue with the boss fights, because as the main points of the game, they feel like they have little to no impact. Like it really was fight JL member, wait for them to get low on health, shoot them when they are weak, watch them fall over, characters make funny joke, and scene. Very rinse and repeat and it just wasn't satisfying. But all-in-all, I think this game is worthwhile as the loadout customization, gameplay, traversal, and map are really good.

The truth is this game will never be or live up to the Batman Arkham Series... and that is okay. This game is fun and although it may feel repetitive at times people have to understand that is what a looter shooter game is going to feel like (this is coming from someone who grew up on Destiny on the Xbox One). However with the plans to release new characters every month this game has potential. Please Rocksteady add the characters we want to see like Bane, Reverse Flash, Killer Croc, Deathstroke, etc. A HUGE BONUS would be if they let us play as the Justice League eventually however I don't really seem them doing that.

27 hours played. 4/7 in terms of introductory campaign chapters. Lv.11-12/30 on all characters. One boss battle down. Reading/listening to all of the lore content, doing all side missions and openworld activities as and when they unlock, or I discover them. Playing fully solo at all times.

tldr: Best introductory campaign for a game in the looter-shooter genre. Premise is engaging, characters are well-written, plot beats are enjoyable, and the balance between activity freedom and narrative funneling keeps the player's momentum going, without making you feel like you're on a conveyer belt.

Overall, one of the better story campaigns in the looter-shooter genre, (somewhere between Destiny 1 Taken King and Destiny 2's Forsaken.)

Positives/negatives:

+ Early chapters are well-paced, giving the player a good mix of cutscenes, lore, mission locales, and live gameplay.
+ Combat is incredibly moreish, and I find it difficult to move through the world without wanting to pick a fight with something.
+ Enemy AI and friendly bot AI is solid. Enemies will flank, surround, and outmanoeuvre you. Ranged enemies find good perch points. Friendly bots utilize all of their kit, and keep pace with your movement and repositioning.
+ Openworld activities are competent and often feel fresh, due to the game's unique traversal. Friendly bots understand these events and engage competently, (including with most of the event modifiers.)
+ The traversal system offers a choice of Anthem/Tribes Vengeance/FFXV Noctis/Savage's differing approaches, and utilizes them to their full extent.
+ Build complexity seems fairly broad, when considered within the full scope of perks, gear, and playstyle.
+ Crafting, and crafting material loop is good. Doesn't feel overlay grindy, and has good transparency in terms of what you can roll on what item or slot.
+ Gear stats and UI is thorough. Not quite Call of Duty levels, in terms of stats, but close.
+ Audio/visual presentation is sublime. Stunning level of detail, draw distances, and world-density.
+ Social-integration seems on-point. The ability to download characters from your friend's profile, or from the regional/global scoreboards, and use them as AI bots who auto-scale to your solo progression, is very cool. 
+ UI, keybind/controller customizability, and the range of client setup options are solid. FoV slider and headbob limiter are included, for those who suffer from motion-sickness.
+ Good mouse and keyboard implementation. Mouse feels clean.
+ Essentially bug-free, thus far. (One cutscene that failed to progress, which required a force-close, followed by a rewatch of that brief 60 second cutscene.)
+ No disconnects or downtime during the period I was playing.
+ Pause functionality while solo! (Not common in this genre.)

- Very CPU limited in the openworld areas. To the point where your choice of upscaler is largely irrelevant.
- Audio levels aren't the best balanced by default, (pump the dialogue, so you can catch all of the openworld/flavour chatter lore,) and the audio track can get a little busy if you don't stop to listen to each round of banter.
- Sensitivity slider's upper limits required me to switch DPI to be able to maintain the same sensitivity between hip-fire and ADS.

---

78 hour pre-Season completion and 100% achievement update:

This game is - without doubt - the best shooter-looter I've played so far in its launch state, and I have absolutely no idea why social media and the press are laying into it. That 83% Very Positive on Steam, and the 4.6 stars it's gotten on PSN? Thoroughly deserved.

Playing Quinn is like returning to Quakeworld CTF after nearly three decades, nailgun et al. Aussie Noctis is like a shotgun pinball on steroids. Fish brings back memories of stalking around in Savage, as one of the bigger beasts. And Deadshot is an Anthem Retiree that clearly didn't want to give his gun up.

There's so much movement goodness in this game, and combat is absolutely *the whole package*, rather than just individual disciplines, like just aim, or just cooldown management, or just buildcraft. Reminds me a lot of Warframe, before Digital Extremes decided to make the game slowmode, so the latecomers on Switch and mobile wouldn't get left behind in a mission.

I can't get enough, and I seriously can't wait to see what March brings.

nerfed the whole league (p.s where are the other league members, there are only FIVE???)
big downgrade from arkham series (i dont even know why its in arkham continuity)
clapped poison ivy
deadshot is BLACK? LOL (not a bad thing but deadshot being a ""replacement"" is a crazy excuse considering there was an arkham movie literally contradicting this)
combat is repetitive
BOSS FIGHTS SUPER UNDERWHELMING WTF. fights are SHORT and EASY. basically noi challenge and killing them isnt even satisfying. its just shoot and counter?>? 
league members are not given their proper respect (too easy to kill and are twerked on when they die) c
graphics are worse then batman arkham knight? somehow? looks good every now and then but bro
Jokes are funny but are used like every 10 seconds. funny but doesnt leave room for seriousness, (especially when beloved characters we've known for so long are shit on)
story: meh. honestly, don't get this game for the  story cus ur not missing much, its js post-arkham bs and more of an excuse to unnecessarily continue the arkham universe when its already ended)

goods:
characters and personalities of shark, boomer, harley, and deadshot are well done. Their characters actually FEEL like them and their interactions are fun to watch. The chemistry between the 4 are also well done.
traversal movement isnt bad. all 4 ways of moving around are unique and fun. 
graphics are SOMETIMES good (sometimes it shines, like in some scenes it looks beautiful but its not consistent throughout the game)
ya get to play with friends! maybe this is a bad thing for yall but im having fun enjoying it w my homeboy

keep in mind. I do like this game personally, even though its bad, but its not as bad as everyone is saying. it's not a good game if you think homage is being payed to the Arkham universe or if you're getting it for the story/boss fights, but if you want a DC filled shooter experience then this might be for you.

After putting a ton of hours into this game, I can say that I had a good time. There are things that I really enjoyed throughout my time with Suicide Squad, and there are some negatives as well that I want to share. The story for me was okay, with me not having played any of the Arkham games yet (and I for sure will eventually) I didn’t have that expectation going into this game like a lot of people. I honestly like the premise, killing the good guys to save the world…because I probably like the villains as much as the heroes in movies. I kind of wish the heroes had cooler deaths, but that is just me nitpicking. The pace of the game did feel a little slow because of the amount of cut scenes. As you play throughout the story, you are continuously learning about new enemies, mission types and abilities etc. for when the world finally opens up to you. I think a big positive was the variety of mission types, especially for the endgame. The grind to get my mastery levels up to obtain the final achievements was not too bad. Gameplay feels really good on my current pc setup, with only a few crashes in 50 hours. I really enjoyed the Riddler challenges the most, but currently two of the three achievements associated with the Riddler are broken for a lot of players including me, keeping me from perfecting this game. Hopefully there is a patch soon because it is not only happening on Steam, but Xbox and PlayStation as well which absolutely drives me crazy. Side missions were cool, same for the main playable characters. Each character has a completely different feel to them which keeps things fresh. Co-Op worked flawlessly and made this game more fun. I think Rocksteady hit the nail on the head with level progression and difficulty stages that can be adjusted dramatically as you get familiar with the game and your build. There is definitely good in this game, and you will probably be able to grab it for a steal sooner than later. It’ll be cool to revisit for seasonal content and achievements in the future.

Looter Shooter + Arkham + Sunset Overdrive = Kill The Justice League

It's a really decent game with a ~20 hour main campaign so why the negative review? For attention obviously, and because $70 is far too expensive for what it offers and plans on including a battle pass. There is a lot of speculation this game will be abandoned at the two year mark which is fair since the majority of players would have found other games to play by then but the problem is there's all this content you could've included just a small bit of at launch like the Joker DLC and none of your original players are going to be around to experience it by that 2026, even the ones like me who did pay $100.

It is a good game, it launched in a perfectly fine state aside from being always online, and if you're a fan of Harley then you'll enjoy another Tara Strong performance killing it in every scene she's in.

I bought it not only 'cause I am a massive DC fan but because I have faith in Rocksteady to deliver something that I will enjoy.
To ensure we all get that delivery, they need to be given a chance. 

Based on a theory I came across on Reddit, which I've linked below, the story still needs to be completed. If it is true, I am excited for what's to come and do say that if you are on the fence and can afford it, go for it. It may get repetitive at times and currently doesn't stand up to the likes of their previous work, but if they get the support they need, I believe they can turn this into a game with a vast library of characters and an engaging concept for players to enjoy. The numerous DC villains players could finally have the chance to experience is endless and can only happen if this game gets that needed support. 

And as for Batman, Kevin is heartrendingly gone. As much as I would love to have them rectify the lacklustre ending to my favourite iteration of The Dark Knight, it's unlikely. We've all suffered from this tragic loss and need to be understanding with the development team. I can hope there's light at the end of the tunnel, even to just get more of the best Batman voice to ever be, but I have it in me to forgive and let go of this whole thing; I encourage all to do so as well. 

Again, if you are on the fence and can afford it, please give that support to them. 
This game may not be game of the year material, but with your investment can be the most worthy of Steams Labour of Love in the coming years. I believe in them and so should you.

I'm a big fan of the Arkham games and a comic book nerd. With that in mind, I can't really accept how you deal with the JL as Suicide Squad. 

With that aside, the only saving grace for this game for me are the cinematic scenes, the banter between the members, and the traversing mechanic in the game. Everything else, I just couldn't care less to do. Riddler challenges? Boring this go around. Side missions? A lot of them are boring and revolve around three types of quests: 1) King-of-the-hill inspired gameplay, 2) Kill an infestation area, and 3) Rescue 3 goons for X NPC. There are twists on each side quest like, grenade only kills, or only pistols, etc. While at first it was fun to do the challenges with these prerequisites, it quickly became boring. I could care less about how I do the side quests. I just want them done. Multi-player I honestly haven't tried, but then again couldn't care less to try. No particular reason for me, it just didn't appeal to me.

Gearing is similar to a very light version of Borderlands. Or at least it's supposed to be. I got a decent gold pistol/shield (I played as Harley), and a legendary SMG at around level 9 roughly. I'm about to be level 20 and I still haven't found any gear better than these items in the sense of DPS output. Tragic. A looter-shooter where my loot (so far) doesn't matter.

My rig has a 4070, 128gb RAM, and an i9 CPU. I still average 50 FPS. Often times the game becomes blurry while out in the open world. Almost as if there is rain coming down heavily, obscuring my vision in the game. Indoors, the game looks very nice. There is a stark difference in quality almost immediately exiting the HUB-world in this game (the JL Tower). It was so bad at first that I actually grabbed my glasses to see if my eyes had became irritated staring at a screen. Thankfully / sadly (?) this was not the case. The game just looks bad.

Additionally, the always-online / live-service is such a disrespect to the players of a game like this. Several times I lost connection to the server for no reason. I have fiber internet and am hard-lined in. I can count on one hand how many times I've lost connection to a game server and it was my fault. The times I lost connection to the server were, you guessed it, at the most crucial part in a quest. This forced me to task-kill my game because I would be stuck in a re-connection / loading screen for several minutes. I'm not sure if it was due to my force quit of the game, or if it was because I lost connection, but I would have to redo whatever quest I was on. I would imagine a solid 2-3 hours are of me redoing quests that I had already completed. 

Lastly, the price tag. I fully understand and can accept a $70 price tag of a game. If the game deserves it. At best, this game is a $45 game in its current state. The state of the launch for this game was horrible for the deluxe buyers with early access to the game. People paid more than the base $70 to play this game early, only to be met with a game breaking bug that took an extended amount of time to fix, topped with an additional server maintenance the day after that took several hours to complete. Users were given $20 worth of in-game currency as an apology. The sentiment is nice, but very disappointing for those that wanted to play the game early.

TL;DR: The game has decent cinematics and party banter. It has subpar graphics and is poorly optimized. The story line is laughable and the side quests are boring and provide no real substance to the game, aside for a time cushion to pad the game. For a looter-shooter, the loot is meaningless. I would give the overall rating of a 4.5/10 for the game.",1707444241,1707444241,False,20,0,0.529786348342895508,0,True,False,False

It's not Batman: Arkham City, and it's not trying to be. I've heard a lot of scathing reviews, but at the end of the day it's a fun game. The characters feel alive, each bit of dialogue lends more to the players understanding of the character. They're villains, their actions and their dialogue doesn't let us forget that, but they still remain endearing and unique characters. The game-play and traversal also feels fun and unique. The Riddler is still a pain in the ass, but the only real problem I have is how often I'm holding the traversal button, it hurts the finger after 5 or 6 hours of game play, but apart from that it feels like it's own game. The Boss Fights against the Justice League feel like they do right by the characters. The Flash is fast and likes to talk, Batman plays is quiet and terrifying. The Criminals that make up the Suicide Squad feel like Criminals each thrown in for different things. The dialogue hits nicely and there's a bit of a focus on combo, but it's not a deal-breaker, it adds to that sense of 4 criminals against an invasion force. At the end of the day, It's something I fully intend to play both on my own and with friends, because watching Captain Boomerang being an absolute rat in every cutscene, Deadshot's professional but angry snark, Harley's Psychology Background and her Manipulation and even King Shark's Literary Passion add to the mish-mash of Waller's Task Force X.

The boss fights had some fun and interesting mechanics, but felt a bit easy (could have been because i was high lvl on my main character). There are story elements and things I would like to see explained more, so I'm definitely looking forward to the upcoming DLCs.",1707443459,1707443459,True,1,0,0.474552959203720093,0,True,False,False

I'm not typically into shooting games myself but I like DC and I've enjoyed it thus far.

Each character comes with their own travels skills.  So you can zip around with a grappling hook as Harley Quinn, Fly around with a jet-pack as Deadshot, Tap into the speed force with Captain Boomerang and ...uh... jump as King shark.

Ok so some are admittedly cooler than others but there seems to be a lot of depth to not only each character traversal skills but also their builds with character perks, gun/melee weapon/grenade perks and afflictions ontop so theres a lot of different play-styles within each character too. 

Movement feels very smooth and chaining mobility together to kill packs of enemy just feels good, as well as being rewarded by gameplay systems.

In the state this game is I do not recommend it but I like it.

Story: 5/10 
(Spoiler Warning)
A story like this was definitely the wrong call to be in the Arkham Universe (Should've been an else world story)

The story was a bit fun and the writing is as expected form a game written in the style of James Gunn's work. The overall plot to kill the JL is as expected, I thought they would back away from it and find some cheesy way to save them instead but I am genuinely surprised that they didn't go in the direction I had originally thought. The cut scenes are actually really solid, I wasn't expecting the acting and facial mo-cap to be that good honestly. 

Addressing the ""elephant"" in the room. This story is centered around you killing The Justice League. Plain and simple, it's what you do. So when I saw all the hate for how Batman was killed, all I can think is ""but that's what the game is about?"". I understand people being upset that this was the late and great Kevin Conroy's last performance but when you play this game and hear his voice, you know he poured his heart and soul into the character as he always had before. So people saying this was a waste of his last performance, I disagree. Nobody knew he was gonna die so soon and nobody knew this was gonna be his last project, everyone involved in making the game and writing his character were just following the narrative of the game. Of course they weren't gonna write him differently as if they knew he was gonna pass away. The hate for the writing and use of his character is unjustified and overall disrespectful to Kevin Conroy, he played Batman in a darker light which was fun but overall it was amazing to hear him for one last time.

Gameplay: 6/10
The gameplay is pretty simple and a bit boring. (When fighting small enemy groups)

Traversing the city is really dope depending on what character you're playing, for example I think King Shark has the best type of movement for this game with his super jump and ability to swim in the air or like Deadshot and his Jetpack but for Cpt. Boomerang and Harely it's not the best. Boomerang can ""teleport"" I.E. Run super fast to the spot he marks with his Boomerang and Harely has Batmans glider and Bat Grapple as combo but both feel so clunky and unpolished. I'm really surprised that Harely being given Batmans actual traversal methods is the worst for me but I feel like a lot of it has to do with the fact that you have to wait in-between each use of the grapple and the timing gets longer and longer which really ruins the flow of movement. 

Besides Traversal let's talk actual combat, overall it's fun but simple within it's own right. At first I thought it the gameplay was gonna be very one note as most gameplay had a big focus on upper cutting someone in the air and then juggling them with your gun but there are other mechanics to think about. The juggling mechanic does extra damage and drops more ammo on kill, shooting an enemy in the leg turns enemies blue requiring you to perform a melee attack to gain more shield drops, and certain enemies have small lighting indicators warning you to ""counter"" them leaving them in a slight stunned state. All these mechanics are fun in a large group of enemies but in small groups it's very dull. There are also these things called ""Afflictions"" which are essentially elemental debuffs that have their own special properties against enemies, really nothing else needs to be said on that. Every character gets their own unique ability to dish out massive damage to a large group or to deal out damage to one specific enemy (Typically you would use it on a bigger enemy type or use it as an escape to gain a quick burst of shield on a smaller enemy type).

Boss fights is where i think I had the most fun to be honest. They were a bit the same except Batman's but besides that, this is where you're traversal skills/counter skills are put to the test and it makes you feel like you're playing an easier version of a bullet hell type game. There is a lot of potential here for future boss fights and hopefully future missions.

End Game content / Gameplay loop: 3/10

I don't honestly see a reason to play once you finish the campaign. I get it that you wanna get more loot and see those damage numbers go up for that dopamine rush but overall there isn't enough unique missions for you too keep playing and there isn't enough loot variety for you too keep loot hunting. The missions you started out with in the story are the same missions you're doing at the end of the game and that's honestly really sad. I can only wish that they would update the game in the future with different missions or special event missions or hell give me what ever a dungeon would look like in a game like this where the end boss is beating Brainiac again or some kind of big boss type because the boss fights for this game were pretty fun. Basically the start of the game is the same as the end of the game with only difference is you being a bit stronger.

TL;DR
This game shouldn't have been in the same Universe as the Arkham Series and the end game content is heavily lacking. I'll keep playing because personally I'm having fun but it's not a game I would recommend till I see the game going in a better direction.",1707437147,1707437199,False,20,0,0.581332862377166748,0,True,False,False

While on the other hand the mission variety and what you are going to be doing almost seemed sort of like an after thought because you will find yourself doing the same objective over and over again, as a looter shooter vet I see no problem in that so long as you have more then a handful and currently Suicide Squad only has the handful. The endgame content and loop is something that I think has a good foundation at the start and has a meaningful reward like gear sets and different tiers of loot that you can earn as you get increasingly higher in rank. Gear and builds are something that I wasn’t exactly sure about going into this game and have actually been one of the things that I found myself really diving into once I had hit level 30, afflictions, crafting, moding and then eliteing your gear is going to take up some time and resources but in a looter shooter that the name of the game.

The game is average but the good kind of average.
Cutscenes are great, graphics are really good and the VA performance is top-notch.

Now onto the gameplay.

Gameplay is pretty solid as well with all the traversal moves you can do and the unique-ness that exists between the 4 playable characters. It is really fluid and fun to zoom around Metropolis in style.

And pretty much that is where the good things stop.

Story is painfully average and after a certain point, around the half way mark, you can feel that something happened and everything just goes down way to quickly. Maybe Rocksteady was forced to wrap things up quicker than expected and they just didn't care as much about the second half of it.

Endgame is offering a good challenge especially in higher difficulties that are unlocked after finishing the story. Won't go into lots of details here because I wouldn't want to spoil things for anyone genuinely interested in buying the game and want to discover things by themselves.

Enemy variety is low to none at all because there is only one faction you are against during the whole game and endgame. I hope this changes in the next seasons because the game already starts getting repetitive already and cannot see it surviving as much as Rocksteady wants it to unfortunately.

Sure, I would prefer a singleplayer story driven game instead of this or even a co-op non-live service game but oh well, there is nothing I can do for that matter, this is what we got in the end. Maybe their next project lives up to the expectations.

I wouldn't suggest buying it for full price, wait for it to be on sale and try to get some friends to enjoy it better because in my experience is a lot more fun with friends, especially in the endgame.

I see this game as what Gotham Knights could've been if Rocksteady had developed it.
Always been a big fan of Arkham series and loved every part of each game from combat/mechanics, movement, story line, character development, and Rocksteady's constant attention to detail. 
Suicide Squad brought a very nice twist to the standard arkham series with the weapons leveling, weapon mods, the new traversal methods for each character and I definitely enjoy the new combat system. 
There is a small learning curve at first when it comes to battling enemies since arkham was more stealth = down an enemy instantly or 3-4 hard hits from batman knocks down an enemy. 
SS introduces health bars, having to get critical hits or counters on enemies to knock them, or specific forms of affliction damage etc. 
Storyline is amazing too, im a huge DC comics/Batman fan so, having the option to play as the ""bad guys"" and take down the heroes brings so much enjoyment. 
Have not encountered any bugs/glitches or issues either, running the game very smoothly at ~70 fps.
The ONLY issue I have is that I wish rocksteady gave some detailed explanation/story of the gap between arkham knight and suicide squad. While YT videos or even in the game, they talk of him joining the league with his identity being known, just being able to see that 5 year span wouldve been dope.

With each character having different weapon selections, skill trees and VASTLY different transverse abilities it takes time to truly master each character. The combat system definitely prioritizes movement, and learning each character enough to have their play styles and movements locked into muscle memory in the heat of combat is a fun experience

Story has some really dark points, but never takes itself too seriously, and actually got me to laugh out loud a few times

My only real complaints is that the reward screens take too long, and the entry price point is a little high

Story was entertaining, game play loop is fun to just burn some time getting gear or load up with some friends and goof around, end game seems interesting and will only be built on as new characters are added to the roster and new worlds become available

I expected much better and more from the same studio that pioneered combat from the Batman Arkham games. I don't recommend. 5 or 5.5/10.

[h1]READ THE REVIEWS, SOME ARE NOT COUNTING TOWARDS THE REVIEW SCORE!!![/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h3]There may be spoilers below. You have been forewarned![/h3]

Back when I discovered this game, it seemed like such a cool idea for a Suicide Squad game. It would also grant my dream of being able to play as Harley lol. I was really looking forward to it. They announced a closed alpha play-test which I managed to get into, and man did I find it fun and smooth, with virtually no bugs. Afterwards, I felt confident in the game and pre-ordered the deluxe edition.

Then we found out 4 days before release that they had decided to chuck in Denuvo along with the always online requirement on PC, which pissed me off immediately. DRM is pointless, games will [u]always[/u] be pirated, and you only hurt the customers [u]who are paying for the product.[/u] It also makes game preservation difficult, since trying to tap into the files is made really difficult for no good reason. People who enjoy and can afford the game will pay for it to support you. And yes, before someone comments, they have said they will add an offline mode, but it isn't for months after release. They haven't even given a date. Until they actually add it to the game, no one has ""won the fight against always online games"". Do other games do it? Yes. Is it still BS when others do it and should they be called out for it? Absolutely. The most outrageous part about this awful release is that they compensated [u]console owners but not PC users despite experiencing more issues[/u]. However, despite this, I decided to keep my order and try it. Man was that a bad decision.

In the playtest, I was playing on an RTX 3060 at high graphics settings, with no DLSS, getting a pretty stable 60fps at 1080p. For the final release? I'm still playing on the same hardware, and I can't even get a stable 30fps at 1080p with DLSS absolutely cranked and low graphics settings. Yes, I had vsync disabled for both. I have [i]constant[/i] issues with textures not even loading properly. If I melee an enemy, I can be dropping down to a single digit frame rate. [u]It is unacceptable performance.[/u] Again, this is what I have experienced. Some of my friends have had better experiences on PC but this is my review, and I'm telling you what I personally experienced. 

Not only this, but I have experienced a number of bugs. For example, at the end of the Batman boss fight, my game crashed without any error or warning, and it turned out that when I got back into the game, it hadn't saved [i]anything[/i] I'd done in the fight, not even a checkpoint, so had to do it from the very beginning. I also had issues with enemies occasionally becoming invincible (no they didn't have shields or anything else) and missions failing to start (such as the escort missions), such as the both of which could only be fixed by restarting the game, and issues with audio just glitching and stuttering in fights, and no, it wasn't when the game was dropping all of its frames because I melee'd an enemy. 

The beginning of the story is really good, however, it only goes downhill after you defeat the first boss. With only a hand full of enemy types, very few mission designs, and pretty generic and uninspired combat (I was hoping at least that the melee would be more in depth than it is, it's seriously basic), it wasn't fun for me. The boss battles are way too easy as well (apart from one). How is Superman harder than Brainiac (when Brainiac managed to take control of him in the first place), and why does Brainiac choose to use Flash abilities over Superman's? Or why not combine them or something? The last boss battle is super lame, and is not hard. It's a very generic and predictable story. This was a studio that pioneered Arkham combat, I expected them to do the same for the looter shooter scene. The only cool thing is the traversal mechanics, but it isn't enough to hold up a mid story and repeated missions. 

In regards to the online aspects, skins are also outrageously expensive. £17 to get all the skins in a pack is expensive, and the fact you have to pay to be able to remove the head piece from the classic outfit that was supposed to be a PC pre-order exclusive is insane and ridiculous. The friends menu is straight up broken, claiming that friends who I know have the game don't exist, and being unable to join anyone's game. At best, they show up, and it says they are in the main menu, even when they are not. 

Just before the conclusion, I wanted to add a bit about the community, because man is it something. On one side, there are people who don't like the game because it isn't a Batman game, and on the other, are people who are claiming it will be game of the year. Neither side is right, don't let the haters or boot kissers get to you, make your own decision. You can always buy the game, and refund it if you're within the first 2 hours of play time and are still within 2 weeks of buying it on Steam (even then, they're very generous). Both sides are toxic, and don't want to listen or hear the other sides perspective, and it's especially noticeable in the official Discord server. It's fine to like the game, and it's fine to not like it, but to harass others over it is insane and childish. 

In its current state with Denuvo, always online, performance issues, predictable story and generic gameplay, no I can't recommend it. I'd give it a 5, maybe 5.5 out of 10. I don't see Rocksteady fixing these performance issues on PC since they couldn't be asked to fix the broken graphics options that cause crashes in Arkham Knight on PC, and issues like the predictable story aren't fixable with any number of patches. Even if we get more variety with the online aspects and other more interesting characters, additions to the story and new mission types, it doesn't fix the base story, which is boring and tedious.

Edit: Fixed some grammar, formatting issues and made the TL;DR a bit easier to read.

Edit 2: I have since sent a refund request (that has been very kindly accepted by Steam). There have been zero patches as of writing this review and the game is still as broken as when it released. I was holding out, hoping that there would be at least a bug fix update, even if it was small by now. People still aren't getting their deluxe items and I can still barely run this game. The lack of attention and care towards PC players disgusts me to be honest. 

I also wanted to add that cheaters are a big problem in this game. The anti-cheat can literally be disabled by editing one config file, and there are either no or barely any server-side checks. This is [u]exactly[/u] what I was concerned about pre-launch, that there would be a problem with [u]cheaters that affect all players including console players[/u] due to cross-play. They have also done nothing to address this so far, not even issued a statement about it. 

There is also a lack of players in this game, the game's peak player count is less than half of Arkham Knight's and absolutely minuscule. This game's future is not looking bright, and for a company that has $45b worth of debt, I absolutely see them charging for the content that they initially promised was free, or ending the game's lifespan short. Sure, there are console players, and it is doing better on there, but it isn't doing well by any stretch of the imagination, and it certainly is not going to pay off the hundreds of millions of dollars WBD would have spent on this game, never mind contribute to paying off their debt.

[h3] Scroll down for short and spoiler-free [/h3]
[spoiler] Of course, most people have been saying this game has disrespected Conroy and his recent passing, but I see none of that in the game. Of course, Batman's death was pretty cold and bitter, sure, but there was a tribute at the end towards him. And Batman is the only Justice League member to have had a lot of screen time. Most of them ended up dying after their third or second appearance, making Batman the most important villain in the game (besides Brainiac). He also has the coolest segment in the entire game, in my opinion, bringing back memories of the old Arkham games. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] Now, gameplay-wise, the game is very specific when it comes to people who will like it. I personally enjoy the gameplay, as I used to play Sunset Overdrive when it first came out, so any loot and shoot games are fun in my books. I personally had more fun playing this game then the recent CoD, which is the same price and all. AGAIN, this is just my opinion.[/spoiler]

[spoiler] This game is also one of the few that actually had me laughing at the cutscenes. Sure,  some of them were corny, but I thought they were pretty good for what they were. Captain Boomerang and King Shark are mostly stealing the show with their stupid humor. [/spoiler]

[h1] Short Version / Final Verdict [/h1]
Kill The Justice League is one of the few games that actually had me playing it every day to try and reach the end, always having something to do in-game. But the gameplay is not for everyone. And for the price tag of 70 bucks, I'd say wait until it's on sale. At least 60 bucks would be good. Now I haven't experienced playing with friends, but I can only imagine the fun and chaos that would be brought with the fast-paced gameplay.

I'd give Kill The Justice League a solid [b] 8/10 [/b] for everything it offers, and I'm honestly excited for what's to come with the game's life span!",1707371335,1707371335,True,7,1,0.471243500709533691,0,True,False,False

I'm a fan of the Arkham games. I completed Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and dropped the series after that. This is supposed to be set in the Arkham universe, so if you really care about the continuity and the fate of the characters in this series, you may hate the story of this game. I don't (there's a million iterations of Batman I can read) so this didn't bother me. 

The story itself is extremely mid. There's a lot of very hit or miss comedy. An obvious comparison is the Guardians of the Galaxy game which is leagues beyond this game's story on every level.

The gameplay is fun, but repetitive. If you like games like Just Cause where you can jump around and murder bases of minions, this does a decent job of scratching that itch.

There is so much to do once you finish the story (wich is basically one giant tutorial), and move on to the meat of the game. 

The traversal/movement can be a little iffy at first, but after some practice (preferably with a controller) you start to dominate it and it becomes second nature.

The game presents you with several different mission types, that you repeat as you progress, but the addition of new mechanics, as well as the difficulty increase post story, keep it challenging and entertaining.

If you are looking for a handcrafted game, that meets every one of you unrealistic expectations, then this game like every other game ever made is not for you. Instead you should consider doing gaming and every other gamer on the planet a favor, and find something else to do with your free time.

UPDATE

I had this game returned and after the bug was fixed got it for the refund so to my eyes its a net zero loss. I playted the game again and its still enjoyable, the story is a fun twist that tears DC fans at the heart when they play through it, the voice work is top notch, the interactions between characters is enough to make me want to idle just to hear the dialogue. That said, the requirement of a controller of time to rebind so many keys because the traversal is different between characters with different key inputs to do their advances moves is honestly frustrating to the point I would rather play release day Mirrors Edge. And thats putting it lightly, not to mention how inconsistent some of the movement mechanics are.


If you are looking for a great twist to the comics and Arkham series, check the game out. The characters show great development in how they go from villains and villainous side kicks to anti-heroes as well as the struggles between the character's dialogue quips and additional information from side items like the Riddler and side quests. If you are looking for something fun to play that doesn't frustrate you or play like the older games from this developer; just play the Arkham series again, save yourself the stress and frustration without the live service and online requirement this game has.",1707163321,1707364303,False,14,0,0.550854802131652832,0,True,False,False

So overall the public discourse on this game can be pretty decent and downright rough when it comes to a few topics that that i will label here.

1. Corporate Shills : people blindly defending a game refusing to see any form of criticism whilst paying for this games microtranscations, upcoming battlepass, repetitive missions, weird loot.

2. Valid Critics: people who generally have decent valid criticism about a game and its mechanics and developer choices without being either delusional or being akin to a rodent in human form.

3. Delusional People and Fanbases: yes i get your favourite hero got wiped off the playing field especially with the prior quadrilogy which are pretty good games but i guess if you want something to complain about you will find a million reasons. some of the delusional takes iv seen at attacking the devs that made the game instead of idk, not playing the game.


Actual Review:

so overall i find the story of the game to just kinda be alright in general, nothing amazing but nothing absolutely horrible either. just some things that could've used a bit more polish.

Gameplay:
Each character having their own style of play and traversal movement is honestly a really good touch, similar to Gotham knights from what i've heard.  ' i have never played it '

Boomerang has a speedforce gauntlet that allows him to zip around the world and in a fight at remarkable speed, making it really good for that somewhat vague Doom-like Playstyle.

Harley Quin has Batmans Drone and Grappler which allows her to swing around the open world kind of like spiderman but with very limited use cases pretty fun to swing from one roof to another during a fight.

Deadshot has a Jetpack which allows him to fly for a limited time in both fights and the open world, with an afterburner ability that allows you to go pretty fast but burns the energy gauge faster.

King Shark just does funny jumps, kinda like crackdown or that really old hulk game, pretty fun i just didn't use him as much.

Missions in this game are very very repetitive but can be eased with the fun gun and movement mechanics aswel as doing combo's and abilities. in later character levels you unlock more abilities tied to creating Combo's so whilst you are cutting through enemies in a mission interesting abilities might activate in the middle of the fight. with the character gameplay the game had a good opportunity to make missions more engaging with more variety but it falls short.  'missions being repetitive goes for both main missions and side missions'

This game reminds me vaguely of Crackdown and Sunset Overdrive.

Cutscenes are pretty enjoyable in this game but some jokes aren't as funny atleast to me since comedy is pretty subjective but even so i can't say i wasn't engaged in any of the cutscenes going on.


Looter Shooter:

Loot wise the game seems pretty odd to me but that may be myfault since i didn't spend that much time using the overhaul or elite-ing system in the endgame. ' i still have no idea what making an equipment piece Elite even does ' 


Overall despite my lack of experience on min maxing or looking thoroughly into the best loot for a built this game does seem to have very good potential for build crafting in general.

Personal Gripes: 

This game  alright, its not amazing nor is it horrible is generally not worth the 60 to 70+ price tag i'd reccomend getting this game on a sale for it to be worth the possible fun you might have with the game.

i will say this game did feel somewhat short-ish me and my friends played during the 72 early access and completed the game and got into the endgame before the game came out.

i get most games now generally have battle passes but most of the are free 2 play games so its a bit more forgivable and understandable but this is a fully priced game that has an upcoming battlepass which is somewhat sickening to me aswel as there being micro-transactions at launch ' even in the 72 hour early access ' i guess if its just not your thing just don't buy the game or buy the game and ignore them.

SUMMARY:

This game is fun but has the average Looter Shooter issues with boring objectives and repetitive missions. good gunplay, interesting abilities, cool character and diverse movement, interesting cutscenes with some comedy, kind of like Sunset Overdrive, Cringe Upcoming Battlepass, Microtransactions in a full priced game, Overpriced game buy on sale.",1707237116,1707362597,True,7,0,0.463425934314727783,0,True,False,False

I do understand the frustrations with how the Arkham-Verse story has turned, especially to fact that we haven't played this iteration of the Justice League up to this point except Batman. I will list out what I disliked, liked, and found okay. These are my opinions...
Pros:
- Great characterization, dialogue, and line delivery for most if not all characters
- Mostly amazing and fun cut-scenes 
- Very fun traversal
- Amazing looking and distinctive map of Metropolis which includes a ton of easter eggs as you would expect. 
- Set up is very nice with hints of things to come 
- The Rizzler's side objectives aren't a nightmare to complete but more so for you to explore the city
- Wide variety of rarities which I loved about Borderlands 
Mid:
- Combat and weapon system, nothing ground breaking but doesn't mean it's bad/good
- Boss fights. They are fun mostly though aren't too interesting mechanics wise. Don't expect an Arkham City Mr.Freeze type boss fight if you know what I mean. 
- Overall the weapon designs are distinctive enough to not always look like copy paste though of course there is some. 
Cons:
- Poor execution of the Justice League's deaths literally and metaphorically (except Wonder Woman)
- Repetitive mission designs
- Always online
- Investment... What I mean is that this is WIP story so I would recommend waiting to get this game on a discount or when the story gets better with more mission designs/game modes
- Brainiac's design and main story ""final"" boss fight
- Forgettable skill system
- Lack of build up for some of the Justice League before fighting them or at least feels that way.",1707292750,1707360559,True,3,1,0.451959162950515747,0,True,False,False

I'll even go a bit technical here. Some exceptional things that it does, not just good but amazing:

1. The character controller is one of the best i have ever used. Just walking, turning around, jumping, everything feels so well done. Animations and transitions are 10/10.

2. Face expressions are top notch. I can't think of ANY game out there that has such amazing facial expressions. With Harley being the most well done and boomerang second.

3. Direction of cut-scenes is sooo good. Loved every bit of them. Music is also picked correctly.

4. Design of the environment is such a breath of fresh air. They went bold and it worked.

5. Character design. Every character is so well done and has his/her own personality.

6. Verticality is done well and traversing feels so much fun.

7. Character traversal being unique makes the game so much more fun without making the characters unbalanced something that games like Destiny 2 fail to execute. Each character has its own identity expressed in design and traversal and not power. This is good to me.

8. The story is FUN and i love it. Another breath of fresh air.

9. Suicide squads representations is done really well here. I won't go into spoilers but there are multiple times that these guys outright cause innocents to die for their own benefit in the story. We might be trying to save the world but they didn't simply turn into good guys.

I can just keep going. Yeah the game has it's issues but it has so many good things going on and in the coding and design side of things they devs have created a marvellous thing.

But as with all thing in the past decade people are fast to join the bandwagons. We all know that talking about the next bad thing is a conversation people like for some reason. It's what gets the most clicks. So content creators are really fast to pick up on it and juice up video after video with sheep that can't form their own opinion following along. And i am absolutely tired of it.

Let's take Diablo 4 for an example. The game scored a great score. For being an always online game that had no point being one, completely lacked endgame, had insane issues from lagging, questionable design choices that still plague it to this day(items, stats, progress lost for things that should not like way-points).

Yet for what it offered it got a generous score from every reviewer out there. And here we are. Another looter live service, always online game, that gets butchered by people for the endgame being repetitive or lacking, always online or loot. But right out of the box although the experience towards that lacking endgame is an amazing and well done one. Simply because people were up in arms before hand. Unlike Diablo where people joined the bandwagons only when streamers and content creators started spreading the word when they realized they can't truly keep making content and streams out of this endgame. Even the one guy that benefited the most from diablo4, DM, is now skipping this season leaving behind the game that changed his life. But abused the shit out of it early on. Now joined path of exile and when D4 gets a good season he will be back for the milking :) Or Paul Tassi, which i honestly like, but everyone that follows him knows that survives on dishing out negative videos(bidaily negative destiny videos ). Even when he is right he just kepts beating a dead horse for the juice. And people seem to love it.

And of course the Arkham Knight fanbase. Like IGN made a post ""a fictional batman from a fictional world deserved better"". Are you people joking? This was the worst fanservice video IGN could have puked out. I get that you are hurt but holy moly it is not your decision and hurting a whole game and devs job because you don't like how they massacred your fictional billionaire and that is a damn stretch.

To anyone reading this that is on the fence. Get this game. It's amazing fun, has a fun and interesting story with lovable characters and great gameplay. Might not hit the nail of the live service itch yet but first season is coming in a month so we ll see. But for what it is right now IGNs 5 is absolutely butchering for sake of proving a point without acknowledging anything that this game does right.

If you like looter shooters like Destiny and other games like Diablo, you will probably like this game. The combat is fun and focuses on your traversal method. The story is alright, it's a comic book story. 

And for people being upset about HOW the heroes die, it's a video game and Superman is literally a Mary Sue. He can get out of any situation he is written into because of his amazing powers, but that wouldn't be fun for the game or any story, would it? The heroes outcome is always determined by story. Take it for face value, like it's supposed to be, and the game really is fun. Now, it is a little more repetitive than games like Destiny and Diablo in their infancy, but this game is also in its early stages, and while I hate live services, that does mean it'll just have more story and content added on. 

Oh, and the Deadshot retcon is dumb. I would have disliked it even if the character models were swapped, it was just a weird thing to do. I don't think a ""fake"" Deadshot would have gone toe-to-toe with Batman and Deathstroke in the previous games.

Anyways, the game is fun. Is it perfect? No, but if you like the genre, you'll enjoy the game. I advise trying it yourself and requesting a refund if you don't like it. Social media feels like it hasn't given this game a genuine chance because of everyone's need to dog-pile things with a hate boner, which has skewered a lot of second-hand opinions.",1707355180,1707355180,True,3,0,0.463599979877471924,0,True,False,False

1. Loot is often unexciting. Legendaries often have aspects like ""Do 2x damage to heavies, but do 0 damage to grunts"", or ""constantly lose shield while you have >1 grenade in your inventory"". Sometimes these are cool, but often they're tossed in the garbage.

2. Lack of diverse endgame content. Campaign is maybe 12 hours, and the endgame beyond that is 3 repeating missions and 1 boss. You're expected to do these 13 times each, which means the endgame is doing the same missions 52 times. This hopefully will be expanded upon in ""season 1"" & onwards.

Overview: The core gameplay mechanics of ""Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League"" delivers a dynamic experience. The game has a roster of intriguing characters. I Love the diverse set of skills each Task Force X member possesses. Among them, Captain Boomerang became my go-to choice, thanks to his exhilarating traversal mechanic. Whether swiftly navigating the environment or using it strategically in combat, the sheer fun of playing as Boomerang is unmatched.


Storyline:
Plot Overview: The narrative of ""Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League"" is enjoyable, but short. The plot keeps you engaged, and the interactions between Task Force X members adds a layer of humor, making the missions all the more compelling.

Arkhamverse Connection: On a personal note, the tie-in with the Arkhamverse didn't resonate with me. While I understand its thematic relevance, and making a follow-up to Batman: Arkham Knight, I found myself wishing for a more standalone experience. However, this doesn't overshadow the game's overall quality.

Justice League Battles: While the confrontations with members of the Justice League were intense and memorable, a part of me wished for more opportunities to face off against other iconic heroes. I'm hopeful that future seasons will bring additional enemies to the forefront, expanding the already rich gaming experience.


Graphics and Environment:
Visual Appeal: Graphically, ""Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League"" looks great. The attention to detail in character designs and Facial animations is Amazing, contributing to a visually stunning gaming experience.

Metropolis Design: The portrayal of Metropolis is breathtaking, Exploring Metropolis is a treat for any DC fan.

Technical Performance: Remarkably, I encountered no technical issues throughout my gaming sessions. The game runs seamlessly on my IntelArc A770, providing a smooth and immersive experience. This technical stability significantly contributes to the overall enjoyment of the gameplay.


Conclusion:
""Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League"" delivers on its promise of an Action-Adventure within the DC universe. Despite my personal reservations about its connection to the Arkhamverse, the game's strengths far outweigh any minor drawbacks. I'm eagerly anticipating the future of this title and can confidently say that it's a must-play for fans of DC.
Without a doubt, I would recommend ""Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League"". Its gameplay mechanics, storyline, and graphics make it a great addition to the gaming landscape.",1707346257,1707346257,True,2,2,0.479902386665344238,0,True,False,False

Lets put it this way, it wont be an Arkham game, so do not expect that. Sure, Arkhams Batman is in this game, but his mind has been corrupted by Brainiac, so he is being used more as a puppet than anything else. If you do not like a looter shooter in the same vein as Destiny 1 or 2, then you probably wont like this game. As the story progressed, I was genuinely intrigued on how this rag-tag group of villains were going to beat a brainwashed Justice League. They hardly retain anything of their normal selves and there is an element given to their behavior that reminds me of The Boys. 

I haven't completed the whole game yet, but I have found this game to be a fun third person looter shooter set in a DC sandbox. My wife and I have had a lot of laughs and don't take it too seriously, and consider it to be a cool ""what-if"" scenario that is a little different from an Injustice or Justice Lords story. 

I like the game play, each squad member is unique and you can augment the weapons and melee items to your liking and their strengths. I personally like Deadshot and King Shark the most.  I have had no issues with my PC port, and my wife has had the game crash on her twice thru PS5, and I have experienced none thru my PC and crossplay allows us to play together in a drop-in drop-out basis.

I paid full price and I cant say I am disappointed with my purchase. If you are on the fence either wait for it to be discounted or just stream the main story content which I am sure is all over the internet by now.",1707342798,1707342798,True,1,1,0.450402677059173584,0,True,False,False

If you liked the Arkham series, looter shooters, Gotham Knights or Guardians of the Galaxy, you'll like this one. This is basically an open-world Guardians of the Galaxy game (but DC) with fantastic combat, re-playability, crossplay multiplayer and the potential of a very bright future with free DLC characters and extra story content coming over the course of this year and hopefully longer.

Each of the characters controls in a different way, and all of the traversal methods are fun to use and make the combat fast and energetic. You can switch between everybody on the squad at any time, and there are no restrictions on who can play as what, so if you want to play multiplayer, you can all be Deadshot, or all Harley, or all Boomerang or King Shark if you want.

Storywise, the game continues the Arkham-verse. Or a better word to use would be to say it revives it into something new and different. There is still the depth and darkness that was always there, but there are also a lot of jokes, and the apocalyptic setting allows for some big changes that you might not expect. It's a game called 'Kill the Justice League' so you should know going in that there aren't going to be any pulled punches.

In terms of dialogue and characterisation. If you've played Guardians of the Galaxy, it's pretty much that, but DC and Arkham flavoured. King Shark is essentially Fish Drax, Boomerang is an Australian comic relief with a heart of gold type character, not dissimilar from Rocket Raccoon, Deadshot is the 'straight' man, rolling his eyes and trying his best to lead. Harley is a stand out, because she has the most interesting characterisation outside of the game already, and the game uses that to massively improve her character from the Arkham games. 

These changes to Harley are a big reason that insecure men are being haters for the game. She isn't the hyper-sexualised idiot bimbo from Arkham City. She is over the Joker, and can use her intelligence as well as her combat abilities to stand as her own character. I'd be worried about drawing negative attention from these types by putting this part into my review, but I doubt that they have the attention span or ability to read to get this far.",1707342593,1707342593,True,3,0,0.482570052146911621,0,True,False,False

The Traversal is amazing, the characters are each unique, The Environment looks gorgeous, performance has been good, fun end game and its just super fun to play the gameplay loop of traversal and shooting. My biggest issue with the game is lack of variety in mission design and enemy types (I would love more groups of different enemies roaming the cities on in missions).

 I don't like much Super Hero or Comic book related things. Other than loving the old Arkham games (City being my favorite), enjoying the Super Hero strategy/rpg from the Xcom devs and liking the Batman movie from the 80s and The Dark Knight. That is it, every other thing Superhero related I have not enjoyed over the years.

I hated the Gotham Knights game that came out last year, hated Marvel Avengers, wasn't big on the Guardians of The Galaxy,etc.. but I am having a real blast on Suicide Squad.

Lastly, I also am not a big fan of Live Service games usually, I enjoyed most my time with the Division games and I play some Diablo 4 but in general have not had a good experience with Live Service games.

Positives:
- Some of the best traversal and movement ever imo, reminds me of Sunset Overdrive and Crackdown 1/2 with its Traversal, but even better.
- Movement is super smooth, ties into the traversal but yeah controlling these characters is a blast!
- 4 very unique characters that handle totally different , especially for Traversal and moving around the map while fighting or to get to missions. Its just fun as hell learning each character and leveling all 4 up.
- If you like Arpgs give this a try, gives me alot of the enjoyment I get with good Arpgs. This is half Arpg and half Live Service.
- They are actually doing the Season Passes very user friendly, you can comeback at anytime and do a later season if you missed it and they are also releasing a bunch of free content. This is the way you do a Season pass imo.
- Graphics are amazing, well done to all the character and environment devs, they killed it, the game world is gorgeous and very well done.
- The Audio is very well done, from the sounds of things to the voice work, top notch work here
- Gameplay is just overall good fun from moment to moment, wiith traversal being so good then right into a fight as you are traversing all over, its great fun.
- I love controlling and leveling up all 4 characters, takes awhile to learn them all, if you are in a clan you can also end up having some of your friends characters (It seems to take the highest level for each AI character you have with you).
- The story is pretty decent, I usually always end up skipping the dialogue and cutscenes in Superhero games, except for the Arkham games. Despite loving the Xcom guys Marvel game, I was skipping all the dialogue at the Abbey base as it was terrible. This game though while not amazing story, has not made me skip it yet so its good enough for me :)
- Controls are very good, you always feel in control and feels great once you master a few characters you didn't use much earlier on in the game.
- No crashes and no big fps issues for me in 20 hours on the game. Only bug I had was once at the end of a mission it sent me from multiplayer/coop to my singleplayer and I had to do the side quest again, wasn't a big deal. This game is much better shape than Arkham Knight was on PC on release.
- The Boss fights are mostly all great 

Negatives: 
- There needs to be a little more variety in the quest structures and for the side quests that are around the game world and end game.
- I wish there was a handful of different groups of enemies walking around the city. There are groups that go around & the stuff in the sky (helis and drones), but they all look the same, add 2 or 3 more groups that have variety please!!
- In 40 hours on the game I been disconnected from the games servers 4 times so far and had the off small bug not alot., but hope this gets straightened out. Not nearly as bad as say Diablo 3 on launch though but still a few kinks that need to be worked out (Had zero bugs during campaign but in end game have had a few)


Overall this game is a nice surprise, as I said previously I am not big on Super Hero games or Live service games but this is good fun. Is it perfect? No of course not. Is it the best game ever? no. But its a really fun Super hero game, that I wasn't sure how I would like, but 40 hours in and I have had a blast. Yes it is different than the old Arkham games but its still super fun imo, just in some different ways.  I hope people give this game a shot, because its fun as hell.

I have played a bunch of the End Game now and its good fun, much better than Marvel Avengers or say Outriders end game. I would score it a 8/10 personally, just needs more variety in enemies walking the streets and in mission design. 

Despite my two issues with the game I would still rather play this than I would Marvel Avengers, Destiny 2 or Gotham Knights, traversal and combat is just way more fun for me in this game than those other Super Hero or live service games. No it isn't a new Batman Arkham game, but it is still a very fun time to be had.",1706903278,1707338462,True,11,5,0.526637613773345947,0,True,False,False

I'll talk about every aspect I consider essential if you are considering buying the game.

[h3] - GAMEPLAY: [/h3]
The gameplay is definetely the strongest aspect of the game, it is quick, dynamic, rewarding and more importantly [b] fun [/b], Captain Boomerang is by far the most fun to use, I read a review calling it a mix of borderlands meets sunset overdrive and it couldn't be more spot on.
Personally I do feel like other than the powers that each character have the gunplay aspect of the game feels like it's the same for all four characters tho. There are certain type of guns that some character can use that others don't but It really boils down to which character you prefer shooting as.
Traversal is really fun to master with each character but I do feel like the distance they travel could be a little bit faster sometimes after finishing a mission your next objective will be on the opposite corner of the map and the speed in which you travel does start to weigh on you, sadly there is no option to fast travel to any landmark on the map except for the team's HQ where you upgrade your arsenal and craft more items to use on your mayhem which is convinient, but I do hope in the future they can add more points where you can fast travel to.

[h3] - STORY: [/h3]
After TLOUS part 2, this is the game where I got spoiled the most on the internet, which is sad since I couldn't browse anywhere without eating a huge spoiler. I do agree this game shouldn't have been in the same universe as the Arkham series, that ends up hurting this game's story rather than enhancing it, which is a pity given how the whole concept and story is really interesting (for the most part).
[u] Spoiler free review: [/u]
Story is solid, [i] the Justice League have been brainwashed by Brainiac after invading Metropolis, in an effort to stop this threat Amanda Waller puts together a team of villains to try and stop Brainiac from taking over the world. [/i] As I said, the concept of regular goons trying to take on literal gods is peak to me, I like all members of the Suicide Squad but Deadshot, he is easily the most boring and uninteresting member of the bunch, he never really has anything to say, and given how the game is connected to the Arkhamverse his whole existence literally makes no sense, he is a retcon character of an established mythos, FYI this is supposed to be the real Deadshot as opposed of the fake one we see in the Arkham games (which are canon BTW), and if you somehow forget that he is the real one along the story, trust me, he will make sure to repeat it every chance he has. This is one of the instances where making the game in the same part of the Arkhamverse, hurt it. In my opinion you could've replace him with Bloodsport and none would've bat an eye. But aside this Deadshot rant the rest of the characters are well written, every performance (besides Deadshot) is top notch, the stuff I have complaints for are in the spoiler territory below.
[u] Spoiler review: [/u]
[spoiler] Surprise, surprise, like the title says you will be killing the Justice League in this game, somehow a lot of people apparently have a problem with that, maybe it's because we got a Suicide Squad game before a Justice League one or because they don't like their favorite hero being killed. I myself don't have a problem with the whole concept of the heroes dying and the villains taking the spotlight, as I said being in the Arkhamverse is a disservice to this game mainly because if we are talking about the Batman of the Arkham series, I do believe he wouldn't have returned to being Batman after Arkham Knight let alone getting brainwashed by Brainiac so easily. Other things that were a let down are the bossfight against the JL members, all of them felt so underwhelming, ALL of them, not even a cutscene worth of a sendoff for each of them (except Wonder Woman), they just take a bullet and die, no last words, just dead. Their deaths don't have any impact on the characters or the world around them, except that now some of Brainiac's goons will be infused with the powers of the defeated superhero. The most dissapointing death storywise was Batman's, although we do get an eulogy after the credits I still feel dissapointed in how the main character of one of the most infuential game series of all time was unceremoniously executed like a dog. Gameplaywise Superman's fight was a joke, I played it on the hardest difficulty and the Man of Steel felt more like the Man of Paper, you'd think each bossfight would have a gimmick to it, but no, just shoot the supe until they die, hell I don't think Superman gets a sendoff even. Those parts are dissapointing given how much of a buildup each fight has. [/spoiler]
 
[h3] - THE GAME AS A SERVICE: [/h3]
It definetely has the base to work as live service, given how this is a pseudo RPG looter shooter, the incentive of farming for better items and loot is there, the gameplay surely works in its favor, but really they didn't thought of the live service aspect of it at all, all the objectives in the game, and I mean all objectives, are to defend something, go here defend here, that doesn't make for a good model of live service at all, it doesn't matter how fun or good it feels to shoot enemies, people dont want to repeat the same process mindlessly although I do have to admit if you want to play with your friends while ""grinding"" it does feel much better and engaging, but then again its because the game was designed to be played by four people at the same time, the incursions which are the endgame content are really the same as the regular defense gimmick the main game has except they drop better loot and the ocasional mutator to spice thing up. This game would really benefit of a raid type system, like grouping up, each player pick a role to help the overall team composition, complete objectives that are not just defend, face some miniboss and lead to the raid boss which given how this is the DC universe you can pretty much have any superhero or villain as the boss, hopefully they plan to do something like that for the seasonal content, the game has the potential, but right now is lacking those core elements that could make it a compelling live service game. 
It's been known the game has microtransactions even if it is priced as a full Triple A game, as of writing this review these microtransactions are just for cosmetics items only and not for gaining a gameplay advantage, Devs have stated the premium battle pass would be cosmetic only as well, along with a free version of the battlepass, personally I would prefer if you could unlock cosmetics through gameplay rather than buying them. Seasonal content will be free which is also a good sign if you were worrying about investing more money in the game.

[h3] - PRICING: [/h3]
So take this with a grain of salt, due to the pricing in south america this game costed me 40 bucks and I absolutely recommend that price for the game, nowadays every AAA game costs 70 dollars which is absolutely nuts, why I don't understand is why this game in particular is taking the blame for it, that is how every game company is pricing their games now so as a consumer I feel we take this energy to combat that pricing in general and not cry about it for a single game, cuz it ain't gonna help nobody, if you have experienced the game you'll see that it does have the polish of a AAA game in every aspect of it, it has care in its characters, environments, and gameplay, so my final thoughts on this is that WB didn't shit out this game from one day to the next one, there were thousands of people working on this and just for the scope of the team behind it I do feel it needs to be priced as a triple A game, whether you think it deserves that pricing or not is irrelevant really.",1707336755,1707336755,True,8,6,0.402781546115875244,0,True,False,False

So i bought the game, and i enjoyed it, i even enjoyed the writing, the story made me have many a ""ha ha"" but what i did not enjoy was the game breaking bug i still have where i cant play past the beginning of chapter 2.

At the exact same time, every time i finish a mission i get an error:
""Unable to connect to server, attempt to log in again""

At which point i am placed in a loading screen that goes on quite literally for eternity, and isn't helped by the loading screen saying ""Just a sec"" 

And this isn't all the bugs with the game. If you take a glance at the discord they link you too in game to the troubleshooting section you'll see people with missing skins(i bought the deluxe edition and i can't even tell if i got my deluxe skins because you need to clear chapter 2 to see them?!?!), people that make changes to their gear and then go into the game and these changes didn't save at all, auto saves not working so people having finished big quests just go back to the main menu after to make sure it saves their progress, and there are even people that can't even play the game at all who are stuck on the main menu because they can't sign into WB.

It isn't game of the year by any means, but it isn't the worst game either. It's just important to understand what you're signing up for. 

Do you want a great story about DC characters you love? You may want to stay away from this. 

Are you a fan of games like Remnant, Outsiders, and Warframe? Then you may want to try this.

What really shines in this game is the gameplay. The gameplay is like a cross between Doom Eternal, Borderlands, and Sunset Overdrive. It demands so much mental and manual dexterity that it is genuinely overwhelming at first. When it clicks though it becomes this beautiful cacophony of controlled chaos.

The main problem holding the game back is the repetitive mission structure. Endgame involves doing the same 6 missions over and over. They don't even change up the dialogue. What's worse is that these missions are first introduced to you in the most awful way possible. See, as you go through the main game, there are these side missions that feel mandatory because they unlock important upgrades. Those missions also put restrictions on the player. These restrictions will often be something along the lines of ""enemies can only be killed with shield harvest"" The idea, obviously, is to help the player understand the ins and outs of the mechanics of the game. The problem is that this sours the player's attitude towards these missions.  It makes the part most people will play through a glorified and entirely unnecessary tutorial. 

Then there's the story, this game is a trifecta of comic book stuff I don't like. The Suicide Squad is not the best concept despite how hard DC tries to push it. Characters turning evil is so trite. (Superman fans know.) Finally, if you've read any amount of comics, the death of any character has no weight. Given enough time, a cape always comes back.  I have no proof. They've hinted at nothing in the narrative. Yet I'm willing to bet that some or all of the Justice League will come back if the Suicide Squad live service goes on for long enough.

Yet despite these overarching problems, the story is made entertaining thanks to the Suicide Squad themselves. As I said, I've never really liked the Suicide Squad as a concept. This game is the first time they've really grown on me. There are a few cringy jokes, sure, but more than a few jokes land. I care less about what these characters are doing, and more about how they relate to each other. Which honestly makes the endgame more annoying because they just repeat the same stuff over and over and the personality just drains from them. 

If Rocksteady can weave in more compelling missions and modes as they introduce new characters and maps, then I think time will be very kind to this game.

And I feel like they did a good job with the playable characters (deadshot,boomerang,king shark and quinn) it had me loving all 4 of them their mechanics feel good range of movement is stellar and I think the game dose a good job of bringing these characters into the light. The game also dose a good job with giving this reversed look at what were used to with the justice league, gives players a new perspective on their fav heroes. One criticism though I don’t rlly like how they introduced the rest of the league (- Arkham Batman) we didn’t rlly get to see how these Arkham verse  versions of these characters were actually made of before their mind control but it was still cool to see them.

...but the story is not really what I expected. I don't think there is a need to talk about all murders, Flash, Brainiac and Superman having no dialogue or good cutscene for their death or the way Batman was killed. Also because the story will likely change with new seasons (I feel like that was not the real Justice League).

I gotta say that Flash bossbattle was great even tho it was not so challenging or peculiar but was a fun ride. Green Lantern bossbattle was very interesting with many entertainment dangers and had a good epilogue. Batman bossbattle was probably the worst of the worst, with a template everyone had played in their life and no challenge at all, it seems like they lost creativity on this one (God, it was the only one character  worth the game). Superman bossfight is hands down the best one and extremely challengy, I had a very good time with it.

Batman death is... strange. I understand why they decided to do something like this and I also get why many hate on this. I think giving bad guys the possibility to show their perspective was a hard challenge and probably Batman wouldn't die like this, but I don't think there was a better way to make it. I mean, there was no cure... it was moving seeing Harleen talking one last time to Bruce, a heart-breaking moment that really upsettled everyone. And that's why it worked. Batman was never the man, the character, the LEGEND that could have a good and proper ending. He died twice and twice we lost him. Three times now with the late legend, Kevin Conroy.

Although the plot and writing are mediocre in comparison to the award-winning drama and action that was the story of the other Arkham games, it's not awful. Whenever this game should be connected to the Arkhamverse lore wise is questionable, but not completely outlandish. The passing of Kevin Conroy, Batmans voice actor has left a hole in the Arkhamverse. Finding another voice actor for batman might be difficult to get use to considering how much Conroy was loved for his performances and character throughout three critically praised, and another positive/mixed game in the series. So taking the series in a new direction where batman is not the protagonist isn't that bad of a idea, and I commend the developers for trying something new. I sincerely appreciated the developers nod to Conroy at the end of the main game's story, and feel like the goodbye cemented Conroy as ""the"" batman in his memory. Cutscenes in the game are fairly engaging, and I feel the cast of characters, both major and minor were chosen wisely. The graphics are beautiful, map size respective, and the soundtrack is nice. The game shows comparison to the Saint's Row and Borderlands franchises, with its witty and immature humor, colorful, exploding game play, and emphasis on lots and lots of loot. 

There is a fair amount of content in the game to explore, but with the main story being done as quick as around ten hours, and the games side missions becoming repetitive rather quickly, the game feels lacking considering it is seventy dollars as of writing this review.

Even with future planned content, compared to other looter-shooter games in the market, Suicide Squad is outrageously overpriced. The only thing holding it back is the price tag. Otherwise, I could recommend it.

The game is good as far as story and quality of the story. The game play is what you expect from any looter based shooter. So no you won't have any problems there either. Some people have said its a little repetitive but I don't mind that seeing i bought a looter shooter for just that shooting and looting lol.

The biggest problem at the moment and I why i can't recommend the game Is due to the really bad Servers. If your hope was to play with friends and venture deep into high end gear and end game content it will require a strong party for sure so for this reason i can't recommend the game right now.

After the game went Live the servers took a massive hit. Its rare lately to get a couple of hours in without getting kicked out the server. without a offline mode to fall back on this issue makes the game unplayable at worst and really tiring at best. I expect this from a Alpha or Beta game still in development but not from a triple A title. 

Now i know the game hasn't been out for more than a week, so I will just say don't pick up the game now, just wait a bit and see how stable the servers are from people who have bought the game sadly. 

Again I can't stress this enough I'm not saying the game is Bad, not playable, isn't fun and not worth trying.
I just can't recommend the game right now due to the bad servers at the moment so at best this is just me saying WAIT just a bit before investing in the game.

I'm a superhero game lover so it really sucks that this game is having similar server issues like Marvels Avengers any many other live service games. I had hope a more qualified studio could make a good live service superhero game but i'm not so sure its possible to have a great launch with live service games when a couple Servers can almost derail a really good game entirely.",1707161587,1707322366,False,15,0,0.538758516311645508,0,True,False,False

- Doom Eternal

had a baby and made Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. The game has an extremely high skill ceiling and the unique traversal mechanics each character has are a blast to navigate the city with. 

The story in the game was short - I beat it in 15 hours - but extremely high quality. Anyone telling you that Rocksteady didn't show respect to the Justice League characters in their portrayal here are full of it. There is a ton of end game grind for those who enjoy the core gameplay mechanics.

The live service hysteria was warranted up until Rocksteady clarified that the only microtransactions were cosmetic. The content that is already here will provide me around 100 hours of fun before I get sick of it and we're getting new characters, story, and gameplay events for free. I'm very glad that we got this instead of Rocksteady trying to figure out how to make Superman/Green Lantern/Flash playable characters in a video game because that would've been the most boring game imaginable.

The endgame has a lot to be desired since they expect you to have a great time with a glorified Destiny 2 public event, if you know, you know. Should you get this game? Probably not. Should you get this game when it receives a massive discount in the future? Just go play another game.

So STUTTERS need to be fixed ASAP, other than that the game is fun to play and all the updates in the future will make it even better.

So after the initial ""The game is out"" phase I only see stutters and frame issues.

The four playable characters (at launch) are great.  Voice acting and models are excellent.  Sound is good.  The graphics are very good but you do need a strong PC to push the highest graphics possible.  However the game supports the best video card options such HDR, Ray Trace, etc.  The game has a large map with various locals showing different types of neighborhoods.  However this does not feel like the massive city scape of Gotham.  
  
Gear options are plenty with different tech available from different manufactures.  Gear reminds me a bit of Borderlands.  The free seasons (starting in March) will introduce new characters.  Seasonal cosmetics will be a paid for option for players to decide on for themselves.  The free DLC is a huge added value.  

A few of the mission types at launch are repetitive.  They scale in difficulty and location but you have to run them in the same manner to complete them.  Like capture the flag for example.  However the campaign play at launch stands out and is narrative driven.  The size and total time of the campaign is average.  With the DLC being free, I think the slightly higher up front cost makes sense.  

There is all kinds of negative non-sense going on about this game at launch.  It seems alarmingly stupid that people are really angry that the Justice League gets smoked given the name of the game is literally called Suicide Squad:  Kill the Justice League.  They are the iconic members of the Justice League and they are not nice send offs.  So, if you cannot maturely navigate such a story line that sees your childhood hero killed, this game is not for you.
Second.  Art is art.  Games are games.  Stories are stories.  A company has the right to generate and present whatever story they want.  People have the right to walk right past without a glance or shell out the money or cast not a penny.  What is not ok is to be unfair, deceitful and manipulative with no objectivity.  That is what is happening here to a large degree.  Many are lashing out because the Arkham that they loved is gone, the Bat is erased and they did not get what it was they wanted.  The story that I have witnessed so far is not woke in a grand sense or overly political.    

Is it the greatest story ever told?  Is this the greatest game made?  No but it is good and fun.  Repel the hate.  Give it a try and think for yourself.  Not how someone wants you (demands you) to think.  7.5 out of 10.",1707292416,1707292416,True,2,0,0.472724258899688721,0,True,False,False

Close to the end of the game decided to pick up all the riddler challenges as I always do in the Arkham games finished them then proceeded to the very boring side quests. Server disconnected went back on and no auto save for 2 hours of gameplay of finishing the riddler stuff and two additonal missions. DO NOT BUY ALWAYS ONLINE!

I don't exactly think anyone asked for a game based around Suicide Squad except Warner Bros who wanted to incorporate live service tactics into the game in order to charge you three different prices for a costume set based on how much you get in that said set. 

Second reason I can not recommend this game is the Always Online services this game has. I know I played this game during early access however if you incorporate always online you better ensure the servers are top notch. I was on the first boss fight and struggled the first 2 times and died to the boss. On the third attempt I was just about to finish the boss off on a great run only for the servers to disconnect me. Despite I never recommend any Always Online games I have never once experienced why always online is a terrible idea until that moment of me playing this game. Granted that was my only disconnect issue I experienced with their servers I still will never recommend any game that employs always online to their game if its not strictly a MMO or completely online experience game. This one can be played single player.

Third reasons are what everyones coming here to read and its the disrespect to Batman. The character you fell in love with in the Arkham series is completely uncharacteristically different than those games to the point why call this a sequel to Arkham Knight? If you do not want to listen to me and go ahead and pick this game up the best favor you will have to do for yourself is separate anything from Arkham series to this game. I consider this a game where one reality Flash dropped a pen that set the events in this game in motion while theres the main Arkham reality still in tact that Flash held onto that sacred pen and kept that universe in tact. The story is not inspiring actually feels like the opening was ripped right out of the Marvel Avenger's game. Opening tutorial mission finds you on a destroyed bridge just as Avengers did as well as the events of the game transpire on Justice Day a day dedicated to the Justice League as in Avengers game the events transpire on A Day a day dedicated to the Avengers. The story feels basic and uninspired and while the Arkham games really gives you a love letter to Batman this game really gives you nothing of that. I found myself in the Daily Planet and looking for any easter egg that I could find to Superman and there was nothing. Unlike Arkham where most likely you will find some really neat references here everything is just basic. You won't get that love letter feeling to the heroes you love and instead be expected just to fight generic enemies over and over.

As for the gameplay its the only positive I have to say about the game but at the same time not good. The gameplay is generic but not terrible. To me it will get repetitive after awhile as I expect the same for others. There isn't that mix of exploring and fighting like you would get in previous games. Exploring like I mentioned has no pay offs to them as you wont find yourself finding easter eggs around the city like you would in prior games. The Hud has too much going on as well as some battles there are too much going on. There is no skill based gameplay here its just a randomness of battles that you are constantly just fighting through waves of enemies. You may have fun with it but will slowly fade. I have 27 hours on this game and only on chapter 4 out of 7 chapters I believe and most of my time I got bored I would go on my phone while the game was on to watch videos or I literally fell asleep while playing this game.",1706903354,1707291611,False,41,0,0.523108839988708496,4,True,False,False

~Gameplay is sort of fun, but repetitive. Beat one mission, go on support mission, bust up five emplacements along the way between them. It's fun for a bit, a good game to shut your brain off and just wail on some bad guys with combat that 'feels' cool, but don't expect to be playing it for days and days on end. 

~Definitely not worth $70-$100 dollars. In-game currency for the store must also be bought ($5-$50 on top of buying price. You get none of this currency when buying deluxe.) And it's all for cosmetics that could have just as easily been $2-3 DLC for those who really wanted it. 

~For a supposed continuation of the Arkham games, it's surprisingly detached from them, while also relying on them for random story bits.

~Characters all seem a bit... One-note? The voice-acting carries it, in all honesty. 

~It seems big, bold, and flashy, but also leaves you feeling like there isn't much substance there. 


-If you're here from the Arkham Games, wanting to 'complete the collection?' Save your money. 
-If you're here to admire the Justice League, save your money, this is the darkest timeline (also one that doesn't make a whole lot of sense...) 

Final thoughts; 
It's a big flashy game, that leaves you wanting, that relies on previous acclaim to draw players in only to shove everything loved and admired into the back corner. The Live Service should be worked into a DLC/Season Pass situation that would have been more satisfactory/player friendly. Wait for the sale, if you're sure you want to add it to your collection.

He's the one with the contingency plans, he's the one that this universe was initially constructed around, he's the one voiced by Kevin Conroy, who we'll never hear again outside of a couple unreleased animated DC films. 

Or better yet, this shouldn't have been a Suicide Squad game at all. Could've taken place in Metropolis still, but it would've been infinitely better as a Batman game. We haven't had a Batman game yet where he has to take down Justice League members like in Tower of Babble or Justice League: Doom. If it HAD to be co-op, toss in Nightwing, Red Hood, or a Cassandra Cain Batgirl or Stephanie Brown Batgirl. Not this. 

I gave it a chance because I'm a DC fanatic, but even I can't tolerate shit writing when I see it. This story has Sweet Baby Inc written all over it. Harley Quinn hitting on a child Poison Ivy is OK, calling her ""fun sized"" and King Shark calling her the ""vegan option"" is totally not weird or anything. Harley lecturing Batman about inflicting mental/emotional trauma when she was the one running around Gotham murdering people all the time is rich,

It's also definitely pricey. Pick it up on sale, and play with friends if you can, it makes the experience even more enjoyable. Just turn off your brain and have fun, don't take it too seriously.

Rocksteady did good. Could have done better, but I blame WB for where this game falls short.

Great points about Suicide Squad:

The graphics and game play are great. Movement felt smooth save for the sliding is a bit of pain, but overall the characters have great movement. Shooting was fun and the games missions to introduce you certain mechanics was so helpful. Sound was pretty great too along with music.

The voice acting. I loved Deadshot, King Shark and of course Harley is my favorite. Her facial expressions and dialogue did make me laugh quite a bit..it is hard not to like her crazy insanity at times. :). I did enjoy Boomerang, but he got a bit annoying at times. Deadshot felt at times the most intellectual and he was trying to see thing through a more sane if you can call it that lens. I have seen Will Smith and Idris Elba play this character and I loved absolute love Idris's portrayal. He is amazing actor and the voice actor here is great to. Yes, I know in comic is different. Hats off to the voice actors. Great job in my opinion.

The so-so parts:
The story. I can understand the Brainiac invasion, but off all the heroes left Wonder Woman is left for a mind controlling entity. I mean come on would have made more sense to have Green Lantern (Willpower) or even Batman be last hero standing. Plus that dynamic of having to take on Superman, Wonder Woman, and Flash to me would have been more epic just on physical scale. It just seem like a narrative was being put here instead of story. 

It does get repetitive, but the game play makes it pretty enjoyable for what it is.
The Bad parts:
Live Service. Period. Every gamer hates live service and it seems if why if you want to play solo, do you need to be online. This still boggles my mind.

The narrative push. While not as overbearing. The whole ""toxic masculinity"" which doesn't exist because masculinity is not toxic. Toxic behaviors like abuse, manipulation, etc can be exhibited by both sexes. There isn't a lot of hard core pushing of it in the game, but in texts and some dialogue like female Boomerang was better. Come on. Stop with the bashing and false messaging. Men and women are different, but compliment each other. We each have strengths and weaknesses. We both can be heroes or villains. You only hurt good people (gamers) who would enjoy game without a false narrative push.

Overall, I give the game a 7.5 out of 10. It is really amazing and fun. I cannot deny that and story isn't horrible, but it is not top notch either and the voice acting on the characters is great for most part, minus Boomerang at times lol. This game could have been amazing 10 out of 10..If they stuck to a good story, no narrative push, and not been live service. But as I said I enjoy swinging and hearing Harley (Tara VA) just comment on stuff. :)

Fun gameplay that's difficult but fun to master, fluid combat, honestly some of the best facial & body animations I've ever seen in modern gaming, a stellar performance from the cast, great writing, epic story that feels like a bittersweet eulogy to the Arkham games and as much as i hate highlighting this bc it rly should be the norm, it actually works on release. I've only experienced literally 1 glitch in the entire 25 hours I've played so far and it was extremely minor. 

The complaints I've seen just don't seem to hold water imo, and everything ppl seem to be hating this game for just feel like reaching the more I play. I think this game is just getting swept up in a tidal wave of misinformation, with ppl playing the first few hours, drawing their conclusions, and saying the game is trash while the public, hungry for another game to direct their internet anger towards, eats it up while providing all the clicks and views for websites and videos that profit off of going along with public opinion rather than being honest or trying to challenge it. 

The boss fights are genuinely fun, and get more epic as you would expect as you start to fight more prominent members of the Justice League. The gameplay only seems repetitive as ppl say bc this game does that thing that a lot of live service games do where a lot of the missions act as tutorials to types of missions you'll be doing as you get closer to the endgame. If you've played games like Division 2 or Destiny you'll be familiar with it. But the whole thing of main missions being identical to side missions just isnt true, i guarantee that comes from ppl who started the game expecting to hate it, played only a couple hours and came to this conclusion. The reality is that almost every non-linear game has repetitive gameplay. The difference is whether that gameplay is fun enough that you either don't notice or dont care. This is a case of the latter where the side missions are noticeably repetitive, yet the devs put in evolving challenges, new enemies and each one is short enough that you can do them in a few minutes all so you can unlock more gear and abilities and challenge yourself so you get better at the game. This is definitely the kind of game where the better you get at it, the more fun it is and the cooler it looks. 

The year is still young and I know there are gonna be some other games in the near future to challenge this soon but so far, this is genuinely my favorite game of 2024.

Considering how much hate I’m seeing for this game, I have to say I enjoyed it.
I must admit I am not happy with how they treated the Batman that we’ve all come to love and I think it’s a very bitter end for the Arkham series as a whole, but like a few other reviews I’ve seen, they’ve chose to treat it as an else-worlds type story and I guess I’m doing the same.

You can see that rocksteady put a lot of love and detail into this world, especially in the places like the hall of justice. I really enjoyed running around the place to begin with and pressing all the buttons. It gave me a lot of the same feelings as the Avengers convention at the start of that game.

Both games could have been miles better if it was a single-player/coop game only and none of this “live game service” BS.

I played this game solely in singleplayer which was fine, but I did experience quite a few times of losing connection which was quite annoying to get back on and it would kick me into a never ending loading screen which I would then have to force quit to relaunch.

I played the game from start to finish on the steam deck, which worked really well and it kept mostly to around 25-30 with some dropping here and there but I found it quite playable.

I liked the gameplay, played as deadshot, I think the gunplay was fun and enjoyed their new take on the counter system which you used to depower enemies and bosses.
Speaking of bosses, each fight was very enjoyable and unique (apart from brainiac) but I can see what they’re doing with him (and I think it’s a crap idea and lazy as hell).

There also was quite a few repetitive mainline quests, which weren’t too bad but as a ‘live service game’ I can see it getting really boring quickly.

Like a lot of others say, I would sadly wait for a discount. You won’t be missing much until the story’s finished anyway.",1707251809,1707251809,True,12,4,0.472271829843521118,0,True,False,False

Great visuals, outstanding character models, animation, and performances. And actually funny dialog. However, I'm only 2 hrs in and the mission design already feels uninteresting. It's not a bad game, it's just not what I expected from Rocksteady after 9 years of development. 

They should've further differentiated how the 4 characters play. Make them have more unique playstyles according to each character. Right now, they're all functionally the same, they just go about doing the same things with a slightly different flavor. For example, Harley and Boomerang traverse by swinging like Spider-man from a drone and teleporting to a thrown boomerang, respectively. They all shoot guns. They all have an air dash. They all have the same basic melee attack. They feel generic in comparison to Batman feeling like BATMAN in the Arkham games. 

Mission design should be more varied. While I haven't gotten very far into the campaign, I know it's more of the same from reviewers who've completed the game. More interior missions and maybe vehicles could have helped keep things fresh.

I hope Rocksteady can survive this as I don't blame them for the direction this game took.

The traversal mechanics keep the game interactive even when traveling. The combat system has been re-done in a amazing way! The story is captivating and I keep finding myself to find out what is going to happen next. Playing with friends is a blast and ads ANOTHER unique way to enjoy the game. The cons, I find the skins to be a bit overpriced. It is $25, technically, for one SET of skins for ONE character. But, the nice thing is, there are a good amount of other outfits to wear. None of the transactions alter game play in ANY way. They are exclusively for cosmetic purposes though. There are really fun ways to upgrade your character through challenges that test your ability to adapt. Like ""only using grenades"" to do damage, and having to use different traversal tactics to get them to drop more grenades for you. As an avid Batman fan, who grew up watching the Animated Series and who STRONGLY believes that Kevin Conroy IS the Batman. Getting to see him taken over be Brainiac and seeing what our beloved Arkham interpretation of Batman become, is one of the coolest things about this game. I am very excited to see the new FREE content that is coming out later this year.

The combination of smooth traversal and combat mechanics immediately caught my attention, making it a solid pick up for anyone who enjoys a seamless and engaging gameplay experience. The writing in the game is exceptionally well-crafted, adding depth to the narrative and enhancing the overall immersion.

One of the standout features for me was the first half of the game, where everything seemed meticulously paced and thoughtfully developed. The initial stages provided a perfect balance of challenge and excitement, keeping me invested in the storyline and character development. The game truly excelled in delivering on its promises of a superhero gaming experience.

However, as I progressed into the second half of the game, I couldn't help but notice a slight dip in the overall pacing. The boss fights and story elements towards the end felt a bit rushed, leaving me yearning for more depth and exploration. It seemed like there was so much potential in the concluding chapters that, unfortunately, weren't fully realized.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the occasional server issues that cropped up during my playthrough. While these interruptions weren't major, they did impact the overall experience. It's reassuring to hear about the upcoming offline mode, and I believe that once implemented, it will likely address and resolve these concerns, further enhancing the game's stability.

Despite the slight shortcomings in the latter part of the game and intermittent server issues, I don't consider these drawbacks to outweigh the positive aspects. This game stands out as one of the better games in the service model, especially within the superhero genre. While it may not be the developer's absolute best, it certainly holds its own and offers an enjoyable and memorable gaming experience.

It does take a while to get proficient at the game though since the traversal mechanics are intertwined with the combat mechanics and both are challenging since the different enemy types all require a different strategy. This isn't a simple run and gun shooter. Gameplay videos on youtube make it look way simpler than it actually is. Story is good with some genuinely funny moments. It's been a while since a game legit made me laugh out loud but there's some hilarious moments which I won't spoil here. 

It's worth mentioning that the game is pretty CPU heavy right now though. With the game set to the highest preset minus RT it still managed to bottleneck my 12700K at 1440p using a RTX 3080. I saw 84% usage of the GPU meaning my CPU wasn't able to keep pace. Just something to keep in mind.

All in all for me it's a solid 7.5 / 10 so far.

Playing with friends, spending time, what more do you want? I agree that the Arkham games were beautiful and special in their kind, but   I'm not so stupid to think that batman dies that way because there are various leaks that prove otherwise so enjoy the game and don't spread hate by using the name of a person who is no longer here.

You have active reloads, Devil May Cry juggling, a sort of Doom Eternal inspired combat resource system where various types of actions replenish different combat resources. You actually have to aim and parry shots. Traversal isn't simply pressing a button to go fast; you actually have things like momentum, mid air cancels into different movement options to extend the length, additional mechanics for air movement, sliding and diving for various effects. Your traversal itself literally gets an ultimate on top of your own ultimate, while having to blow up, shoot and melee baddies in between to keep your score up, and score provides breakpoints to enable your two dozen talents that may give you different conditional actions too. All while there are objectives and obstacles going on that demand your attention. All while you can guzzle up that procedurally generated loot and running missions seamlessly in between.

It's insane how intense and fast paced the game is and the potential for how difficult it can be. Quite frankly, I have no idea how you will be able to play this with pugs in endgame, when most pugs in other MMOs wouldn't even be able to do a fourth of these mechanics without dying. If Avengers was the dullest and simplest game in comparison to Warframe, this game is on the opposite far end of the spectrum. I can look past the capeshit story because of that, but the price is just way too much - remove the story or release parts of it every season, but the game doesn't need it and it only needlessly drives up the price tag. The constant banter can stay in, because it isn't a cringy as I thought, but it's too family safe despite harley quinn often making pornographic jokes.

First, let's get the obvious out of the way: it's an online-only service game, even though you can play solo, meaning if your internet connection or the game's servers crap out, you can't play. Yes, it's one of those live-service games publishers keep trying to peddle even though it comes with loads of problems and generally isn't the kind of thing gamers like. The worst thing is it's expected to have an offline mode but it'll be in a future update. For now, at the time of this writing, I can't connect to the WB servers so I can't play right now.

The game's isn't too bad, it's fun and a bit mindless but I enjoy it. Metropolis is filled with Easter Eggs and references to the Arkham games as well as the DC universe as a whole, with Riddler throwing out some riddles for the player to solve, pointing at some of these references. The characters are well-written and there's some fun banter between the members of Task Force X, with Captain Boomerang being the butt of the joke most of the time. As for the Justice League, they're okay, they're evil, brainwashed versions of themselves, with Batman flexing constantly on the comms while you're playing. The highlights of the game's story involve the Squad having to deal with Batman in some sort of reverse-Arkham sequences where you have to watch for traps while Batman's picking the Squad members off one by one. Sadly short and scripted but a fun take on the Batman MO nonetheless.

The gameplay is fun and fast-paced, being focused on movements and chaining combos, but it's a little messy, there's always a lot going on, with enemies everywhere, constantly shooting from about every angle. It's overwhelming at times and the only way to ""heal"" is to harvest shield from enemies, which really becomes a problem during boss fights. There are no common enemies during the JL fights, which means you can't get any shield power-up, making the fights a bit harder. Yes, the JL shouldn't be easy to defeat but not being able to recover from damage is pretty annoying. And they really went overboard with the post-processing effects, you get big blue honeycomb-shaped overlays when your shield is low and red overlays when you'ee low on health, they really get in the w ay of the action in moments where you need to see and dodge threats.

Sadly, performance issues also get in the way of the action, it's hard to get decent framerates even with a good setup. I'm playing on an RTX 3080, I have 16GB RAMs and an i7-9700KF which, by the way, if the only part of my computer that's below the recommended specs. I still get awful stutters, even during cutscenes and changing graphics options barely does any difference. I get about 40 FPS at street-level, with around 50-60 when on rooftops. I switched my resolution from 4k to 1440p and still I get lots of performance issues. The game really needs some fixes to address those issues but at the moment, there are problems and slowdowns on such a fast-paced, action-heavy game really hinder the experience.

Overall, it's an okay game. It's a looter-shooter, so collecting guns and equipments to build a strong Squad is what you do, mostly through crafting/buying upgrades from the Penguin or completing repetitve missions. The only reason I keep going at this game is the story and even then, I'm losing interest thanks to the always-online requirements and awful performances. I recommend it on sale, with low expectations. It may be a Rocksteady game but it doesn't have Arkham-levels of greatness and knowing this takes place in the same universe makes Batman's turn as a brainwashed villains even sadder.

The combat was not as beat-em-up as I was expecting, it's primarily a shooter with melee only serving to break shields/augment the shooting etc. but the more I've played the more the combat has grown on me as I get more used to the movement and unlock new skills.

My biggest complaint is actually the missions modifiers, like ""enemies can only be hurt by X damage type"".  The game is well balanced to shoot/melee/grenade/special abilities, with each of those things giving you more of the other (melee to get more shields, shoot to get more special abilties, etc.) and so the game is super fun when you can do everything seamlessly.  Some missions however will throw in ""enemies only take damage from X"" which breaks the cycle/rhythm of combat and feels really bad to play.  You run out of grenades and enemies only take damage from grenades, and you only get more grenades by shooting enemies but enemies don't take damage from shooting.  etc.  or doing a big satisfying special attack but it does nothing because in that activity only ""crits"" do damage.  Or you need to get more shields but you can't because they don't take melee damage that mission etc.  

I get they were trying to add variety in a genre that is super repetitive but this is a really not fun way of adding variety.  I'd rather they replace all those ""only X damage"" modifiers with literally anything else -increased difficulty missions, all elite enemies, even forcing you to play as X squad member.  Anything else would be better.

So far King Shark's traversal is the most fun and natural feeling to control, Captain Boomerang has great zippy traversal as well. Ironically Harley Quinn (who uses a stolen Batman grappler) feels the most janky, which is insane given how good Arkham Knight's grappling felt almost 10 years ago. It takes a bit of practice to get used to, and feels like traversal controls from the PS2 era. Depending on your individual style of preferred traversal, pick your character. You can change who you control on the fly though.

There is heavy Arkham trilogy nostalgia early on. Part of me wishes it didn't, due to knowing how they're going to screw with it later on in the story.

They mention that Deadshot isn't the same Deadshot as is in the Arkham trilogy but every time a character questions it it gets shot down. It hasn't, yet been explained. If it's really an issue for you you can select an outfit that literally covers their entire body.

I love finally having a game where Harley can wear her original jumpsuit. I played with bots, and with the characters you don't play you can customise their outfits and skills very easily to compliment your main. The outfits show up in cutscenes also.

There's been a lot of controversy over lore and narrative being incredibly sexist and bigotted. That would matter to me more if the game actually enticed me to look at the lore. It's par for the course that those incharge of DC narratives lately aren't fans of the material. It's a far cry from the original arkham trilogy or even Lego DC games!

Is it a great game, no, but this is literally first few days. They're going to tweak and balance things. That said it's probably only a 6 outta 10 so far from me (and it appears meta critic agrees).
It has the opportunity to improve and could have been an amzing return to a universe so many fans love. Unfortunately they opted for an old and dead games as a service model, and new heavy handed political rhetoric.

That said i don't regret my purchase and am actually having fun. I just hope they don't cancel the game before bringing out the Two Face additional content.

I think pretty much everyone's reaction to finding out Rocksteady's new DC superhero game was gonna be a looter-shooter was, ""why?"". That question still remains. However, the style of running and gunning is pretty similar to Crackdown and the overall diversity of mission and game variety is very similar to mid-budget, sandboxy games. Snappy and fun traversal, overpowered weapons, and incredibly samey enemies. It really baffles the mind that this isn't a game where the diverse cast of villain's combat abilities are used as the player switches between them in a action-adventure game. I mean seriously you give me the hulking monster that is King Shark and you aren't smashing and wrecking enemies? No, you are just kind of doing Sunset Overdrive, but as DC characters  I love those kinda games, but this leads to some issues. 
Since this is a looter-shooter on top of all this, the game compartmentalize stats needlessly and gives you new weapons constantly that you don't need and don't play differently. Probably the worst issue with this and most glaring for the start, we are playing as super villains from DC comics and we're reduced to generic gunmen. This was a complete mistake from the conceptual stage. Would an, even well-made, RTS sequel to Streets of Rage satisfy or make sense to longtime fans? It clearly reeks of desperation to cash in on games as a service, something detrimental to this kind of action-sandbox gameplay and a comic book story.
That comic book story is very compelling and well written however. This is easily one of the best iterations of the suicide squad in any media and the writing perfectly balanced the irreverence and the genuineness of the team. There's been A LOT of hate for the story of this game and it's probably from a lot people who don't read comics. We play as villains who don't see DC heroes the way we do and them holding our type of admiration for them would feel forced and unrealistic. Within the context of the games events, the game uses the roster of DC characters well to make you feel like the last resort of an already drained resistance. It must also be mentioned that this is probably the best facial animation I've ever seen in a game, it seriously is outstanding. Although sparse, this game also has the best depiction of Wonder Women outside of the comics and makes me wish we got more story wise. Which leads back to the same problem, the live service. If not for this crap, we could've gotten a sizeable, even more compelling game. The game's story is about 10 hours and I just don't think $70 for a short game with a mid-budget games style of gameplay loop is fair. 
Conclusion: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is weird. It's the wrong genre of game for this IP, but it's fun regardless. Its not a story we thought we wanted, but its actually great. The only thing holding it back is what its trying to sell to you, the live service. If you really like DC comics and think fast-paced, parkour shooters are fun, you will like this game.

I really do like being able to customize my gear to the nines though. Want crit chance and damage? Shield Regen on Crit/hit (which is dope btw).  Got the mats (easy to just accumulate through play), it's yours! 

I still chuckle at some of the things that Boomerang says mid-game. 
I'm not sure if this is in the game, but my only gripe would be all of the stuff that's been piling up. If I could gear filter for rarity and auto scrap the rest, that would be ideal. 
Other then that, I love games like The Division and Destiny, so this is right up my alley. I like the survival mode. I like the clear paths to gear. I like being able to challenge myself solo.

As much as it was a bit easy to kill the Justice League (mind you, I was playing on medium which is probably just my fault), this could still be expanded upon as a live service game. A lot of the humor hit pretty well and got a good chuckle to full-blown laughs, which is always a plus to me. Once in a blue moon, the dialogue can somewhat get a bit odd with a random pause in between conversations, though I believe this isn't intentional. The setup for the whole live service thing was done interestingly and got me thinking about what's next and wanting more. I will say in terms of movement, I think Harley and Deadshot were kinda underwhelming, sadly, especially when both King Shark and Captain Boomerang are a way better option in terms of movement abilities. Harley's improvement could be a shorter recharge time with the drone grapple; it's great, just the recharge time sucks quite a lot and doesn't allow for its full potential of a fluid grapple hook chain. As for Deadshot, it's practically the same reason, and of course, I have their movement recharge maxed, yet it's just a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's due to having a lot of directional movement freedom, which is why they capped it so hard, but if it can just be a bit longer enough to just close the gap, I'm sure it'd be used more.

Positives:
- Excellent characters and writing
- Fast and fluid combat that is super enjoyable to experiment with
- Dense and detailed open world set in a devastated Metropolis combined with excellent traversal

Negatives:
- Microtransactions present in a $69.99 game on launch
- Server issues and frequent frame stutters
- Repetitive mission design and general lack of creativity for main story levels and encounters outside of boss battles which isn't too bad considering the extremely fluid and fun combat

The combat is bland and all the characters feel the same aside from the movement, and when thats the core loop of your game, thats not great.

The story is serviceable, I dont think its as bad as people say it is, but its very short, I have already beat the story as of the time of this review. The most redeeming quality is the cutscenes, they absolutely killed it, incredible facial animation and perfect performances from the main cast!

The end game and monetization is what really killed it for me, as far as I know I have all the possible free cosmetics, and they're not great. The missions you do after the story is over are the same ones you did in the story, and the loot grind fails to capture my attention.

I think this game is a great addition to the story line, paying plenty of homage to the B-man without over saturating the game to the degree of a love letter to Kevin. It's a looter shooter at it's heart as well and I enjoy looter shooters. 

Positives:
I love the games humor and writing. The voice actors had fun and it shows. Different side-quests requiring different forms of damage to encourage using your entire arsenal and swapping characters, the psyched up mechanic does that as well. However I was still able to beat the main game on Sweatin' Bullets with only Shark and Quinn, no issues.
The Boss fights themselves are very looter shooter, Borderlands mixed with Sunset Overdrive. But the cut scenes and dialogue with the Justice League feel imposing. Everyone of them feels like an actual threat. And without spoilers I would like to say, usually heroes v villains is pretty close and the heroes win. So all the villains needed was a little extra gear kinda makes sense.

You kind of have to know what you're getting into before you decide to play it, it's first and foremost a looter and It's understandable that this kind of genre is not for everyone this game is not a single player heavily story driven experience that you'd expect especially from the creators of the Arkham Trilogy (which I loved btw, RIP KC), so like any good looter, no matter what, the tasks can be monotonous and missions are not really too creative. I've played both Division games, Destiny 2, all the Borderlands, the Avengers game, Warframe, Remnant and so on, so I have a good amount of experience in looters to confidently say that this game does what it wants to be really well.

The main story is kind of meh I can agree with the general public that it's nothing too crazy or special and yes I also think that *SPOILER AHEAD* the way that Batman was sent out, *END SPOILER* I'm not a particular fan of, there are a lot of hints that it won't be the last we see from them, but the cutscenes, voice acting, animations, gameplay, movement, endgame systems are all really solid and make it worth coming back to grind that piece of you've been wanting. It takes a lot of good things from other looter shooters and combines it all into a surprisingly in depth character building system. For example the re-calibration thing from Division 2 is pretty much just how you modify stats on your gear pieces in this game, but Rocksteady also expands upon this idea and helps make this game casual player friendly by being able to ""Elite"" your gear piece which means you can modify all the stats on the gear to your liking making it fairly easy to get a fun build going but also for the players that want more of that grind, the power fantasy still exists, you spend more skill points on your character after the lvl 30 cap and your always looking for that god roll item because even though it's easier to get a build going you're always going to be looking to perfect those stats and synergies. Also their post launch content is stacked for the first year, they seem ready to support this game in the long run and a solid roadmap is what every good looter shooter needs.

My only real complaints about the game are the performance issues, the busy UI, and some QOL stuff, I have a 3080 with a 5900x @ 1440p on Medium settings I average around 40-70 fps and get micro to huge stutters fairly often. It's by no means a crazy looking game, like the characters and the environment are not bad per se they actually are really well made but there's better looking games out there that run better and this is no exception, the performance is horrendous in this game. There are also a few crashing issues and bugs which are usually sadly expected with every new release in 2024. As for the UI, yes it is all very chaotic and there's alot of things happening on the screen. The more you play though the more you get used to what you're looking at so it's fine when you get to that point but I still can't deny the fact that there's way too much information happening on the screen. I also hope they expand on the boss fights in the future and incorporate more raid like mechanics in instead of it just being counter the boss then shoot the boss.

Other than that this game does what it sets out to be, a live service looter shooter that has an addicting endgame loop and lots of really creative ways to build your character. It's not what people expected but just cause it's not what you expected it's not fair to shine this game in a negative spotlight or compare it to the Arkham Trilogy (even if it's set in the Arkham verse) cause that's not what this game intends to be. If you're into looter shooters this game is definitely worth checking out, but if it's not really your thing just don't get the game at all or if it's something you still wanna experience I would probably still wait until they release a few seasons for more content or until a sale.",1706999005,1707186219,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game crashed once right from the beginning, and when the video clip ends and it switches to the game, then the FPS drops, but I have to move away from that spot then the FPS returns to normal. Although I'm typically not a fan of superhero games, this title serves well as a casual pastime that doesn't require much thought, similar to the entertainment value found in shows like ""South Park."" It's the type of game you might play to unwind and clear your mind. You just run around in the city and kill aliens, and the shooting between different characters offers enough variety. There's a sniper who can shoot from a distance or beat up aliens in different ways, adding to the excitement. And a bit of a funny story even makes you laugh. This game is such that you don't take it seriously.

However, it does not compare to the likes of ""Batman™: Arkham Knight"" in terms of sound quality, graphics, or storytelling.

The game supports Super Ultrawide 49"" monitors, but the audio quality is lacking, missing atmospheric effects such as the sound of rain.

A major drawback is the game's online-only format, requiring significant investment with the risk of losing access if the game servers are shut down, making offline play impossible. Additionally, the city environment feels empty and lacks engagement, as it would benefit from more dynamic interactions like civilians battling the aliens. The lack of diverse activities and discoveries within the city makes the environment monotonous and uninteresting. The missions tend to be repetitive, and the overall game comes at a high cost.

Traversal and vertical gameplay is fun. Some of the best currently. 
Feels a bit repetitive sometimes but the gunplay and unique abilities along with the traversal click together to make fights interesting. 

The voice acting is top notch. Every character has their quips and one liners that go over really well. They also kept the par for the course on Amanda Waller and how manipulative and hateful she can be. 

Being able to modify your equipment and score some good perks that flow well in combat also surprised me. Seeing how things can come together when matched up with your “build” add a certain flavor to combat. 

The two boss battles I’ve done so far are memorable. They didn’t disappoint. It really felt like in some ways you were outmatched but counteracting them was a blast. 

My only real negatives are how empty the city feels at the beginning of the game. As you progress the map becomes more lively but for someone skeptical it could seem like the game is bare with no real point to it other than the mission itself. 

Secondly, just feeling like you’re in the same kind of fight until modifiers come into play and there are some annoying ones but it does change the game up some. 

Is it worth full price? At the moment no, I think 50$ would have been a great price point but considering you have some really talented voices shaping the cast and a beautiful city to traverse through - I’d say I understand that budget wise this wasn’t a small undertaking.

The tldr is: 
It's not a game for everyone.
weapons have cool legendary effects. Characters feel unique
The same mission types are used way too much.
The characters talk a lot and while i find them funny for some it might be too much.


Ok in the game are 4 characters with unique movement options the jetpack for dead shoot,the drone for harley,the speed force glove for boomerang and king shark is just built diffrend and has charged jumps.

So the positives: I love the movement.
Esspecially harley with her drone can swing across the roofs and be super fun with her mps or pistols.
I think the only one who feels a little less interesting is deadshoot due to it just being a jetpack.

When you touch the ground with any character you can instantly do a slide that gives your next move extra momentum and refills your movement meter (harleys drone use resets ,deadshoots jetpack cools down etc)
So you have a really nice movement buff for playing well.

The melee feels HEAVY like when you hit a soldier they will become airborne and you can juggle them.

The legendary weapon effects feel quite unique.
I found a gun for harley that causes a certain enemy type to become frozen in the air with everyone around it with the draw back that this gun deals no damage to this kind of enemy
So i see this enemy use this gun to get an advantage switch to my second one and just go ham on em.

A gun that has good skills can be upgraded to a higher level aswell

Visually the game looks quite nice.
And i love the animations for the single target finishers.
Overall really pretty Designs

The Bad
The missions are often quite simple and just repeat.
Like in one mission i have to safe people and put them into a bus then  i need to break cristals then a bus again then protect x 2 times It's not a strength of the game.

The voice quips can be funny at times but sometimes they are just annoying.
They also start talking into some audio logs sometimes which is annoying.

There is a cash shop for diffrent costumes
And i don't feel like 10€ for 1 skin with recolours is worth it.

There are riddler riddles and trophies along side speed challenges in the city
 you get recolours for your skins from the challenges and lore from the trophies aswell as a riddle place in the world. That isn't that bad but what is bad is that the riddler always says one of the riddles if you are in the area which is really annoying.

There are cars only for missions that explode when their time us up.
I really don't like it but some might find it fun.

The Story is... not great. It's not atrocious, but it's definitely not very good. The characters themselves are great; they're written well and the voice acting is stellar. But the situations and circumstances that the story puts them in do them [i]no[/i] justice. The brainwashed members of the League are treated incredibly poorly, arguably the worst being Batman as he's supposed to be the same Batman from the Arkham series. But Wonder Woman and pre-Brainwashing Flash are perfectly in character and shown the respect they deserve. The ending is a bit dissatisfying, but given it was written with the upcoming seasons in mind, I am willing to bet this was more of an 'end of act' ending than an 'end of game' ending (which is an issue with Live Service games). The comedy is hit-and-miss. Some of the jokes landed with me, some didn't. Maybe that's just because I have a mid-brow sense of humour, but that's really a personal thing.

As an aside, [b]DO NOT[/b] use Kevin Conroy's tragic passing as a means to insult the game or the developers. They had likely already written and recorded most of the game's dialogue by the time he passed. Aside from scrapping all their work and/or starting over again with a new voice actor, there was nothing they could do to 'respect' Kevin's last-ish performance as Batman.

Now the gameplay is where things get a little more complicated. This is a genre and gameplay loop that I, personally, enjoy. At the very least, I don't mind it. Shooting controls are hard to screw up, especially on a Mouse and Keyboard (which I recommend despite what the game tells you on first launch), and this game doesn't screw it up. As long as you bump up the mouse sensitivity to ~70, aiming is quick and responsive, and the feedback for hitting Criticals and Cripples is cruchy and satisfying. I'm not a huge fan of putting the melee button on non-ADS primary fire, but I got used to it after while. Racking up high combos and zoom-ing around the map to find more enemies to keep that combo going is addicting as hell, and I often find myself getting distracted when going towards my next objective going on a minutes-at-a-time rampage throughout the city.

The traversal is as amazing as Rocksteady's finest, and I enjoy running and flying around as everyone but Harley (sorry Harls, but you're just an objectively inferior Spider-Man). Deadshot's jetpack is addicting once you get into the flow of it, Boomer's blinking is so useful for getting into enemies' faces with his Shotguns or getting out for Sniping, and the simplicity of King Shark's run and jump makes him ideal for ground combat and a few of Riddler's AR Challenges.

A criticism I see a lot is about repetition. And while I can see that, my question for that is 'what did you expect?' This is a looter-shooter in the same vein as Borderlands, even down to the gun manufacturer modifiers. Quests in looter-shooters aren't about being in-depth and unique, they're about causing as much death and destruction as possible as fast as possible by being as chaotic as possible. The quests are pretty copy-and-paste, yes. But so were 90% of Borderlands 2's quests, you only remember it differently because the quests that weren't simple were [i]really[/i] good (which, admittedly, this game doesn't have as far as I've seen). Most missions boil down to ""go here, kill the enemies and collect stuff, deposit stuff, repeat."" it's not interesting, but it's carried by the gunplay and traversal.

All that said, is the game good? For me, yes. Definitely, worth every penny. But that's just because I like this kind of stuff. If you're playing for a continuation of the Arkham storyline, don't waste your money. If you're playing it expecting for long and in-depth missions, don't waste your money. If you're on the fence, do the smart thing and wait for a discount.

If you like looter shooters, good humor, solid gameplay then this game is for you.  I played duo through the entire campaign, leveled all characters to max level and am currently working on endgame.  In my duo we are at Mastery rank 40+ with much more to go in terms of content, itemization and making builds.  If you like character progression, item and build variety with solid gameplay you will not be disappointed.  I will admit I know very little about the franchise and lore of suicide squad & justice league, went into it purely as a gamer looking for progression and endgame grind, and this game delivered.  It is a lot of fun and with lots of replay-ability and builds to be discovered to fit your play style.  Each character and play style can differ significantly, I suggest you try them all and see which one you like the best.

They did do a great job with the endgame and progression systems in the game, crafting, re-rolling items, re-rolling stats, etc etc.  As a ARPG fan you truly want to add this one to your library. 

Saved the cons for last for those curious - 
 1 - Server stability *after* release has had a few hiccups, not sure if its amount of players or other issues, example random disconnect or long loading to connect to server.  While this is rare it exists, I assume the devs are aware and will improve on patches.  (this was experienced in multiplayer only again I havent played solo much if at all)
2  - Saved loadouts, currently bugged not saving all characters correctly.
3 - Inviting player to your squad can be tricky, either do it through steam or Clan menu...the friend option in-game doesnt work always says player not found in the Argus database....whatever that means.
4 - Some maps, loading into them cause lag or complete freeze and have to restart - Again rare and I hope with patches this will be fixed.

All in all solid game cant wait for more characters and content, will definitely keep this one in my favorites list in Steam.",1707166985,1707166985,True,3,1,0.475264161825180054,0,True,False,False

Call me crazy, but I judge a video game on gameplay first, and the gameplay here is truly solid. It's a 3rd person shooter with a heavy emphasis on mobility, and it absolutely nails that concept. I've put nearly all my time in on Harley, and she lets me bounce and swing my way across the battlefield all while dropping grenades, bopping goons with a hammer, and popping brutes with a six-shooter. Getting better at this ballet of insanity has been just so much fun. 

I think the vast majority who complain about the story (especially pre-launch) are actually complaining about the tone. This is the tale of a clown, a shark-man, and a boomerang enthusiast saving the world from a big purple alien invasion. This was never going to be another brooding, angsty Batman story. That's why this isn't Batman: Arkham Suicide Squad. I love the Arkham trilogy. That trilogy tells a very complete story start to finish, and I'm glad Rocksteady get to spread their bat-wings a little. This game's story is like a cover version of your favorite song. Don't like the new cover? You can still listen to the original. It still exists. This is a new thing.

The story is full of fun character interactions punctuated by the occasional punch in the feels. It most definitely just tapers off into setup for infinite content, instead of coming to a super satisfying conclusion. This is absolutely true, but I had a blast with the journey to that point. That's why I quit playing Super Mario. He always just rescues the princess, and then Bowser just kidnaps her again? What sort of simpleton takes enjoyment from such a narrative? 

And again, I feel like some sort of relic who plays games for the gameplay first, and watches TV/movies for the plot. So the promise of Rocksteady continuing to make content for a game that I enjoy playing isn't the worst thing in the world. So far, the monetization doesn't seem remotely predatory. I'm not sure where the accusations of grind come from. Play the game, get stuff. Use that stuff to play harder levels. Don't want the stuff, don't have to play the game to that degree. The only person who's going to tell you you HAVE to spend time in this game is you. The only one telling you you NEED the absolute highest tier gear is you. Play as much as you want, and then put it down. 

I will say, the PC version is still not the most stable, and on opening weekend, online is kind of hit-or miss. But I suspect this will all be addressed, and the game is still very playable either way. If you wanna give the game a patch or two to get these issues sorted, that's a respectable position to take. Name a couple big online games that were perfect on launch weekend. Go ahead, I'll wait.

The game is gorgeous, the characters are fun, and above all, shooting aliens is just a joy. Is the game perfect? Nope! But I would say not the let great be the enemy of good.

Traditionally Looter shooters' stories are extremely weak, especially when they launch. Destiny 1 and 2, Anthem, Division 1 and 2, Avengers, all have very middling launches, and survive based on their audience's ability to tolerate their bullshit. I can look past the story. I'll say I'm definitely not happy about how the entire Justice league is unceremoniously killed, and barely acknowledged for most of the game, but I tried to turn that part of my brain off and just focus on getting to the meat of any looter shooter, the endgame. 

The endgame loop in this game, along with the spam of IPad-kid looking combat with flashy numbers that barely mean anything, is abysmal. Without spoiling too much, they want you to run this endgame 13 TIMES over what seems to be the course of a year if not LONGER, and without any signficant changes other than the elseworlds you'll visit while you do them, this game will die within that year, easily. If you check the steam charts page for this game, it peaked on February 3rd, 2024 at the time of writing with 13,459 players. Right now as I'm typing this, we have 6,877 players on February 5th, 2024. 

It really doesn't matter what my opinions are on the game, I can sit here and type that I like the traversal, or that metropolis looks cool, or that while the Justice league is disrespected by a seemingly absent writers room for its 9 hour runtime of a shitshow story, their designs are great, etc. The proof is in the playercount that this game was an abject failure, and has now wasted Rocksteady's past 8 or so years of development. I never WANT a game to fail, I love videogames, I love this studio, but they're going to have to take a good hard look as that playercount sinks even further as to why they should keep this game running at all. 

Your mileage can vary. Some people really like the combat, some people can look past the shit parts of the game and just enjoy having a DC focused game to play in, that actually has some cool loot when you get to the notorious/infamous stuff. Personally I will be playing the loop at least for the next month or so as Joker gets released, and I'll be closely following to see if WB really wants to sink more money into what looks like an already capsized and sunk ship. I cannot however recommend the game. Rocksteady and WB have some serious work to do that will take time, money, and effort, and if the base game is anything to go by, I don't think they have a snowball's chance of turning this around, and I don't know why they would given the playercount and retention is so abysmal only 3 days  after its actual launch (Not counting early access) 

I won't recommend this. If it's on sale and you want to hop in before the servers are inevitably shut down, go for it. I hope I can be proven wrong in the long run. But to me, this looks like another Avengers or Anthem, and without some serious help in the next 3-6 months, I can already see the tweet rocksteady will send out stating that they're pulling this from sales or delisting it entirely.",1707159062,1707159062,False,118,0,0.744515120983123779,0,True,False,False

This game has many good things going for it, but it also has an equal amount of bad things as well.

Before reading my review, note that I played this game entirely in single player, and the game is probably more enjoyable from a game play perspective if you are playing with friends, as usually games are. There is also a matchmaking option to find random people to play with, but honestly the bot teammates are good and you don't really need random people to play with for the game to be enjoyable. 

The good:
Solid game play. The game is fun and all of the combat mechanics work really well. Movement through the city feels smooth and Metropolis feels really cool to play in. The game is fun to play and I enjoyed my time playing it. This game feels like a better version of Gotham Knights, where many of the things that felt bad about that game are corrected and made to feel good from a team play perspective.

The bad:
This game is not rewarding at all. This game is all about killing the Justice League, literally in the title, but killing them does not feel satisfying. None of the Justice League characters you kill feel rewarding. You kill them and they don't even get cool cut scene deaths, they just die from the fight and afterward there's some cut scene that immediately pushes the story along not even letting you reflect on the fact that you killed a member of the JL. Even after defeating the final boss, Brainiac, you learn that that's not all, and there are 12 other Brainiacs you will have to kill at some point in the future when the developers add them in via the live service part of the game. After the whole story, your actions do not bring Metropolis any closer to being free of Brainiac's invasion and it feels like you really did not do anything through the events of the story other than killing a few of Brainiac's hit men.
Even completing all Riddler challenges feels underwhelming. You get periodic unlocks for completing some of the challenges. By completing the AR traversal challenges you can unlock some skins for the characters, and collecting the trophies unlocks codex data like concept art, but there is no reward for completing all Riddler challenges. A complete letdown. It feels not even worth it finding the trophies and scanning the riddles.
The gameplay was very repetitive, which is forgivable for the main story, but once you beat the story and you're in Finite Crisis, there's a limited pool of events you are expected to do on repeat for mediocre item rewards.
The loot drops you get are kinda not great. I got a few legendary drops early in the story and pretty much used them until the end of the game. There's no reason to use any loot that isn't legendary quality as they drop early and have better stats, so most drops you get are worthless. The item overhaul systems are also very lackluster and don't really do anything. The items you use change game play so little that you can pretty much ignore items as a whole and the game will still be pretty easy.
[spoiler]There's also nothing else to the story than what you can tell just from the premise of the game. You kill the Justice League then kill Brainiac.[/spoiler] There are no twists in the story, nothing new you ever find out, very dissimilar from the Arkham games where each of them you are learning and adapting throughout the game. In this game, [spoiler]you kill the JL, then kill Brainiac[/spoiler] and that's it for the story, then you are pushed into the live service part where you play the same missions on repeat for mediocre loot that hardly changes game play at all.


You may see that I wrote a lot more about the bad things than I did good, and I gave it a 5/10. It is a lot easier to write about the things I did not like about the game over the good because the bad things stick easier in my head. All in all the game was fun and I enjoyed playing it a lot. Was it worth $70? Maybe not, but if you, like me, are a big DC fan and have played the Arkham games, you can enjoy this game.

TL:DR: Fun game, very enjoyable. Bad story, bad live service aspect with repetitive content.

1.) The game has phenomenal character development with unforgettable quips and story moments. 
2.) Moving about metropolis feels fluid. You experience acrobatic adrenaline exactly how they do in comics.
3.) Gear drops have some interesting loot with the rarest of items themed to named characters. 
(Like Bizzarro's Undeath Ray!! ""No harm will come to your friends."") 
4.) Rocksteady included references that make you smile, some that make you cry and others agitated. 
(In the end, the goal of a cinematic story is to invoke an emotional response. In that they succeeded.)
5.) Boss Fights feel as they should. Flash zips around. Green Lantern has military themed constructs. 
6.) Than you Kevin Conroy for all the hard work and determination you put into the character over the years.
(His performance was stellar. And there is a certain poetry if you take into account the Arkham games. 
It's only fitting that story comes full circle. Just as it would have in Zach Snyder's JL with Afflec and Leto.) 
6.) End game opens and endless string of missions for you to play and earn those unique gear drops.
7.) Full year of free content starting next month. 

*Cons:*
1.) Gamer elitist think they are 12th level intellects because they were raised on cancel culture.
2.) Enemy types changes as the game progresses, but they are fundamentally the same ""Alien"" designs.
(While I understand the invasion was in progress it would have been nice to fight against street gangs too.)

*Overall:*
As an artist and longtime fan of the characters, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. All of the hate that people are generating for this title is uncalled for. Rather than moving on with their lives, they choose to bash the buttons labeled: ""Hating this product gives me internet points"". Truth is there is nothing wrong with the game. People are just jumping on the bandwagon because it isn't in the Arkham play style, and that's what everyone is comparing it to.  If you actually open your mind you would understand that this isn't a story about Batman, therefore he won't be the focus... *Surprised gasp*

The end game is also being chewed apart for just being replayable missions, but if you think about it how is it any different than other successful multiplayer shooter games: Apex Legends, Fortnite or Rainbow Six?  It's not. In those game you group up with friends and you tackle the same missions over and over. Same thing, yet this one includes an actual story and it gets hypocritical hate... 

The problem isn't the game. The problem is the audience being over saturated with ""#NotMyArkham"".
Once they move on to regurgitating hate somewhere else, this game will be more approachable. Cyberpunk 2077 felt the same childish disdain, but hardcore fans of the series stuck with it and got anime + DLC.",1707154014,1707154014,True,7,2,0.435611456632614136,0,True,False,False

For those of you who are turned off by the League dying, here's a massive spoiler, so if you don't want to spoil yourself, quit reading

SPOILER

The Justice League you kill cannot die. Or to be more accurate, can't stay dead, as Brainiac has modified them. There are plans for the League to be resurrected, freed from their brainwashing and finally beat Brainiac.

END SPOILER

There's plenty to gripe about the game, especially if looter shooters aren't your thing (and especially if you hate live service games). However, using Conroy's death to harass the devs and dunk on the game is pathetic. The lack of true enemy variety after you encounter them all can get repetitive, the Brainiac League dying from bullets is dumb and the ending can sour you a bit because the main storyline isn't truly finished yet until they finish the 12 seasons.

The game-play loop is something we have become familiar with in game design over the last 10 years, go here complete a mission/contract/job, get gear, do it again. its the same thing found in games like the division, borderlands, and anthem. i will add that using your ""powers"" does add some fun combo abilities which does make each character have their own play-style(s), this carries over into how you traverse the map as well. 

As a person who really doesn't care about Marvel or DC i still think the story is neat. I have really enjoyed the story featuring many classic hero behaving in ways you normal wouldn't see them  has made it quiet enjoyable. The developers also clearly have a plan that aligns with modern gaming which includes seasonal updates adding more playable characters, gear, and likely story and features.

The negative reaction the game has received, can really only be attributed to 3 main things;
 First would be the gaming communities dislike for live service games, I understand people may want to play the games while not near the internet, but i feel this argument is becoming far more irrelevant, with 5g integration most people have a stable internet connection around them and most of us have one in our pocket. it leads me suspect the people who dislike this feature are the people who would have pirated the game, and  cant be regarded as a serious comment.

The second being the price point, this is something i can get behind. The game could have been marketed as a cheaper jumping off point, with the promise the game will continue to add content under a pay wall. it can be a very steep jumping off point.

and lastly, people have complained about its un-similarities to other arkham games, which to me is just silly as its a completely different title and therefore is a different game. 

with all that being said i'm sure ill get a bunch of points from clown awards so thanks.

 Most of the hate for this game is about how the death of the characters is handled, but they forget that this is a team of villains, of course, it is going to be a disrespectful death, they have no honor (and I have a suspicion that this ""Justice League"" is not our own, I think the game hints at something bigger going on) 

Also, for those mad that this is Kevin Conroy's final role as Batman and how it was disrespectful of the Devs to have this be the send-off for him, I rebut with 2 facts: Nobody, including the Devs, knew he was going to pass away when he did, and Kevin Conroy had to have known how the character was going to be handled and must have been ok with it while working on the game.

I felt compelled to write a review and leave positive feedback because there's a lot of noise out there about this game and some previews months ago did quite a bit of damage ahead of release of this game. For some people, it was dead on arrival because people in media told them what to think about it. Any de facto quality within the game would not and could not change their mind.

I'm not going to touch on everything the game has to offer, but I'll offer my thoughts; I'm about 11 hours in and I am having a lot of fun. The story is great (have not completed yet), the cast of characters are lively and well played. I find myself laughing too - good bits of humor sprinkled throughout. 
The moment to moment gameplay is *fun* - I'm maining Boomerang and his traversal is so satisfying and it feels so damn cool. 
The combat is not what I was expecting; it's unique. I've not completely wrapped my head around it yet (character power is tied to combo counter and ramps as it goes up) but the options seem plentiful. I've gathered that the chief complaint about this game is it is ""repetitive."" I haven't seen it. If you choose to dig into the mechanics of the combat and the combo power ramping then there's a lot to chew on here. I don't love trashing a game for being ""repetitive"" - seems lazy. If you try hard enough, you can make the case that *any* game is repetitive. Every game has a gameplay loop and SS's happens to be a ton of fun.
If I had a complaint, so far, it would be that this game can get pretty ""busy"" in chaotic moments; I think we saw this pre-release with the unsettling UI. There's A LOT going on in the UI. I often find myself scrambling during an objective trying to figure out what I need to be looking at, trying to find the information I need in order to know what to do next. I expect as I continue to play, things will ""slow down"" as far as that goes, but as of now it can be pretty overwhelming. 
This is a live-service, multiplayer game from the makers of the Arkham games. I theorize this game has failed with people because many can't get past this fact.

What's wrong with these people? Who rewards the review of this cheater, liar, provocateur, etc., who believes everything written on the Internet without a doubt?

This game is similar, almost 30 hours in and I am still in Chapter 3, taking it slow and enjoying the environment and various characters and not rushing for endgame content.

Now on to the negative, yes a lot of people do feel outraged because of the BattlePass but it is just cosmetic, you don't need to buy it to enjoy the content as all future DLCs are free. Plus there are pretty decent stuff from Riddler challenges and all that you can acquire.

I am going to be 100% honest about this game, I do not take ether side of the isle in terms of the hate or the love, I was trying very hard to wait to give it a fair shot I have played for about 6 hours now and while I cannot say ive seen the main meat and potatoes of the game I think I can give my general assessment. The story is hot garbage, who ever wrote this should really stop thinking they are creative and good at story telling, the blatent disrespect for the Arkhamverse in this game is staggering and downright shameful, Kevin did not deserve this as his final outing and Rocksteady should be ashamed of the story they have cursed the world with.

Pros:
- Gunplay. It reminds me of one of those old school games back on the 360. It's really fun just jumping around throwing grenades and shooting stuff.

- Cutscenes. The game has A LOT.  You basically get a Suicide Squad movie out of this game.

- Voice Acting. A lot of the characters have amazing voice acting. However, Deadshot is kinda of a miss. Tara Strong as Harley Quinn is pretty dated too. She sounds good at times but most of the game she sounds like someone who smokes 10 packs a day.

Cons:
- The story. A lot of it makes zero sense. Without going into deep spoilers, it's obvious that the writers don't understand how the DC universe actually functions. You'll see what I mean after the Green Lantern fight.

- The progression. Mainly the leveling. It's slow. Especially after you max out a character and realize there's more levels to unlock for a skill tree to do more damage. And when I say ""slow"" I mean REALLY SLOW. It's actually baffling how insane their progression system is.

- The boss fights. Very underwhelming. Especially when you get to the last boss and then post end game stuff. Recycled content. Very lazy on the devs part.

- ""Looter Shooter"". Doesn't exist. Don't let anyone fool you. I used the same load out through out my entire story campaign. Then you unlock the highest tier gear post game and you just end up using that. Everything else that drops for you is recycled into materials.

- Performance. Pretty mediocre.

- Online play. I joined a multiplayer session and it was so confusing that everyone left within the first minute.

- Bugged achievements. Collected all the Riddler trophies and the game didn't register two of them for me.

- Very Repetitive. The game consists of you doing the same exact 3-4 missions. 

Overall, if you ignore all the bad and just want a brainless shooter, then sure, the game is good. But considering how long this game was in development and the delay they took for release, it's really f***ing awful.

- Excellent VA and Animation. This is done incredibly well. You can ""read"" the Character expressions during cut scenes, and the VA's knock it out of the park tenfold.

- Excellent loot system.  Lot's of choices, lots of decisions, transformative mods/augments.

- I genuinely loved the story for what the premise was. People get a bit butthurt for XYZ, but it does deliver a consistent experience on it's main premise - Killing the Justice League.

- Traversal is a highlight. FInding which character works best for you is a key aspect of enjoying the game (i.e : I planned on maining Harley, fell in love with Deadshot movement+gun types ) - Each character feels unique in it's movement and approach to positioning.

- People shiat on the graphics ( comparing to Arkham ) - but I find the game to be beautiful and outstanding scope - along with character models etc.

- Combat.....here there will be a few negatives later on, but in the meantime, here are the positives : It's fast paced, chaotic and honestly fun (most of the times ).


Con's :

- Sound design is honestly atrociously bad. Gun sound is flat, Some skills sound flat . Some animations have no sound when they should. Enemy attacks have no sound cue's . Music is extremely generic and anti-climatic for the most part ( especially boss fights. Good lords might as well as not have any music on those ).

- Gun Uniqueness is entirely missing. For a game focused on GUNS GUNS GUNS, all Guns feel boring to SHOOT ( not the stats or the mods, those are great ) . If you're looking for a Division/Division 2 style of weaponary, please don't. There's nothing like that here 

- Enemy Variety is non existent . You're fighting ...3...or 4 enemy types on repeat. Even when they gain super powers from previous bosses, they are just the same looking type with extra ""flashniess"" (heh. )

- This a big one for me .....but...There's absolutely no reason for COOP (which automatically invalidates a live service. ). In fact, it can be worse to run COOP missions than doing solo, in terms of end game efficiency.  Not having Dungeons/strikes at launch is a big huge humongous red flag and swing-and-a-miss.

- No persistent over world nor a Player Hub ( a la Destiny 2 Tower ).

- Too many activities focus on open world positioning, and you rarely rarely fight indoors or enclosed quarters. 

- Apart from Traversal, characters feel the same without unique styles. (i.e : Why can't king shark eat enemies to recover HP; Why can't Cap.Boomerang fight with Boomerang attacks ; Why Can't any of the characters actually focus on Melee builds ...etc.. )

- Combat can feel extremely frustrating depending on enemy positioning. When it works and you're moving non stop taking them down, it's an adrenaline rush. When the enemy spawn position sucks, you will want to quit and uninstall the game. There's rarely a middle term.

- Not launching Season 1 until a month after and Premium Early access were the two dumbest decisions this game/marketing/publisher (wtv) ever made. The game needed to hit the ground running with all the bells and whistles. All it did with the premium early access was to create a negativity echo chamber that fueled hatred and stopped people from trying it out themselves. Then they thought their launch endgame was enough for a whole month, which show how unprepared rocksteady is to handle a live service.

They went the Destiny 2 route with the line of thinking about ""not wanting to overdelivery"" - when they really really should've.



Saving Grace points : 

Most of my negatives can be solved with some ""ease"". So I am hoping the game can improve on those.

- Enemy balancing needs urgent fix/attention. Anything that takes away player control should NEVER EVER be Spammed on an encounter and used/deployed with care ( i.e : The snipers are too many, too much. )

- Enemy cue's and signaling need a massive overhaul. There are so many vertical dangers that it becomes near impossible to keep track on everything and the AI does a piss poor job on drawing aggro. It feels like when an MMO forces you into an underwater region with combat, and calls it a day. 

- Weapon Uniqueness needs to happen ASAP. It's not enough to slap unique mods/perks and go ""nailed it"". That's terrible design. High lvl weapons (Notorious/Infamous, or pick one and stick the uniquess there ) should feel special and different from all other's within that archtype.

- Dungeons / strikes need to be implemented ASAP. Like, YESTERDAY. There needs to be a reason to COOP, and it cannot be overworld. We need proper, constructed, refined, dungeon encounters, with mini-bosses/bosses and matching gear set loot ( instead of overworld only).

- Rebalance the Talent Trees so that at least SOME characters have a VIABLE MELEE build ( Harley and Shark are key candidates here )



Overall, I am really enjoying the game. But I fear for it's future unless they pull their heads out of their arses and start implementing more instead of taking a kneejerk reaction and start Nerfing shiat - 
Don't do what Outriders did. Don't kill your own game ( further)  by nerfing anything at this stage. Give us more to have fun with, not less.

But the looting aspect of the game doesn't have enough variety. The weapon ratings seem very arbitrary when you're given legendary rated weapons from your first, second, and third missions. I may have just been lucky but with how easy it is to craft more, I doubt it.
I've only gotten to the first major boss of the game, so I can't really say much for the bosses. I thought that the boss was quite good though I've seen a lot of people think the opposite. It might have been because I was setting myself up for failure with difficulty, character choice, and weapon.
The story is very standard, it starts off quite strong and aside from a few very minor complaints, it is still fine at least up until this point.
The movement in the game is great. I've been mostly playing as Harley since her swinging is somewhat reminiscent of the Arkham games before this.
But I've left a negative review on this game because it has some pretty bad performance issues. My device generally has higher specs than the recommended, so I should have no issue running the game. But I was met with a lot of freezing and frame rate dropping. Especially when going in between cutscene and gameplay. 
The game being live service also is weird. It doesn't feel like one in any aspect that I've seen so far. It just seems like a way for them to excuse features not yet being in the game. 
The UI is also pretty ugly.
The game is just too expensive for what it is. Especially since there are in game purchases already for skins. It seems like they're trying to juggle between monetization practices by putting it at the price of a AAA game (which it is) but with the micro transactions of a free to play game. If the price was even brought down 20% this review would probably be positive.
Updating: Batman's boss fight was disappointing. Superman was a good boss fight. There is a whole lot of bugs that I've encountered especially in regard to projectile hit boxes. Tanks should not be able to shoot you through any surface. Any of the missions that require critical hits to do damage should not exist. Non critical hits will heal them and your allies will actively screw you over by healing bombers and tanks to full health whenever you get them low. Also the explosion on critical hits that they give also is disadvantageous since the explosion isn't a critical hit so it just knocks them in the air sometimes while healing.

But the main story is actually pretty fun, and as far as killing the Justice League goes, it's in the name of the game, so if that bugs you don't buy it, simple as that. I will say that the thing that bugged me about Batman was that he had the weakest Boss fight of the game, not as cool as it could have been. I think they might have had less people mad about Arkham Batman if they had added an option to capture instead of kill, but that would have meant double the voice acting, double the cut scenes, and that may have impacted their plans for the Endgame. Which brings us to the Endgame. I like the concept; Elseworlds, multiple iterations of past boss fights, epic loot, new squad members rolled out over the seasons. But, I don't know if the gameplay loop is enough to keep me interested in the long run; it was alright for the main story, but It seems like it will get real old real fast. Ultimately though, I would echo other's sentiments: wait for it to go on sale, not worth $70 and definitely not $100.",1707118101,1707118185,True,5,3,0.475269466638565063,0,True,False,False

Turns out the game is actually fun, and the majority of their criticism is just a bunch of salty sally's angry they didn't get a review copy. When I dug into it, IGN's consistent reviews and comments of Suicide Squad: KtJL, it is evident that their critique lacks professionalism and presents a skewed perspective on the game's merits and shortcomings. 

Is it worth the opening price point? I'd argue not, but I've played for close to a day and I find the game fun, the challenge of its endgame content is also keeping me around. But when you're looking at reviews to determine if you should get the game, ignore the reviews from people criticising a bunch of villains actually offing the justice league... kind of like how the name of the game implies. The game has 84% positive (as of writing), but there is a very evident review bomb campaign happening that I'd like to address a few comments on:

The assertion that Suicide Squad doesn't live up to the legacy of the Arkham trilogy is a subjective viewpoint. While the connection to the Arkham universe may be a contentious decision, it's a creative choice made by the developers. Dismissing the game solely on this basis disregards the potential for new narratives within the broader DC universe. 

The critique of the mission structure being boring, repetitive, and grindy is a common complaint in open-world games. However, categorising it as disrespectful to the player might be a stretch. Developers often aim to provide a variety of activities to cater to different player preferences. What one finds monotonous, another may find enjoyable.

The claim about the difficulty balance, especially in side missions versus Justice League boss fights, is a valid concern. Game developers should strive for consistency in challenging game play throughout various aspects. However, this alone doesn't invalidate the entire gaming experience. I can guarantee every employee at IGN struggled with these boss fights. 

The game looks good & feels good. This isn't Gotham, so it doesn't have the Dark & Rainy graphic crutch that so many are comparing to the previous Arkham games, get over it. Is it a perfect game? No, I give it a 7/10, but it excels in bringing a fresh perspective to the superhero gaming genre. The departure from the gloomy atmosphere of Gotham allows Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League to carve its own identity, and the developers and writers should be applauded for this bold step.",1707114042,1707114042,True,4,0,0,1,True,False,False

Of the 2.7 hour playtime I have at the time of review, none of that is spent on playtime, you might be asking why... BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T F***KING WORK. It keeps having server issues and loads of bugs... It is so bad that I haven't even been able to get to the menu of the game because the game won't connect to the WB servers. 

I have raised support tickets twice, which is just an AI bot replying the exact same thing, reported the bug on the bug forum, all this was done when the game was in early access, I still haven't been able to play it so essentially, I received NO EARLY ACCESS, even though I bought the deluxe edition. Icing on the cake is, the console players were provided compensation for server issues on the first day of early access, but pc players got f**cked over, none of people who are facing issues are neither receiving proper customer support, or compensation.

I will be updating my review when I can actually play the game and drop my thoughts on it

UPDATE: 
I got the game working again, not because of some patch published by the devs, but a workaround I found out after troubleshooting for 4-5 hours, I have a guide on how to fix the ""network error"" issues and infinite loading issue.

The game overall is really fun of the time I am playing it, green lantern boss and flash boss were really fun and I feel like gameplay wise this game is very much better than the games its getting compared with (marvel's avengers and gotham knights) 

If you can ignore the obvious plot armour of the suicidesquad, its a solid game with really fun banter between the crew and its really fun, on top of it, the game has no FOMO which I am highly supportive of (looking at COD). Skin pricing is bad, but the battlepass and all seasonal content are not time-gated which is a huge W in my book.",1706930052,1707113644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Me personally, a live service game isn't what I want to spend my time playing. A live service game is also what this game shouldn't be. That being said, this game is actually very fun. I like the gameplay, what with 4 different characters to play as with unique abilites, and the story is not even close to how bad everyone is saying it is. If you don't like looter shooters, this game also isn't for you (they aren't my favorite genre, but oddly enough, I feel like it works here).

What does suck unfortunately, is that the game's subtitle is ""Kill The Justice League"". With that subtitle, you would expect the boss fights to hit. Hard. Really well. Look at Rocksteady's previous entries. The Batman Arkham games are *fantastic* games. So much in fact, that Arkham City is my favorite game of all time. The boss fights in the Arkham games are amazing and memorable. The boss fights in SS:KTJL are mediocre at best. Without spoiling anything, they're very lackluster and before you know it, they're over. Sans one or two.

With all that said, you might be thinking, ""Why does this review have a thumbs up? They've mostly only said negative stuff"". Real quick, I think the gameplay is fun, the animations are superb, the voice acting is phenomenal, and the abilites (especially Cpt Boomerang personally) are super fun to use in combat and in traversal. I could take or leave the looter shooter and live service aspects of this game, however. I haven't even played the game with friends yet, but I'm sure that would be a lot of chaotic fun.

I'd give this game a 7.5-8/10, which is a lot better than some AAA games coming out these days. But, I would also say maybe wait for sale. $50 or less seems like the perfect price for this. The lackluster boss fights really hold this game back for me.

If this happens I'm guess that batman will get a new voice actor. The games gear is actually cool with how its done and I'm excited tho see what comes in the future and what guns are brought in. They have the characters names and I can for sure say this is wayyyy better then Gotham knights.,1707110769,1707110769,True,6,0,0.509509742259979248,0,True,False,False

I am really happy with the game overall. It has a great art style, really fun, quippy writing (very James Gunn, so you know what to expect), and some of the funnest combat I've ever played in a 3rd person shooter. Wonder Woman looks literally the best she ever has, and most of the cast look fantastic as well. That's not to mention some absolutely stellar voice acting from Tara Strong and Kevin Conroy (rest easy man, you're missed by so many people). 

The Bad:

There are issues that you should know before playing though. The net code is clearly not figured out, especially in the escort missions. NPC's will often flush back and delay event/dialogue triggers. Some missions didn't make any sense until I played them on single player and it felt like a different game (it's always online but very noticeable whether you have someone in your party or not). 

Overall, I don't see what the very vocal critics do, this is a really good game! It could be one of my favorite coop games period if they just figure out the network issues. 8/10",1707099820,1707099820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: gun play, abilites, and traversal all work really well. Each character has its own approach to how they play. It is a chaotic mess at times, but you never lose yourself in that chaos.

Gameplay is fun but gets repetetive very fast. Voice acting is very good. Story is all over the place, starts off strong but falls off. Mission and enemy variety is non-existant. The live-service part of the game ruins a lot, locking cool cosmetics behind paywalls instead of grinding for them sucks lol. There is absolutely not enough content to justify the 70€ pricetag, I don't care if ""content is coming with seasons"" if I payed that much money I'm expecting a lot of content. 
The game is pretty fun, but not worth the pricetag. Wait for a sale.

Aint bad.
Are you after loot? It has it.
And a few ways to get it as well.

I've started to notice some missions types repeats however its fun to just smash, explode and bash so it has not really bothered me that much.
I cant complain about how it runs either, and my computer is about 3 years old at this point.

Overall if you like action games with loot then yeah this game has it.

The most negative i can say so far is that the game is a little flashy on the UI side.
It introduces at times some weird mechanics that do not matter 90% of the time.
And some elements just feel weird.
Such as the vehicle parts, they work.

Chaotic fun gameplay. 
Some of the best vertical traversal out there.
Crazy good animations, character controller and animation transitions.
Fun story and well executed.
Good direction in cutscenes.
Combat music really fits the gameplay.
Exceptional facial animations.
Weapons and builds look fun.
Good optimization and stability out of the box. No frame drops, stuters or crushes at all.

The bad:
Missions are repetitive in the sense that there is not enemy variety and it's mostly horde modes.
Snipers are really unfun to deal with when multiple are spawned.
Overworld is lacking depth in the sense of exploration.
Always online for no real reason.

Since this is a live service game if it is supported the negative points can be fixed and content will be added. The foundation is there. If you expect to play the story and get a few dozens of hours of fun then the current state serves this purpose. If you are looking for a game to sink 100s of hours right away then i would wait for seasonal content and updates to beef it up. If you are like me and got only a few hours a day to game and actively play more than one game then this is a good game to add in your library.

A lot of negative feedback is coming from Arkhamverse shills that are hurt from the direction of the story. I kinda understand not liking something but IGN making a video called ""batman deserved better"", a fictional character in a fictional universe, really tells a story of bandwagon hate and milking of said hate for this game. People were out for blood before it even came out. And any content creator or reviewer are in for the moneys.

It's not a 10/10 and it will never be. But it is a solid 7 and with updates/seasons it can get better.

It's got good things it that I'd imagine you won't hear anybody mention on the internet, but where you do those things is where the lazy part of the game feels like it comes in.

First off, all the characters are good. I wish we got to see more interactions between the main four, maybe something that that which you'd see in Guardians of the Galaxy video game from 2021, but the characters felt like losers (that's a good thing by the balls). In terms of the Justice league however. The only character I think seemed to get time to shine, and that I wanted to see more of was the flash, and he was only in the first bit of the game. All the other characters had no time to shine. Superman had a good boss fight, but that just about it.

The story wasn't good, but I do like the idea of it. some say it's unrealistic, because batman has a strong will, and wouldn't be mind controlled, but imagine if a new comic came out, and it was exactly like the previous comic run, it's nice to see a change, the real problem comes in when you realize that this batman is a batman you've spent the last 15 or so years with in the Arkham games. It doesn't really matter how his story ends or who it ends to, the problem is really that it feels like his character was just thrown away, in a game where you don't even see much of him. 

The gameplay is actually good, or at least it's something not to mind. It sucks that they all pretty much just use guns, rather than them being unique, but I'm not gonna judge it for what it could've been, but rather what was given. Now of course, there is one big problem, and that is thee missions. they're all repetitive, and or they really don't have anything to do with what you'd think you'd be doing in this game, which if you couldn't tell, was to ""off the justice league"".you just do a bunch of hacks that get you to pretend that you're there to get item number A, then item letter 2, to beat superhero. I think if they made it more each chapter is linear, about an hour or two long each chapter, and you kill a member in each chapter, we would've gotten more screen time from the justice league.

All in all I was playing with a friend, and we can have fun playing pretty much anything, the trashiest game of all time can't stop us from having it. me and my friend were having a good time... until the last mission. It was so disappointing. The game felt like a decent multiplayer game throughout, until the last mission, where it's treated like an introduction to the live service part of the game. And to top the last mission off, the final boss was just a rehash of a past boss. Not all the past bosses, Just one. They didn't even give the big bad his own moves. The game really ends when you beat the last member of the justice league, and the game ends without finishing the story, because it's a live service game. 

I will say that it isn't so bad that my friend and I are just gonna drop it. we plan to 100% the game. I would also love to say that you should buy it on sale, at most 20 dollars maybe, but by the time that happens, the game will probably be shut down, as when they decide to shut down the servers, you will not be able to play the game at all (from what I gathered, it's a live service game), unless they decide to make it offline somehow.",1707094088,1707094088,False,34,1,0.594828248023986816,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and campaign are amazing, the traversal and the mobility is one of the coolest I've ever seen on a videogame, the feeling you get while moving through the city never gets old, quite the opposite, once you master the mechanics (at first it can be quite difficult), it gets smoother and doper. 

But not everything is good, the ""world"" is very meh, there aren't enough enemies out there to kill or events to participate... After some hours you realize the world is a little ""dead"" when it comes to enemies, and the variety of these too...

Overall a pretty, decent, fun game, but quite repetitive after some hours.

Very funny campaign (it'll get you laughing a lot), combat and traversal very fun and cool (you'll feel like a badass), bland world (after you do everything there is to do, you'll get bored pretty quick)

Do recommend playing it just for the campaign.

*THEY DID NOT DELETE 7000 REVIEWS. If they did the Steam DB would show there have been changes to it. On top of that there were 700 reviews that were deleted or being held by the system which ended up being a mix of review bomb reviews and reviews that were trolling ticking it as positive. Anyone that says there was 7k is just agreeing because some salty person who has been bashing the game since before it came out wanted to try and start up a rumor. Apparently people took the bait. (The number on the day that the user claimed 7k are missing only 700 was missing from the total overall count).*


1) The shop isn't that bad (it's standard for a buy to play that has a cosmetic shop) Average skins cost $10. (Cheaper then shop in any of the CoD games which are priced at $70 except warzone).

2) Battle pass hasn't even been added yet and again it'll only be for cosmetics which is an OPTION. 

3) The game it self isn't bad. As a loot shooter it does the basics very well, but does get repetitive. Has some of the best vertical and horizontal combat in a third person shooter.  

4) Bosses are lackluster every one of them.

5) Current content doesn't warrant $70+ price tag (Coming from someone that preordered the deluxe). With that being said all story content, characters and overall extra gameplay content being added in the future will be free. So none of that $20-30 expansions. People don't understand that this model is fairly pro consumer and is a plus once the content is added.


6) Again the game currently isn't worth $70 but it is a fun game. If the devs hold up their 
promises it will be worth it down the road when more content is added.

7) Performance for the most part is not as bad as people make it out to be (at least as of 
now). It still has a few issues but nothing thats worse then average game release.

8) Some people keep saying this is a ""conclusion"" to the arkham series. It is not. Don't listen to those people. 

9) Story isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's not the best but it is very ""Suicide squad"" like. Anyone who has read any of their comics, or even seen the animated movie (Even the live action) would know that the tone and dialogue in the game is accurate for them. (Though the plot and certain scenes are a bit far fetched and i don't agree with some of the choices that were made).

10)if you are on the fence about the game, don't buy it now wait until there is a sale or major content update.

11) Coop works well with cross platform and you can set the limit of people that can join your session. Example you can have 2 players then you both bounce between all 4. They fixed the lagg that was happening Early access (mostly).

12) Avengers comparison is NOT accurate. I played quite a bit of it when it came out. The game had way more in game currencies, unbalanced grind, coop was an after thought and it showed, cash shop was way more expensive (more bundles $20-40) then anything. They gave more incentives to drop money then SS (so far). Only thing the game did better was the selection of earn able costumes (but that took ALOT of time before they added more that you can earn). They lowered drops rates for the materials you use to make the costumes (or buy them). Servers were bad, there was no cross play until it's last year of life. Game had no sense of direction and combat was extremely linear. It took the devs a while before they started doing Quality of life updates. They kept pushing out cosmetics to match what ever marvel film or tv show was coming out at the time. The player based died before the game even really started.

Killing the Justice League is a bad thing that bad guys WOULD do. That doesn't make it a bad game, people make games bad all by themselves.

- Gameplay is great especially when you master each character (Can play solo throughout the game)
- Story is great (Dialogue, Banters, Characters)
- Open World is great (Easter eggs, Details, Map design)
- Audio, Music
- Game length is not 10hrs (Yes if you rushed the main story)
- Performance for me is great no crashes on my 22 hrs play through some occasional dips below 50 fps when so many things are on-screen (i5 11400, RTX3060 12 GB, 16GB RAM on max settings 1080p DLSS set to Quality)
- You can turn off the damage numbers, enemy health and other stuff

Cons
- Enemy/Mission/Sidequest variety needs improvement (Mostly kill a set of this, Save a number of civilians all over again)
- End game kind of sucks and not enough content at the moment
- Characters are mostly the same minus their Traversal or a a few unique skills
- Most missions are set in the Open World Map (Always outside of the Map and No interiors Probably because of the traversal mechanics)
- Not enough content for endgame (You should probably wait for the upcoming seasons)
- Always online (Though I got disconnected only twice)
- Character talents/skills (Mostly passive abilities with a few unique skills to each characters)

An 8.5/10 experience for DC fans.
As a video game fan, I'm generally unimpressed. It's basically Sunset Overdrive with a DC skin slapped on it, which is fun and all, but it's nothing too innovative or refreshing overall. A solid 7/10 in that regard. 
As a fan of the Arkham series, I'm depressed and disgusted. It really is difficult for me to see that Batman that I played as for so many years go from having his story wrapped up and his cowl retired, to this sudden time skip where he not only came out of retirement and undid everything from the ending of Arkham Knight, but he apparently also joined the Justice League, but is now evil and has to be killed. It just feels like it didn't have to be the Arkham Batman at all, and they just did it to create some kind of hype/interest, and overall it just makes me sad to see/experience. Not to mention the gun-focused gameplay is so opposite of anything experienced in the previous Arkhamverse games, with virtually zero melee gameplay offered, despite it apparently being the same Harley that I beat hordes of armed thugs with using nothing but a baseball bat in the past, causing a further feeling of disconnect between this game and the previous Arkham games. So a 5/10 experience as an Arkham fan.
Overall I think the game is pretty average, most of the hate online honestly seems super forced after having played it myself. If you're looking for something fun to kill time with, this game can definitely offer that, and if you're a DC fan looking for something to scratch that Gotham-Knights-Sucked itch, this game can offer that, too. Arkham fans, Batman stans, and man-children who don't like to see their heroes fall so far from grace (all me); beware.",1707087955,1707087955,True,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has possibly the worst first 2 hours of a game I've ever played. 

It is either boring you with very long repetitive cinematics where your characters keep forgetting about the bombs in their heads or it is non-stop teaching you new mechanics without giving you time to master the ones it showed you previously. I have almost exactly 2 hours of playtime, and I did one real mission. I haven't even really played the game yet and I have to decide if I want to refund it or not. 

The gameplay seems schizophrenic. Non-stop jumping, dodging, and combos. Jump up, shoot people, fall down. Swing over, shoot people in mid air, drop down, combo people, jump up again. This is the gameplay loop. Also, shoot the purple glowing spot. The beginning of the game feels like the end of most other games, where you have lots of movement options and different enemy types. And you learned how to use them over time, but in this case you do them all from the start. Just watch the videos on the store page, watch much the characters jump around and shoot, or do a 180 and shoot, or fall from the sky while shooting. That is the game.

Yet at the same time, the world and scale of the game is interesting. The character models are impressive. There are moments where something special is happening. This looks exactly like a game I should enjoy. But the one mission I did play was on rooftops, and I kept falling off because I wasn't used to doing the combat and movement at the same time. And I realized, it will be more of this, and it will get more complicated. 

I like King Shark / Harley, they are fun. Deadshot is seemingly devoid of a personality. But every time I have to listen to either Captain Boomerang or Amanda Waller, I want to stop playing. This game acts like these characters are familiar to us, that we've seen them before, and we all love their jokes and personalities. And maybe some people do, but I'm guessing for most of us we barely know anything about them. So we have no connection to them. I'm sure they grow on us over time, but at the beginning it's terrible.",1707087627,1707087627,False,5,0,0.482379883527755737,0,True,False,False

I would buy it on sale. As I saw another person say, its fun, but maybe not $70 fun.

Same things as previously said, except missions keep getting repetive. As one of my favorite youtubers said, ""your brain is off, you're mowing goons down and numbers are flying at your screen.

Honestly, I'm genuinely dumbfounded by how much hate this game has gotten, so much of the complaints feels completely unjustified.
The story is engaging and well written, on par for Rocksteady. the characters are colorful and fun and full of personality even the NPCs that stand around at the base feel unique and interesting and have their own stories going on. The protagonists are great personalities that bounce off eachother really well, especially Captain Boomerang, easily a favorite though the rest are a really close second.
 The gameplay is fun and exciting. lots of gunplay, movement and flashy attacks that rewards stylish combat and reading your opponents. The game loop that develops is decent enough to not grate. at least not yet, I've just gotten to the endgame loop and so far I'm enjoying it. 
the loot system is interesting enough, you dont feel like you are constantly swapping out for a slightly more damaging gun. this does have the minor downside of you picking up a LOT of junk items waiting for the next Legendary or Notorious drop to round off your build
Of course lets address the elephants in the room: 
Yes, there is a cash shop, but its completely cosmetic
Yes, there is a Battle Pass but we have been assured that all game features and game modes will be separate from it. The only FOMO will be cosmetic FOMO. 
And yes, this was Kevin Conroys final performance as the batman and quite frankly, some of his best work. People trying to use his death as an argument that the game is bad because of plot and character reasons (Spoilers) are despicable and in my opinion, non applicable. To avoid spoilers, though I'm sure everyone has seen it by now: When you take the whole story into account and everything that the player goes though to get there, I believe it was handled really well and is a satisfactory conclusion for batman to go out on. And clearly Mr. Conroy would agree. Afterall, he agreed to the script and gave it his all. (Also, after credits scene shows that Rocksteady had nothing but love and respect for the man too, so saying that they don't is bullshit.)

To wrap this up, this game is really fun! the good greatly outweigh the bad which i can count on a single hand without my thumb. Is it Game of the Year? its only February guys lets not over sell it. But is it one of the good ones? Absolutely.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League stands as further evidence of why you shouldn't listen to people on the internet. The bandwagon was pooping all over this game long before it was even released. After playing for 6+ hours I'm pretty confident in saying they were wrong. Is Suicide Squad game of the year? No, it definitely isn't. Is it a lot of fun to play? Yes, it is! The live service stuff is weird. $24 for a skin in a full priced game is insane! But you don't have to buy the skins or engage with the live service and you really shouldn't.

Edit My Last Update: Honestly finished the game, it's the same missions over and over again with almost no change for any of the side quests, map is small, graphics are no where near as good as games released over 8 years ago.  The story is pretty lame, flash fight good, superman okay, green lantern okay to good fight, batman was just dumb and waste of time.  Writing is funny I will admit that, there's some funny lines but overall story is pretty bad.  The game makes you redo the same things over and over and there's only like 4-5 types of missions with no change between them and their types.  This game is not worth 70 dollars and then becomes essentially a dungeon grinder after the main campaign, that's it, basically tiny tina's wonderland at the very end so if you keep playing it then that's the experience you'll get.  Overall not worth the money at all, wait for it to go on sale honestly, should not be worth more than 30 bucks honestly,  Enshrouded or palworld is way better than this and it took me a day to beat this game.  Honestly very disappointed in this game, also the weapon customization kind of sucks, combat is okay but odd and clunky and could be a lot better.
TBH if this company puts anything out again like this for more than 30-40 bucks do not buy it if this is what 6 years of development puts out, I'm really disappointed with how short the story is, how repetitive it is and the design feeling like really no heart or soul was put into it to make a game that people can enjoy with their friends for a long time, this game you will beat and not want to pick up again because everything is the same over and over again.  Probably not gonna play this ever again after today because I've really done everything that does not repeat over and over again at this point and I feel like I wasted 70 dollars on this, I'm going to go back and play enshrouded or something else instead.  

Edit Again: ""oddly"" after people were up in arms in their discord about this issue, suddenly, it's fixed for a lot of people, interesting.

Edit: played the game a few hours, game crashed, can no longer log into wb servers to play the game now, it is unplayable, there is no fix for this either, no timeline for a fix from devs, 100's of people having this issue in their discord as of now and being told to deal with it, do not buy this game, if you do and it crashes you may never be able to play the game again and waste your money.  

Games clunky, forces you to waste time, story is okay, not a fan of the woke stuff, beginning of the game and have to see lgbtq flag every time leave the hall of ""hero's"" what happened to the american flag and supporting the troops, just hate woke stuff put into a game for no reason when there's actual hero's in the world unlike what's being put in our face, otherwise fun game",1706930100,1707082071,False,19,2,0.379981637001037598,0,True,False,False

As for the boss fights most were easy even on higher difficulty, but again this can all be fixed as more content is added.

Each character feels different in style of play thanks to how they traverse and what guns they have access too. With each being able to focus on a support role, or tank, damage etc depending how you set your load out. 

Story i would give it a 6 out of 10, there is a lot of mystery as there are a few plot holes that again, will likely be filled as more content is added to the game. The voice acting is brilliant, there is always banter between the characters, that always make me laugh. 

Overall the game play is fun for what it has to offer so far, the story can be improved just need to see what will be added in future seasons. The characters are funny. A little too much repetition in the way objectives go for missions, but as i said a lot more will be added in future seasons with more characters.

I see a lot of people complaining about the messy UI as there is a lot of stuff on screen, a lot of it can be turned off in the settings this will also help with frame rate issues if your having those too.

I would recommend this to players who like looter shooters like borderlands for example or people who just enjoy PVE (player vs environment) and want to play with friends too, and don't need to play the other Arkham games to know whats going on this story, so you can treat it as a stand alone if you want too.

If you are just a casual gamer who wants to play the game with friends or family, BUY THIS GAME. The gameplay is enthralling, each character has an entirely different play style. The gameplay mechanics seem overwhelming, but mastering the mechanics is rewarding, and really does make you feel like (insert character name here). Overall, I would not recommend this game for either hard core fans or casual players at the moment, it is by no means worth the investment of $70 USD, but I will recommend this game for anyone who is willing to try it either on sale or if it hits a service like Game Pass.",1707080596,1707080596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each character feels mechanically diverse as well; enough to where hot-swapping in between missions takes a few minutes to adjust to the different playstyles. A lot of layers to how combat plays out and the competitive incentives for multiplayer are a nice touch. Any game that is just 'fun to play' is usually enough for me, but there's even more.

Story is excellent so far both in the content and the visual execution. Each cutscene seems to deliver equal parts humor and insight into the DC world just in the same way any of the previous Rocksteady Arkham games did. 

The city map is actually pretty exciting, after a decade + of Gotham, we're seeing the same talent tackle Metropolis and it shows very well.

Traversal is actually a lot of fun too. No two characters move the same so its a bit of a minigame and a challenge to get from A to B efficiently. Traversal is also huge in combat, so knowing how to do something character-specific well feels like you actually start to 'main' a character rather than fan-service them.

Definitely on par with Rocksteady's standards. Really surprised at the pre-emptive and early negative feedback. Playing the game debunked all of it.

As for negatives, the GaaS aspect does, unfortunately, prove to be detrimental when you 'disconnect' during a mission even when playing by yourself. Only happened once, but I'm not looking to do any mental gymnastics here.",1707064502,1707078799,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The whole experience is only enhanced if you're a huge DC Comics nerd, or just a superhero nerd in general.

Then the leaks dropped.

When the leaks for this game came out (we now know most were fake) the majority of the internet fully turned on this game. They began to spread rumors, say that Rocksteady was disrespecting Kevin Conroy as if they knew he was going to die during production, and critique every small thing that came out about the game. I knew that whether the game was good or not, all of the major discussions of this game from now on would be in bad faith, which ended up being true to this day. 

So, how is it?

I liked it!

It's not perfect or anything, far from it, but I enjoyed it pretty much the entire time I played it.

Let's start with the biggest compliment that I can give this game, the gameplay is really fun. It's nothing revolutionary, but if you think you'd enjoy the gameplay they show in the trailers, or you enjoy looter shooters and DC, you'll probably have a lot of fun playing this game. In terms of which character is best, I'd rank them like this:

1. Captain Boomerang: My main. He has great traversal, his melee has a lot of range, and his special moves are cool as hell.
2. King Shark: Good traversal, short-ranged melee.
3. Deadshot: Okay traversal, mid-ranged melee.
4. Harley Quinn: Okay traversal, short-ranged melee.

I found all of the boss battles to be fun, and I think the IGN reviewer who was complaining about the Flash fight is just bad at games.

Moving on to the performances, I think everyone did a fine job. The only real standouts in my opinion are Daniel Lapaine as Captain Boomerang (goat), Scott Porter who plays a great evil Flash, and especially Debra Wilson as Amanda Waller, who at every chance she gets reminds everyone why she's in so many games these days. You could also tell Kevin Conroy was having a really fun time playing a new take on Arkham Batman, and it was fun to hear him voice an evil Batman for once. Other than them, everyone was fine, no bad performances to be found here.

Moving onto the most mixed part of the game for me: the story. There are good aspects here. I like how all of the members of the squad interact with each other. They're not best friends or anything, but they start to like each other as the story goes on and that's their main arc. There are hints at possible major character progression, but besides just liking each other more they're all static characters and that's fine. Arkham Origins is the only game in the entire Arkham series where the playable character had an arc, and it's also the only game in the Arkham series not made by Rocksteady. What confuses me, however, is why even put the hints at possible character growth in there if you're not going to do anything with them?

I'll give a quick and very very minor spoiler example here. Deadshot in this game is incredibly claustrophobic and will start hyperventilating if kept in a small space with no way out for too long. This is an interesting aspect of his character and if he were to overcome this at some point in the story by willingly going through a small space to save one of the squad members, that could be seen as an incredibly triumphant moment and it could provide some growth for at least one of the characters, both in overcoming their fear and growing to become really close to the other members. Unfortunately, we don't get that and instead, his claustrophobia is referenced a few times and then never brought up again.

My biggest problem with this game, however, is the fact that it is set in the Arkham universe. This is a universe that we had spent four whole games protecting. A Batman who we had watched grow (in Origins and never again) and followed through thick and thin. Having this game be set in that same universe has a few terrible implications.

- Everything had done meant nothing since Brainiac starts invading Earth and killing everyone anyway.
- The guy you were playing as in those games is now under murderous mind control that can't be reversed, meaning you have to kill him if you want to save the world. 
- The Justice League needs to be explored a lot more as this is a universe people care about and want to know as much about as possible. If this was a throwaway universe and this game was just marketed as ""Want to play as the bad guys and see what it would look like if they actually won?"" I feel as though it would be a lot better.

Now that we know that everything in the Arkham games leads to the world being taken over anyway and the Batman we played as for so long needing to be killed, it only makes this game look worse, especially with how perfect Arkham Knight's ending was despite the game's many flaws. If they had just put it in a different universe, a lot of my criticisms of this game as a concept would go away.

However, even if we were to think of this as a completely different universe, the Justice League still needs more time in the spotlight before they turn evil than they got here. I have a proposal to help with this a bit:

The tutorial for this game is bland as you're just fighting mindless goons in some random tutorial-exclusive area, with no effect on the story. What if, instead of that, since you get to learn every character in the tutorial, it went like this: No tutorial at the beginning of the game, instead we get the first cutscene as normal. However, as they drive into Metropolis, they tell each other how they got into the position they're in. As they tell their story, you'll get to play that short story out where you not only get to learn how each of the characters works (besides the new gear they get at the Hall of Justice, but that can be taught after you get it) but you get to see each of them get caught by their respective league member instead of just hearing about it numerous times. Not only would it make the tutorial far more interesting, but it would also give the four evil league members more screen time before they turn, making their inevitable deaths far more impactful and sad, or more exciting if the player wants to kick their ass even more for catching them at the beginning.

I have far more spoilery problems with the story, but I won't touch on them here.

In conclusion, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is a flawed game but a fun time all things considered. It's Rocksteady's weakest entry, but hey, it's still fun.

Buy it if you think the gameplay looks fun, however you might want to wait for it to go on sale.

-Gameplay: While the squad plays fun and traversal is interesting, you don't unlock new moves past the ones you start the game off with. You'll unlock gear with modifiers, but that's about it. Fully focused on the guns, of which there's tons of looter shooter variations on the same core ones but without anything crazy.
-Graphics: Pretty good, but a noticeable downgrade when compared to Arkham Knight in 2015.
-Performance: used an rtx 3070 and ryzen 5 5600x at 1440p with most settings on medium and some on low while having dlss performance on and frequently was under 60 fps for almost the entire game.
-Always online: during my playtime, I had one day where I tried to boot up the game 5 or 6 times before it would be able to connect to a server to actually play. took about 5 minutes.
-Music: nothing special stood out
-Mission variety: very minimal. You'll be playing the same grindy missions over and over minus some story ones.
SPOILERS: look below



Story: Extremely rough with no care for beloved characters or proper storytelling. Deaths and characters outside of the squad are handled very poorly. See below for more:
-Flash: done pretty well leading up to his final fight in which you whittle his health bar down and then he's just dead. No final moments or words. No special cutscene of the squad taking him out. He just gets shot in gameplay and ragdolls over. Not to mention a lot of the disbelief necessary.
-Green lantern: little better than flash as he actually gets killed in cutscene, but it's as simple as deadshot saying a word or two while he's practically dead and then shooting him in the face. Also gives king shark a lantern ring for a cutscene ignoring how the rings are supposed to work.
-Wonder Woman: funny enough, her story is actually great as well as her ending. You don't fight her, but you get to watch superman do it. It's followed by a super dumb moment where the squad all just stands and watches as superman (with Kryptonite in his chest) slowly kills Wonder Woman instead of helping her. For some reason, they act all sad too for some reason despite no reason to.
-Superman: Killed with bullets in-gameplay same as the flash with no climax whatsover. It's just ""oh, superman is dead now"".
-Batman: A spit in the face for fans of the Arkham series. The squad somehow overcomes his fear toxin and beats him by just raining bullets on him in the easiest boss fight ever. He's then experimented on, half tortured, then dragged out to a park bench where Harley talks trash to him before putting a bullet in his head and leaving him legs up in the air.
Brainiac: Somehow the worst boss here. The entire ending has you repeating missions you've already done, then you go and fight this incredible alien that took out the entire justice league and controlled them aaaaand: it's literally just the flash fight again but with purple. Nothing unique at all there.
To make things worse, the end credits after a nice sendoff to kevin conroy plaster a poster advertisement for the upcoming ""seasons"" and ""battle pass"".

Combat- I think that the core game play of the game is very fluid and satisfying and the weapons (notorious and infamous) are very unique and fun to use. I have personally put most of my time into Boomerang so far and he feels like the most fun and fast character to use in the game, but I am sure the other characters open up a lot more once their skill tree is leveled up. People are shitting on this game because of the suicide squad using guns but killing enemies satisfying and taking advantage of your characters movement is key to making this game a lot more enjoyable.
Story- The story is definitely the weakest point of this game by far. I enjoy all of the members of the suicide squad and think that the banter between them is well executed. What wasn't well executed were the Justice League. Each of the members of the Justice League have there own chapter in the story focused on killing them but the way the squad goes about killing them felt very underwhelming. Lex Luthor is responsible for making most of the items the suicide squad needs to kill them and it makes you question how he hasn't been successful in defeating the justice league in the first place knowing all of there weaknesses. Batman is the massive talking point in how this game ruined his legacy and to an extent i can agree. Harley acknowledges that they wouldn't have learned how to defeat Superman if not for Batman but i still feel like he was done dirty for sure and was a very shitty sendoff for the character that made rocksteady as loved as they were. The Boss Fights were solid for the most part except for Brainiac's. which if you go into endgame you will learn just how insufferable his boss fight is. His boss is just a copy and paste of the Flash's fight but with a bunch of extra bullshit being thrown at you to the point that you have no clue what is happening. The death scenes for the justice league were also very poorly executed and lacked any form of impact. I know its very possible that the justice league may return as this game releases content but they should've tried to make you at least care about them to an extent.
Endgame: So far I've found the endgame to very repetitive but still enjoyable. You basically do missions in metropolis to earn a currency to do the same three different missions that each have a different loot pool of the best endgame loot. There is an incentive to keep pushing the difficulty of these missions higher as depending on the mastery rank of the missions will give you access the the best possible endgame loot as of right now. I think its a fine idea for endgame but i think that this will probably get very stale after about 2 weeks. Its kinda similar to borderlands in its mastery levels but with a lot less to do. Hopefully we will see raid bosses and new endgame missions because as of now the endgame is pretty baron except for grinding your finite crisis rank to get the bane items.
Overall I think that if you are going into this game as a fan of looter shooters, you will really like this game. If you are going into this game as ONLY a fan of the Batman Arkham games then chances are you will probably not enjoy your time with this game. The core game play loop is a 7.5/10 as of now. The story is a 5/10 and that's being generous. If your willing to shill out $70 dollars for the game go for it, but if not i would just recommend waiting for the game to go on sale.",1707070783,1707070783,True,2,0,0.494467496871948242,0,True,False,False

Beat the Game playing on Hard from first minute - 20 hours to beat, did all the side content also. 

Story - Good, enjoyed it. Not the greatest story of all time, but I laughed, was shocked, and found it engaging. A note needs to be said, the title is Suicide Squad – Kil the Justice League, what happens is literally in the title. It’s a dark story, that is irreverent.

Game play – Excellent, variety of activities is good, enough to keep me excited, but not so much that I am lost in the different mechanics. Each activity is modded randomly, each time you do one how to complete it could be different then the last one you did. Often requiring you to adapt, and change up your build. 

Boss battles - Only one that I would say was weak, but the others were excellent fun fights. 

Loot - Engaging, not Borderlands flood of loot, the loot streams in though and is fun to see the builds.
Main Character - Used King Shark 14 hours of my 20 hours play through. He reached max level at final boss, starting endgame with him max level.

Build Variety - Many builds to be had. The different weapon abilities, talent variety (that is a free re-spec whenever you want out of battle), Grenades, 3 mods to equip, melee weapon, and a charm. All these interact with each other allowing for builds and synergy between all of them. All your mods, charms, and weapons have augments further creating diversity in builds, finally apply aliments to your melee and grenade that interact with augments on all your gear, endless min max potential. 

Character Diversity - Each character feels unique, for the few hours that I played other characters, it was hard to play them, because each is so unique. How I played King Shark is vastly different then Harley, Dead-shot, and Boomer. I am excited to max the other characters and make fun builds with each of them. 

Conclusion - If you like Looter shooters Its a buy, if you only want story I would wait for sale, if you only like the DC universe wait for sale. If you do not like looter shooters this would be an avoid, or super sale. 

For me I am 100% happy with my purchase.


Update:

Endgame - I have been in the endgame for 16 hours. Max leveled King Shark took him to Mastery level 10 and 15 squad points. I working on maxing out Deadshot, currently level 20. 

Like I said in my earlier review each character plays different. This holds completely true. As Deadshot I find myself hovering in the air, throwing grenades, working the middle with my Assault Rifle, and long range with my sniper. He definitely out DPS the Shark, but doesn't have as much survivability. While King Shark wants to be in melee up close and personal. Both characters are great fun, and fun putting together a build that works with their unique play style. 

What is the end game? 

Here are the mission types - Kill X amount of enemies. defend these locations, and destroy the nodes, save the civilians. All of which come in their own variety (3, 2, 1, 2, respectively) and you want to do as quick as you can. After doing some of those you then use the endgame currency to do 5 different endgames zones to get unique rewards, in these zones you are timed. Kill X amount of enemies to get points, defend locations, and destroy nodes. They add two new endgame content to the rotation, both are the same, but variations. It is a survival last as long as you can zone. You start off a the lowest level more enemies you kill the higher mastery it becomes. Longer you last the better rewards. One is normal, the other is hardcore no revives. 

Is it repetitive? yes of courses. I have never played a looter shooter, or mmo whos endgame is not a repetitive game play loop. The question becomes, is the loop fun, for me yes, it is scratching the looter shooter itch I have had for awhile. The game play loop is larger, longer, and more fun the any COD or Battle Royal.",1706902323,1707069150,True,525,54,0.649747669696807861,49,True,False,False

so here are the problems i have with this game

THE MISSIONS are repetitive but that plauges all live service/looter shooter games at launch the game just needs more variety of missions to keep it engaging for the players. and i hope for each season that come out the less repetitive the game will be

THE STORY i no for a fact rocksteady can create a better story than this the story is not bad but not great either its just alright i hope it gets better throughout the next four seasons but  my expectations are low

and if you are thinking about picking up this game i would wait for at least two seasons to be released before buying this game

also we do not want sweetbaby inc please use in house writers

The suicide squad characters story and banter wise is really good and fun. The overall story is not. I don't understand how killing Nerd/Geek  heroic icons get you ESG point or virtue signal points. Why do woke people feel the need to tear down beloved icons to make them self better. The people that wrote the story are no comic book fans because they have no understanding of the lore. This is why gate keeping is needed. god forbid someone comes around and makes any female character look bad or weak like the do male characters. 

Enough ranting.... Play the game for the fun action and the funny banter between the suicide squad. Also voice acting is top notch for ALL of the characters!!!

DO NOT play the game for the story. I have learned to not hold on to the icons I grew up too tight. I know the madness will end eventually and we can give all stories and characters the respect they earn and not just a select few.

The negativity over the past month had dampened my enthusiasm, but I decided to dive in and form my own opinion. To my pleasant surprise, I discovered a well-crafted and enjoyable game.

Having spent over 14+ hours (so far), I recently completed the main story, yet there's plenty of endgame content left to explore. While some might find 14 hours for the main campaign too short for the price, I personally prioritize the question of whether I had fun over playtime vs money spent – and in this case, the answer is a definitive yes.

What I Liked:
	The story, though a classic comicbook story, proved to be entertaining, boosted by excellent cinematics and voice actor performances.
	Traversal feels amazing, but needs a bit of time to get used to. But when it clicked, it reminded me of the feeling Anthem gave me. I always loved Anthem’s traversal, and while this isn’t the same, it did scratch that same itch.
	The gunplay exceeded expectations, which flows great with the abilities.
	Characters felt distinct with unique abilities and movement.
	Boss battles

What I Didn’t Like:
	The introductory tutorial felt out of place, disrupting the flow and nearly ending my interest in continuing the game.
	Mission and activity variety were lacking, leading to a feeling of repetition/grind.
	Boss battles were unevenly distributed, lacking a cohesive narrative flow.
	The game struggled to explain different vendors and systems, requiring videos on YouTube for clarity.

My overall experience was highly enjoyable, and I'm excited to dive into more gameplay. Excited to see what the upcoming seasons bring to the game, and while it has the potential to be an excellent live service game, I know its foundation may not appeal to everyone. I encourage those interested in the genre to give it a try, and for those less inclined towards live service games, it's worth considering the game despite those foundations.",1707060638,1707060752,True,164,24,0.613209366798400879,0,True,False,False

Comedy is pretty good and the bulk to the story is fun but the ending is very unsatisfying. 
Not entirely sure why this is a live service / looter shooter. Loot wise it’s a bit like a single player game but with loot, kinda like more recent assassins games. Although there’s no power levels or anything. XP level ups only serve to unlock skill points. There’s no real progression out side of that. 

Worth playing if you can pick it up for £20 but probs don’t bother unless you’re really in to DC.

Pros:
- Amazing storyline (so far), an extension of the DC universe
- Game runs smoothly, no bugs so far
- Graphics are beautiful. Running on a 4090 so that helps, but the cutscenes, maps, combat animations, etc. are all amazing.

Cons:
- movement controls can be a bit clunky (Tried using both keyboard and xbox controller)
- Missions can get repetitive (defend the point, kill X troops using a specific method). Puzzles were meh as compared to the Arkham series
- Skill tree can be lacklustre

Neutral:
- Combat is quite flashy and revolves around combos, adding some complexity and flashiness for people who like fast-paced games. However, it can be quite frantic and messy, contrasting with the smooth-flowing melee nature of the Arkham series
- The different characters are rather similar in their moveset, and have little distinguishing gameplay styles. This can help in switching and balancing out your squad, but makes it less interesting in general",1707059185,1707059185,True,2,0,0.487804889678955078,0,True,False,False

Edit: gameplay is fine, I don't feel motivated to do the side missions, there's not much reason to use any of the ""Support Squad"" because the guns you get work fine for everything, it doesn't matter what effect you use on your weapon, ice or fire, who cares everyone will take damage from them, the final boss fight is very disappointing and you'll understand why if you get there. I didn't care too much for the story, Toyman came in super super conveniently out of nowhere and saved the whole story from ending at the start and then you can just ignore him the rest of the game, don't really have to talk to penguin and make guns or anything, the only good enemy variant is the flash variant because it's the only one that isn't just alien with a different gun. I felt there were way too many escort missions, there's some weird pokeball mechanic for some of the missions? idk why people haven't talked about that so far. Batman's bossfight is really short and really easy, it was a cool idea but it took like 5 seconds to beat him, was expecting another phase where he's not like a giant demon fear creature but whatever. Lantern's fight was pretty good, Flash was fine but just felt a bit spongy, Superman boss fight is confusing, Kryptonite doesn't work because writers need a reason for you to help Lex i guess which was fine but then you just shoot him? like dude gets stabbed in the chest and flies it off ig, like does Diana just miss all his vitals? Diana had the best and most respectful death scene which isn't shocking from Sweet Baby, just wish they all had deaths similar to hers, even the Squad's reaction to her death is weird, they're all upset and being respectful but for everyone else they're spitting on their faces, piss on Flash, strip Lantern, make fun of Batman, I don't even remember what happened after Superman's fight, it's just inconsistent, I also don't understand why they care about Diana? she shows up, kicks our asses, tells us to fuck off and in a last ditch effort one her death bed she tries to give you encouragement, feels like she was going to have more scenes where the suicide squad develop care for her in some odd way? The gameplay is fine but the loot is really underwhelming, I got 1 gun that I would say was unique from others which is the Bizarro set of guns, purely because it changes the reload function, the grenades have the best affects/effects, got one that sends the enemies up and freezes them for a bit, one that does some slot machine stuff etc. Don't spend £60 on it, if you wanna see the story just watch the cutscenes on youtube, maybe buy on sale if you like the look of the gameplay but don't get too excited about the loot because the guns are just bullet on fire, bullet that freezes etc",1707047793,1707058174,False,4,1,0.519663989543914795,0,True,False,False

The voice acting, cinematics, banter between characters, motion capture acting is all fantastic in this game. the time taken to implement the detail in to the world design is noticeable. 

The gameplay is fun and enjoyable. Traversal is great, takes some getting used to. Combat is quite good, open world npc combat is great. The missions / tasks in the story campaign are great so far (currently in chapter 3 @ 15 hrs in) I tend to take my time and play open world and side missions, no rush to speed run the main missions. That's how i play all games really.

The initial pre-order & deluxe cosmetic items were initially missing, but was resolved when i contacted WB Games Customer Support. (If you have this issue, make sure you enter your WB ID name & Hydra ID correctly)

I haven't experienced any glaring technical issues except the odd freezing during combat for a few seconds, i haven't attempted to play co-op and group up with others, so i don't know if there's any technical issues there. The low FPS was noticable initially, even on my RX 7900 XTX. I had to force full screen (alt+enter), enable Windows 8 compatibility while making the game run in Admin mode & Disable Full Screen Optimization, that got the FPS up a bit. Hopefully the next big patch optimizes the fps a bit more, but it's all playable on my end.

I quite enjoyed games like Cyberpunk 2077 and The Division 1 & 2. So this was really my cup of tea. Played Gotham Knights, didn't get too far, I may have to revisit that down the line.

In the end it's your choice if you want to play this game. Visually it's the opposite of the Arkham games, just the other side of the coin, set in the same universe, which i'm totally fine with.

Is it perfect? no, but it's very enjoyable. I haven't reached endgame yet so i'll have to update this review down the line. it's a good 7/10, maybe an 8/10 when all the launch woes are out of the way.",1707057989,1707057989,True,11,1,0.516036391258239746,0,True,False,False

An excellent looter shooter but weaker Arkham story carried by its cast with high quality cutscenes & motion capture. If you've played the division, destiny, and even games like borderlands prior to this one then you'll likely have a great experience here as well. 


Very player friendly in terms of end game grinding; you can target farm specific items, free player & weapon respec, materials for upgrades & raids/incursions are surprisingly easy to get but can feel repetitive solo as you can't multitask objectives like in co op.


The end game systems are surprisingly in depth but will become repetitive after some time. As it is a live service game built from the ground up, if the combat & traversal movement doesn't hook you, you're gonna have a worse time engaging with the games systems & mechanics as it is a looter shooter at the end of the day. 


[b]Some context [/b] 

This is a game with a plethora of well implemented mechanics that will no doubt be bombarded by those who dislike games as a service (GaaS) & online only games. Took 22 hrs to beat as a Harleen main hard mode with all side & main missions completed


[h3] Actual Review [/h3]

Throughout the entire campaign, you are slowly introduced to the game's several core mechanics that you'll need to utilize if you wish to clear the end game content at an efficient level such as:

[list]
    [*]Mastering traversal movement for survivability
    [*]Shield harvesting to regain shields
    [*]Applying statuses & debuffs to enemies
    [*]Understanding RPG itemization & build synergies (necessary if wanting to push highest difficulty content)
[/list]


Alongside core mechanics, there is a satisfying progression system for EACH character all with their own traversal movement & unique abilities complimented by three talent skill trees (unique for each character) allowing you focus on improving individual strength & weakness


The icing on the cake would be that each piece of equipment has 3 sometimes 4 slots for augments (buffs) while equipping 3/3 of an armor set will grant you it's bonus set adding an entirely new mechanic to work your build around.

Don't like the augments you got on a new weapon? You can respec and pick exactly what specific buff you want such as more damage to burning enemies or more firearm damage. 

Unfortunately, what doesn't change is the gunplay between each of the characters. Each character will parry enemies, regain shields & ammo and knock up enemies in the exact same way as each other.

While each character uses their own weapon types (Harley smg pistols, Deadshot sniper and ARs), they all have their own unique synergies within their talent trees granting special abilities & buffs to equipment differentiates each character significantly in my opinion. 

[h3] Story thoughts & Bosses (No Spoilers) [/h3]

If you're a casual enjoyer or just a fan who wants to focus on story, you'll enjoy how story driven the plot as there are 3 hours of cutscenes in this 20 hour game. Some of the jokes will hit and some of them just won't. 

Half the boss fights are just OK. People will complain about things like the flash not one-shotting everyone but if he did they'd just complain how the story lasted only 30 seconds. 


However, most bosses lack variety and just spam the same few abilities over and over. Though, some of the bosses did have a 2nd phase where they gained entirely new movesets which was immediately noticeable but not the case for every boss fight. Clearly, they invested their budget elsewhere.


Majority of side quests are worthwhile as they will give you upgrades towards core mechanics like improving your vehicle, unlocking new status effects for your grenades & weapons, and others will introduce you to various NPCs for upgrades. 

Not too many filler quests until you reach the end game. Ignore them and focus on incursions that'll instead raise your mastery level, loot tiers, gear sets, etc.


[h3] Final thoughts [/h3]

The game is built as a live service game from the ground up. The story presents itself as such with cosmetics to purchase, battlepasses with no expiration date & season 1 in March with new characters and content with more tiers added.

All-in-all, I came out with more than I expected as I truly believed this was going to be just another low-effort live service game from the industry mill but surprisingly this game has more depth to its systems & mechanics than you'd think. 

I think if you're a fan of looter shooters & itemization, there's a WHOLE lot of dopamine waiting for you as you build your main character seeing their damage numbers go up, mastering the traversal system, flying around the map getting clearing end game content and slowly improving your build over time.

For the people who don't like this because it's not Arkham 4.0: The Arkham series is feature- and story-complete. I would not want Rocksteady to be turned into another Call of Duty mine, where developers slave away on the next iteration of the exact same game.  By that logic Portal is bad because Valve just should've just made another Half-Life game in the early 2000s regardless of whether there's a creative spark behind that project or not. After the success of Half-Life 1 and 2 that's just what Valve should do now right? 
There are three games in the Arkham series that you can always go back to and enjoy, but personally I will always applaud studios for branching out into other fields. What I'm trying to say: This game is not bad BECAUSE it is not an Arkham game. It's a comparison between apples and oranges because they are a completely different genre of game and they should be compared to other games in their respective genres instead of to another.
Every studio should be allowed to make any game they want without getting a barrage of hate thrown in their faces. Demon Souls would not exist without From Software fiddling around in other genres after making like 10 Armored Core games.

About the actual game, there's really not that much to be said. It's a looter shooter with an extremely fun core-combat loop. It actually reminds me more of Doom Eternal than of other looter shooters with how many synergies you can create between different mechanics by equipping special items or picking specific perks in the talent tree. If you pay attention in the tutorial and you try to apply all that the game teaches you, there is a lot of fun to be had here. If you ignore everything and play the game like it's a third person cover shooter, you probably won't enjoy it as much. It's one of those game loops that gets progressively more fun the better you get at playing.

Regarding the criticism of repeating objectives, I'm not that sure which expectation of a looter shooter Rocksteady violated here. Was there really that much more to do in the launch state of Destiny 1/2, the Borderlands series, The Division 1/2, etc.? IMO, games with lots of loot have exactly one job: give me a good reason to kill more bad guys, and when the gameplay is this much fun, I really don't see the issue here. I was engaged all the way through and I have easily gotten my money's worth.

Since there is such an absurd amount of hate surrounding this game, I would make the suggestion of using Steam's refund policy and make up your own mind about the game.

game had one thing going for it at launch and that was everyone expected the worst as did i but i will say it surprised me.

Graphics are not great, but it's also made for consoles and I've never been a stickler for high end graphics. I would have preferred a longer story or if the story extended into the endgame grind, but maybe that will continue with season content. Hectic shooter game that I cannot suggest playing with a controller. I saw a gameranx video complaining about the Flash fight. I think they were playing with a controller so yeah, you're gonna be spinning around slowly all the time. Overall, it's a good game. Not amazing, not bad, just good. I look forward to seeing season content that they say will be free.
 It seems like this game didn't sell well and gets hate online because of all the stigma from the first trailer. Also, people are just disappointed that this game isn't essentially a sequel to the Arkham series. On top of that, you have the anti loot box/live service/gacha/PTW drones (that don't even know those mechanics are no in this game) and the anti woke chuds complaining about the one LGBTQ flag in the game. The game had months of people stewing with their poor preconceptions of the game and many comments I see online are made such that that either 1) don't know anything about comic books or 2) didn't want to play a game about the Suicide Squad and instead wanted to play as the heroes again. People say that the Flash could have killed them all instantly. Doomsday could have, and did, killed Superman. So why don't we all just make the game ""Doomsday kills everyone""? Comic books aren't about being realistic. Even given the context of the world in which they exist they are not realistic. Mxyzptlk could just unmake everything and it would be all over. If Darkseid could tap into the power of his true form (Godhead) he could wipe out the JLA, TFX and Brainiac. It would be boring to see everything happen the way it would realistically would happen. That's literally the point of Batman. He does the impossible. If you wanted to play Batman Arkham 4, then wait for that game. People make comparisons to Arkham Knight to Suicide Squad as if this is the same universe. If you really were a fan of the game, you would have known what happened at the end of Arkham Knight and know that this Suicide Squad game wouldn't make sense. This is a looter shooter. Get over it. They didn't make Arkham Knight 4.
I'm glad to see, at the time of this review, reviews are mostly positive. If you get past the fog that social media and online content put up that clouds people's judgement you can see that this game is decent. Again, not amazing, but good.",1707053312,1707053312,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't hate the way you take down any of the heroes in the Justice League, it's expected. And to be fair, they weren't the real ones, they were weakend and tainted by the main villian. 

Funny story, I chuckled several times over the humor and gameplay is addictive and fun with its varied movement and traversal skills. But it can get chaotic and messy really quick, which I feared by looking at the gameplay from pre-release videos. I wish they had more simple combat and less enemies to maybe make it more tactical. A lot of action is what they went for, do you gotta move all the time, to avoid getting hit, and to be able to hit the enemies.

But so far I feel underwhelmed with the loot (itemization) don't really notice the stats, don't notice the gameplay changing all that much, but I do see higher numbers! And assuming increasing the difficulty would reflect this change. But it leaves the rest of your team at low level, if you main one villian, which was my plan. But I have a couple of heroes that I like to level up as well. But for me Harley has the most difficult of movement skill, and therefor falls low on my list.

And I had done the bus-mission like 4 times in a row at one point, only a few hours in, so already then saw where the grind and repetitiveness could make you not like it. But it's like Warframe tbh. A set of mission types that you can select to grind. But I get new loot and can craft and change up items very often while leveling up. But I don't feel it's needed unless you're at endgame and want to min/max. Which I am right now, so I'm trying to find a build that I like, and then hone in what stats I need to go for. Which can also changed based on a few Notorious items. Notorious items are set-items based on a specific villian.

Skilltrees are also not trees in the proper sense, you can't get one pool of points, but get one row at a time. All rows uses 1 points, so more like WoW's new skill system, choose 1 out of 2 or 3. So there's builds, but not really deep and complex during leveling. But endgame also offers paragon-system, so you can continue to get stats as you level. I don't know if this is capped, some icons for damage reduction and damage done, seems to be open for leveling forever by the infinity symbol on them.

I do like the game, would recommend! For sure!!

Edit: Also for those thinking they did Batman and Kevin a bad one.. I like surprises, and I do like bad things. When a company dare to cross boundaries, that's respect imo. Go against the masses, that's.. Courage.",1706961188,1707052030,True,1,0,0.451127827167510986,6,True,False,False

It's so easy to sit there and rag on Suicide Squad just because that's what the games media hive mind has decided to do. 

I've had fun on this game so far. The combat is good, made better by the traversal mechanics which is easily the standout part of this game, and sets it a part from other looter shooter type games such as The Division. Because ultimately, that's what this game is. It's a Destiny / The Division style looter shooter wrapped up in a DC skin. You squad up with mates or go in with ally bots, run missions, hoard loot and repeat until you get powerful enough for end game content. The fact that people are pretending this is a failed single player narrative game is ridiculous. Perhaps if Rocksteady had not set this game in the Arkhamverse, that detachment from single player game to live service looter shooter would have been easier to stomach. 

I get that a live service looter shooter with a battle pass is probably the last thing anyone would imagine Rocksteady making, and I certainly did wish that their next game after the Arkham series was a single player narrative game, but here we are. The game is here, and it's actually not bad at all. My biggest criticism of the game is you get presented with a ""mission summary"" page after every single mission and it really breaks the flow of the game. The moment-to-moment combat is frenetic and energetic, and it kind of kills the vibe when you have to sit through a screen showing you what loot you got, what awards you got, your mission score etc. They should have just had this as a pop up on screen with a ""Hold this button to view your summary"" prompt instead. 

Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League can be frustrating at times, but if you look at it for what it is, there is absolutely fun to be had. How much fun is the question, because I don't see this game lasting the next 12 months, particularly after your generic YouTube / Twitter personalities have had their say. 

Pros:
-Traversal / combat
-Open world
-Characters & dialogue

I dig the fast paced combat, even though the traversal was kinda meh for some of the characters. It was still fun to roam around Metropolis and enjoy the design.

This game is still really good if you just look past the repetitive elements of the game, let's just hope that further updates and future contents bring much more to the game.

technically it looks very good but doesnt run too well not just performance but in generall the expierience   
i had to ask support to give me my preorder and digital deluxe edition items before launch at early access and once again after launch   when i then told them ""i still dont have my items..."" i sent them my acc url and they manually just gave me my stuff   so good on them for actually helping and im glad for that   
now game performance   ive had some issues like my 4080 r9 7950x combo being brought down to its knees during most combat scenes that being said graphically its very pretty and i do like the animation work and art style
 gameplay    run of the mill third person looter shooter     its good and very fun to me and my gf  we played and will continue playing it in coop 
main  issue is its mostly the same thing and every time you finish a 3minute long sequence you will be forced to accept loot and sit through some animations   its annoying and ruins the flow of just flying through the city and tearing aliens apart     you can tell they tried but made some questionable decisions 

now to the big issue    in a game called ""KILL THE JUSTICE LEAGUE"" youre going to do exactly that    dont act surprised
its more of a humorous take on the entire thing and i personally like it 


so i recommend this   if you still have doubt  wait for a sale but surely in coop its well worth the time   atleast it was for me

This shotty developed game that took almost a decade to produce is a senseless souless attempt at advertising to the original players of the arkham franchise giving little appreciation to the long running characters the game depicts, Its a Destiny ripoff of a game with no substance. The bossfights were unbalanced in their difficulty and respect for their deaths and the brainiacs bossfights are just rehashing of the original leagues where its not even the original brainiac and is over reliant on season passes to finish this dirivative story that repeats all of its missions. All i could say about it the team plays well with eachother in the lack luster story and played great when i was captain boomer, However harley in the arkham canon was just a boring woman plaing the victim against batman dispite all hes done for the series implimenting the modern harley instead of the arkham one dipicting the batman as a bully as a pathetic attempt to push her into the story.  

If they planned to make this game actually having some soul and care they would have added more story to this game actually telling the story's of the villains of the squad as they prepare and grow their skill have missions that tell aspects of the superheros story growing themselves more attach to their arch rivals making them conflicted with the actions they have to do to save the world while also giving the squad inspiration to carry forward with their fight. with this they could give more attachments to the characters like lex and robin getting killed as you interact with them in the story while also telling the story of Harley redemption against the feelings she had over the jokers death and growing past him and gaining respect for batman creating more tension and giving the audience accepting Harley for what she has to do feeling the same emotions as we do in the game. On top of all of that the point of multiversal story telling is always a bad choice giving less stakes for the potential of getting the justic league back or adding in side characters that wouldnt be needed if they added the characters into the game who they screwed over in the game.


Overall Dont buy this game its not satisfying, boring and a bastardisation of the arkham games and play the original arkham games. If you intent to play with friends understandable but if you play this game in single player youll realise that the story drags on until you dont want to play another dc game again.

When I switch characters, I don't feel like I'm playing the same character with the same guns, I have the choice to decide what guns my characters use, how they are played, etc. It also helps that in some missions, there's situations in which a specific character would be best for completing it, encouraging switching characters and leveling them up!

I haven't finished the game at the time of posting this, but I would recommend this game to those that are fans of open world combat, superhero games, run and gun, or is just looking for a game to pass the time!

Well if you enjoyed Marvel's Avengers game like I did then for you this is like Marvel's Avenger's 2.0+ Yes that's right! It has so many various implementations in this game that we wanted in Marvel's Avengers!

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op action-adventure game where you play as Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, who are tasked with taking down the corrupted Justice League. To best enjoy the game on PC, you should follow these tips:

Choose the right character for your play style. Each character has unique abilities, weapons, and personalities that suit different situations and preferences. For example, Harley Quinn is agile and uses a baseball bat and a grappling hook, while Deadshot is a sniper and can fly with a jet-pack.

Experiment with different combinations of characters and skills. The game allows you to switch between characters at any time, or play with up to three friends online. You can also upgrade your skills and customise your appearance as you progress through the game.

Explore the open-world of Metropolis. The game features a large and detailed city that you can traverse using your character’s mobility options, such as swinging, flying, or running. You can also find hidden collectables, side missions, and Easter eggs that add to the game’s lore and humour.

Engage in dynamic and chaotic combat. The game offers a variety of enemies, from brainwashed civilians and soldiers, to super villains and superheroes. You can use your character’s abilities, weapons, and gadgets to fight them, as well as interact with the environment and cause destruction. You can also perform combo attacks and special moves with your teammates for extra damage and fun.

Have fun and don’t take the game too seriously.

The game is meant to be a humorous and irreverent take on the DC universe, where you play as the bad guys and mock the good guys. The game is full of jokes, references, and fourth-wall breaking moments that make it entertaining and enjoyable.

Superb graphics, sound, voice-acting, and audio comprise a true AAA game experience as one might expect, while the gameplay is loads of fun. It's clear that they spent a ton of time on traversal and combat and it makes these crucial aspects of gameplay addictive and enjoyable.

The characters are all very well portrayed and interpreted here and the storyline is as cool as anything that's ever happened in the comic books, too.  Very well done.

No bugs for me at all nor slowdowns or graphical presentation issues, either.  My system isn't quite top-tier but it's definitely a top 90% PC build, so I can't speak to performance like someone with a less potent system could.  But as is always the case with PC gaming, you have to know (and/or learn) how to adjust your settings to pair with your hardware - far too many PC gamers complain about performance issues without having a single clue how to tweak their game's setting for maximum efficacy.  Then they blame the game or the developers for making a poorly optimized game when the reality is simply that they're to blame for not knowing how to manage their PC. SMH

In some ways that reminds me of Gotham Knights, which invariably comes to mind as I'm playing this game.  Gotham Knights also took a beating early on in its release for a buggy launch but the core gameplay and AAA graphics and sound still made it an excellent game, one that's highly and stupidly under-rated. Suicide Squad is facing some of that type of angst already despite being a very high-quality title. 

This is definitely a must-buy game for fans of superhero gaming, DC Comics, or just really fun action/combat style 3rd-person games.  Fully recommend.",1707037316,1707037316,True,5,0,0.475754588842391968,0,True,False,False

Its really fun, humerous, charming, and great with friends even if its story and some gameplay elements are not the greatest.

 However, the people saying that this game ""is just a quick cash grab"", ""disrespects Kevin Conroy (RIP)"", and ""ruins Arkham Batman and his verse"", are completely wrong and are not true fans of the previous games. Sure, the game is not perfect but that does not mean that time and effort were not put into this game. I mean all DLC besides COSMETICS are FREE. Combine this with the fact that the developers have a long road map where they will add new missions, maps, and characters to play, and you have dedicated developers and not money hungry scammers. 

Also story wise, its fine. Sure, it has its fair share of questionable choices and is not better than the other Arkham Games but that doesn't make it bad on its own. In fact the addition of a lot of new characters, fun locations, and a meaningful way of telling all of it, and you will find that the story is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.

Also this game can be played up with 4 friends who I can tell you first hand will have a great time.

Bottom line, if you played the previous games, you will enjoy aspects of this one. Sure, this games has its flaws and its story is not the best, but it still is a fun time that you can revisit time and time again, maybe not for full price.

Cut scenes do have cringy jokes, however they get a chuckle out of me. 

Everything is up to your preference, you like the Arkham fit, it's yours, like the normal outfits? Its yours. Wanna lower aim assist or turn it off? Done.

I disagree with all the bad you've heard about this game. Rocksteady has given us a well-written, well-acted evolution of the Arkham formula. The slower pacing of Batman's stories has been replaced with a Doom 2016 style of constant offense to move through each encounter, and I think it's really enjoyable to see how the studio has developed over time.

Rocksteady delivered a very fun, sometimes challenging, well-told story. The only negative outside the typical complaints about GaaS is that the UI can be a little too much at times. Luckily, the menus allow for a great deal of turning off the UI.

Not a perfect game, but one worth the asking price. Looking forward to Joker's debut and how Season 1 pushes the game forward.",1707029506,1707029506,True,4,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Interesting, there were a lot of talk about digits and stuff, but I kinda like it. Maybe it's cause I used to play Diablo 3, which is colorful and displays digits as well (they're small, but still).

The jokes, references and awesome interaction between the main characters, their reaction to the world, love it.

I'm on the first missions, we'll see what's next.

Also, out of all 16GB RAM, the game takes 10-11GB and already frozen to death and the starting of the game is super laggy. I guess, I have to upgrade my PC now...

This game is great. The mechanics are pretty fluid, and all in all it's quality gameplay you'd expect from Rocksteady.

To start: This game is literally titled [i]Kill The Justice League[/i], and so many saltines out here complaining because you play a team of psychos whoa re out to kill superheroes. I am not completely finished, but I think it is pretty damn good. I don't usually review games, but the amount of people ""Lets review bomb this so they change it"" is stupid high. It's a good game and people are letting other people's opinions flavor it even when none of them have actually played it. I wish I was kidding but I've seen an account on Tiktok that rebranded to ""Gotham's Savior"" and has been just posting video after video complaining and he hasn't even played the game. The controversy of this game is people saw some things online out of context and evaluated a game they haven't played based on it, and they need to grow up.

Now, to get into the story. Is it perfect? Nah, of course not. But unsure of any way to improve it without making the game a Justice League game and not Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. All of the complaints I've seen are completely unfounded. I've seen ""It's disrespectful to the Justice League!"" but when you ask how the complaint ignores the premise of the game. So many people want this game to be Justice League vs, The Suicide Squad where the Suicide Squad works to save the JL and redeem them. THAT IS LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE REASON TASK FORCE X EXISTS. These aren't good people doing a tough job, it's a group who wants these superheroes dead on a good day, let alone when the Heroes are murdering people. I get it, you wanted them to let you know what the JL was doing as you were hunting them, but that's never been how these games work. You don't get cut scenes where it fills you in on the bad guys plan, without the PCs knowing.

Another complaint is ""It was disrespectful to Conroy"" Just shut up, He was a grown man with more experience as Batman than you'll ever read about. He turned down other Batman projects throughout his life when he didn't like them. If this is your complaint you just want to hate it because it wasn't Arkham 5, running around as Batman hunting clues.

""It's badly written"" Yet when asked, no one can explain how the writing is bad, or point to actual examples of bad writing or just say ""it retcons the movie"" you know how many game franchises retcon shit? Halo:Reach is one giant lore breaking retcon, but people out here act like it was from god, despite how poor of a game it was. Saltines just don't like that the story didn't magically conform to what they wanted to happen. Sorry Rocksteady didn't call you before they approved the story.

""Harley isn't the same"" but when you ask how salt farmers reply, ""IDK she just felt different"" You mean an abused and manipulated person didn't behave like the Joker was actively next to them abusing them, and then went through years of institutionalized therapy and now they don't behave like a vapid murder robot hell bent on impressing their abuser? ""She acts like they just broke up or something"" Have you ever met a survivor of trauma and abuse who is now years removed from it? Like do you even know anything about Harley Quinn? This is very true to her character post Joker obsession. Why would she bring up her trauma? People try to move past their trauma, not obsess over it til they die. It's like salties have never met a real person before.

""Deadshot was white before"" Get over it. it literally changes nothing but his skin tone and his voice. 

[spoiler] The way they kill batman was badly written [/spoiler] How should a black ops team of people recruited out of an asylum handle that? Should they have organized a parade? Called for a trial in front of a judge? Gave speeches? No. They acted quick and efficiently while in enemy territory of a warzone with alien invaders. Sometimes life doesn't end up how you want it to, and other times Waller puts a bomb in your spine and extorts you to kill Earths Greatest heroes, who have repeatedly broken your bones and thrown you in prison.",1707023112,1707023112,True,5,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Before I talk about the things I hate, I will be fair and comment on what I did enjoy about this game. This does game has it's moments, I'll be honest. Decent humor, acting, good cinematography, a decent soundtrack, and fairly fun gameplay, aren't completely scarce. If you are looking for a mindless looter-shooter, go ahead and buy this game. I strongly suggest waiting for a sale. This game is not worth 70 dollars under any circumstances. 

However. that's about all it's good for. Everything else, mostly the story, is completely disrespectful to the rest of the Arkham franchise. The narrative is a complete mess. Why bother having complex and unique superheros turn evil when they all can be defeated by the same amount of bullets? the only bossfight that actually felt somewhat engaging was Batman's. The others? Borderline inseparable and boring. I suppose it doesn't matter considering my screen was filled to the brim with blinding prompts, HUD indications, and number vomit 75% of the time. 

Die-hard Arkham fans- actually no, ANY Arkham fans, I once again, do not recommend buying this game for 70 dollars. It takes the meaningful ending to Arkham Knight and shatters it.

The story is a typical DC Animated movie and that is a GREAT thing. Lots of great lines, just spookily good character animations. Harley and Boomerang's faces in particular. 

Cons include small enemy variety and the combat all occurs in the overworld. There are inside encounters but it is all about outside. I can see how the stealth part of the Rocksteady loop just does not work here.

Rocksteady has built the foundation for an event driven live service and the core game is worth buying in my opinion, but it remains to be seen if Rocksteady can make Live Service engaging. They will need new missions as well as new characters.

Video games are meant to be fun, and this game does that and a whole lot more. I do have some gripes with it, but let me sum it up:

[h3] Pros [/h3]
[list]
    [*] Beautiful cutscenes with great writing and even better animation
    [*] A deep and addicting combat system for a third-person shooter
    [*] A good amount of content and detail, that will only grow as the game lives on
[/list]
[h3] Cons: [/h3]
[list]
    [*] A short story. Yes it's live service, but 8-10 hours is laughable for $70.
    [*] Not a ton of enemy or mission variety. Again, it's live service, so I hope they can patch this in.
    [*] TERRIBLE skin pricing. $10 for a skin, then tiers of that skin going up to $25??? There is no reason to do this in a $70 game  AND not allow for some sort of combining parts of different skins to get a unique look.
[/list]

I think if you're a fan of the universe, and want to hop into this game early-on, then it's worth a buy. If you're not too stoked about certain things in the game, I would wait for a sale of some sort for performance improvements, more content, and hopefully improvements to the store. And lastly, if you're a passionate hater of live-service (or an Arkham fanboy) and just want to see this game fail, then don't buy the game and call it a day. Some people will find this game fun, and the internet has done enough damage to this game to invalidate the fun people are currently having. I like this game, and I hope it does well.

The game is overall decent and feels nice at times the graphics are great the traversal is alright.

Superman, flash, wonder woman, green lantern in the arkham verse have never been seen before just for them to die instantly. knowing what arkham batman has been through theres no way he couldnt break out of a little bit of mind control and help the justice league break free from it.

Marketed as a high-stakes superhero extravaganza, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League eventually fails, leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouths of both gamers and die-hard DC fans. Any potential enjoyment is overshadowed by the combination of terrible gameplay, a dull story, and a dubious treatment of Batman's character journey. However, the thing that hurts the most is the knowledge that this is Kevin Conroy's last appearance as the recognizable voice of Batman, and it's a terribly misguided farewell.

Let us begin with the fundamentals: the gaming. It's a depressing mess that falls short of being the exciting, action-packed experience that was promised. The praised squad dynamics feel more like an unneeded burden than a novel innovation, and the controls are awkward. The fighting isn't as smooth and sophisticated as one might expect from a game in this genre; it has repeated scenes that get old faster than you can say ""Gotham City.""

The story, which is touted as the highlight, is a forgettable jumble of drab happenings. The narrative is shallow, and attempts at humor are frequently unsuccessful. Character arcs are flimsy attempts at evoking strong feelings in gamers who are immersed in DC mythology, and they fall flat. A cliched plot that undervalues the excellent source material ruins the possibility of an engrossing story.

Perhaps the most grievous misstep in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is the handling of Batman, voiced by the legendary Kevin Conroy. As the final chapter for Conroy's portrayal of the Dark Knight, one would expect a fitting send-off, a poignant moment to honor the years of dedication he brought to the character. Instead, the narrative takes a bizarre turn, betraying the essence of Batman and leaving Conroy's iconic voice attached to a character arc that feels like a slap in the face to fans.

Without delving too deep into spoilers, Batman's role in the story is a departure from the character's core principles, and it's a narrative decision that does no justice to Kevin Conroy's incredible legacy. The mishandling of this farewell leaves a sour taste, tarnishing what should have been a momentous occasion for both the actor and the fans who have followed his remarkable journey as Batman.

At the end of the day, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a depressing end to Kevin Conroy's Batman career as well as a disappointment for gamers. This game is a terrible disgrace to the memory of one of the most recognizable characters in gaming because of its unimpressive gameplay, dreary narration, and careless handling of a great voice actor's farewell performance.",1707009093,1707009093,False,9,0,0.499470233917236328,1,True,False,False

I really wanted to give this game a positive review, for what it's worth it is an enjoyable game. No, it's not the Arkham games; but if you're able to look past that there is some interesting stuff at play.

The servers are not one of those things. Every time you close the game you run the risk of losing your save data, because on no platform is that housed locally. Every platform has had mass complaints of this happening, resulting in hours of data/levels/costumes lost. 
The costumes/store is one of the most horrendous I've seen in a game (and that's including F2P) just to finish the pre-order costume sets would've been (and I HOPE I'm misunderstanding) $20 PER CHARACTER. They neglect to tell you that ""costume packs"" have tiers, legendary being the highest at 2,400 coins.
The game itself is fine, but these are some of the most malicious microtransactions I've ever seen for ""not a live service"" game. It ran fairly smoothly, but had a lot of stutters, mostly due to it switching between ultrawide and standard every cutscene and when enemies spawned in large numbers. 

((Tl:Dr:))
The traversal is fun and fits the characters surprisingly well, I found it more enjoyable playing with controller though. The graphics are great and the character models are some of the best I've seen in a game, but I don't think that's enough to outweigh the asking price and reality of this game. 
If it was going for all this micro transaction stuff, it should've been priced much lower from the start, so I'd at least wait on a sale and maybe the offline update before throwing yourself into it.",1707007251,1707007251,False,55,7,0.610837996006011963,0,True,False,False

Firstly, this is not an Arkham game and was never advertised as such, so it is unfair to review it as such and compare it to those games.  Developers can experiment with different genres without having to consistently get a 10/10 game.  As far as looter shooters go, I'm having a great time with Suicide Squad.  Think of a blend between Outriders and Borderlands.

Pros:
- Once you get a few hours in the build variety for the different characters do start to make them feel different to one another.  AS well as the traversal abilities which all affect what you can do in combat in different ways.
- The loot is not so overwhelming that you are constantly changing weapon every 5 seconds and having to change your build too often, however this is also a con (see below).
- Some really entertaining boss fights and a decent story with a lot of humour and the characters really hit the mark for me.
- Graphics are really nice and the game runs well.  I also experienced very few glitches, only two resets required in 17 hours of playtime.

Cons: 
- The loot during the story was underwhelming to the point I only changed my weapons a couple of times as they were powerful enough to see me through the game.  Time will tell if the endgame will provide better loot to really theorycraft some different builds.
- The enemy variety is on the lower side, although I still find the combat fun, I can see it getting repetitive unless they introduce new enemy variety and objectives in future seasons.

Ultimately I've had a blast with this game and I think it is being bombarded with hate it doesn't deserve as it delivers as a looter shooter that you can play with friends.",1707006872,1707006872,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game feel is wonderful.  Traversal and combat are both well designed and fun.  Enemies are mostly good, cutscenes, voice acting, art design, graphics, all of this stuff is great.

So why is Suicide Squad such a bad game?  Because while most of the pieces of a great game are here the bones that hold them all together are not.  Leaving Suicide Squad a flaccid mess.

I would say level design is bad but this would be misleading.  There are no levels in SS.  There is one open world map that you won't even look at because that great traversal means you spend the entire game flying over the city rather than experiencing it.

I would say the mission design is bad but that too would be misleading.  There are no story missions in Suicide Squad.  Instead you have open world public events.  Suicide Squad is what Destiny 2 would be if the game was only public events on the patrol maps.  Except, of course, there is only one map.

I would say the boss fights are disappointing but that would imply a bunch of boss fights when there are actually 4.

There are about FIVE total mission types.  Defend a point, escort a thing, kill a bunch of things, and rescue things.  This is the entire game, no exageration the ENTIRE game.

Cutscenes are amazing but in a game this bereft of interesting things to do you will eventually resent the fact that 4 hours of your time is spent in cutscenes for a story that doesn't even have the decency to END.  Instead nothing happens and nothing matters.

The game CONSTANTLY Locks you in place until you listen to 35 seconds of comms chatter.  Can't jump, can't do anything but spin slowly in a circle.  Loot is absurdly boring for the majority of the game.  I used the same weapon I got in the second mission until the end. Why even HAVE loot if this is the case?  Oh...right...because a live service game needs loot.

This game is more disappointing than even Anthem because Anthem was doomed and flawed to its core.  It had nothing but flying.  Suicide Squad has everything needed to be a fantastic game but throws it all away into a bland pointless open world with none of the greatness of the games its aping.  It's borderlands except you use the second gun you get for the whole game.  It's Destiny but with one enemy faction and nothing outside of public events, it's the division but with none of the actual indoor story missions, it's Warframe with ONE class and no procedural generation.

It's a mess of a game that would be a complete catastrophe if not for the talent and brilliance of these developers, who are unlucky enough to be so great the game ISN'T a total disaster therefore meaning they'll need to waste another 18 months supporting a mistake.

General feeling: This is a looter shooter heavily inspired by Borderlands. Not a bad thing if you like looters, I do like looters so that will inform my opinions.

Pros:

-fun traversal
-fun combat (takes a bit to figure out)
-stunning graphics
-loot feels fun
-amazing voice acting

Mid

-story is just ok so far
-some mechanics don't feel great (reload, counter shot)
-ui confusing at first

Cons

-Multiplayer is jank out of the gate (don't bother until you're suited up and in the open world)
-Bugs (not terrible but comparable to most AAA day 1 releases)
-If you don't like looters this is likely not for you.
-1 enemy faction, a big miss for me, hopefully we see more in the future cause it'll get boring for sure.

I really don't give a sh*t about the us vs them rhetoric surrounding this game, this is my honest opinion and if I didn't like it I'd simply stop playing, I haven't stopped playing yet and I'm having lots of fun.  That being said the opening 90 mins was quite buggy (due to multiplayer) and if I was to give any advice it would to say DONT DO MULTIPLAYER UNTIL YOURE IN THE OPEN WORLD.

Gameplay:
Honestly the best part of the game, the moment to moment gunplay in battles feels amazing. Every character handles very differently even though they use mostly the same weapons, because of their travel abilities, the game gets VERY hectic on higher difficulties and you have to constantly on the move. Guns feel good and punchy, abilities feel really cool when they oblitiriate a group of grunts and the overall gameplay feels really unique with all the arcadey effects going on. I can't think of a game that feels quite like this.

Loot:
The loot has some really interestign aspects here, first of all there are no level requirements or gear level, if you find a legendary gun in hour 1, it can still be used pretty much as well in hour 40. Speaking of legendary effects, many of them really feel like you could make a build just around them, the effects are interesting and you unlock more legos when you go up in difficulty tiers.

Story:
The main story was there, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Best part of the writing was all of the banter going on, and multiple long running jokes from the start to the end. I was almost constantly smiling listening to the characters talking, but it also wasn't a story just about jokes, i found them to be mixed in really well.

Endgame: I'm still going through the endgame after leveling all launch classes to max level. The loop seems to be: Do short missions in open world to get currency, and use the currency to open a map into a 5-10 minute missions with loads of enemies and good loot. This is where the repetetion comes in, i have 4 missions unlocked, and they are always same ones, only with some different modifiers depending on RNG and difficulty setting.

Final thoughts:
I like the game, but i understand a lot of the critisism for it too, some of it is really blown out of proportion, but there is really fair critisism going on too. I wouldn't give it a 5/10, maybe 6 or 6.5 currently. Its really fun, but i don't think there is currently enough content to go around. We'll see how the first season does. I hope that the game survives for a long time and becomes better with age, but we will see what the future brings.",1706999498,1706999498,True,200,12,0.677224040031433105,9,True,False,False

I think the main problem this game is facing is ""live service bias"". People wanted this game to be another Arkham-like game and its not that and isn't trying to be that. This is a live-service game. 

Pros

-Really great and fluid combat. The combat is snappy the effects and abilities look and feel great. Mix that in with the traversal system you can pull of some really appealing combos.

-Story is good. IMO the voice acting was good and cut scenes were terrific. Now for the die hard comic people you may feel different. However if your a super hero casual you should find enjoyment out of this. Characters banter between on another and to me a lot of the dialogue is funny.

-The world is very well built. Its nice to finally play in a metropolis setting. Lots of spacing and verticality to take advantage of each characters unique traversal mechanics

-The loot. This is probably the most important aspect to nail in a looter shooter. The loot feels perfectly fine IMO thus far. I haven't had any issues acquiring anything from common all the way to legendary or the ""notorious"" which seems to be the rarest type of items. Like many other looters you can craft, re roll stats, etc, to try and min/max your weapons.  

-Character progression is middle of the road. I wouldn't say its great nor bad. Each character has 3 skill trees, but your limited to how you can spec your character. Its not a free flowing system where you can put talent points wherever and however you want. Instead you have to spread your talent points across all 3 skill trees per each level. Meaning you cant specialize in just one skill tree. 


Cons

-Mission design. This is where the game suffers the most. So far the game has about 5-6 mission types that you'll be running throughout your time playing. Most include (Kill ""x"" amount of enemies), (collect & return), (Defend objective), and things like that. On certain missions objectives will be augmented such as ""enemies can only take damage from grenades"" or something like that. 

This was a missed opportunity for the game i really hoped they'd have more thoughtful mission design. Maybe something like the division or destiny where you actually have dungeons or something similar to that where mechanics are involved. 

-Performance is suspect.... sometimes the game is running perfectly and sometimes i get frame drops stuttering, etc. When i first purchased the game kept crashing when i tried to launch it. So keep that in mind. 

-Character diversity. Moment to moment gameplay all the characters do the same thing. Mechanically none of them are different from one another. I felt the biggest difference was maybe the traversal mechanic. It may come down to your choice of primary weapon you prefer. You like Snipers? You prefer heavy Gatling guns, or do you want to use handguns?


Overall 

I think this is a fine game. Is it perfect? No. But i think there's enough here to build off of. If you like live service games this may be for you. If you came to this game looking for the next Arkham Trilogy follow-up this is not it and you will  be disappointed.

My thoughts so far (played 10h and still in chapter 2):
- Cutscenes and writting are good, really well done.
- Facial animations are really impressive, especially in cutscenes. 
- Graphics are also good - not the best, but everything looks sharp.
- Combat and movement is extremely fun! The fluidity of the characters is what does it for me. 
- City design is well done, although you spend most of your time blazing through it with the traversal.
- Not much enemy variants at the moment.
- Enemy density is a bit low in the beginning, but now its starting to pick up. 

Overall, pretty fun.

Don't get me wrong this game can be fun to play with friends, but it's a game built around grinding for gear with a ""story"" as an after thought. I've never played any of the Arkham games so I can't speak on that front but from what I've read in the comments and elsewhere, this game does not do those games justice (no pun intended). Combat can be fun but it seems to be geared around multiplayer and, being a live service game, Rocksteady has hedged all of their bets on players sticking around just to grind for gear with no other motive. If you just want to grind gear endlessly and don't want to play Destiny 2, I guess this is a fit, but for myself it's just not fun. I haven't run into any serious bugs or glitches so at least it's stable at launch but the traversal mechanics are...a choice to say the least. That could be a skill issue on my part but I don't think getting from point A to point B should be more challenging than combat. 

TLDR: If you want a story, don't bother. If you want to mindlessly dump hours into a game for the sake of grinding for better gear so that you can then grind for better gear, this is the game for you. I still do not recommend because it's just a cash grab imo.

I'm also not a fan of the Batman Arkham games so I don't have an opinion on if it was a good end for Batman or not but it did make sense in the game because Batman is just a small side character in it. I'm assuming if you really like the Arkham games you're not going to like what happens to Batman and if you're not a fan of looter shooters with lots of end game grinding then you're probably not going to like this game. Side note I wouldn't recommend not watching any of the cutscenes out of contacts because most of them are long-term story plots or have callback jokes that don't really make sense. I also seen a lot of people complaining that the suicide squad could never beat the Justice League but I can assure you that the suicide squad does work very hard throughout the game in order to overcome the power difference as well as getting lots of help from allies while also failing a bunch and then learning from their mistakes.",1706994670,1706994670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cannot believe they actually let this become a game, the repetitiveness is god awful, did we learn nothing from the avengers game???? NO ONE WANTS THESE KINDS OF GAMES, even people that DO like these kinds of games are even saying this is garbage.

This game is void of any and all love that the arkham series used to bring to the table, character development?? Not anymore, mainly because all these characters are already pretty well established in there own ways (except maybe king shark who doesn't have enough representation in the dc world)
But there doesn't feel like enough significance is there when you DO kill almost ANY of the JL.. except for one.. BATMAN!!
The way you kill batman in this is the most disrespectful, disgraceful, and utter nonsense ways they could've EVER killed him.
THEY SAT HIS ASS ON A BENCH AND JUST TALKED SHIT AND SHOT HIM IN THE FUCKIN FACE!!
Batman would've never been killed by any of these goobers, not even as a team.

I REALLY enjoy the entire game, I think the story is pretty good for what they were going for, the only let down is not having a fight with batman, but, fan theory is that is because of Kevin's untimely passing. It definitely seemed like they were setting him up for a big fight, but had to skimp due to real life circumstances.

I find the combat really fun, the movement feels great, especially Boomerang or Dead-shot. Harley and King shark were fine, but lacked the overall vertacality that the other two have, which makes playing them solo a tad more tedious.

And, although mostly positive, I think the mission selection IS pretty bad, but the fact they are planning updates, at the moment I am remaining hopeful that they add different types. 

End game content - even though there is ""technically"" an endgame, they probably should've left it alone until the first season, as it essentially teases whats to come, instead of being its own thing. You have, again, a small selection of missions. You have 3 where its exactly the same as the story mission, a ""survival mode"" and fighting the final boss, on scaling world difficulties. The most tedious part about these is that you have to do all 3 in a circle to level up your ""mastery"" which (makes sense) but is super tedious. especially since you have to travel to them over and over and over. The modifiers felt a little underwhelming, cause once I understood you cant melee them with the boom, they essentially became stupid easy, even on Mastery 32 (out of 50).

Overall, and long story short, I think this game actually has GREAT bones. I think they did a ingenious thing by introducing the multiverse as that leads to limitless possibilities. While being a live service game inst my favorite, it essentially means that, as long as they can profit (which is my main concern at the moment), the game will continue to improve. 

LAST THING AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT - While I personally have been having a blast, other peoples reviews DO HOLD GROUND. I will leave it on... maybe you should wait until march, when the first season starts, to buy the game as that will determine the longevity/playablity of this game.

(TLDR: Most, but not all, of the bad stuff about the game is slander or misrepresentation. It is a very good parkour-oriented looter shooter designed specifically to solve 90% of the issues with predatory looter shooter monetization, so unless you have the impulse control of a chipmunk, you will not be asked or forced to spend a dime beyond the price of the game, unless you want more outfits than the base game provides. It is fun to play, and is occasionally funny to take in.)

Does it have awful graphics?
No, it has better graphics than Arkham Knight, but it also has weather cycles and a day/night cycle, so Epic Cinematic Shots Of Rainstorms In The Night don't make up 200% of your playtime. However, should you find yourself in those, you will get everything you saw in Arkham Knight, but with DLSS and RTX included.

Does it have ""9 hours of playtime""?
No, that's likely if you ignore anything but the core story missions and speedrun them. For reference, doing the same to Arkham City would make you end up with 6 or 7 hours, Arkham Asylum around 8 hours. Anyone who has ever played Arkham City knows that this is the wrong way to play Arkham games.

Does it, in fact, let you kill the Justice League?
Yes, it does. No, your mileage may vary regarding how it goes down.

Wait, does it or does it not suck?
Again, your mileage may vary. The story and character work see-saws from being on par with some of Rocksteady's best to something you'd think came out of a cracky fan fiction challenge on Reddit. On average, it is no more offensive to the comic canon nitpicker than the James Gunn Suicide Squad movie (you'll note it comes up a lot in relation to this game, it feels like WB higher-up specifically told the devs to aim for it as some sort of golden standard, but keep as much from the Ayer one as they could, which leads us to...)

But what about black Deadshot?
The characters INSIDE the game discuss the topic at lengths comparable to the main plot. The game acknowledges your confusion and rolls around in it, gurgling happily.

Should you play this game?
If you liked the Arkham games, if you liked the James Gunn Suicide Squad movie, if you ever enjoyed one or more of the following: Crackdown, Destiny, Borderlands, Saints Row (particularly 4), you might be able to find something to enjoy.

The gameplay is fun and I still find myself discovering new ways to fight which always makes a game feel fresh. The story is a lot better than I imagine it would be and there's lots of laughs. 
I think the main issue in this game is setting it in the Arkhamverse, had this just been a different universe people would love it, but building it on the back of Arkham meant people (including myself) went in with too much bias. It was a silly mistake, but it can't be undone and the negative press will likely kill the game. 
I hope not, as I can't wait to see what they do in future content and I want Rocksteady to be able to put as much into this game as they want, not what the market dictates.

In short, if you can't stand the idea of a game that changes Arkham Batman's story, don't play it.
But if you like Batman or DC in general, I'd recommend it. We don't get many DC games, let's not cause them to stop making them all together.",1706983691,1706983691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The optimization on release is SO bad.. the fps is absolutely awful and every single graphics setting will not fix it.. I just wanna enjoy the game without it only being a stable 36 fps! The worst part is there are micro transactions in this 70 DOLLAR game. With the option to spend 100 DOLLARS for some random items that are not even worth it.. Why do I have to continue spending money to get all the content even though I payed full price and extra??! I love rocksteady with my life because the arkham series was absolutely amazing. I love that we get to play as multiple characters in this game that is my favorite and what brought me in. But this is completely different than what everyone was expecting.. This game runs worse that gotham knights and this game works alot like gotham knights! With the elements and upgrades with the weapons and gadgets. Not like the normal upgrading like in the arkham games where it was kept minimal and not the whole entire game. But this game has ALOT of upgrades. I like the skill tree's abilities with the flashy effects and stuff because It adds alot of style to the combat and I enjoy that. This game can definitely better and rocksteady can do better. I love them so much and everyone was right that another arkham game would of been the best choice. But I do love playing as harley so maybe this was good enough?

Literally delete this game its a shitpost now like you cannot be serious.. the arkham series literally ends with the whole justice league dying and batman being a hardcore murderer???

***THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS***

Let me begin this review with what little good this game has to offer since that list is shorter:

- The first encounter with Batman: it's just really cool to be on the other side for once and be the prey to the Batman.

-King Shark: not exactly a ""good"" character per se, but more of all of his dialogue was so bad it's good. Every word out of his mouth was hilarious. For the other members of the team, dialogue was just bad.

- Shark Lantern: even this was a wasted opportunity and clearly only exists for spectacle. I hesitate to even call it something good from the game because of how it's immediately undone and doesn't matter. After defeating the Green Lantern, King Sharks puts on his ring and creates a gigantic, green shark to attack Brainiac's ship. It's a genuinely cool experience until you think about it.
First off, it is immediately undone because King Shark with his new lantern power betrays the others by turning the shark against them, and of course they're saved at the last second by them removing his ring. The ring then falls into the water never to be seen again.
Secondly, this is such a huge missed opportunity. There could've been a much better sense of progression if every character somehow gained a power to compliment the JL in the mid to late game especially since these people are expected to fight Superman. Or just don't tease us with that scene at all.

-Not as buggy as your average modern game upon release. This is not saying much at all, there are still bugs, but there are surprisingly not nearly as many as you would expect seeing as how lazy the entire industry is. Not many game breaking bugs either.

Now that's out of the way let's get into the problems.

-The UI. This game is ADHD incarnate. There is way too much going on at all times to the point where at any given point you will likely not know anything that's going on. Furthermore, the UI isn't even unique. It just looks identical to every single AAA game released since 2020.

-The gameplay. To be fair, this does depend heavily on what character you play as, and it can be subjective. Overall it's fine. That's it. Nothing unique (a common theme with this game) or groundbreaking at all it's just fine. In my experience, King Shark was the best one to play as, but even that was a bland experience. Harley just felt like Batman, Deadshot is literally identical to Fortnite, and Boomerang was really bad.

-The story. Seriously, who wrote this? This might be the worst part of the entire game, I think I would be able to get past everything else if the story was written well but it just isn't. As stated before, dialogue is awful. If you've ever seen a Marvel movie, just imagine that. There is very little character development whatsoever, and while there are real scenes that try to be emotional most of them are either ruined by some Marvel tier joke or don't even work to begin with because of the terrible writing from the rest of the game. The only character who had an iota of an arc was Wonder Woman, and it really felt like this should've been a WW game because of it. Too bad she died before that arc could even finish.

-The boss fights/ending. These are members of the Justice League. The Flash and Green Lantern fights were fine, but it felt weird that Batman and Superman went down just like that. It felt out of character for them, but this could be from years of only knowing these two as being basically invincible.
But then there's the Brainiac fight, which is just a reskin of the Flash fight.

Also there are 13 of them. Only one is needed to beat the game but you don't even get the one from the correct universe. Oh yea the multiverse is here too because of course it is. Of course the only reason for this is to artificially inflate gameplay hours to make the game look good. Have fun spending however long it takes to fight 12 more Brainiacs.

And that's it. The game just ends and leaves you with 12 more Brainiacs including the one who attacked your Earth initially. There is no real conclusion to this. The game is just slop designed to keep you playing with no real artistic value whatsoever. This is not worth $70.",1706982439,1706982439,False,160,1,0.666641175746917725,0,True,False,False

5/10

Menu systems are tight and choked up, icons for active bonuses during gameplay are hard to read and strenuous to decipher, especially during missions where you need specific combat bonuses active but you have no idea what each icon means, and sometimes there are 12 on screen at one time so its absolutely impossible to know.

Inventory management is horrendously done and makes me feel like im spinning in circles until I puke. I learned that dismantling is S, and remembered that, so now i don't even look at anything I just press S, look for weapons that aren't equipped and dismantle everything regardless of stats because it is WAY TO MUCH to look at, I feel like Deadshot being locked in a tight space, claustrophobic.

Combat
--------

Quick and as everyone else says, absolutely snappy.

I think the worst part is when you NEED SHIELDS, you have to shoot the legs of enemies but depending on the type of weapon you have equipped you're gonna one shot them a lot and its impossible to earn more shields unless you proc other passive abilities that you'll never remember how to do because there's so much freakin information this game wants you to digest.

Half the game is a tutorial with information screens taking up most of your time that you can't read at first because NPC voice lines are playing in the background and it interferes with the comprehending all the info you're trying to absorb.

Think of it like you're trying to make a speech to a room full of people and someone keeps interrupting you because they're louder so you can't keep going and lose your train of thought because all you hear is them. That's exactly it.

Characters
-----------

Harley: 7/10 (Needs improved traversal speed, and slightly faster melee because a lot of it feels off to me)

Deadshot: 9/10 (The best of the squad, traversal is fast and easy to control, damage with weapons is great, and feels like you're playing the leader of the squad)

Boomerang: 7/10 (I don't even know what to say here he just feels weird to play but its not terrible)

Shark: 8/10 (Overall good character, nothing to write home about but gets the job done)

Story
------

6/10 leaving it there, I don't want to talk about it further.

Animations/cinematic
-----------

Some of the best in modern day video games.

End Game
-----------

I cannot recommend this game, based on story alone.

Every character has their own unique play style that will take time to master (not like other games with multi characters but same play style just different weapons).

The enemy AI is where this game shines. the enemy dodge / attack / reaction keeps the game fresh.
 
The end game is where all the fun  is. the difficultly in this game is AWESOME !!! (its not too easy or too hard just the right amount).

So far the game runs smoothly  the only time i had issue was audio syncing was off in one of the story cut scenes.

The other issue is related to playing with a controller when hot swapping to other characters the character will spawn looking up and get stuck in that animation the only why to resolve it was by unplugging the controller and using the mouse then plugging the controller back.

This game is NOT for you if you are a HARDCORE  DC fan. Also, don't expect a rich story like batman games .... from the name * SPOLIERS*







 that's exactly what happens.....

I was hoping for a complete trainwreck and would have waited for a big sale or gamepass if i hadnt gotten this game as a gift XD
The reason i got this as a gift because i was genuinely hyped to play what seemed like the dumpster fire of the year.

Sadly the game has some upsides... some of the jokes land well and after making some massive changes to the keybinds it actually plays well aswell.
Its a looter shooter with not just a DC skin slapped on it but the characters do ofton remind me of their original IP [though im not that familiar with boomerang]
And sure the graphics look good like especially the facial animations, and the style really works well for a comic book game, like they dont seem to be aiming for hyper realism.
Oh and the skills etc do seem  to allow for making builds in a fairly ok way.

The UI is messy and weird and allot of stuff is explained through massive text dump.
Then theres how just dry cookie cutter it is as a ""live service looter shooter"" XD
The enemys are very bland because ofcourse they are :D
Theres enemys that can track you and attack you through buildings and if they are 1 street over messing around you dont realise this until 1 second before impact a beam appears XD
And ofcourse the story XD roflmao...
OMG and by default atleast the kb/mouse keybinds seem to have been made by some1 who has never touched a PC, like not even to excell with or facebook i dunno what even older people do.
AND default aIm AsSiSt for kb/mouse XD who does that ?

So now im just torn....
I jumped into this dumpster expecting garbage, but i actually found some good in here.
For me that kind makes it worse...
They made a product that nobody asked for yet they wer able to give it positives.

So now at times i feel bad playing this wanting it to just be a good game, wich kind kills my dumpster dive experience.

TLDR : Expected garbage found some good sides now im never fully pleased, wait for sale?

Edit : had this been 40 euros at release i coulda seen that, theres just not enough content at the time to justify 70 euros.

I enjoy the game. Gameplay is more important to me than story. This game has good gameplay. The combat is a mix between Sunset Overdrive, Borderlands and still has combat elements from the Arkham Series.

This game got a lot of bad press the same reason Last of Us 2 got bad press. They killed off Fan favorite characters, but none of the bad press talks abut the gameplay. To be honest, Arkham never had good writing. It's always standard Batman affair. This game is not some ""Slain on Kevin Conroy's legacy."" Kevin Conroy has a lot of dialogue. He's one of the actors who talks the most through the game. Kevin got a lot to really spread his acting chops has an evil batman.

amazing cut scenes that are wonderfully animated and Banter between are characters is fun and in my opinion doesn't get old.

The movement is fun in this game, and gun play is okay but its not amazing; however Most of the missions in the game are repeats and get old quick, and the RPG elements is so basic its boring.

The live service is gonna most likely flop, most people, me included, just wanna play the story and be done with the game but their locking most of the game behind seasons.

Rocksteady shouldn't be making live service games, if this game wasn't held back because WB wants more live service games; I think Rocksteady could of cooked up something good. WB are holding back both NetherRealm and rocksteady from cooking.

Not to say that this game is taking place in the arkham verse, which is a slap in the face to fans. their are so many retcons, technology, and things that don't make sense to be in the arkham verse.",1706977199,1706977236,False,16,0,0.551988184452056885,0,True,False,False

-Characters are well written and have solid chemistry
-Graphics are beautiful and music is solid

THE BAD:
-The game is online only being designed for multiplayer gameplay
-Plans for a battle pass system
-instead of earning skins like in the Arkham games, you purchase them with in game currency.
-Story is all over the place and questionable at best.
-Gameplay gets repetitive and combat isn't as satisfying as it was in the Arkham games.
-Level grinding:You can only level one character at a time, inactive characters won't get any XP, you have to grind everyone separately 
-Traversal: the game has a decent sized map, however it lacks any form of fast travel.  This means you have to go to the mission area on your own.  Because the fast traversal methods have limit use the trip back and forth becomes tedious.

To the Devs:
-I recommend including an offline mode, or at least make the base game non server dependent.
-add more costumes in game for the player to earn.
-Give passive XP gain for non active characters to keep everyone balanced
-Adjust the limits of traversal methods to make them more viable to navigate the map.

- Full story around 15-20h and a good one (took me 23 to beat but I'm slow)
- Side quests (20+)
- Riddler challenges (traversal, trophies, riddles)
- Highly detailed and multilayered city 
- City evolving through the story
- Game feels alive, villains talking between them, to you through coms and reflecting the story and your actions, banter between the squad members 
- Dynamic weather (day, night, sunny, rain)
- Feels like a comic book story 
- Reminds me in DCUO in a good way 
- Story reminds me of The Boys from time to time 
- Didn't have any bug besides some keybinds on the menu not showing correctly (using v instead of x to show gear set bonuses for instance)

Looter shooter :
- Character swap at any time 
- 4 Differents characters (traversal, weapons, abilities, talents)
- The 3 characters you don't play are bots using your gear, cosmetics, ect
- Visual effects for passive effect (when you read x5, x20 combos points ...)
- Loadouts
- Creating builds is fun (stacking effects, different effects)
- Weapons effects inspired by Dc villains (black mask, bizzaro, ...)
- Gear set bonus 
- Infinite progression (dumping points past level cap to improve stats)
- Gunplay and traversal are fluid, feels fun to kill stuff and go crazy with various effects 

Engame :
- Leaderboard
- Endgame already here
- Episode 0 already available

Live service :
- Free updates, content, story and playable characters 
- Roadmap with date for the first content drop
- City will change with updates (new zones)

Pro:
You'll have fun watching the cutscenes and dialogs.
You'll fight the justice league.

Cons:
This game seems that it was made for you to waste time. Daily quest, every blood mission when you fail you need to spend some 30sec in useless dialog after your death, then if again with the mission start, if it was a boss fight you need to hear over again all the speech (can't skip, and when you can there is some 10 sec of non agression).
Everything seems slow, the grapple is slow, the jetpack is slow, the speed force travel is slow, the only one that gives a sensation of speed is shark, the wrost char to control.
Every skill tree is the same, just slighted adjusted to the char and you need to spend point on all 3 paths. It is like someone that never saw borderlands wanted to copy and made a poor job. Then you have another specialization for the team, like diablo paragon.
Game as service, no one asked for a game as service, we all wanted what we already saw from rocksteady doing great, but yeah good job again WB runing games (I can't see anybody trusting this studio again).
Always online even if you don't want to have multiplayer.
Shoot oriented game, the melee is ONE blow that is used to farm shield or toss enemies in the air so you can shoot.
0 puzzles, enigma is back but all trophies are hide and seek, beat enemies the icon will show up in the map and you just need  to find it.
Small and generic map, two buildings that you can entender, one does nothing besides get new story missions up to a point, the other one is a base with all the weapon/shield/etc... merch. modifiers.
Combat is not fun, is overcrowded, boss fight usually sucks, you don't have a cue from where the attack came and usually deals a lot of damage (boss fights are even worse), the skill is taken out of the equation and it is 40% RNG most of the time.
After every mission you need again to hear all the speech of whoever it is, see the loot animation and then transition (with loading) to the field screen.
This game is just like Diablo 4, expensive, repetitive and poorly made from the start to the end all you can think is that the executives of WB were the QA assigned and the only concern was how to make the cash shop work.

Btw finished the game in the hardest dificulty without using the pre-order weapons (they're op) and doing every quest available before progressing, probably some 30~35h. Completed also all the riddlers challanges with 3 stars.

Withdrew my refund request because I have been having a lot of fun.  It's like The Division + Crackdown with a sprinkling of Vanquish on top.  All fantastically playing games that got crapped on by internet hive minds and the hacks that are games reviewers.  One thing I've learned is ""professional"" reviewers suck at reviewing loot games and usually hate them because it's not a Sony exclusive sad dad simulator.  

People whining about GAAS?  I haven't spent a dime extra on the game and most likely won't.  Recent top sellers and well received games:  Like a Dragon: IW has 19 MTX totaling $150, Persona 3 has 7 MTX for $30, Tekken 8 has $60 worth of DLC, Granblue Fantasy has $60 worth of DLC yet somehow Suicide Squad is the ""soulless game designed to sell you skins.""  The hypocrisy in games discourse is disgusting these days.  If you're gonna call out SS, call out that game you like too.  

So far the story is fun.  What can I say?  I like playing games as dirtbags and we don't get a chance to do that too often.  The animations are extremely smooth when you switch between traversal to shooting to traversal.  Seriously, the moment to moment gameplay is sublime and I'd rank it near the top of all TPS.  If you like lootin' and shootin' and zipping around a massive world that looks great, it's a fun time.  ""It's repetitive!""  EVERY GAME is repetitive.  It's no more repetitive than any other looter shooter out there.  If that's not your jam, that's cool but move on already.

Right out of the gate this is probably the best performing PC port I've played in YEARS.  My CPU is long in the tooth so I get some stutters between cutscene to open world transitions but then the game is smooth as butter. A decent amount of options and thankfully you don't have to quit all the way to the main menu to change options like some games do.

Comic book fans are notorious for being big babies and are right up there with Star Wars fans for being total lunatics who harass little kids and women.  Combine comic book fans with video game players and you have the biggest pile of terribly smelling nerds this world has ever seen.  This ain't an Arkham game and was never sold as such.  People whining about character assassinations must not understand comic books at all.  Comics are the LAST place you look for for a continuous lore or timeline lol.  Superman died in the 90s ffs and came back like Superjesus.  EVERY super hero has died at some point.  Get over it.

I'm also getting to the point that whenever some internet weirdo yells ""It's woke!""  I immediately assume it is amazing.  Stand down MAGA QANON warriors, senpai Trump will not notice you but he will steal from your pockets and your state's funds as he has been doing the past 8 years.

Although the crybaby soycorp braindead meta shitbags who are crying that super villains kill their favourite soy superhero has given the game a bad rep, actually playing it and delving into the story and everything it offers makes this one of my favourite rocksteady experiences and DC experiences overall when it comes to a game. You really get a good squad with a lot of good laughs throughout the phenomenal story, its a great length, so much variety in loot, new enemy types, side characters like Poison Ivy and Penguin assisting you in defeating Brainiac makes it just that bit better. The versatility of the looter shooter experience this game offers is a combination of borderlands and guardians of the galaxy and my god does it pay off. Once you've completed the reasonably lengthy story (around 12hrs if you do some side things and grind for loot) you get to experience the vast end game full of new levels to grind on Earth-2. 

The Justice League are no longer their human selves and you can really tell by their attitude to the civilians and city of Metropolis, Batman is a huge part of the game he is dangerous, deadly and terrifying. He stalks you and watches over the squad after every mission (look around, you might catch him). Superman and Diana have a small storyline on the side and its just as you'd imagine. The Green Lantern and the Flash are terrifying under Brainiacs control, they kill with no remorse and toy with the squad. Lex Luthor 2 is probably the best side character, he is extremely important to the story and is amazing when assisting the squad. The movement is fantastic and fluid on all characters. I will say some bossfights could've been done better but it all makes sense in a way. You are a super villain, you do not need a big song and dance after killing a soyboy superhero like all the twitter virgins are crying about, they dont give a fuck hence why boomerang pissed on the flashes corpse. Brainiac is as disturbing as you'd imagine and the game doesn't end with him as they're are many universes the squad have to travel to and defeat Brainiac. The social aspect of the game is amazing, playing with friends is the best option with the competitive nature of all missions with its score and reward system. Don't read what soyboy corp youtubers or twitter virgins say about the game, if you want it, give it a shot. You do as the title states and don't look back once you've done it. Arkham Batman may have defeated many assassins in one night but this Squad killed the entire Justice League and an alien army in a few days. Once you understand the main goal of the game, everything makes sense stop hiding behind your dumb ass fantasty and inhaling your pure Ugandan Copium. 

The ""live service oh my god I hate it!"" doesnt even apply here, you hear nothing about microtransactions until you go to the store page + March 1st we get the battlepass which then allows us to get the Scarecrow DLC, Twoface DLC, Joker Character and Joker Metropolis all for free even if you don't get the battlepass...Mutahar (nerd youtuber) prefers siege as a live service (you literally buy lootboxes and pray for a ice camo) compared to a game were everything is hidden away until YOU go there yourself (with no lootboxes) then an entire act + characters are all free...yeah so get the game, its cool asf. (it has its small flaws but nothing as big as the misinformation spread online)

The story is lackluster and the bosses aren't great. 

But there are parts that really shine and the gameplay is really fun and slick. The players all feel unique, the gun mechanics are very borderlandsy, and the overall core loop is satisfying. 

This is a live service game. It's been advertised as a single player game, when realistically it's more of a lite MMO in the vein of Destiny 2. The writing is going to improve as they go by the seasons and it's a blast as a single player game so I can only imagine my friends will enhance the experience when they get to playing it with me.

It's not game of the year material at all. There's a lot to be improved on and ironed out. 

However, if you approach this game with an open mind, and not expecting another Arkham game, but instead a sort of Sunset Overdrive feel, then you'll probably enjoy it. 

The expansions are all going to be free so hopefully I'm right in my assumption in that the game will only get better and with time this could be amazing.

The game has high quality, stunning graphics and impressive. Character animation, movement, facial expressions, gestures It's something so perfect and amazing. I really love it~!!

For example, in the scene where Batman is encountered, it feels frightening, terrifying, and unsafe. It very well expresses the feelings that the villains go through when fighting Batman. There is no way to overcome it. And you never know when Batman will take you down. It's like a Cat chasing a Mouse.

Conversations between the four characters the villains (who are now the Super-hero? haha XD) To those Super-heroes. (Who has now become a Villain? XD) It's hilarious and each joke makes you out laughing immediately.

Playing as the Suicide Squad Team is another charm, great idea, fun and enjoyable, can make you playing very addictive. Especially if you play with friends, it will be SUPER FUN~

So I want fans of the Rocksteady's universe and DC fans to not miss this nice and fun game~!

What happened? Rocksteady created 3 absolute bangers; three narrative driven Arkham games that became instant gaming classics. They made us believe that we were the Dark Knight and that we were prowling the darkened alleys and skyline of Gotham City. It was a Batman fan’s dream.

First thing that happens when Suicide Squad boots is a option to decline to have our personal information harvested and sold to third parties. Gross! And the kicker? The opt out doesn’t even work!

And then after you’ve signed an enormous digital contract whereby you agree that the game you just dropped £60 on isn’t actually yours and that you’re only borrowing it from WB until they decide to take it away, the game just… kinda… starts. No real cutscene, no explanation for what is happening; you just run and jump around a bland disjointed environment without rhyme or reason. 

To be fair, the performance is good and the gameplay mechanics are polished, but none of that matters because I didn’t feel invested in what I was doing. It’s a strangely soulless experience. The more I gunned down the endless waves of generic NPC’s the more I felt disconnected from the game. I started thinking about what i was going to have for dinner tonight and when The Batman Part 2 was going to start shooting. I wondered how and why Rocksteady had spent 8 years on this project and who even imagined that it was a good idea to greenlight to begin with. 

I can’t imagine this game doing well, I don’t know who this is for. I hope that  management pays for this disaster and not the grunts that have toiled in the trenches for the best part of a decade. I hope Rocksteady survives this debacle and gets to make another single player narrative driven game; perhaps another Batman game or even a Superman. Imagine how cool that would be!

There are some flow problems with the end of missions, they just seems to break the momentum of the game. Also playing as King Shark is a bit odd as his traversal isn't nearly as fun or accurate to control as the other 3 players. 

I would have loved more animations for the abilities, one of the main reasons I think Batman's Combat popped a bit more in Knight, was how dynamic his animated take-downs were, While here your abilities largely look like the same animation over and over.

I've overall enjoyed my time playing the game. the characters seem well written, and the game has gotten quite a few more chuckles out of me then i was expecting based off what I was reading about online. You could do a lot worse with your money on other games then this.

Story: 8/10 - Really enjoyable story 
Gameplay: 10/10 - Really fun and addicting, stuff gets added as you do side missions 
- Exploration is fun, especially when using Captain Boomerang and Deadshot 
- Endgame mission is fun, you can use the endgame stuff to level up your other characters 

Stuff I disliked: 

- Majority of the characters are based on Batman comics, could have atleast added more characters from other titles like reverse flash, captain cold, Black Manta 
- Connecting the story to Arkham, they could have went along with the game not connecting to the arkham game but it's a minor gripe 

I'd recommend the game at it's current price if you enjoy looter shooters

However they is some massive cash grabbing going on. The game is £60/£90 depending which version you buy. It's a really short game so far but supposedly it's meant to get free big updates in the future. Another thing is whilst I've seen no battlepass in the game there is a store to buy costumes that cost real money. You can't have a game that's full price and have to continue paying for things if you want them. (Look at destiny 2). If you want this game wait for it to go cheap which it will have to because the pricing strategy is a scam.

I've never played the Arkham games, so i'm not biased by what came before, but this game was honestly broken on concept and had no shot at being good.

gameplay wise:
-the loot system is extremely boring and almost pointless. i'm getting showered in legendarily and uniques(hell the first weapon drop i got was a legendary) and my main character(boomerang) had a complete loadout of legendary or better before i even hit level 10.
-the skill trees for each character are similar to the ones in borderlands, but they somehow fucked them up since you have no agency over which skills you take. you get one skill per row per tree, and the game picks for you which tree you get a skill point for so you have to level up all 3 evenly. and even worse, most of the perks are extremely boring. you know in borderlands 2 how your perk loadout could completely change the way you play each character based on just one or two perks? yeah that's gone most of the perks i've seen so far are basic stat buffs. the only interesting one i've seen so far is a perk for captain boomerang that slows down time on an enemy when you melee them
-the traversal mechanics are pretty dull. there's 4, one per character(a jetpack, a teleport, a grapple, and a super jump) and all four are too under baked to be even slightly interesting or fun to use. compare harley's grapple to the swinging in spider-man 2 and it really shows how under-used all of these mechanics are since they needed to make 4 instead of focusing on making 1 good one.
-the difficulty is a joke. i beat green lantern and flash in one try on the hardest difficulty and acording to the game i was under equiped for both. neither fight was difficult, i just had to run around like a headless chicken for 10 minutes taking pot shots with the legendary sniper rifle the game shouldn't have given me yet.
-the modifiers on missions are just flat out irritating rather than interesting. you want to only be able to kill enemies with a limited resource(grenades) that you can run out of and all your other weapons deal 0 damage? you want to only be able to deal damage with crits on enemies that have very unclear crit spots and all other damage heals them? no? too bad.
-the game basically requires a controller since the mouse controls are so bad(good luck sniping)
-the scopes are useless. i hit the button to scope in with a sniper rifle and it feels like the camera barely zoomed in at all, it just goes into first person instead of third person without actually changing the distence.

writing wise: i hate it. i hate all of it. there are 4 characters in this game who come anywhere near close to likable, and they're king shark, boomerang(sometimes), flash(in the 3 cutscenes before he dies), and deadshot(because he hates everyone in this damn game as much as i do). the fact harley is a main character too doesn't do it any favors, because she is at her absolute most annoying that she's been in the past several years and not a single line out of her ear piercingly awful voice was funny. in fact none of the jokes in this game are funny, i laughed literally one time in 10 hours and it was when deadshot tried to snipe flash and then flash was looking over deadshots shoulder and said ""did you get him?"". that's it. that's the one funny joke in the whole game and i just spoiled it for you so if you want to play this game for the humor you don't have to anymore.

and the overall plot is just a flat out bad idea to begin with, even if it were done well which it isn't, because where the hell do you go from here? this is a live service game so what the fuck are you supposed to do now? the game's called ""kill the justice league"" so after you kill the 5(not even 7, 5) members of the league, what next? is a new league gonna form off screen and then get mind controlled by a different bad guy so we can kill them next and literally piss on their corpse again?

if you like DC, don't play this game, because it couldn't be more clear that the writers of this game outright hate this property and only like harley quinn and wonder woman while wanting to disrespect every other aspect of this world that they possibly can.",1706958231,1706958231,False,284,3,0.78775632381439209,0,True,False,False

I have heard this is a censor issue but that makes no sense and the game is rated M there should be no censors and the outfits already exist in their own games just flat out disappointing I can't walk around in those cool outfits.

After playing the game for 36 hours so far.. All I can say is:

""Umm IGN Are we playing the same game here because I'm having a blast?""

Unlike Destiny 2, The story is well made & the open world events are challenging and fun.

Unlike Marvel Avengers, the characters are enjoyable to play as, feel unique & their dialog / story beats are great. 

The game is dark at times yes, You're playing as Villains, it's to be expected. 

I haven't made it to the Batman boss fight yet, but so far I believe they've written Batman really, really well. He's a force of nature, especially for just a Rich guy in body armour. 

The looting is actually well made, granted I haven't made it to end game yet but as of now everything I'm using is Viable & I can still make a fun elemental bleed build with Deadshot (Who I main) with the three tech trees that while they're very Borderlands inspired, are great & make me excited to level up. 

The Crafting is wonderful, making it not too RNG to create the build you want. 

The enemies are varied, have a great variety & at the point of the game I'm at, don't feel like Cannon Fodder. 

All in all, I'm really enjoying this & I'm looking forward to keep playing it, hitting endgame & playing the new Seasons (Which all content besides some cosmetics for the new characters, are completely free with NO FOMO)",1706953826,1706953826,True,4,0,0.524886906147003174,0,True,False,False

I read a lot of hate and people putting down the game, after playing the game for 6 hours at the point of this review I'm disheartened by the negative reviews. This is a good game, its fun, the writing of the story is solid and the options are varied. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Seeing the road map for the future is very exciting, the new playable characters that'll come is awesome. If you're a fan of DC and enjoyed the story line of the Suicide Squad this will be a blast. The characters are great with their dialog and banter. Don't let the negative votes sway you. I actually like the story arch from the original Arkham series and this is a great follow up. People complaining about oh so and so dies, oh so and so is a kid... blah blah blah. If you actually play the game and know the Arkham series and what took place during those games it all makes sense. The game even does a great job recapping the series for you explaining why all the things that are the way that they are in this game. They even joke in game why certain characters are the way they are and casted as the way they are, its fantastic. The makers of the game took care of the franchise and gave us a great, entertaining, laugh out loud at times game. The only thing I wish they had....Harley Quinn in her shorts outfit from the Suicide Squad Movie. LOL Here's to hoping for the future. Speaking of micro...the transactions that you can ""buy"" outfits and emotes and stuff isnt a game killer, you DONT have to buy them. It's great they are offered, especially if youre a DC fan. If you're not then dont spend youre money on them. Hope my review helps like the ones before me helped me pull the trigger on this game.

You play as the Suicide Squad and the game is from their perspective, so why would they be respectful to the people who beat them up and throw them in jail? These are villains, not heroes, do not expect them to be good people.

As for the actual game, the concept is good, the execution is not. The story starts strong and gets worse by the end. People complaining that the concept itself is the problem can go play another game. That simple. I do not like Injustice. I don't like what they did the the characters, the story, or the the concept as a whole. So what do I do? I don't play it. That simple.

The game-play isn't very good. Gun-play is bare-bones, melee is a joke, traversal depends on the character and personal taste (decent but not as good as Sunset Overdrive), enemy variety is very small. This game is a looter/shooter, I've played Borderlands 2 & 3 and would consider this game inferior to them. The game-play is fun, but not very good. It doesn't necessarily do anything wrong, but it could have been done so much better.

Additionally, the game is meant to be played cooperatively, just because the game has the option to play solo doesn't mean you should. That would be like playing Resident Evil 5 solo and complaining that Sheva isn't helping. Now that doesn't mean that I support this online only crap. The game should have launched with it but didn't, meaning as of 2/3/2023 you can only play while connected to their servers.

This video game did not ruin your life, childhood, or the Arkham-verse.

Other complaints: the characters never shut up. The game isn't worth $70. It is a damn shame that this is our introduction to the Justice League of this universe, and it even has my favorite Green Lantern.

That being said, I think the story is pretty good. Gameplay is fun, but I agree with others that being online only is a mistake. I understand their reasoning for it, because they want people to be able to join the action as you play and the game is definitely meant to be played with other, but for those who just want a single player experience, then it can be annoying when there are issues preventing you from playing the game. Additionally, the controls are OK, but targeting enemies at time can be a chore. For a game like this, it feels that it would have been better with an assisted lock for enemies, or if there is one, then it could have been implemented better. Graphically, the game is really good. Overall, if you're into these types of games, I think it is a good game, but I do feel the pricing of the game is a bit high. For a $70 - $100 game, there needs to be more in my opinion.

Gameplay got repetitive only a few hours in

Battlepass and insanely overpriced cosmetics in a $70 game

PC port is terribly optimized, I have a Ryzen 5600x and a 4070TI but still couldn't get stable 60 fps on any settings (meanwhile I played both Cyberpunk and Alan Wake 2 maxed out with Path tracing no problem)

and the writing... my god they dropped the ball hard. To their credit the story had a somewhat interesting start, and the cast did an excellent job with the voice acting throughout the game, but the constant jokes every 2 seconds and the way the writers treated the justice league had me so incredibly dumbfounded I have no idea who thought this was a good idea..

Can't believe Rocksteady made this game",1706949771,1706949771,False,1828,42,0.849903106689453125,0,True,False,False

First of all, right off the bat I kept running into technical issues, the game wouldn't even let me play even though I had an internet connection, it would just tell me it failed to connect to servers and to try again later. After getting it to work after a while, I for some reason wasn't able to invite my friends to play with me. They would be listed and shown as online but they game would not let me send them an invite and just say ""[username] is not part of the ARGUS database"". Eventually we got it working by manually searching each others usernames up and inviting that way, but even after ALL THAT, my game crashed TWICE.
And no, my PC wasn't the issue. (rtx 3080, 64gb ddr4, ryzen 9 5900x)

Now, lets just pretend I didn't have any of those technical issues for a second, I still wouldn't recommend this game at all. First of all, the style of online looter shooter gameplay they were going for is outdated and doesn't make any sense as a sequel to the amazing arkham quadrilody. But, at first I was willing to look past it. I will admit, the shooting, traversal mechanics, and overall fighting scenarios were pretty fun for a short while. But it gets old very fast. It's always the same. Shoot purple guys, get shield, rinse and repeat. The few missions I did were very stale. I didn't play through the whole game but I've seen a lot of videos of the story online and oh boy where do I even start. They've basically thrown away everything they've built from the last games. Just watching THE arkham batman, the amazing hero we've been attached to for close to 15 years throughout the whole arkham franchise, killed by harley quinn on a park bench in metropolis. After being brainwashed and killing countless innocent people. It's just not what anyone want's to see after playing as this character for countless hours like I did. I almost feel like they did this in an effort to make us feel better about killing him? Like maybe they wanted to make him so evil we would feel triumph for defeating him? but this just makes the whole thing even more disheartening.

""BuT ItS LitERaLy CAlLed KiLL THe juSTiCe LEaGUe WhaT DId yoU ExpECt??""

I don't know, maybe the real question is what I DIDN'T expect. I DIDN'T expect rocksteady to destroy the amazing universe and characters they've been developing perfectly for over a decade, I suppose. I DIDN'T expect a Destiny 2 Suicide Squad DLC ass of a game.

Believe me, I really wanted this game to be good, I seriously gave it a solid chance despite all the controversy online about it, but its just not worth it. My best advice would be to avoid this game at all costs and just pretend it doesn't exist so you don't ruin your childhood.

My only qualm so far is the Batman bossfight. He had such great scenes before the fight, and such menacing and chilling experiences here he was hunting you down, stalking from rooftops. All for it to be some trashy bullethell where I was just aiming my gun blasting at his (giant) eyes for four minutes, jumping up and down to avoid swipe attacks. Very sad to see such an easy bossfight for him. Especially when I'm playing on the hardest difficulty.

At the point I'm currently at, just after defeating Batman, the only bossfight I felt did true justice to the character had to have been The Flash's. Truly a hard bossfight, and very fun to play. Green Lantern's was okay, but again incredibly easy.

I really appreciate the co-op features. For example, I can borrow my friend's squad members as bots in my squad when my friend is offline.

One follows my friend and one follows me. And everything works really well; no major bug so far.

All the features surrounding this looter shooter are very well thought out, including crafting, itemization, and attributes, etc. The weapons sometimes have game-changing perks, which let you think you might legally cheat, which feels great!

If you are only in for the story, then I would suggest you wait for a discount. But even then, it could be a very enjoyable experience because the cutscenes are really well made, and my friend and I laughed a lot.

If you generally enjoy a looter shooter like Warframe, Destiny, or The Division, you should definitely give this one a try. The handling of the characters, the traversal mechanics, and the gunplay are addicting. The rocksteady DNA is still in there, including combo counters, different abilities, and the flow of combat, even when it is with guns!

(NON-Spoiler PROS)
So the pros about the game, its quite fun the movement has a slight nod towards the Arkham series, but its also fast pace to. It also explains some questions we Arkham fans had about some questions about what happened to Bruce and the rest of the bat family. Why the justice league got infected. Including some good old Easter eggs and references to the old games and certain comics to. The comedy is also quite good to, but ill get back to that subject later. Some of the boss fights are pretty good and they get how the characters should act/be down correctly.

(NON-Spoiler CONS)
The comedy is a bit to much where they make everyone and everything a god damn joke and it just gets boring really. Half of the game is fun until you defeat green lantern it starts to go down hill from there. There's also a major repeat of certain missions which is fine sense their mostly repeats for upgrades of weapons and they do convince you to play different characters due to them being HYPED up which is nice. Also certain sections of missions might not work half the time, due to the enemy AI either freezing up or basically going invincible for a slight second fucking you over.


Do I recommend the game? Kind of either wait for a sale, or just give it a slight chance and see for yourself. Overall 5/10





((Spoiler Pros & Cons))


 [spoiler] So the major downfall of this game was and I hate to say it, How they treated Kevin Conroy (The voice of batman for those who don't know) They just treat him like he's a joke. The fight is pretty much a reskin of Ra's Al Ghul's fight from Arkham city except with guns. Including how he just fucking dies in the way he shouldn't have. Its fucking pathetic and Lazy. But I'm giving them some Slight slack due to him dying. But they had 4 god damn years to work on this shit. At least they gave him a nice tribute after the credits mind you the credits are an Hour long so just skip them. But the game itself is not bad from the beginning to the Green Lantern fight it's good, but after the fight. It goes downhill from there. Do I recommend it? yeah I guess, but I'd say wait for a sale or give it a few minutes of playtime and see for yourself. [spoiler]",1706901707,1706945131,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

it is a good game. Cool gameplay, and world class voice acting.

 BTW I think deluxe edition is necessary because the bonus weapon is OP. You don't need to surfer the gear RNA in the whole story.  I did not even spend 1 second to change other weapon until the story end. If you are interest of the story only, just buy deluxe edition.

 The only thing I want to complain is the art style.I think Gotham Knights' stlye is much better.

The traversal as expected is fluid and easy to learn but hard to master. The combat is varied based on what character you play and the build options are deceptively complex. The writing is fine (not really my style) and overall you can expect a tight well rounded experience from the game play with a fun story to follow.

That is, if you view the story as a standalone. The fact that it's set in the Arkhamverse definitely sours the experience a little bit, and it's a fair complaint that you'll see online. There is no reason why it had to be set in such a beloved universe, and doing so does feel like a slap on the wrist from the developers, especially with how unceremoniously they handle it. I love the Arkham games personally, so I have just chosen to view this as an elseworld with the exact same history as the Arkhamverse.

The MTX are also borderline fucked. The pricing is outrageous, $10 for basically a re-shade in a $100 game is the definition of greed. On top of that, pre-purchasing the digital deluxe edition doesn't even give you the full classic collection and to purchase the rest of the collection costs around $40.

As it stands, this is a good game but not great. Everything it does well has been done better in other games, such as the Arkham series. If you just want a bit of mindless fun shooting Braniac goon's and occasionally killing a member of the Justice League, then wait for a sale. And ignore the crybabies on twitter who will shit on it without playing it.

I'd give it a 3.9/5, it's so close to being something much better.

That's not what this game is nor is it what it ever was advertised as being. This is honestly what the Avengers game should of been. Variation in builds. Every character plays vastly different from the rest as well as you can even have builds that play different.

Most of the 7 1/2 hours I have put in so far has been playing through various side missions and leveling characters.

I don't mind the fact that the game is always online and a live service game. It allows Rocksteady to feed us content. With this game advertising as content for the next 7 years,  I'm pretty excited to see what they do with this game as a live service. They have already announced that they will be adding in Joker. I'd love to see them add in characters like Bloodsport, Peacekeeper, T.D.K., El Diablo and Weasel.

They fall for this marketing gimmick every time. So don't give this game money. 

The game is fine if you like simplistic third person shooters but the story and dialogue takes a huge nose dive after an hour into the game. 

Unlike most people, I'm giving this a negative based on the game play itself.  You repeat the same thing over and over again. Doing the same objectives every mission and fight the lamest boss fights. It's a slog and not fun at all to me. 

And that's all there is to do. The same escort quests, go here kill the same 3 types enemies on repeat and shoot the purple circles on the tank for about 7 hours. 

I could care less about the politics this game pushes, sweet baby or the story and how they treat the universe Rocksteady built in the past Batman games but the game itself is just awful right now. There's zero content in this game and I'm sure as time goes on they'll add more content to this game being it is a live service game, but this is just ridiculous how low standard this game is. The fact that people are defending this is worrying to an extreme degree. 

I really don't take my time and write stuff like this but if you were on the fence about buying this game like I was just don't get it. It's not worth playing. There's a million other better looter shooters on the market you can play instead. Just be cautious of the positive reviews on steam as they mostly fall into the category stated at the beginning of this review as people who will buy slop to ""own the chuds"" or ""oh wow look how progressive!""

A non bias review of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League

If you enjoy a fast pace, looter shooter type of game that encourages fun instead of being grindy but can be challenging here and there then you will most likely enjoy this, the game doesn't have the best of stories and they have made some questionable choices there but remember they will expand upon it in the future with the seasons, I am interested to see on what free content they bring in the future with the seasons though, each character feels unique and fills a pacific roll in the squad, the graphics and facial expressions are really good and actually surprised me and the performance of the game is pretty good as well, the city itself is beautiful and it kind of reminds me of an actual city if you just forget about the giant space skill and the destruction, just one more thing I need to state the game does contain micro-transactions including a battle-pass but don't worry they are all cosmetics, they do not affect the game or give you advantages, they do have unique effects and styles and each battle pass they bring to the game will be in the game permanently similar to halo infinite's battle-passes.",1706937514,1706937879,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest problem most people seem to have with this game is how they handled Batman and his death, whilst yes being shot in the head by Harley Quinn doesn't exactly give Arkham Batman the sendoff that he had in Arkham Knight, and invalidates his death and sacrifice at the end of that game (even tho it was clear he didn't die in post credit scene).

I've also seen a lot of posts about people using Kevin Conroy's death to shit on this game, and I believe it is completely unwarranted, the man knew what he was signing onto, and likely agreed to how his story ended, you don't know how he felt about it, but he KNEW what would happen and signed along with the game. 

The boss fights in this game are very lackluster and mostly follow ""shoot this object, shoot this to weaken boss"" and to be honest the boss fights are comically easy to do even on the hardest difficulty.

Enemy variety is one the biggest weak sides of this game, nearly every enemy plays the same. Only major difference there is in enemies and how you play against them is genuinely just if they need to be melee'd first or not, other than that just shoot and counter.

Unless you're a die-hard fan of the DC characters and want to play as them, I would not recommend this game at full price at its current state. I do believe later on in this games lifespan it can become a game you keep coming back to every new season.

 -SPOILERS ALERT BELOW-

Mostly relating to the death of ""Arkham"" Batman. Here's a fun fact to all those concerned, through in game dialogue there are many hints that the current Justice League the SS are fighting are 'Clones', leaked DLC voicelines also reveal Flash and Batman being alive, kinda odd isn't it? The game still achieves its story's main objective of 'killing the justice league' and it transitions into a multi-versal narrative of stopping other brainiacs and whatever problems the future holds.

My only main point of critisim is HOLY HELL OPTIMIZE THE GAME A LITTLE MORE PLEASE MAN 
Despite that, game is super fun, easy to learn mechanics, traversal into combat transitioning is suprisingly addicting and each character has a unique flare. One downside was when I realized each character can share the same weaponry that takes away the 'unique'ness of a character's role BUT that is only dependant on how YOU want to build your character.

Suicide Squad KTJL is a fun game, overshadowed by hate cast by people completely lost on the game's narrative by watching out of context clips, I mean, people think Boomerang pissed on Flash's corpse when that literally never even happens because the other members of the SS stop him from doing so, like come on the false narrative spinning is CRAZY.

Anyways, game is fun, addicting, if you like stuff like this, play it and ignore others opinions, they will look unbelievably stupid once Arkham Batman is revealed to be alive in the upcoming DLCs, specially the Gotham one later in halloween this year as leaked by reputable source Miller.",1706937209,1706937209,True,0,1,0.496240586042404175,0,True,False,False

TLDR;
6.5 out of 10
GAME IS MID
The gameplay is super fun
The story is below average 
Not worth $70, get it on sale
 
This game is “something”. I've played all the Arkham games, and I have enjoyed what Rocksteady has done with that world. This is a huge step away from what they've done before. After beating the story, if you enjoy DC IP and these suicide squad members you'll be entertained. The story has its moments but it is a little stale. It is a rocksteady story though that can't be missed. The humor was pretty good but at the expanse of characters, I wish we had more time with them. The gameplay is honestly the most fun I've had in a while with a game like this, it is super chaotic and fast-paced pace but it is so much fun. Traversal is super fun and just fast. All the characters are unique in traversal and abilities, but the gunplay on all of them is similar enough. This is 100% a live service game and you can't escape that aspect of the game. It's always online, weapon rarities, resources, contracts, dailys, and loadout crafting. If you just wanna play the story and play the next game in the “Arkham Series”, you can do your best to ignore this aspect of the game but it will always be there, offline play is set to be coming at a later date post-release. I can best describe this game as if Destiny, Borderlands, Sunset Overdrive, and Warframe had a baby and slapped an Arkham coat of paint on it. If you enjoy those games you will enjoy this game if you like DC. Overall I give this game a 6.5 out of 10. Not worth the full price, and would be more fun with friends. Pleasantly surprised with the gameplay and traversal but slightly disappointed with the story. Addressing the big giant bat in the room, Yes I am Upset with how they treated Arkham Batman but it's whatever. I'm just glad I got to hear Kevin Conroy reprise the role of one of my favorite Batman adaptations one last time after his passing.

""We have to start by THIS IS NOT A GAME IN THE STYLE OF THE ARKHAM SAGA, although it is developed by the same studio and is in the same universe (though in terms of story, it only has nods to the Batman saga), this is a 100% different bet. We are no longer the bat, we are no longer in Gotham.

That being said, this is a good game, it feels solid and well-planned, made with love. It's not a game for everyone as the Shooter Looter genre is very present, in a well-grounded way. However, it changes a lot from the usual superhero games. My rating for the game is 8.06, and I will be explaining point by point without spoilers what I thought:

GAMEPLAY and PERFORMANCE: It's a game that was running well since early access, very smooth, no frame drops, and with very solid graphics. It features 4 playable characters (this is before the release of any extra content) that are very different from each other. Personally, I loved the game's mobility, being very effective and feeling comfortable with 3 out of the 4 characters. The gunplay is very solid, combining melee and ranged attacks in a well-executed manner, with a good variety of mechanics that doesn't become overwhelming like in other games. Very well thought out and executed. In my case, I followed the suggestion to play with a controller, and the mapping felt very well done. 9/10

CHARACTERS: The four main characters are well-crafted, each having their own essence both narratively and in terms of gameplay. I was afraid it would feel like the same character with a different skin, but fortunately, it doesn't. Each one has its own identity and is very enjoyable. In terms of gameplay, you will likely stick with one or two characters for the comfort of their mobility and combat style, as their different styles naturally make some more comfortable than others. 10/10

STORY: The story is good, not spectacular or entering any historical top, but it works. I expected a bit more from this studio, which has shown it can have very good scripts. The story has its funny moments brought by our four criminals, and there are some pretty good moments with the league, but it doesn't go beyond that. 7.5/10

ENEMIES: The variety of enemy models is limited (similar to the Arkham saga), but it's functional. You don't need more since they have variations covering a wide spectrum of things you might need. There are helicopters, tanks, common units, shooters, armored units, a strange bug that revives enemies, and a very strong large unit. Several of these units have variations, which helps so that you don't have to learn many mechanics. They are few, intuitive, and functional. 8/10

BOSSES: I don't want to go into much detail here to avoid spoilers, but they feel powerful and make good use of each one's iconic powers. There's one fight that I didn't like much because it was very average, but the others I enjoyed quite a bit, so I think they did quite well considering the characters are VERY difficult to bring into gameplay as they are practically gods. 8.5/10

SIDE MISSIONS: This is where the game fails more strongly in the base content, excluding the endgame. Six characters give you side missions to farm resources and unlock the possibility of having better things to create and modify your weapons. However, it fails because it lacks extra story, quickly falling into repetitiveness. They only add obstacles on how to kill enemies to add a variant to the game, and it's practically doing the same thing with each one. The good thing is that there are few side missions. 5.5/10

SHOOTER LOOTER: The mechanic, in my opinion, is well grounded, giving you pretty good weapons very early in the game. There's also the option to have 4 traders who can improve and change weapons/statistics, avoiding the need to farm like crazy until you get a specific weapon with the desired upgrades and statistics. This makes the game much more enjoyable to play. 9/10

EXTRA CONTENT: As part of the studio's signature, there are many unlockables that can be obtained, from skins, audio, designs, art sketches, etc., very much in the Rocksteady style. If you liked that in Arkham, you'll like it here. If you didn't like it in Arkham, you won't like it here. Personally, I liked it, but in my opinion, this doesn't warrant a rating.

GAME AS A SERVICE AND MICROTRANSACTIONS:

I see it as a positive that all playable content released after the launch is free, avoiding having to buy a certain amount of DLCs. Regarding the Season pass, I also see it positively that you can get any Season pass even after the season has ended, avoiding FOMO and allowing everyone to see and buy the Season passes they like at their own pace. At the time of this review, the first Season pass has not been released, but once it is, I will update this review with my opinion on the content. The skins released at launch didn't attract me, and there are three versions of each skin: Base, epic, and legendary (or similar names). The base is the basic skin without much more, the epic is the skin with variations of look and color, and the legendary is what comes in the epic but with even more things. Obviously, the cost increases depending on the version, but it didn't seem too expensive to me. Here, I think it depends a lot on each person's economy, so it's subjective. For now, it's a 7/10. (If more things come out and my opinion changes, I will update the rating.)

SUMMARY: It's a good game, and personally, the post-launch content attracts me a lot and promises a lot. Unfortunately, many people have thrown a lot of hate at this game without having played it just because of what they've seen or because it says ""game as a service."" I believe Rocksteady has made good decisions on how to handle the game as a service, and they have announced that they will incorporate more HUD adjustment options so that you can have your HUD as you want, introducing an offline mode and more things to come in the following seasons. Currently, I don't think the deluxe version is worth it since the most attractive part was early access. I would suggest buying the standard version at full price or on discount, depending on each person. Enjoy your games, enjoy your tastes, and if you don't like something, say it, but let's not blindly throw hate that only makes this great gaming industry stink more. Cheers.""

The animations, the character lines, the environment, it all OOZES Arkham, and it's very clear these developers are extremely passionate about the source material. Story is OK, but the real game opens up post-story, as anyone who has played games like Warframe can say.

If you can accept that this isn't the Arkham game we all wanted, and instead view this product on its own, then its a stellar bit of fun. I don't know if I would call it 70$ fun, but the fun is there.

While expectations of an experience similar to the Arkham games may lead to disappointment, it's crucial to recognize that this installment comes from a different Rocksteady Studios team. Approaching the game with an appetite for high-velocity looting and shooting, coupled with a genuine love for the DC Universe, can significantly enhance the overall enjoyment of the adventure.

This game offers many surprises, defying initial expectations. Despite the seemingly repetitive combat mechanics on paper, the action-packed chaos remains captivating even after extended gameplay. The characters, against all odds, exude charm and deliver funny moments. Furthermore, incorporating live service elements, usually met with skepticism, turns out to be surprisingly generous. While acknowledging its imperfections, the game impresses in ways that overshadow its shortcomings.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League combines the essence of Infamous and Borderlands, presenting a unique gaming experience. Though the live service model requires an upfront purchase, it successfully balances offering a whole AAA experience and creating an incentive for continuous engagement. The core gameplay spans approximately 30 hours, delivering a compelling campaign, purposeful side missions, and a coherent endgame.

I pre-ordered the deluxe edition and I've been playing w/o an ssd and running a gtx 1070ti and get between 40-60 fps on high settings and it feels very smooth and playable, I ran into a few issues with crashing but It didn't remove progress so I looked past it.

The game-play in this game is so incredibly addicting, I find myself roaming around the city aimlessly thanks to boomerangs awesome traversal, The gun-play and action in this game is just as addicting as the traversal, the way some moves flow together seamlessly is incredibly satisfying and the move-set you have which some may see as limited is more than enough.

I've played as Captain Boomerang throughout most of my whole experience playing this game and he is by far my favourite, his traversal and move-set as-well as just his voice lines just make the experience more fun.

Gameplay Experience: ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"" delivers a thrilling story and an open world brimming with activities. The combat is both fun and rewarding, offering a blend of melee and ranged battles that keeps things interesting. Each character's unique flair and abilities add depth to the gameplay, despite side missions adhering to familiar looter shooter conventions.

Graphics and Audio: The game's visual presentation is on point, with standout animations that breathe life into each character's moveset. Cutscene animations and lip-syncing are particularly impressive, enhancing the overall narrative experience.

World and Story: Though only 14 hours in, the game world feels adequately expansive, though I found myself wishing for a bit more density. The storyline, with its alternative universe setting, is compelling and filled with humor and chemistry among the Suicide Squad members, making it a standout feature.

Characters: The character portrayal is spot-on, capturing the essence of their comic book counterparts. The dynamic between the Suicide Squad members is entertaining, and even the mind-controlled Justice League members retain aspects of their original personas, albeit more sinisterly.

Challenge and Power Balance: The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and empowerment. Battles are designed in such a way that, regardless of the difficulty, you always feel powerful and in control.

Unique Features: The novelty of combating iconic heroes as villains stands out as the game's most notable feature. Additionally, the unique traversal skills of each character contribute to the game's fun and fluid gameplay.

Comparisons: This title draws parallels with ""Gotham Knights"" for its combat and setting, and ""Anthem"" for the distinct feel and gunplay of each character. It manages to carve out its own identity within the genre, however.

Likes and Dislikes: The story, animations, combat, and character interactions are the highlights of the game. The setting of Metropolis, while iconic, sometimes feels too uniform and could benefit from greater variety.

Recommendation: At its full price of $70, ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"" is a worthwhile purchase for fans of the franchise and genre. However, I'd suggest waiting for a sale if the price tag is higher. The game is a solid addition to any gamer's collection, especially for those seeking a blend of action, humor, and a fresh narrative twist on the DC universe.

Closing Thoughts: This review, based on a substantial gaming library experience, aims to guide your decision-making. Remember, gaming is about fun and exploration, not life-altering choices.

Pros
-Great Gameplay!
-Great movement!
-Decent story (has some weak points)
-Great Cast
-VERY nice character designs pretty much for everyone
-Game looks great and runs well on a mid tier system.

Cons
-Some disappointing boss fights
-The weak points in the writing are very obvious at times
-Differences in the starting 4 characters aren't vast enough (this is more of a personal thing)
-Basic ish skill trees
-Repetitive missions (could be fixed easily with time)

Overall the game is fun. I've played a ton of destiny and after leaving that game due to it not respecting my wallet this game fills the looter shooter shaped hole in my heart. Only cosmetics will be paid for so that's a huge win as well.

315210,157445306,76561198257146779,649,183,22,0,22,1706664109,"to preface: i have been playing this on my ps5, and i still wanna try this on steam deck. 

also, i am someone who has pre ordered every arkham game, starting with arkham asylum 15 years ago on ps3. i was 5 years old when it came out (i asked my mom to pre order it for me every time :p) and it instantly became one of my favorite games, and i would always replay it. then on to city, origins, and knight, which i had all been massively hyped for. not just hyped, kid hype.

with that said, when they first announced this game back in 2020, i thought the premise was badass, but i hated that rocksteady were abandoning arkham's freeflow combat and were making it live service. and instead of being insanely hyped like i had been for the arkham games, i was highly skeptical and was eventually under false perceptions of rocksteady being shot down on their superman game and WB made them make this (which isnt the case, but they were still handed the project after their previous multiplayer game was canceled). and after the founders left, that solidified my belief, i had originally thought. so with all that, i was pretty against it, and thought it would probably end up like avengers. the trailers also did not do it any justice until they had delayed it, and they put their new trailer out, which looked better. then they had their alpha, which was the first two chapters of the game, and now, release.

turns out, it did not turn out like avengers. the gameplay is incredibly fun and fast. rocksteady made an entirely new gameplay system after completely changing the industry after their last one. highly impressive. im really enjoying the story, and the writing is fantastic. i have lost count the amount of times that i have actually laughed out loud, even when my roommate is sleeping in the same room. 

that being said, it didnt completely dodge the live service negatives. the mission design and gameplay loop is my biggest problem with this game, with a lot of it being repetitive and feeling very samey, and this is used to try and bloat some of the story. the missions made sense in contexts of the story, but they were the same things you have already been doing, and i was just waiting for a unique story mission it felt like. i hope their new content adds more variety into their missions so that this isnt a big issue anymore, but sadly its present in the main story.

also, this game should not have launched with an always online requirement. i had my first server error last night and i just took that as a sign to get off, because i fully could not play unless i restarted or waited or something, didnt bother to try. no clue why this was even considered, but it was actually implemented. also, i personally did not get some skins with the deluxe edition, and when they gave away 2000 vbucks and i claimed it, it did not give me it. stuff like that that is highly annoying probably has to do with their servers or something.

but all that being said, this game is massively overhated. and if you like fast paced third person shooters with a focus on mobility and traversal with skill involved, i highly suggest it. and if you are a fan of guardians of the galaxy, this very much takes that approach trying to replicate james gunn with his suicide squad as well. but obviously, these characters are a lot more villainous and f'ed up than the guardians are. but the story uses that and its written well, being both hilarious and heartfelt and wholesome between the four of them. they bond over their villainy and roast each other.

my one conflicting feeling with the story is how batman's death is handled. i wont spoil anything about it, but i feel like there could've been better ways of handling it, if that is truly the last we see of him. if their entire plan is to eventually bring him back, then i can see that working, but that does not happen in the main story sadly, which i think it should've.

overall, i would recommend this game, i just hope they can give it a reasonable amount of love and new content, and fix some issues with repetitiveness and its missions. and hopefully rocksteady can eventually make some new games, because the development on this one took like 8 years.",1706913908,1706924283,True,1,0,0.435483872890472412,0,True,False,False

It has a fully competent gunplay that is meant to go hand-in-hand with melee, which will give you the ability to juggle foes for guaranteed critical hits, or harvest shields, both of which result to a fun and arcadey combat experience unique to the game. 

Sound effect is on point! It kind of reminds me of Vampire Survivors in a way. That shield harvest sound effect and weapon buff procs sfx makes you feel that you're playing an addictive slots game of some sort and it gets you going when you chain them all together in one big frantic fight. Combat music hits all the right notes and is very appropriate for the likes of the suicide squad. It's dynamic and ramps up based amount of action going on, which is a nice touch.

Loot may feel lackluster at the beginning, but you get to unlock more interesting unique gear further into the advanced difficulties that will let you deck out your characters. Unfortunately, purple tier items and below do not serve ANY function whatsoever. You will have access to legendary tier weapons pretty early on, and since there is no sort of gear score or power level mechanics in play, you won't ever equip a lower rarity item in a slot where you have a legendary available. What makes it even worse is that you will have to CONSTANTLY delete blues and purples if you're on the grind for better gear in the end game which will kill your buzz. Also, deleting items is VERY clunky and the lack of option to delete lower rarity items en masse makes item management sorely FRUSTRATING.

The real star of the show is actually its traversal mechanics. There is no getting around it though. It will take time to get used to each character's unique movement options. BUT! Once it clicks, damn, it CLICKS HARD! As an example, at the start of the game, I felt that Harley's spiderman swinging was difficult to use in actual combat scenarios, but once I got used to it, man, everything became fluid and combat felt dope. Getting around the open city is fun, and coming across enemies and using your traversal attacks to wipe them out is always entertaining. Each squad member handles drastically differently from each other and it makes each character's combat flow unique to each other.

The endgame loop is pretty standard. Doing open world activities will reward you with a currency that you can use to run special missions that can increase in difficulty and reward. Think of it as Diablo 3's Greater Rifts. It is implemented well, and the gear chase will keep the grind going if you're into looters.

Story-wise, the game starts off VERY strong, but right at the end, it somewhat under-delivers. Feels like is a severe case of ""best foot forward"" overall. Fortunately, it's still a pretty good time and a lot of the jokes land. Interactions between the squad members are full of quips and banters and the anti-hero humor hits especially if you're tired of all the generic super hero stuff that popped up in recent times.  It's the Suicide Squad just being the Suicide Squad - 4 idiots being idiots. At first I thought King Shark was just a Drax reskin, and I don't like Drax that much at all. But going through the story made me love the shark man and how different he is from the rest of the criminals he's with. He's not malicious, and he has a good heart, to an extent. Since the protagonists are pretty much villains in the comics, the writers can get away with jokes that otherwise could have not been used in any other situation. There are extremely cool parts of the story though, particularly a couple of sections related to the batman, epecially if you are familiar with the Arkham games.

Performance wise, there are some hitches here and there and frame drops do happen depending on the on-screen effects. I also experienced a random crash as well.

TL:DR

This game gets a lot of flak for being a live service title, but in all honesty, its a pretty fun and competent one that gives you an addicting enough loop that will keep you going well into its end game.

However, the side content is notably repetitive, and the completion system is handled poorly with time-consuming loot boxes. The challenge to complete missions is too easy, limiting strategies with specific attacks. The rewards are mediocre.

Regarding the story, it's okay, but whoever scripted it seems to deviate from certain DC lore guidelines. The numerous well-made cutscenes showcase great characters and all the main characters so far have suprised me.

Traversals are unique and easy but challenging to master. Gunplay becomes enjoyable when experimenting with different characters and adjusting playstyles based on enemy numbers.

As of now, without added content from WB, the game stands at a 6.5/10. There's potential for improvement, and if Rocksteady delivers more diverse content, the game is worth trying.

In terms of optimization, I play on full settings, including ray tracing, without updating any drivers, and surprisingly, the game runs smoothly. After 20 hours in early access, it has yet to crash, and I haven't encountered any FPS drops.",1706897240,1706924020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

*I got in on day 1 of PC early access and did not get kick out of server nor encountered any bug. Frame rate is super smooth, 70 to 90 fps 4K resolution, did not need to do any setting adjustment. I'm on RTX 3080Ti, i7 12700k. 

1) Story, facial and voice acting. 
-As of writing this on 10hrs playtime, I had not completed the story. I did not rush thru the main story back to back; did some sides mission/riddles puzzle to unlock new features/lore and loot in the MASSIVE beautiful open world. 
-voice acting is super high class feeling in which u can feel the emotions of the dialogues. It's not mono tones. 
-facial animation is the best and top notch! During close up cinematic cut scenes, every main character and NPC u can see the micro expressions on their face. 
-lots of funny moments actions, not just dialogues. The comedy part of this game is even better than guardian of the galaxy (which I completed). Because the 4 members of SS will make hell break loose in a funny way inside the game. 
-story I would not say it's rich (witcher 3 rich) because that's the gene of live service game where story is not the focus. However, it's quite immersive as every part there is surprise and u would not have expected this would happen. Glad that in this game it was being interpreted exactly in the movies where suicide squad is not a totally evil teams, they do have a good side but don't want to show it out. 

2) Combat (the main fun!) 
-combat is very fluid smooth transition from Melee to range to explosive to changing weapon to dodge to transversal to special moves there is literally zero down time. 
-the shots fired from different types of weapon u can feel the hit impact, it feels life-liked bullet impact. I played a major chuck of hours on competitive FPS and would say that SSKTJL have somewhat similar feel on the firing of different types weapons (SMG VS heavy rifle LMG etc.). 
-screen can be chaotic most of the times during mission but this is also the difficult part because u can die anytime from stray bullets (if u stay on same position for too long) 
-the chaotic part of combat is immersive because they want u to be airborne most of the time to make use of the unique transversal method that I had not seen before over my 5 years of gaming. 
-characters have few sets of powerful animated special attack that change then tides of battle.

3) RPG system
-the loot is diversify and skill tree makes a major difference in ur power. It's a min-max-er dream come true! 
-different character uses different sets of weapons. And different sets of weapons have different augmentation with different playstyle. So there is no excuse to say all characters only ""shoot guns"". 

I had not get to end game yet because I'm still enjoying the story main mission which comes from someone who loves single-player story driven game. However playing co-op turn the fun up to another high level. 

Last but not least, it's understandable that people have otherwise opinions. But if this game were to made by other dev that did not made any batman game before, people will sure have more positive experience. So just because it's not the game expected from a dev and start nitpicking every aspect of gameplay; which is proven good by other players too (gameplay wise).",1706920385,1706920385,True,5,1,0.498218506574630737,0,True,False,False

I've had some bugs with pre-order and deluxe content I'll get later and some bugs in game, but those aside the game is honestly great. Mastering the combat is a blast when you get the hang of it and get into a flow building up combo points, which activate passives to make you build even more momentum. I haven't reached endgame yet and am still toward the end of the story with the peeps I'm playing with. I'll update my review after the story and again after I'm into endgame. What I can say is that so far the story is good and gameplay is great. Bugs right now are going to hurt perception of this, but I say give it a shot. Some design choices like standing in circles to activate story progression, standing around to listen to story beats, or Waller yelling at you all can be annoying along with server issues.

Now I knew years ago that I wanted this game based on the combat and movement alone, the fact that the game plays exactly how it looked when it was previewed years ago which was a selling point for me. I can see why the game play loop would become repetitive for some people. 

The Bad:
-Story: So far I haven't really done that much main quests only on chapter 3 but it seems alright, the writing isn't overall spectacular from Rock steady standards.

- Ingame store: It's just costumes so far hopefully we don't see guns and resources for crafting

- Enemies: would of likes to see a little more depth for enemy variety 

The Good:

-Combat: everything from the shooting to air traversability is a really good selling point it's refreshing to play a fun shooter that doesn't really punish you for wanting to play a certain way 

-Gear crafting: isn't over complicated and doesn't take crazy resources finding them isn't a hassle as every enemy you come across drops something


Suicide Squad Kill the justice League is an overall 8/10 for me, if you're looking for a fun looter shooter to dumb some hours in I'd recommend this game despite what you've heard about it

The only pleasant surprise I got out of this short game is that the gameplay is actually pretty decent, but the story was complete dog poop, but It's way better than Avengers game and Gotham Knights. What they did with all the justice league heros was probably the lamest thing about this game. The boss battles are so bad that they make the fights in Arkham Knight look good. Literally The Flash, Green Latern, Brainiac and Batman have 3 moves at most. The missions in this game are so boring that it reminds me of the Gollum game and never even played that game. For some reason they decided to bring The Riddler into the game, but he really has no point to be in this game besides to keep incorporating the ""grind"" from the past Arkham games. The narrative of this game is so laughably bad it hurts and the ending is just overall terrible. The true ending to this universe was Arkham Knight and the writers should be ashamed to take credit for this flaming pile of poop.

Is this game a 10/10 game you should absolutely be rushing out to play? - no, but its a perfectly great looter-shooter similar to Borderlands than anything else it'll be compared to.

The story was a lot of fun, yes they kill Arkham Batman and that sucks but people saying its not ""Lore-accurate"" is cringe as fuck. Literally anything that isn't a main line comic is non-canon, I'd rather Rocksteady take a swing and tell an original story that just copy and paste from comics.

Go in with an open-mind, you'll probably have a great time.

Shooting feels solid.
Melee is a little floaty but otherwise hits hard.
Character vibes are solid.
Humours a bit hit or miss - read goofy.
Single player runs a dream, AI teammates are... decent, they shoot, they hit, they kill enemies.
Looter shooter - weapons and character modifications drop from enemies ; cosmetic and appearances are skin and swatch based - some skins seem to unlock through gameplay and challenges but some are available on a cash shop.

Cash shop is a bit of a... bad taste but if the season passes proceed as advertised and remain around for the player to choose and work through at their own pace - It's forgivable.
Purely cosmetics - probably owing to the multiplayer aspect - bets looking always gets highest score - but still there is a cash store.

Story/Cinematic: 10

Feels like an awesome DC movie. Fighting the justice league is such a twist too. There are some parts that are a bit grotesque and definitely not suitable for children.

Gameplay/Gun shooting: 8

Feels intuitively smooth but not perfect. Hard to juggle the enemies and camera can get lost at times. Needs sensitivity tuning to get it right.

Character customization/Looting: 9

I can see the potential builds between talents and items. But the skill trees really serve as a ladder with some options for tweaking. But this is probably good for new players. 

Graphics/Music: 10

Such a good looking game. No joke. Love it.

Overall Rating: 9

There are bugs especially in multiplayer. This is why people hate live service games but how else can you play with friends? It'll take some time to squash the bugs out. But the game is awesome solo for now.

[b] Pros: [/b]
- Combat feels very fluid and has a lot of ""punch"" to it.
- The movement and traversal is really smooth, reminds me of Crackdown.
- Game looks pretty good graphical wise.
- Story was pretty mid, but I enjoyed the little jokes and references.

[b] Cons: [/b]
- The UI is kind of a fucking mess.
- A couple of glitches here and there.
- Had a few crashes in cut scenes
- Cosmetic store with micro transactions
- 70 dollar price tag
- Some of the boss fights are kinda lackluster, especially Batman's

I want to start by saying that I dislike multiplayer games. Just like everybody else, my first reaction when I learned that this would be an always online live service was beyond disappointed. I would also like to add that I'm a huge fan of the Rocksteady Arkham Trilogy. And the fact that Rocksteady, this amazing studio behind the Arkham Trilogy was spending years on this live service game instead of a singleplayer game added to my disappointment. HOWEVER. What is currently happening with news and review outlets is completely unfair. We cannot judge a game by what we wanted from the developer, we should only judge it by what the actual game is. The game is fucking awesome. First of all, yes it's always online but my guy if you're playing this game on a pc in your home, you are connected to internet. But that doesn't mean you have to play it with other people. I'm playing it as a singleplayer game and have no complaints so far, and the fact that you can play with your friends if you want to is a bonus. The graphics is f****** incredible. The game looks just beautiful, and my gaming pc which is 3-4 years old can run it on highest settings with relative ease. THE GAMEPLAY IS UNBELIEVABLY FUN. I don't remember the last time screaming out loud, 'THIS IS SO MUCH FUN'. And the story is also very captivating. In the end, you have a game that looks nice, plays nice, has good story. Is it a Bioshock, no! Is it Arkham City, no! But it's still so much fun and damn worth your money. Let me mention again that I hate, hate, hate multiplayer games. I'm not a fanboy of either Rocksteady or looter shooters. The gaming news and review outlets have been extremely hateful towards this game, including myself, before the release.

The first season drops next month so it has enough to tide someone over until then, but the game will probably need a constant influx of new content to keep it going. The core gameplay loop is engaging enough that you don't mind doing the same things over and over, but as mentioned it'll need new mission types eventually to stay interesting. The characters have enough difference in their traversal and weapons used to feel distinct from each other even when there's occasional overlap. 

On the negative side, sometimes the dialogue overlaps or cuts off in gameplay while traversing the city which is a bit annoying when you actually want to listen to it and some of the jokes don't really land. I don't think it ever gets too annoying but YMMV. Story quality is subjective but for what it is it's okay. The character interactions are probably the best part of the game rather than the actual story which is pretty simple. 

Overall I think the game is pretty good and on my personal scale I'd put it at like a 7.5. For reference one of my favourite games ever is in this range (Dragon's Dogma). As more content gets added that might bump it up but the game on launch is a fairly solid package with a good gameplay loop.

-Great gameplay. A ton of depth and skill expression. If you have a shooting itch and enjoy learning cool movement this a game for you. 

-The main story is an extended tutorial, the difficulty spikes at the end game with multiple players is pretty nuts. Genuinely hilarious writing at times.

-Way too much talking from the enemies in the overworld. Braniac, riddler and batman never stfu.

- Theres some light competitive features in the multiplayer that encourage trying your best if you want to decide what to do. Every incursion is a time trial and you will always be compared to your friends and clan mates.

- Performance has been stable. No crashes. There are some weird bugs in the endgame that need to be smoothed over. For some reason mastery doesn't progress for some people. 

- One time a group of enemies didn't spawn in an incursion until I suicided and ran out the protection clock which led to a significant increase in difficulty. 

- Sometimes It wont allow me to claim an item for a minute or two. Nothing game breaking though. 

- The squad ultimate needs to be changed.  They should be different for every character and impactful like any other ultimate ability. The unique mechanic of only one ult choice for the team gives an intersting strategic choice for groups that want to coordinate to win.

However lets go over some pros and cons This is a game set in the Arkham universe not to be mistaken with a single player Arkham game that also runs on different engines if you're looking for Arkham Knight here you wont get it.

Pros
- Funny dialog and dynamic often reminds me of a guardian of the galaxy team up
- The characters are unique and fun to play
- The combat feels good as far as loot shooters go
- Open world with lots of different things to do as well
- A lot of customization as far as character and weapons go 
- Fun looter shooter if you like games like Border Lands, Destiny, etc

Cons
- A few side jobs are repetitive and often have stupid restrictions on them to complete often result in a fail 
- The Riddler is in the game and while some would like this the Riddler challenges were my personal worst parts of the Arkham games
- The game being a live service game with battle passes is a bit of a drag
- The overall killing of the JL and letting multiverse characters appear in this game / world is also a huge drag in my opinion.
- The upgrades are a bit of a slow grind as well my weapons and even DLC weapons are better and dont keep up with the penguins shop so there is often never any upgrades though I am sure that will change over the course of the game.

Usually a lot of people including myself don't typically enjoy a live service game for obvious reasons but I have never seen any reason to be disappointed by Rocksteady so I am going to let them cook, That being said I dont want this to be the norm with future games.

Overall though the game is fun I am glad a lot of players are enjoying it despite the unwarranted hate and I am glad to see its not review bombed either! I would recommend it if not now definitely on a sale.",1706914931,1706914931,True,2,1,0.48617476224899292,0,True,False,False

I am absolutely enjoying this game.  All the characters have a great feel to them and each is as interesting as the other in the way that they navigate the city.  Shark's massive leaps are just as fun as zipping around with boomerang's... well boomerang.  I have a pretty beefy system so everything runs amazing.  I get 120hz cut scenes, but that does dip a bunch once you are in big battles, but my system maintained a reasonable 60 fps during it.  There's a ton of fan service to fans of Rocksteady's previous games.

This is a great game to turn your brain off to and just cause massive destruction throughout Metropolis and you can do it with friends.  If Rocksteady makes good on their promises, this game is going to be a living thing with new missions, bad guys, etc.  

I don't have everything unlocked so take this part with a grain of salt.  I get that the streets of Metropolis are supposed to feel empty due to the alien abduction, but damn it feels really empty, at least in the beginning.  It's starting to stretch out with the story, but it would be nice if we were able to interact more with the city.

TLDR;  Really fun, frenetic, third person shooter with a really good story (up to the point where I'm at) that you can also play with 3 other friends.  Performance leaves something to be  desired during big fights but nothing game breaking.  Traversing metropolis is a ton of fun but the city feels really empty(so far), but it does seem like it's fleshing itself out.

* Systems from Arkham are done here, such as multiple dodges/movement abilities, ranged counter attacks, Rock/Paper/Scissor melee combat that smoothy picks targets
* Deep and interesting build mechanics later, but while leveling its rather simplistic. Difficulty ramps up rather high once the story is done

A lot of the criticism of this game is its rewrite of a lot of things to make it ""woke"" or ""hip with the kids"" and yeah. WB definitely demanded that from Rocksteady along with the layers of live service crap that doesn't work.
And that's a great way to describe this game: Something that can be fun but just doesn't work due to live service and modern crap we as players want to take a moral high ground on but don't do it correctly. The discussion should be about the quality of the game and substance. Is this a game worth your time vs the cost? What does it do good? What does it need to improve on or dropped the ball on?

TLDR; (because i know a wall of text sucks so heres a summary)
this had actual potential to be a good to mid 4 player co op experience that got forced to do a crap live service model. It's close to being an actual good game with updates and overhauls minus the meh to bleh story. Will it get that? Well there's 4 seasons planned and the content besides the premium battlepass with cosmetics only is free. That's not too bad and the new characters are exciting if you are as hyped with the movement as me. It's not worth 70. It's not worth the 100 for deluxe. There's a lot to love. A lot to hate. It's a shame the conversations around the game further it probably dying in the future but on the subject of the game itself it just could be more. Maybe pick it up on sale if you're lookin for a really mid experience and hopefully it gets a offline mode to just exist long term because I'd love to at least see the game fix itself and allow others to try the movement at a reasonable price point. But that's most likely too hopeful. 
Hate WB Games for how they continue to butcher and poorly manage their IPs in chase of cash.

Combat:
Probably the most fun but jarring experience. When you master it, you feel great as a player in the world. Builds could be more inspired but when it all comes together, it affects gameplay in amazing ways.
Enemies aren't the worst either despite the criticism. With some more polish, they'd at least be ok fodder for the general game. It's the larger enemies where the game just stops working. 
And things not working is a common theme. Afflictions (elements) tried something new but just leaves most of them not worth using vs electric which just makes all hits critical. Ez game. Ez life. Some perks just do not work out in combat like they want to
When this combat works though my god does it work. it's smooth, it flows well and each character is distinct.

Loot: 
This isn't bad but isn't good either? No gear score is great. It removes the urge to use something worse for the number. That said, most could be cut from the game and you'd never notice. It's pretty obvious that this system worked in a more Destiny like game but in this? No. Not at all. 
Builds can be really really unique but with so many downsides to juggle it leaves you always feeling like a double edged sword instead of a continuous building of power

Movement:
Talked about in combat it alone needs to be talked about. F*** yes. It's not perfect but I genuinely feel great moving around this world. It's a super dense city that you can choose to parkour the rooftops or go through this ravaged really cool looking city streets. This is one movement game no matter what I'll think fondly of for the feeling it gives in control. And I even did it on keyboard and mouse. There's a learning curve and some rebinding needed but god damn is it just good.

Story:
This is not a Arkham game. No matter what marketing you've seen or what flash words some exec said lied flat out. It sure does have references all over and its like oh hey I know that but no. The writing, tone, everything IS NOT ARKHAM. 
So noting that and giving this its own shot, it's obvious some very heavy reworks last minute happened. When you meet the fallen heroes, you're introduced to this period where the Justice League has become god like to the point where people just think the heroes have everything handled. It's a neat idea and some of the cutscenes, jokes, and just overall plot points land but its kind of like a hydra always giving you 2 reasons with each good to be disappointed or left wanting more.
The invasion kind of feels like a half baked narrative with no real direction to utilize the awesome setting it is trying to play off of. For a game where you kill the JL, it did not feel like I killed them. Some of the characters are a great version of JL members too. I tried so much just to get back into the story but it actively kills itself through randomness and no direction.
Also we got a really solid Wonder Woman that is a real shame she didn't do more than be a random set piece to throw lines for trailers.

The UI:
You'll hate it because holy crap is this bad. You can turn a lot of hud elements off due to community request which is great but if you have to do that, maybe overhaul the UI. It's just too much. It speaks for itself if you watch gameplay but when you turn a lot of it off it at least lowers how annoying it is. There's a menu for everything and dialogue to boot. AND THE MISSION REWARD SCREEN this left over loot box mechanic they obviously had to scrap needs to just go. it's a great idea in game but LET ME SEE IT IN GAME not a black screen with a drop pod opening slowly.

And unfortunately, everything else this game struggles with:
Bugs bugs bugs because live service was half baked
social menus that don't work
sub menus for menus
multiple materials you dont care about
a uninspired shop overpriced with a premium currency
THEY MADE ME WANT BATMAN TO SHUT UP (with brainiac after) the characters on enemy coms do not shut the F*** up
uninspired skill tree and random number percentages that all shlooters do

I enjoyed the story so far. 
Characters are well done, there are quite a few funny moments. 
It gets quite dark too especially watching some of your favourite heroes becoming menacing serial killers. 
But hey it is in the title...

Zipping around the map is pretty cool, it needs some getting used to especially with HQ but it is quite fun.
Shooting is good, and it feels satisfying to pull of some special moves.
I have about 11 hours at the time of writing this, and only just defeated Green Lantern, and haven't touched any of the Enigma quests. 

My main concern is that really are only a few types of missions with some added modifiers to make it more interesting but it still feels a bit meh... So far it kept me entertained but can it keep me around grinding after? 
No, I don't think so.

While moving around feels different across all the characters the talent trees of each character kinda feel the samey... 
To be fair I haven't really cared so far about min/maxing anything.

Guns are kinda cool, they have modifiers that can change how you use them.

Performance is a bit meh... it runs mostly smooth (i9700, 3090) without ray tracing with balanced DLSS, however I am getting some serious stutters. The game freezes for like 3sec completely then comes back again... Does not happen often but super annoying when it does.

Overall I think it is an ok game at it is current state. I am having fun with it and I am enjoying what it has to offer and curious about what it has in store for the future, however the current asking price might be a bit too steep for the amount of content that comes with it at this moment.

Long answer:
~SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW. EARLY ACCESS.






~
I was pleasantly surprised with the first playthrough.
All I knew going in was ""Brainiac has control over the JL,"" and ""the game is a live service but the content is free and each season pass is strictly cosmetic, but you can go back to previous seasons after they finish.""
This game is getting a lot of undeserved flak just for not being a Justice League game.
Making a Justice League game would not have worked. They are SUPERheroes for a reason, with SUPER powers that are nearly* impossible to counter. Finding the counters to those powers was most of this game.

STORY: 7/10. THE IDEA WAS THERE, BUT IT'S TOO SHORT. This is for the story itself, not the way that the story was told. Brainiac has taken control of Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and The Flash, and is trying to take over Earth and transform it into a copy of Colu. Amanda Waller assembles the Suicide Squad to help Wonder Woman take on Brainiac and the corrupted Justice League.
It's a nice, fresh story. We don't see those very often. The only iterations of Suicide Squad outside of the comics that I know of are on the CW shows and the movie from 2016 that wasn't received very well.
However, I finished my playthrough in TEN hours. I played the whole thing on the hardest difficulty, did MOST of the side content and took my sweet time reading and listening to collectibles. This game could have gone for days for me if the comic-accurate Justice League was present. For reference, Spider-Man 2 on Ultimate and Ultimate New Game+ took 23 hours in total. Even Spider-Man 2 was larger than this game.

STORYTELLING: 5/10. WATCH AN AWARD-WINNING MOVIE, THEN WATCH THIS. The story is pretty simple to understand... once you've completed it. If you were completely blind to the marketing for this game or the comics part of DC, the game itself does not do a good job of explaining. 
You just have to assume Brainiac is the main villain by looking at his ship or have prior knowledge from comics. I don't think he's even mentioned by name until two hours in. It's like the devs assumed you watched all the trailers and followed the game's development AND recently read a bunch of comics.
The tutorial is so bad it should be optional. The tutorial just has the squad separated in a desolate land and you play as each of the characters making their way to a rendezvous point with their traversal tech. Having to memorize the aerial controls for four different characters as the FIRST thing you do in the game is not a good feeling. They could have excluded this platforming section and just started the story from the beginning, then had us learn the traversal tech when we acquired it.
The storytelling hurts: there's cringe dialogue, cringe comedic relief, and the protagonists have a lot of plot armor in the first act, but these problems aren't exclusive to Suicide Squad. (Marvel games have some cringe dialogue too.) I understand Harley and Captain Boomerang being comedic and childish because it's in their characters, but hearing Deadshot say ""My kill count is sky high!"" while shooting from the air kinda made me cringe. 
Shark's whole character development is ""I don't understand humor, so I'm trying to learn how to be funny,"" but he's constantly going from low to high energy in his voice lines and they normally don't fit the combat setting/pace. You could be standing afk in free roam and he'll get all high-energy for no reason.
There was also a line that played during free roam where Boomerang asked Deadshot if he liked kids? Not sure why that was implemented.
Regarding plot armor, there were so many times the JL could have just killed the SS. They use the excuse of [paraphrasing] ""Brainiac doesn't think the SS is worthy/powerful enough to be serving him"" a few times, but we also hear [not paraphrased] ""Brainiac has taken 99% of the population and is still searching for stragglers."" From hearing that voice line, Brainiac should have been hunting the SS from the start, not waiting for them to take on the JL first.
There's also a lot of cutscenes where characters just stand around? There's a cutscene between the tutorial and the first mission where it's literally freeze frame instances where the camera ever so slightly pans across the frozen 3D models like it's The Walking Dead: Destinies. Most of the important cutscenes with story revelations have characters standing in shock.
My largest gripe in the plot is the way we handled Superman. In the marketing that I watched after beating the campaign, the devs stated that the ratio of four Justice League members and four Suicide Squad members was very intentional. HQ knows Batman. DS and Green Lantern are rivals. CB and The Flash hate each other. King Shark... was advertised as ""one of the only beings powerful enough to take on Superman."" KS did not have a significant role in killing Superman. They could've scrapped Shark and put in a Superman villain.

GAMEPLAY: 9/10. BUILDCRAFTING GO BRRRRRRRR. Think... The gunplay from The Division 2, with abilities from Destiny 2. Both have great combat systems and SS has the best parts of both. The combat feels fantastic, the guns are snappy and reload fast, and the abilities all have a purpose instead of ""this does X damage, this does Y damage."" There are buffs and debuffs. Armor and weapon mods. Weak spots on larger/tankier enemies. This is far above the bare minimum.
I first tried out Harley, thinking that her grappling would feel similar to the Arkham trilogy or the grapple swinging would feel like Insomniac's Spider-Man, but I was VERY disappointed. The grapple takes forever to lock on to ledges, and the swinging is clunky like the Avengers game. After the first mission, I swapped to DS. DS' jetpack lets me reposition above cover, and aiming makes me hover in place. CB can zip across large distances and gaps, allowing for CQC. I had no desire to play as Shark or go back to Harley.
The objectives are simple enough for a shooter. Defend several points. Bring civilians to point D. Defend C. Kills drop X. Deposit Z. Destroy A to unshield B. Those sorts of things.
My main gripe with the gameplay is the Support Squad's challenges you'll find around the map. They're just like the other objectives, but the active modifiers could have been done better. A modifier is a gameplay rule active in an instance, like 'headshots only' or 'collect X to do damage.' Being told you can't shoot something in a shooter game is not fun.
My only other gripe is that, similar to early Destiny, all classes just feel like a damage-class with similar abilities. King Shark is not a tank, nor a melee-based character. Harley is not a lightweight, nor a fast-moving character. All characters have identical grenades. The only variance in gunplay is that characters are locked to three weapon types. DS is locked to snipers, pistols, and assault rifles. To think that the world's ""deadliest assassin"" who is ""proficient in all types of firearms"" is locked to three weapon types. Deadshot should be proficient in all weapons! 

OPTIMIZATION: -/10. NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL. I have a Ryzen 9 5950X and an RX7900XT. I can get 150 frames consistently on ultra settings in combat in Destiny 2. Here, I barely break 40 on high settings. I'm terrified at the thought of a PS5 running this game at all.

The game is supposed to grow over the coming year. I don't think there's a single thing they could do in the coming seasons that would fix my current gripes with the game, and it's tough to think about how the worst parts of this game (the base story and a portion of the base gameplay mechanics) have to stay the way they are while the good parts (the looting/shooting) just get better. 
I’ll be watching to see how large the free seasons are.

7/10. Treat it like a box-model game, not a live-service, and you'll enjoy it more.",1706907926,1706913080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While there are some minor visual bugs present, they don't detract from the overall enjoyment, whether you're playing solo or with friends. Speed runners might find the game shorter, but as a completionist, there are plenty of engaging side quests and tasks to discover, keeping you immersed in the world. For die-hard DC enthusiasts, purchasing at full price is recommended. However, for more casual fans or those hesitant about the price tag, waiting for a sale might be a better choice, considering the steep base game cost of $100. I'm currently enjoying the game and trying to squeeze the most out of it. Props to the team behind the game, has been a mostly smooth launch process compared to most AAA+ games these days.

Calling all anti-heroes! Brace yourselves for a wild ride with ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,"" the latest offering from Rocksteady Studios. Buckle up, because this game is equal parts explosive fun, quirky characters, and head-scratching decisions.

Let's dive into the good, the bad, and the Harley Quinn-tastic:

Story: Brace yourself for a decent, not groundbreaking, narrative. It's about the Suicide Squad taking on brainwashed Justice League members. It's enjoyable if you dig comic book shenanigans, but might leave you lukewarm if you crave Shakespearean depth.

Characters: Rocksteady truly shines here! Each squad member - from the psychotic charm of Harley Quinn to the brute strength of King Shark - feels distinct and well-developed. Their interactions are hilarious and banter-filled, even if some lines teeter on the edge of cringe.

Gameplay: Ah, the meat of the experience! Movement is a joy, with each character offering unique traversal styles. Swinging through the city as Harley is exhilarating, while stomping around as King Shark is a power trip. Gunplay is tight and responsive, a rare gem in today's gaming landscape.

Side Quests: This area needs work. They're repetitive and uninspired, feeling more like chores than engaging activities. However, the live-service model promises future improvements, so there's hope!

Fun Factor: Let's be honest, this game is pure, chaotic fun. Squad up with friends and the experience explodes. Even with random teammates, laughter and mayhem are guaranteed.

Overall: ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"" isn't perfect, but it's a solid adventure with loads of potential. If you crave a unique shooter experience with a quirky cast, dive in. Just remember, you're here for the fun, not the Pulitzer Prize-winning story.

Bonus Tip: For an even wilder ride, crank up the difficulty! It'll test your teamwork and make every victory feel legendary.

So, is it worth your time? Absolutely, if you embrace the craziness. Just remember, it's not for everyone. But hey, even Harley Quinn would tell you that's part of the charm, right?

Suicide squad is fun, funny, and frolic. I personally enjoy the banter between characters, they are always making fun of each other and have really funny acting. Game play shines in this game. You could not ask for a better group to lead a game, movie, or comic like these four.

Good: Very well optimized and no bugs so far.  Voice acting is great, and story is interesting.  Movement is fluid, and shooting feels fine.

Bad:  UI of menus is terrible and very confusing.  The screen is constantly covered with ""stuff"" making it hard to see in combat.  No variation in game play, it is all the same chaotic routine of get shields, kill snipers, get shields, melee, get shields, repeat.  NPCs never...stop...talking.  This game has no reason what-so-ever to be live service.  I actually like live service when it is done well, but I can't see how this lives on.  Rocksteady is better than this, so it was obviously top management pushing for cash.

If you can get past some of the unsavory business practices, there is a fun third-person looter shooter here that is unique in my book.

Not sure if this is going to be something I can sink hundreds of hours into, but what I have played so far, I really liked. Unique encounters with the ""villains"" and boss battles all have their own mechanics. Each of the 4 characters feels unique and impact-ful. Enemy AI is meathead-ish, definitely a quantity over quality type of situation. Flying around doing trick shots is great.

I've been playing for 3 hrs so far and im really enjoying the game, playing on high graphics and turned off Ray Tracing and i have not encountered any problems.
Not gone too far into the story but really looking forward to the rest and love the Museum where you get quick story recap and info about the Arkham games and what happened before, i know bits and pieces of the Arkham games as i've only played Arkham Knight years back on ps4.
I really love the Harley Quinn bat grapple as it really remindes me of Arkham knight.
I love the gun play and i just can't wait to do more and more, even got some friends to do co-op at some point.
Honestly i say give it a try if you want, again not every game is for everybody and some will like it and some will not, there's no pleasing everyone.

CONS: 
- The fps can drop sometimes but that's normal considering the game JUST came out. 

- There isn't a super huge variety of missions quite yet it's kinda the same idea but they slap different objective ""themes"" to it

- For some reason it seems like leveling up takes forever. Maybe that ones just me.

- I had a bug where the sound didn't link up properly to the cutscene so things would be said but the characters wouldn't actually mouth the words until 5 seconds later. 

PROS
- Characters are PERFECT representations of their comic counters. They are written well. ""Cheesy"" dialogue (exactly how they're meant to be) and all. 

- The JL boss fights are EXTREMELY unique. They're very fun to play and represent the powers of the JL member perfectly 

- I personally find some of the dialogue hilarious. 

- Feels like they did way more things better than the avengers game. Like avoided alot of the issues that made avengers fail

- Upcoming DLC are free. Every character, mission, everything. 100% free. 

- Every character has melee. All those people saying ""why do king shark and boomer use guns"" they don't just use range. Every character has melee options. Boomer uses his boomerang and KS uses whatever weapons you equip. Usually hooks or butcher knives. Plus they all have really cool finishers that are melee exclusive no guns involved. 



OVERALL
- I'd rate it a 7.8/10 so far. The repetitive missions and fps drops can be very annoying at times but the story is great. Followed up by a suicide squad that feels exactly like the suicide squad should. Gameplay itself is fun. I'd recommend it right now. With MULTIPLE upcoming DLCs and multiple new things to look forward to, it looks and sounds very promising. Now, for all I know, it could get worse. Or not change at all and stay how it is now. Nobody knows the future. Ill leave it on this. Don't let anybodys opinion change how you feel. If you wanna play it, then play it! And if you dont like it There's refunds for a reason. If you don't like the game in general or weren't looking forward to it that's perfectly ok too. Everyone has a right to their own opinion.

A. Took a little tweaking with the graphical options to get my FPS to a stable 60 - 80 FPS. I don't usually make a big fuss about it, but during the later hours you have so many things shooting at you it's hard not to die to a random lag spike.

B. Thereare really only 4 types of side missions with different challenge modifiers added to them. They are rotated around the map to unlock new weapons or gear upgrades you can craft at Penguin.

C. The Weapon system is nice, but Rocksteady put an OP ass class of gun, at least in my opinion (Black mask), that I never stopped using the gun. 

D. The game can be pretty buggy sometimes. Especially in some of the side missions where you have to kill these little spider like fuckers and they don't seem to spawn for you when there is only one or two enemies left. It's really infuriating. You really have to move quickly in those missions.

E. The games content as far as things to do within the game does not justify 70 - 100 dollar price tag. I am a bit disappointed in that. But if your fortunate enough buy it and play it. If you are not in a fortunate circumstance I don't think it's a bad idea waiting for a sale. Apparently Joker is being released in 3 months or so. They will probably do another bundle with more content. That could also be an option.

Pros

A. Story - If you like James Gunn movies and dialogue (which I am a big fan of) then you will appreciate the obvious inspiration they took from his movies. King Shark really reminds me of Drax. I love that cause I loved Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy. The actors and voice actors did an excellent job. And DAMN Debra Wallace as Waller does a really good job at making you hate her. 

B. I am not sure why every one is so butt hurt about the Heroes' portrayal in this game. They are casted really well out of the gate. They also make them almost God like. The game is constantly reminding you how much weaker you are. Taking them out takes a very large group effort. All the cinematics so far is my team getting their ass handed to them over and over and I think it is hilarious. Sure the Super Heroes die... but guys really; there gonna be back. There is no way WB and Rocksteady are believed to be so stupid that they would not bring back the real money maker. We all know everyone wants to play with Superman. 

C. The mechanics are kind of drip fed to you. I still have 2 slots in my inventory grayed out. Not even sure what its for yet. The story pacing is great though.

D. The Arcadey feel of the shooting feels nice and serviceable. Very similar to fortnight. 

E. Explosions, explosions, particle effects, and more explosions. I don't know if this is a pro, but it does look and feel pretty cool when you unload a magazine and literally see and alien burst into blood and guts. 

F. Nice enough skill tree so far. Kinda wish you can earn levels faster tho. That's leaving a bit to be desired. 

G.Don't let content creators get to you. I've seen a lot of bias reviews on the main stream media outlets and youtube. Basically summed up as ""Well the game is good, I had a good time, it has a lot of good things going for it, and a lot of things that need to be added, and as a live service game it may take off, BUT they disrespected my imaginary Super hero Homeboys. The game sucks.""

I just like getting to the action.But i actually only skipped 1 cut scene and it was by accident and i was mad about it, i am not saying this game has the best story ever but it was entertaining. The cut scenes, character models, voice acting were all very well made. And a group of very talented people but a lot into this game and it shows. So, to all of you, Thank you, great job you should be proud. 
Does it follow all of DC universes story~ don't know don't care. Was it cool beating up on DC heroes~ Yep.
This game checks a lot of boxes for me. And this is a great sandbox that can be tweaked here and there when needed. Content added time to time. Whatever, i am here for it.
was Destiny the perfect game at launch? was the Division? and i can name a few more.. i think we all could.Anyways, if you like looters and shooting and fun. Here you go.

My only downside is the boss fights, They felt quite underwhelming, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS POST.

Flash was interesting he had different phases each time you did certain amount of damage but overall it was the same thing build up the flash charge then do damage until he was killed..

Green Lantern was pretty much the same only you shoot down his creations then do damage until he is fully down..

Batman.. Oh boy where do we begin.. That is not how you do a boss fight with the worlds greatest detective..  HE DOESN'T EVEN FIGHT YOU IN PHYSICAL FORM? I don't get how you can fumble such a great opportunity for a batman boss fight.. Its pretty much spray at his demon form dodge the stuff he throws at you..

Superman was probably the best boss fight out of the first 3, he actually felt challenging nothing more to really say.

Brainiac.. Pretty much flash v2 boss fight.. not really a great way to end the story with a repeat of the first boss fight of the main story..

My only suggestion being is in the seasons please please please try and switch the fights up as yes it shows Superman and Green lantern redesigned boss fights are coming but I really don't want to do the same fights again.. as for Brainiac if we do get another boss fight for him each season please don't make him transform into a justice league member just to get the same fights again..

With the ability to access elseworlds bring in new justice league members to fight. Have the story play out where each elseworld brainiac recruits new justice league members that we have to take down over the course of each episode..

If we get 4 seasons a year and you aim for us to fight 12 more Brainiacs that means we won't see the TRUE ENDING until late 2026... If all we are doing is fighting the same justice league/brainiac members with the same format fights over and over.. this game won't make it to year 2..

You can freely swap between them in the open world before missions in single player and multiplayer. The story so far is very short but also pretty dense with amazing voice acting. The story itself isn't anything supremely spectacular but it is very ""comic book"" and enjoyable if you like those kinds of stories.

The gripes I have with the game are mainly QoL stuff that already exist in looter shooters but is somehow missing from the game:

* Cannot see loot before picking it up, and after picking it up you have to go into the specific equipment slot menu.
* Mission reward animation cannot be skipped.
* Switching equipment can be a bit of a slog with the menu.
* Not sure of how powerful you are until you either breeze through or get wrecked.

The issues I have with the gameplay itself are mainly with the damage type missions - these are enormously annoying if your build isn't set up for it. Currently there is a bit of repetition with the available content, but the way the story sets up the endgame allows for a lot of possibilities so there is a lot of potential.

It is quite fun teaming up with others and seeing everyone zipping around beating up enemies. Actually getting good loot is a bit underwhelming since you don't see it the moment it drops.

Overall I'd say this is a solid 7/10 with a lot of potential for improvement and content.",1706903356,1706906485,True,2,0,0.474233716726303101,0,True,False,False

However, you should be aware of the lack of mission variety in the game currently. 
Thankfully, it's a lot of fun to kill things, and the gameplay works really well. 
I find the gearing experience to be both confusing and deep. 
It might make more sense with more experience.

I recommend it if you enjoy DC Comics and well-written stories. 
I recommend it if you like to loot and bashing mobs.

I do not recommend it if you're looking for a solo game. 
I've already reached the limit of that possibility, the game becomes tedious in solo mode, and even a pre-boss phase during the campaign is simply unenjoyable when played solo.
Lastly, I do not recommend it if you don't like filling gauges and grinding for endgame gear.

The story promises to continue in the upcoming seasons, we'll see if it's on the same level as the vanilla game or if it's just a gimmick to introduce new characters.

I hope to make it my go-to game between seasons with Diablo IV, Last Epoch, and PoE 2.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: I played the game on both PS5 and PC.

Lots of stuff to do with Riddler trials and puzzles making a return. They also feel a lot more worthwhile as they unlock cosmetics for each character.

This has been one of my most, if not the most, awaited game. And I must admit, I was terrified - the game has received a lot of hate recently, concerning the lore and some core aspects of the game. However I decided to trust my heart and bought it anyways, and do I regret it ? Absolutely not. Not even a little.
This game is truly wonderful. The game is well optimized, looks amazing, the story is great, the characters (their emotions and relations with one another) is just as good and the gameplay, although it's what I kind of feared at first, works perfectly for me. While I am not yet 100% done with the story, I am loving it so far and I cannot wait to complete the game and experience post-launch content because what I've experienced so far is mind-blowing, truly.

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a very interesting game. The combat is nice and the characters don't feel like a copy paste of one another. The humor is childish and crude, exactly what I expect from this cast of villains. My biggest complaints so far are the performance issues and the lack of detail to the heros, mainly superman who just appears toward the end and is dead shortly after. 

Finally I have seen people complain about the batman death and how it seemed insulting. I thought it worked well. Yes it could have been better but I think having Kevin Conroy as batman one last time was the best possible outcome. 

Would I recommend this game? Yes, it is fun and has a lot of good humor in it.
Is it worth the price? Yes and No. If you want just the story wait for a sale, if you plan on playing this for awhile like I do, go for it.

The writing and story is mediocre at best and disrespectful to source material at worst.

The combat is good, the movement needs tweaking, but otherwise it's a fun arcade-y third person looter shooter.

Gameplay loop is repetitive and tedious. Go here, escort/kill/protect/destroy, cutscene, repeat - sometimes they throw in modifiers like ""grenades only"" or ""crit damage only)

The only two reasons, I could see to not like the game is:
1. You don't like heavy traversal/movement games
2. You don't like always online games (they plan to add a type of offline mode later)

Pros:
- Great Story
- Great Character Diversity (More to come with seasons)
- Diverse options of missions, exp mechanics, and end-game grind (More to come with seasons)
- Impactful itemization that keeps you engaged in combat
- Great in-and-out multiplayer
- Built in Leaderboards for both Time and Mastery Rank (As well as localized Leaderboards with friends)
- Combat makes you utilize all aspects of your kit, not simply just shooting

Cons:
- Somewhat difficult to understand damage calculations
- Somewhat difficult to understand itemization at the start
- Small QoL items that would really make the game be a smoother experience

As a longtime fan of the Arkhamverse, this isn't quite the sequel to Arkham Knight which I would have asked -- let alone expected -- Rocksteady to make, and time will only tell if future Seasons will resolve some of the more bitterly received elements of Suicide Squad's story (IYKYK) but for now, the game boasts an addictively fun gameplay loop which could serve as a brilliant foundation in the months and years to come.",1706901995,1706902385,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Season 1 launches in march with promises of new story and areas so if they provide on that front and add some mission variety to the endgame this could be a very good looter shooter live action game.

Also keep in mind that this review comes from the perspective of a massive fan of the Arkham games, I have over 1,000 hours across all 4 main games on all platforms[/h1]

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

First of all, the skill floor is higher than that of the Arkham games. That isn’t to say that SS is extremely difficult, but to effectively fight and move around, you NEED to use the resources at your disposal. Don’t expect instant satisfaction from doing the bare minimum.

[b]Combat[/b]

The 6 weapons classes, grenades, melees, and abilities all blend really well together. There is a ton of variety, and my high expectations were far exceeded. 

[b]Traversal[/b]

All 4 characters feel entirely unique, and will require you to adapt to their style to make the most of it.

I played through the main story as Deadshot, and his jetpack was unbelievably fun. It’s fast, but also limited, so I had to maintain the jetpacks uptime by bouncing off buildings and sliding. Once you understand how the traversal move set works, the game just flows so much better. Mixing in gunplay while moving across the battlefield in crazy ways is an unmatched experience.

To new players, I’d advise against starting with Harley, her movement is definitely the hardest to learn, and has unfortunately resulted in a lot of unjust hate towards the game from players calling her “slow”. She is by no means slow, but has the highest skill floor of the roster.

[h1]Bosses and Story[/h1]

[b]Bosses (Sweating Bullets Difficulty)[/b]

[spoiler]Batman (Museum): One of my best gaming experiences ever. Getting destroyed by Arkham Batman in a predator encounter is so much fun. He uses his gadgets and takedowns on the squad and I love it. Most people might not consider this a boss fight, but I thought I’d include it anyways. 10/10

Flash: We use some sort of speed force counter measure, which I thought was a fair enough reason to be able to beat him. The fight itself was fun, albeit short. Flash used a variety of attacks, and the battlefield got pretty hectic. 8.5/10

Green Lantern: GL’s weakness is yellow. Yes, like it or not, this is his actual weakness. We infused our weapons with some Sinestro Corps tech, developed by Batman, and I thought that was a great explanation for being able to take him on. GL deploys a variety of constructs over the course of the fight, and it was really fun avoiding attacks, destroying constructs, and navigating the field. 9.5/10

Batman (Fear Toxin): The first half was good, the second half was bad, read my main story critique for more of my thoughts. 5/10

Superman: So how can we take down Superman? Kryptonite, specifically the gold variant. I think that’s a perfectly fair way to take him down, what else do you expect? I loved this fight, Superman uses all his powers against you and it’s a ton of fun. From dodging laser blasts to getting helicopters swung at you, the fight was a chaotic mess. 9.9/10

Brainiac (Earth 2): He basically infuses himself with Flash’s powers and it’s another Flash fight. The arena and music are cooler, and I really enjoyed Brainiac’s dialogue. The fight was longer than the first Flash fight, and there were also a lot of ads thrown in which was fun. Unfortunately, it was mostly just another Flash fight. Had we fought Brainiacs' version of each JL member I would have been satisfied, but I was a bit underwhelmed. It was pretty decent, but could have definitely been better. 7.5/10

[b]Main Story[/b]

Overall, the performances of nearly every voice actor was incredible. Each character had a completely different personality and listening to the dialogue was enjoyable. I know some people will hate killing characters like Flash because ‘technically’ he could one shot us. So, why doesn’t he do that? IT’S BAD WRITING. The superhero industry would be nowhere near as successful as it is today if story arcs ended instantly. Sweet Baby Inc was unfortunately involved, and they are likely the reason for some forced diversity, though I do think some people are exaggerating it. It could be a bit lackluster at times, and I wish Superman had more screen time, but other than that it was really good! …except for Batman.

Unfortunately, Arkham Batman was done REALLY dirty. I had faith that Rocksteady would do a fantastic job, especially after playing through the Alpha and the No More Heroes trailer that revealed we would see fear toxin Batman.

The first ~60% of the game he was amazing. Going through a predator section from the POV of the prey will go down as one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had. He’s badass, powerful, and you’re not a threat. Soon after, you get to hear Batman talking through hacked communications, so getting to hear evil Batman analyze the squad and act as Brainiac’s general was great.

Things get bad at his second fight. Things start out awesome, with Batman using the Voice Synthesizer to trick the squad into filling a Batcave with fear toxin. After this, you fight him in his fear toxin form, and sadly it’s pathetic. It’s a decent boss, but for a fear toxin Batman boss, not so great. You jump around a small arena, dodging simple attacks and shooting his new form. When the health bar reaches zero, the fight ends and you capture Batman.

How is FEAR TOXIN BATMAN less powerful than his ‘normal’ form? You go from IMPOSSIBLE ODDS, to spamming your weapons while dodging attacks. This is AFTER you kill Flash and Green Lantern; Batman learned from their mistakes, and yet he fails like this? This fight was underwhelming, and seeing Arkham Batman lose just feels wrong.

You know how thugs and villains give Batman the inaccurate description of “just a freak in a bat-costume”? Well, after you finish his boss fight and capture him, the rest of his life is spent in this beat-up condition and mostly strapped to a chair. You can talk to him, and he’ll say stuff like “I can kill you 10 ways right now”, and then he’ll do nothing. He really does just seem like a freak in a costume, and it’s sad to see.

How does he die? The squad drives him out to where they want to kill Superman, and sits him up on a bench. Harley Quinn pulls out a gun after some dialogue, and shoots him. No resistance. Let me say that again. The same Harley that Batman one shots on multiple occasions in the Arkham games, shoots ARKHAM BATMAN in the head, and he doesn’t even try to stop it. I won’t include this as a part of my head cannon. I’d go over just how OP this Batman was, but that would take too lo…. eh screw it:

Fear Multi Takedown
Defeating several members of his rogues gallery IN ONE NIGHT… 4 TIMES
Defeating an army in Arkham Knight… while dealing with the effects of fear toxin
Fighting at his peak immediately after taking a shot to the gut.
Conquering fear toxin in Asylum and Knight
17 years of experience
One shots Deathstroke in Arkham Knight
The entire squad was one shot by Batman in the museum 
Beating Killer Croc in an even one on one fight
Took down mobs of the League of Assassins while on the brink of death in City 
Harley is a joke to Batman; whether he one shots her, or she gives up information out of stupidity.

I understand that Conroy might not have finished recording everything, but Rocksteady still could’ve done better. Let’s not forget that Conroy isn’t the only person that can voice Arkham Batman. He’s obviously iconic, and no one can match his performance, but if Rocksteady was interested in keeping this Batman around more, the option was there.

[h1]Conclusion [/h1]

I do recommend this game. While Batman’s end was poorly handled, it’s not fair to base my review off of that. The bosses are fun, gunplay and traversal is unique and responsive, and all future gameplay content is free. I had a blast playing, and don’t think this should be a negative review.[/spoiler]

[h3] Story [/h3]
I am not a big DC/Marvel fan, I find the stories very shallow, reductive, and immature. My expectations for the story were not very high and I was not disappointed to find that the story of this game is very shallow. There is zero and I mean absolutely no character development. The characters stay exactly the same from hour 0 to hour 30. King Shark is by far the best character and made me laugh a few times, but most of the jokes are out of place and unwarranted. I found myself frequently asking, ""Is this supposed to be funny? Who finds this funny?"" It is highly unlikely you will ever get a thought provoking deep story from DC/Marvel, they aren't interested in making you think, only to consume next product.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
It's not bad, but it's not great. The traversal is pretty fun, each character has a unique mode of moving. Harley's movement is fun but it feels a lot slower then the rest. Also it felt as if rocksteady had copied movement from their other games, not a detractor as they are also fun to move around. Gunplay is serviceable, it does what it is intended to, nothing special. The special moves are alright, I liked the King Shark squad attack animations.

The enemies are really generic. I think there are maybe 6 or 7 variants. You'll be fighting the same enemies the entire game and it never changes. There are no unique mechanics to kill enemies, just shoot them until they die. Pretty boring after a few hours.

The bosses are extremely horrible. Each boss has maybe one or two moves which you can easily dodge, they become vulnerable, you pump them full of bullets, and they die. It really is not a challenging or enjoyable experience. You're fighting a boss, it should be a grandiose and great endeavour, make me feel like I have to work for it and get a sense of accomplishment from beating them.

The loot is the one highlight in the game. It's varied enough that you'll be getting different equipment every 15 mins. You can customise all the stats too which is nice. Some of the synergies of set gear was pretty fun to work with. The end game gear especially was fun, requires you to actually engage with a part of the game to get the buffs which is better then x% increase damage.

[h3] End Game [/h3]
It's bad. It's really bad. You cycle through 3 missions to increase mastery rank to get more gear to repeat the same 3 missions. I'm not joking, the end game consists of 3 missions. There are ""technically"" 2 other missions at end game, but they do not provide advancement towards any mastery or gear. So there you have it, grinding the same 3 missions for what? Why would I do this for another 30 hours?

[h3] Microtransactions [/h3]
Abysmal, absolutely abysmal. Cosmetics only which is alright, but the conversion of the in-game currency to USD is ~$1/100 credits and 2400 credits to buy one shop costume = $24 USD. Just to put into perspective how egregious this is, the entire game only costs $70 USD. So you're telling me that one cosmetic holds the same value as ~34% of the entire game? That is a disgusting valuation and straight up predatory. 

Currently the shop exists to see how badly they can extort their customers for more money, not as providing a beneficial service to those who would like a unique costume.

[h3] TLDR [/h3]

It's not Batman Arkham Knight, of course, but I do think the gunplay and the traversal mechanics work very well in the city of Metropolis. I'm enjoying the story so far, especially the ""kill the Justice League"" angle, and it's no lie that the game looks great (especially the cinematics).

I do have a couple grievances though: of all the traversal mechanics, Harley clearly has the worst (I would say larger swing radius and swing speed is needed). Also, some of the missions are very repetitive, which is the unfortunate reality of this game being a traversal-focused 3rd-person shooter with its live service component.

But I can't say that the downsides outweigh the upsides (beyond my next point), and I'm hopeful this game can really become a great product with the addition of an offline mode (I think the game's length is fine considering side missions, and I don't plan on committing to its GAAS systems).

I was very sceptical myself. And yeah, I've seen ""spoilers"".

Anyway, here are some major positives:
1) Full crossplay at launch;
2) Matchmaking based on player progress 
3) Clan system to enjoy with friends 
4) And if you don't have friends like me there's a solo support! You can finish the game with bots! And they are good! My goodness... I wish Sheva Alomar had a tenth of their intellect...
5) There are NO co-op related achievements. You can 100% the game solo. Sweet!
6) No FOMO with seasonal content;
7) NG+ mode with modifiers on launch
8) Very user friendly UI
9) Overall very rich looter shooter and the game actually focuses on loot. The combat is fast paced and very satisfying.
10) Inventory/item management system while being kinda similar to GK is now less convoluted and much more player friendly.
11) Still feels like a Rocksteady game aesthetics wise and many great cameos!
12) NO WOKE content! Literally NONE. Stop blaming Sweet Baby inc! They can only give the advises the rest is up to developers! The game is nothing like woke abomination Spider-Man 2! Well, you can find 1 certain flag in the game. But that's it! Hell, I wouldn't even call that ""woke"". Yeah, Deadshot is suddenly black and the game even references that... but I can let it slide cause' he's awesome. Hey, maybe he has a revitiligo like good ol' uncle Ruckus, eh?
13) First Battle pass is anounced to be free!
14) Awesome characters with great chemistry and dialogues between them. King Shark is particularly wholesome! But Boomer is my favourite!


And let's try to take a look at possible negatives:
1) Well, if you worship Arkham Trilogy Batman this game definitely isn't for you.
2) If you don't like Harley then this game isn't for you either.
3) There are optimization issues. Even people with 4090 are turning of RT to have stable FPS at 4K. The game is also heavy on CPU. Without RT though the game runs very decent.
4) Premium shop... and the prices are as outrageous as in MK1! It's a good thing though that nothing in the premium shop can top Justice Losers costumes that you're getting with Digital Deluxe edition. Otherwise only the cosmetics are sold. At least I don't think I saw anything balance breaking in it.
5) My personal issue. 4th Rockstedy game and the city is again conviniently empty... Good grief... Rocksteady, I've a question for you. When will you make a game in a city with citizens? Gotham Knights featured an actual living Gotham! And I loved it! it was something that Arkham trilogy didn't have. BTW, give GK a chance too! Apart from it's ABYSMAL inventory system the game is awesome.
6) The price. Good grief... The game costs even more than MK1... I guess it kinda makes sense cause this game is actually finished! Unlike MK1 ""Beta"" which is still going.

Overall I'm having a blast with it! Even playing solo with bots! Come on guys! Give this game a chance! It really feels like a continuation of the Arkham Knight.

----------------------------------
Game completed in 16 hours. I gotta say, it's pretty overhated and doesn't deserve the malice poured onto it by ass-mad die hard Batman Arkham fans. Don't get me wrong, I like arkham. Played through Knight before Suicide Squad let out. But the game isn't a ""bad game"".

The gameplay loop is fine.  The gameplay itself is smooth and doesn't feel janky like Gotham Knights or anything like that. Builds, weapons, and the different feel of each character  with their melees and traversals brings enough variety that it doesn't really feel boring. The traversal is the best part, with awesome visuals and once you get your build going, you really feel the fun and flow both outside and inside combat. The promise of free content with season 1 in March seems promising, and along with whatever follows that.

The experience was relatively bug free (FOR ME) with a couple audio issues here and there, and a radar issue that disappeared on a reload. I acknowledge that some people had trouble staying connected during early access, but strangely enough I never had that problem or got disconnected from a solo session. Additionally I discovered one mission that couldn't be completed, being a gizmo car mission where the enemies wouldn't spawn. Which isn't great but it doesn't ruin the experience for me.

The story pacing seemed okay, the characters play off of eachother fine. They're crass, disrespectful, and... well they're villains forced into the hero role. They certainly feel like it, which works for me as someone who loves villains. The humor definitely isn't for everyone and honestly, humor is subjective, though the dislike at the story's ending is understandable since it doesn't ""wrap up"" (even though the game story isn't over and will continue with the seasons).

But man, where it all goes to shit for people is the fates of the justice league members... Which I think doesn't matter as much as some people seem to. Some people are weirdly attached to Arkham batman and think the way he went out is some kind of insult to Kevin Conroy himself or something, (even though he took the role and clearly didn't feel insulted considering) or wish they'd gotten a justice league game or another batman game instead. The latter of which has nothing to do with the game experience and more the personal feelings of people who didn't want the game in the first place. This isn't worth talking about as much as people are acting like it is.

----------------------------------

TL;DR, it's pretty fun as far as looter shooters go, and relatively inoffensive as online live service games go (save that pricey shop.) It's technically sound (for the most part) and the experience was seamless for me. A lot of the outrage feels manufactured by angry fans of Arkham batman because the game isn't another Arkham Batman game, or people who hate live service as a whole. Depending on how Rocksteady handles the content per sesson, I can see the game having a pretty healthy lifespan, at least until it's OVER over, and doesn't overstay it's welcome. (That is, if the outrage farming doesn't cause the game to lose out before it can even get going down the live service train.)",1706899693,1706899693,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike most other looter shooters and live service shenanigans, nothing's annoyingly spongy. If you like a gun, you don't have to worry about it being replaced every other second. Each character feels different enough where swapping occasionally at least helped me freshen up a game loop that to me worked very well in keeping me engaged, but I know mileage will vary on that. For the story and banter, it's goofy, it's fun, and it knows it's not winning awards and it's fine with that. Really, and more importantly, the city and characters still feel like some passionate comic nerds helped craft them, and just relaxing and enjoying that is a good amount of content for the price in my book.

Think the only really good thing about the game is the story, characters, voice acting and graphic.

315210,157429330,76561198167924782,0,2,994,0,130,1707457437,"Game is pretty decent when you don't have a bunch of unemployed chronically online Twitter losers in your ear telling you to hate a game before even giving it an unbiased open-minded shot.

All seriousness tho, this game really isn't some cinematic single player ""masterpiece"", rarely anything that comes out nowadays is. And it never ever was advertised to be that. But it's definetly a pretty chill co-op looter shooter with VERY satisfying gunplay and movement. I think the problem is that people were expecting Rocksteady to make yet another single-player batman game, while COMPLETELY forgetting that Arkham Knight got absolutely slaughtered by most people for it's historically BROKEN PC port, as well as the fact that a lot of fans were mixed on the overall quality of that game compared to previous releases in the series. Yet for some reason, people seem to forget any of that ever happened and don't realize that's probably exactly why they went down this route of trying something completely different, regardless of whether or not you personally find that to be the right decision.

But with the politics behind the game aside, as far as the game itself, it's either gonna be a really fun experience if you like co-op shooters, or it's gonna be an instant turn away if you're someone who's looking for a more slow paced narrative focused game. There's really not much in between. There's definetly a story here, at least if you were fortunate enough to not get spoiled by people thinking it's okay to spam leaked cutscenes for a game just because they hate a game that much, but it's far from the focus of the game and the real centerpiece is definetly around the gameplay itself. It's all about building skill trees, leveling up, customization, mastering each character's movement, getting in the flow of knowing when to shoot, where to shoot an enemy at, when to melee, when to look out for counters, etc. and that's definetly where this game shines, especially when you're doing all that with friends. The game looks and runs absolutely amazing, which I'm sure is definetly thanks to Rocksteady not wanting a repeat of Arkham Knight's PC port lmao.

Overall, I'd say if you're skeptical but looking for a gameplay focused co-op game just wait for a sale or grab a 3rd party key for the low. I hope the game can manage to stay alive, because with the content support they have planned this could really be a content packed game, but that's if Rocksteady can really manage to survive the insane negative press they have on them currently.",1706899611,1706899611,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, Xbox users in New Zealand got access almost a full day before steam users. I saw spoilers all over the internet a full day before early access started for PC. I had the game spoiled for me before I could even play it.

I played it all day on the first day of early access and finished it in 9.9 hours. Wow! I thought there would be more content coming, considering the base game costs $70 and I paid $100 for the deluxe. It seems like I paid all that money so I could play ""free"" DLCs in a couple months to finish the story.

The gameplay is fun. I enjoy the traversal a lot, but the combat and missions are so repetitive, I got bored after an hour of the same combat. The loadouts and customization did little to help poor enemy variety. 

I do not recommend playing with friends, because during every mission, there is a 8-15 minute cutscene and all gameplay stops and all players have to just sit and watch quietly. It's a little awkward.

I played the game during the closed alpha tech test and performance was great. However, they recently added Denuvo DRM to the game before launch and it has seriously hurt my performance. I just meet the recommend specs for the game, but I had MANY frame drops and performance issues throughout the game. These weren't present during the open alpha, so I'm quite disappointed. I'm sure the always-online functionality and anti-cheat software doesn't help my performance much, either. I consistently got around 100 fps during the closed alpha. I got around 50 fps during early access. HUGE performance drop.

The game starts off with a 15-30 minute tutorial that has NOTHING to do with the main story. It's just explaining how to shoot enemies. Really? The main story already has dynamic tutorials that explain everything pretty well. What's the need for a SECOND tutorial before the game starts?

The story was pretty disappointing for me. It was the reason I bought the game. The trailers looked so promising, but I'm a bit disappointed. (spoilers ahead) [spoiler] All of these characters that I love, such as, Batman, the Flash, Superman, and Green Lantern all had death scenes where they were (quite brutally) murdered. Green Lantern and Batman were shot in the head with very little grace or send off. It was genuinely a bit disheartening to see Arkham Batman go out like that. It felt incredibly disrespectful to the character and the fans of all the Arkham games. Superman and the Flash died by just falling over at the end of battle. Really? That's how these incredible characters go out? By slumping over? It felt really heartless when characters would piss on the corpses of these beloved characters and it felt really uncomfortable to me. I don't understand who this game is for? Do flash fans want to see flash get murdered and pissed on? Do Arkham fans want to see Arkham Batman get shot point blank? I'm a huge fan of the Suicide Squad property. I have countless Suicide Squad comics, but I'm also a fan of the Justice League, the flash, and Arkham Batman. I didn't want to see any of this! At no point did the squad try to save any heroes, besides delaying Wonder Woman's death, and only saving civilians when they HAD to. The story had lots of fun moments and surprises and even a couple laughs, but it ended with a feeling of having not accomplished anything. The world isn't saved, it's still being invaded, and we killed the world's best heroes. What was the point? What was the message? The characters feel the exact same as the start of the game. I didn't notice any character development. Is pissing on a corpse character development? It honestly just felt like a waste of time. The story starts and ends at the same destination. There is no journey. The only difference is now the justice league is ""dead"", but they weren't doing much in the beginning of the game anyway, so you won't notice anything. 
The story of ""Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"" felt heartless, upsetting, and ultimately pointless. [/spoiler]

I'll probably come back to the game in a year, so I can play the ""free"" DLC that I paid for and (hopefully) finally complete the story. But for now, I do not recommend playing the game as it is. Maybe check it out if you can catch the game on sale for $20 in a few years, but I don't see this game appealing to many people.",1706898475,1706898475,False,16,2,0.522189617156982422,2,True,False,False

That being the gameplay, the characters and parts of the story. Then there's so many things I really don't like. The repetitive Quests, how the game kinda just ends for a good endgame but it kills the the flow of the story. Honestly the biggest issue I had was how the story was ripped apart for seasonal content that will be added later on. If you are a story player, you will want to wait for all the seasonal stuff to finish dropping so you get the complete story. Other than that this game no where near the bad that people complain about. Game is fun, even fun with random and friends. The story is depressing but if you read any DC comic over the past few years you know that they love putting their heroes through the worst possible stuff out there. I bet you this, The Justice League and Arkham Batman will return by the end of the seasonal drops.
Also the all the good content is free (characters, story, etc). The BP is outfits only and they don't expire so no FOMO. That alone is a win for me. Unless you're a big Arkham fan who knows that DC is keeping thier word with the title of the game I wouldn't buy it until it goes on sale honestly.

Missions are rather limited in their type, it's fun when you focus on getting creative with the movement and how the characters work but it does make you want more.

Bosses are decent but could be more challenging, flash has 2 moves... you could've given us a big charge up move where he rushes the player to insta kill them, would give more reason to keep an eye within the chaos. 

Some bosses feel slow in their attacks, which gives you plenty of time, just speed them up or add some moves that make you pay more attention to their moves, they do well with making you focus on keep moving and reasons as to why things have to be this way. 

[spoiler]With the title obviously pointing out what is going to happen, the characters deaths are clearly shown in a way that they will be brought back, many of the dialogue suggests brainiac took them back or that they never were the actual league members, it's a bit annoying a lot of the people complaining don't realise this and I think rocksteady or wb really took a risk with making the dlc finish the story seeing that if this really hurts sales we may never get the finished story[/spoiler]

But overall the game is very fun, I advise playing at max difficulty to keep you experimenting with the game, for those who are thinking this game is disrespectful to our beloved characters, just know rocksteady have a plan, kevin agreed to how this would go, the story is not finished.

Live Service done right! All upcoming content is included in the base price of the game, and you can only buy cosmetics.

This game is lots of fun and in gaming thats what matters... 

You can enjoy the game solo and the game works really well for this.. but it shines in co op and within the Clan system.. ( Please Raise The Clan Limit 16 is way to small) 

This is a looter shooter set in the Arkhamverse, 5 years after Arkham Knight and for players of the Arkham series there are some recognisable faces, some very popular and some minor ones too. 

If I had to put a negative thing in the spotlight it would be that sometimes the boss fights just end a bit anti climatic. once you land that final blow its done... maybe bigger endings like the fight being ended in a cut scene. still very fun boss fights but yeah.. that was a low point. 

Gameplay: Is not Arkham style at all and its not trying to be.. its a looter shooter.. once you level up a bit you unlock some very fun ability's to mix in with the traversal and shooter gameplay, mixed with the more simple yet fun melee combat.. again with all sorts of stats and afflictions.. 
the whole combat gameplay becomes chaotic and fun

The world looks amazing, with the traversal its a joy to speed around in.. theres lots to do within it. even more so once you beat the story and reach end game and start levelling up your character past level 30 with squad points, 
weapon afflictions and all sorts of upgrades and stats. the chaos can truly begin. the loot is extreemly good in this game

Once you start getting some good drops with crazy stats on them the builds you an do are really fun and impressive. with plenty more on the way with seasonal content and updates.

The voice acting is without fault, and the cut scenes are extremely good. The story is a lot of fun to follow and while having a lighter tone with the humour in this game its very dark at times. And having the Freedom of the DC multiverse to play with for upcoming content and already existing content is brilliant. 

The upcoming content for this game is already exciting and theres more than enough to keep you going untill the first big content drop in march.

Kevin conroy: [spoiler] R.I.P to this legend who will all loved! but please remember.. He read the script and voice acted the game, the comments saying this game disrespects him are beyond stupid!!

The game has the multiverse in it... and who knows what twists and turns are coming in the future.. who knows if this was truly the Earth 1 JL and not some other variants sent down to kill everyone while Earth 1's JL are still on the ship..

[b]Agents of Mayhem: DC Edition[/b]
Went in without expectations, it's genuine fun to play so far.
Characters feel smooth to control both inside and outside of combat and the systems are easy to understand.
The banter between characters is fun and changes based on what stage in the story you are in. (The VA is great)
Just watch out what u do if u wanna hear this banter, same goes for radio comms after an boss fight.
Some actions will cut off/talk over these interactions, shooting a drone out of the sky for example.
Oh and zero disconnects or server issues, only two crashes due to a bad driver on my end.

[b]Story[/b]
Its fun although on the shorter end main story wise which kind of sucks.
20-ish Hours for full run that includes the Riddler Challenges/Trophies.
Maybe 8 to 10-ish Hours if u really ""bum-rush"" the story, if u call it short then that is on yourself.

See it as a Guardians of the Galaxy with an open world, an open world that looks very good and comicy.
Without getting into spoilers they should not have put in the same canon as the Arkham games, the very few references it does make (Not counting the museum) do not seem worth it because holy a lot Arkham fanboys are pissed.
The Arkham Games are my favorite games of all time (Yes that does include Origins), but throwing a hissy fit and mass rating 1/10? Come on now.

Also seeing alot of ""Its Woke"" comments, only thing i've seen and whats really unnecessary is a rainbow banner that is somewhat in your face when u exit and enter the main hub (Which u can skip later on) make it blend in, other then that not really a thing and just something people are spewing for clicks and views.

[b]End Game[/b]
I guess you can compare it to games like The Division.
Do objectives on the map, get currency, use that currency to do/get better stuff. (Keeping it simple dont wanna spoil).
Can definitely get repetitive and the weapon variety seems a bit mid, i don't mind it as much but i know some will.
Seasonal Content is probably gonna spice this up quite a bit down the road.

[b]The Big Bad, The Store & Battle Pass[/b]
Its a couple of Cosmetics and Emotes, so far anyway not to bad lets see if and hope that it stays that way.
As for the Battle Pass, its not here yet but will only contain cosmetics (Officially stated) and all its Characters and Seasonal content will be free and allegedly revisitable.
Definitely not a fan of a Battle Pass system, but if it doesn't affect gameplay what so ever and folks who decide to pay for it only get cosmetics out of it, it does not affect me so why should i care.",1706896816,1706897667,True,14,0,0.471665620803833008,0,True,False,False

a solid 7.5-8/10 if you like looter shooters and i look forward to trying thew new dlc characters in the future. Hopefully the devs can support it with new interesting mission types.",1706897656,1706897656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The second half and onward, its just a boring copy and paste of mid game-play design and plot points. It tried to follow a story which was incompatible with the game-play, making some points feel out of place. The Arkham games did this very well as it was more grounded and with a better combat design. This is unachievable with the ""Looter Shooter"" style is designed, leading to a lacklustre experience with subpar game-play design elements.  

Graphics are okay
character design is good
combat design is Atrocious
Traversal is good

Overall, this game was a slap in the face of the fans of Rocksteady's previous work. The Live Service elements really stir up the pot in ways that don't work well. I have no trouble foreseeing the possible outcome for this game company to end up bankrupt, much like the Saints Row devs.  I really had hope in this game, though the odds are not in it's favor.

Suicide squad kill the justice league, is a hectic crazy colorful mess and it knows exactly what its trying to be. it just seems like to me that no one got the memo. this is and clearly never was a followup to the arkham games series, its a continuation from the arkham stories THATS IT. end of thats where the connection begins and ends. 

this is not an rpg its not a story focused game even though the story is great. its a looter shooter that hopes to bring frequent updates and content each season which is what we all knew it was going to be 2 years ago. anyone saying otherwise is just an idiot. 

you are going to see hundreds of negative reviews comparing this game to the arkham series. but thats just satly kids mad that rocksteady wanted to make something different. if you love looters you will love this game simple as. if you dont like looters you wont like this game. there is no need to buy something that you dont like just to give it a negative review. its clearly not made for you go play something else.

My first impression is positive. The game is a lot of fun. Traversal feels different for every character but is always powerful.
Different weapons and talent trees for heroes enable different playstyles. The banter between our Anti-Heroes is great and the overall story so far is servicable. 
Performance on my RX 5700 is good enough even with relatively high graphics settings. Early technical problems like long game launch times (to the point where it feels like it won't launch at all) will hopefully get fixed soon. Once ingame, there are few loading screens and those load fast. I had one crash so far, but I lost no progress.

Right now (release day), some/many seem to have small problems with the game. Because of that, the release price feels too high, especially considering the ingame shop for cosmetics.
If you really like The Suicide Squad in general, get the game and have fun! If you are still on the fence, wait for March when the first Season Content drops.

I well and truly expected this to be a dumpsterfire. But turns out it's kinda not..... I mean it ain't no Arkham City  but it's kinda fun.  The gameplay is pretty solid. You get a lot of room to move thanks to added verticality. At the very least it's a fun looter shooter.

Your mileage will vary with the main story though as the characters are more quippy James Gunn Suicide Squady than John Ostrander's beloved comic versions. So if you're into that , you'll find it funny than grating.

 Now for the negatives
            . There isn't really much to do other than a handful of activities
            . Some missions really restrict your playstyle like ""enemies take damage only from grenades "" or "" Enemies taking damage only by melee after staggering them"". Those tend to get annoying rather than challenging
            . Locking Pre-Order costume stuff in the store by which i mean instead of giving the whole set ,you have to pay for alt colors

I've played quite a lot, finished the campaign and I'm currently working my way to the end game. At the moment, I'm at Finite Crisis 7 and Invasion Level 3, the latter being a difficulty bump that you need to unlock with gaining xp on the previous difficulty options {e.g. Hard +1, +2, +3). 

I really enjoyed the story, it's really well-put and I loved the comic relief provided by all characters. Mind you when the story needs to go dark, it does. 

The game is a looter-shooter, providing an excellent mix of both with tons of loot and item types,tiers, set items and affixes, maybe too many affixes? While I've tried all chars, the majority of my playthrough was Deadshot and King Shark. To me all chars feel different, yes the talent tree is a bit meh, they dictate the weapon you have to use e.g. you can have 3 skills on the same tier giving bonuses to shotguns/pistols/assault rifles and you get to pick one. The good news is that at any given point you can edit your skill points free of any cost. 
Everything works synergistic and it's one of the cool aspects of itemization. You can use different notorious (think of unique items which can have random rolls but specific bonuses) items with different set items that when used together they provide a villain synergy bonus that gives you another cool perk like extra damage on afflicted enemies and grenade ammo on kills etc.
The endgame is a constant flow of quests (mostly tho the same quests you've done during the campaign) you can complete in Metropolis, missions that reward you a special currency called Promethium in order to challenge higher difficulty activities, endgame bosses and phat lewt. That being said, it doesn't feel a lot but I'm going to assume we get more content with the release of Joker as a playable character in March. It can get repetitive, but 

I'm running an asus  Rog Strix 4080 on a 5800x3D with 32gb of ram and an  SSD, the game plays decent but I think denuvo tanks my fps by a lot. I have roughly 80 fps dipping all the way to 59, on 1440p-144 hz with DLAA turned On, with volumetric fog quality, shadow quality and ray tracing set to off. Denuvo is notorious for this kind of behavior. I'll get back to you on that, waiting for Nvidia drivers release and hopefully a patch. That being said my game crashed once and only once before completing a Finite Crisis mission which is instanced so that may also have been some server shenanigans.

So is the game worth of your time? Definitely yes. We get a sneak peek of what's to come, there's a roadmap already out for season 1 and what's next if you want to check that out. And I for one, i'm really excited cause let's face it, we don't have a good alternative to the known looter shooter games and hopefully Rocksteady can deliver.

Serious talk now, people on Youtube are going craycray for clicks and likes. I saw a video from a guy ""reviewing"" the game and he said ""from the data I have gathered without playing the game, it sucks"". Like, are we doing this, am I the one going crazy? The genre is ""LOOTER-SHOOTER"" you either like it or you don't. There is some crazy amount of production value here and you can tell. So everyone's out to hate this game WITHOUT ACTUALLY PLAYING THE $#@!ING GAME! There is nothing in-your-face-woke in the game, if you get triggered by a pride flag as you enter the Justice Hall that says ""We welcome all Heroes"" then that's on you, it's not the game.

Pro's: 
-Game play is fun at times.

-Character designs look super cool.

-Voice acting is amazing especially Debra Wilson as Amanda Waller and Kevin Conroy as an evil Batman, genuinely terrifying. 

-Wonder Woman was a bad ass.

-Some funny moments that I actually laughed at.

Con's:
-Justice league is barely in it with no character development for them they are just there as bosses. The one character development moment you get is with Batman as a Hologram is basically skipped cause they already defeated most of the justice league at this point. 

-Development for the squad turning into family didn't feel like that at all. Especially when the hologram Batman talks about being  family in the Bat-Cave and the squad agrees with him but there is no moment up to that point where they feel like a family or after.

-All the deaths were written poorly especially killing off arkham batman in the such a dumb way. 

-Superman is only in it for what 5 minutes tops way to short.

-All the boss battles were bad and not really unique except for the first half of the final Batman fight. Especially Brainiac's which was just a flash boss fight. (And if Braniac is suppose to be this super smart and powerful being why would he choose the power of the first justice league member to die in a boss fight. He should have been all the league members combined.)

-Wonder Woman was nefered in her fight against Superman.

-Superman and Brainiac where built up to be these impossibly difficult characters to beat only for you to beat them in one fight which was way to easy. 

-Not once did I believe that the squad could actually beat these characters they should have been dead the moment they stepped into metropolis. 

-Lois lane graphics on the billboards looked horrible.

-Moments that weren't funny especially boomerang trying to pee on the flash.

-Game suffers from it being a live service game because the ending doesn't feel like an ending to a story.

-Wonder Woman should have been switched with Batman would've been way more impactful especially with this taking place in the Arkham Universe.

-Tim Drake dying was not needed. 

-King Shark looked cool as a green lantern but didn't make sense that he could just put on the ring when it's suppose to fly away and find a new lantern after his death.

In all honesty. If you like games like Crackdown or Sunset overdrive, fast paced gameplay and fun movement. Ypu will probably like this game.

As a true looter shooter enthusiast, this game is truly a blast to play and the movement skill is so fluid

The only thing that I don't like about this game is where enemies are immune to damage except a single source.. It ruins the flow

The graphics and animations are top notch, the combat and traversal are satisfying and addicting. The story (from what I've experienced so far) is alright but I need to experience more to have a full opinion. All I can say for now is that I like these versions of the characters more than I thought and have genuinely laughed out loud a few times in the first few hours. 

My main issues currently are with longevity and performance. The enemy and mission variety are extremely lacking and that's a shame as almost every other looter shooter has had this issue and one would hope that a game in development for like 8 years would have prepared for this more. 

I have a 3070 and a Ryzen 7 3700x and I struggle to maintain 1440p 60fps using DLSS Auto and all settings set to Medium. The game regularly fluctuates between 50-60fps. I can unlock and hit higher frames but then experience big dips often and is not a good experience. 

I hope that they optimize the game further and support it with more content variety. As it stands, it's a very fun game on a mechanical level but the variety of content holds it back. It may be worth waiting for more content or a price drop if you aren't itching to explore Metropolis right now.

There is a story here that from my opinion isn't that bad but there are some really strange decision made with how certain character react to ""Killing members of the Justice league"" that only make you go, ""okay?""  This is a live service game so you will see micro-transactions as to be expected, the strange part about this is you will hear comments like, ""at least they are cosmetic only"" but the pricing for something that is so limiting in customization is crazy to me when do the math for it. $20 for a skin for a single character that is not mix and match to other skins in the game is crazy greedy to me. 


There are plenty of reviews out there that say this game is bad and I agree with a lot of the criticism but its not worst game in the world. This game is okay but I don't recommend it unless WB and rock steady take a look at revamping mission variety. For me to say that I don't think this game will be shut down or die in a couple months from repetitive play would be lying.  

Sorry if this is tough to understand as this is just my quick thoughts of the game. the short and sweet of it is I don't recommend playing at this state and I kinda feel like WB and rock steady gave up on this game two years ago so outside of maybe Joker and other planned DLC, this will probably fade from public conscience very soon.  I'm going to give it a few more weeks for the end game content but I don't recommend you do unless the game goes on sale. 


Pros
Story has its moments of fun 
Game play can be enjoyable for bit  (way better with friends)

Cons
Repetitive 
Feels unfinished 
Price of Micro transaction vs what you get is insulting to the players
End game feels hollow and the impacts of events from the story feel very underwhelming (Kevin deserved a better send off)

The live service content just feels out of place, rather than predatory, which can get in the way of the pace and the good time but it's never so much of a problem that it ruins the experience. The story and combat is really what sells the experience. Mobility is the key to success and it just feels excellently fun using the unique movement methods of each character to tear up the enemies. This might have been a fantastic game had they left out the weird shell of the live service aspects, but I can definitely settle for great game. For what I've played, and what lies ahead, I'm in. Glad this didn't turn out to be a bust like we all thought. I guess if the live service aspect means some content updates in the future that'll just be icing but currently that doesn't interest me so who knows. Never been into that sort of thing so I can't really speak to it. If I had to gripe about anything, it's the dialogue of some of the support characters. It's genuinely bad, to the point it almost seems intentional but feels like it forgot be funny. Lot of that these days, wonder how all these writers keep getting work. But, like I said, it's just a few of the support characters so it's not really a problem, just kinda lame. 

If you were on the fence with this game, I say give it a shot. The devs put in the effort, in my opinion, and it shows.  Feel bad they got stuck working around the live service nonsense but they made it work. Guess that extra year paid off.",1706896786,1706896786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
