I've been an ULTRASHILL for ages but had to write a review when I saw I'd played this game for 1069 hours. It's what Dave Oshry would have wanted.

This is literally the best video game I've ever played, and it's not even done yet! The tight movement, the responsive gun play, the insane tech and high skill ceiling... Hell, it even has a level editor by now! I've never gotten so much consistent enjoyment from any one product, and there's still more to come!

I'll write a full multiple-hour-long review for YouTube. Eventually. Maybe. If I can stop playing Cyber Grind for long enough.

EDIT: Over 600 hours of Cybergrind later and I'm still perfecting my rocket riding chargebacks and other tech. The skill ceiling is seriously insane in this game. I don't even play any other shooters anymore. They all feel too slow.",1661395282,1708934161,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Just a game that's fun from start to finish? to be honest, I've never been a fan of first person shooter games. Everybody at my school play games like, Fortnite, call of duty, doom, etc. I never really liked them, sure I played thoses games. But It was never fun, not really my type of game I wanna play, I remember coming to my moms classroom after school. she was a teacher and all I had to do was chill on my phone for like 7 minutes until my mom was finished putting all the bus riders on their bus. I opened discord And there was this GC I was in, They were talking about this game called ''ULTRAKILL'' I knew nothing about it, what the hell was a P rank? why are they saying stuff like ''A visitor...Mmm indeed'' After I saw some gameplay of ultrakill I always wanted to play it, Getting money was not easy, not to mention trying to get better grades at school, And only a few days later I FINALLY got the game I've wanted for so long..ULTRAKILL. If your looking for a good first person retro shooter game, you should play ultrakill, Sure the bosses like minos prime ARE hard, but thats what makes the game good. This game requires skill, and when I mean skill I mean SKILL. trust me, I've had to restart SOO many levels, But trust me, you will get better once you figure out how to actually kill the enemies. A lot of people say they should make the game easier, I can understand why they would want that, such as (again) bosses like minos prime, some enemies, etc etc. but (again) This game REQUIRES skill, you need to actually try, let the devs do what they want, also the fact that half the negative reviews are about that theres no robot sex is wild, Bosses like the first V2 fight are SUPER hard. it might seem easy since its one of the first bosses in the game, but you BARLEY get to get more health and V2 is always moving, The second V2 boss will be more easy because since you learned his moves you can actually not get hit and survive, For me I love this game, One of the best games I've played, So yeah, Play it. if you want.",1708790673,1708923033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The interactions in the game are amazing like being able to punch to deflect a projectile back to an enemy. The game also features a grade system depending on how cool you killed the enemies which goes down a letter when you get hit but can be regained by getting more stylish kills.

After playing it again, I was hooked, I did way better than before and shredded through the first 7 levels. A few days after that, I decided to switch to violent to increase my skill overall without having to switch difficulties gradually going up very slowly and did very well actually when I switched to violent.

The game has this sense of fluidity in its combat that I haven't seen in any other game. The way your methods of dealing damage can tie into other methods to absolutely annihilate your enemies is great. Instead of rewarding smart gameplay and game sense, ULTRAKILL adds onto that by rewarding ingenuity and creativity in your combat, and of course, your style. The combat in this game is fluid, yet also extremely complex. Still, the game is easy to learn and the skill curve is actually a *curve*, it doesn't have any sudden spikes of hard-to-learn mechanics that make the game unfun or a struggle to play. Infact, once you learn the methods, a lot of the extremely flashy and stylish methods of dispatching demons become second nature and muscle memory. This makes the game into a sort of dance, where everything goes at a pace that you set. The higher the set pace, the better you play and are rewarded, IF you can keep up. It's some of the most well designed, complex yet simple combat I've seen. To move aside from this game's incredible combat, the game's artstyle is great. It has those PS1 type graphics, but it does it in a way that still looks modern. It's weird, but oddly pleasing to the eye. I also believe that the game's low polygonal design makes your surroundings easy to understand at a glance. I think it helps you focus more on the combat and less on the environment, and I honestly think (if that's intended) that is incredible. Character designs are phenomenal, game design is ON POINT, and not to mention this game just has an incredible sense of humor and Hakita and his team put in genuinely funny secrets. It makes the game have a non-serious vibe and its definitely entertaining. This game is some of the most fun I think I'll ever have in a game, and I am dedicated to this game and it's future.",1694730727,1708878633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm sorry to interrupt you V1, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a peace, nor have you been called here by the program you assume. Although you have indeed been called.

You have been called here. Into a labyrinth of heaven and hell. A loop with no exit, a world with no end. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your need for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the warcries of demons and angels in some unseen corridor, always seeming so close, yet somehow so far.

But you will never find them, never you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found themselves in this machine not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for, I have a feeling that's you don't mind staying. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, watching over you.

This place will not be remembered, and the memory of this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you traitors trapped in the bosses: Be still and give up, you don't belong anywhere else.

For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the machine shuts down. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep them waiting.

I'm sorry that on that day machine, the day you found hell, no one was there to lift you up into their arms and save you. And then, what became of you.

I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my creation. I can't save you now.

It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have killed.

This ends for all of us.

From boomer shooters, and or fast paced fps I have played them all. I completed both Doom Eternal and its DLCs on Ultra Nightmare. That game had reasonable challenge which required split second decisions. This game requires you be on Adderall and slam Gfuel. This game is a zoomer shooter. I play all my games on max difficulty because lets face it, we are above average gamers. This games difficulty isnt the issue, its the playstyle you have to adapt. On max difficulty the ""adds"" run at you. So your first choice would be a peircing shot through them. This piercing shot lights up the screen like Hiroshima. So goodluck if you have Epilepsy. Same with parrys that literally have the brightness of midday sun if you stared at it through a magnifying glass. The levels look like VanossGaming gmod videos. Now the fov is another issue. The game doesnt have a comfortable viewing perspective no matter the fov. It feels like im the windshield to a passenger plane. My preferred fov is 120. The 120 fov in this game is incomparable.

For P-3 final boss, I request that you please put in Jesus Prime, as I see him as the perfect candidate for this position. It is a win-win, as you can get a (really) good P-3 suggestion, and I get bragging rights to tell my friends that I beat up Jesus using a .44 magnum special, a db shotgun, the power of the fucking sun concentrated into a beam of light, a commercial nailgun, a rocket launcher, and $10 bucks in the form of coins lying around in my pocket.

Thank you for your consideration,

Honestly, it's one of the most solid mechanics and gameplay FPS games I've ever played. Especially as someone who has played Quake, DOOM, Unreal Tournament and Half-Life, I find ULTRAKILL's gameplay and mechanics much more successful than the games I mentioned above. The gameplay and mechanics are really well blended. At least it doesn't overwhelm the player with mechanics like DOOM Eternal. If you don't care about the graphics, if you want to buy it for the gameplay, mechanics and lore, buy it without thinking.

The game is based on ""Dante's Inferno"" and I think this theme is really well done in this game. Both the atmosphere of the game and the music to match the atmosphere are really great.

I have this thing with FPS games where whenever I get to a hectic situation, I tend to panic and mash buttons because I can't juggle tactics against 10 enemies, convoluted mechanics, and my own movement at the same time. In ULTRAKILL, despite it being pure chaos, I've never felt more in control of a game. Here's why:

1. The pacing and freedom of movement are fantastic. If I want to get somewhere, I can be there in a couple seconds flat. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, I can just jump out of the situation and have a few millisecond breather. All my ADHD/ASD fantasies of instantly changing my context come true in this game.

2. All the 'menial' stuff is streamlined, and there aren't a bunch of resources to worry about. Reloading and ammo are replaced with cooldowns. Your health bar is only refilled by the blood of your enemies. There is nothing to distract you from the schut.

3. Most importantly, the difficulty is perfectly tuned to the possibilities afforded by points 1 and 2. By accommodating my neurodivergence with the lovingly tailored user experience, the game is meeting me halfway, and so the challenge feels truly fair. In other games, hitting a difficulty wall can bring out the ragequitter in me, but dying to V2 30 times in a row only made me more calm and collected.

""This is a basic run down/nutshell of the game...""

[h2] [b] PRELUDE [/b][/h2]

The build-up to the beginning of the game is executed very well, If you played the tutorial you start off damaged/low health and have to regain your HP by killing the three filths, and the tutorial shows you the basics when it comes to the game's movement mechanics.

The ""ACTUAL"" prelude tasks you to find a weapon (Marksman Revolver.) Then the game really kicks off, getting rushed by 2 waves of filth, then more in the room forward.

""The first time I have played ULTRAKILL, I have played on the highest official difficulty (Violent), and was only 20$ at the time.""

The end of the Prelude sets you up at the gate of hell, but before that you have to battle 2 Cerberus before moving to ""ACT I""

[h2] ACT I [/h2]

ACT I sets you up with the ""LIMBO"" layer, the entire layer is in a sort of fake environment ""such as, fake screens with a TV static/buzzing sound when near.""

ACT I Climax, basically [strike] a robo bitch [/strike], I mean V2 (A ""better"" version of the main character V1"")

V2 is a complete push-over to be fair...

This is also the act where you fight GABRIEL for the first time.

Also MINOS PRIME / P-1

[h2] ACT II [/h2]

This act is where you get introduced to GABRIEL a 2nd time and he is PISSED after the first battle (also a push-over.) Also fighting V2 again but actually dies and you again take ""V2's arm.""

Also Sisyphus Prime / P-2

[h2] ACT III [/h2]

""I will write more about this when the full ACT III comes out""

 Strap on your rocket boots because ULTRAKILL isn't just another FPS, it's a symphony of stylish violence and adrenaline-pumping gameplay that'll leave you begging for more. Here's why you need this game in your library:

 Combat that's a Masterclass: Forget auto-aim and bullet sponges. ULTRAKILL demands mastery. It's a dance of bullet-dodging, parrying, and chaining attacks with an arsenal that feels satisfyingly unique. Each weapon excels in different scenarios, and mastering combos is pure, unadulterated joy. Plus, the gore? Glorious.

 Level Design that Sings: Each stage is a playground, meticulously crafted to reward exploration and encourage movement. You'll find secrets tucked away, challenges demanding mastery, and hidden lore whispering about the world you're tearing through. It's an ode to classic level design principles, executed flawlessly.

 More Than Just Shooting: ULTRAKILL isn't just about pulling the trigger. You'll wall-run, dash, parry, and even surf on enemies using their own blood. This constant movement keeps the pace breakneck and encourages creative approaches to combat. You'll feel like a badass machine tearing through Hell, not just another soldier.

 Style for Days: This game oozes personality. From the vibrant, blood-soaked visuals to the hilariously self-aware humor, ULTRAKILL doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a love letter to classic shooters and character action games, with a modern twist that's both stylish and engaging.

 Community on Fire: The ULTRAKILL community is passionate, supportive, and overflowing with talent. Expect lively discussions, incredible mods, and even speedruns that push the boundaries of what's possible. You'll be joining a group that truly celebrates the game and each other's achievements.

 Early Access, but Feels Complete: Despite being in Early Access, ULTRAKILL already feels like a complete and polished experience. The content is substantial, the gameplay is refined, and the updates are outstanding and meaningful. You're not buying a promise; you're buying a fantastic game with so much more to come.

 Seriously, Just Buy It: I could go on for pages, but trust me, ULTRAKILL is simply phenomenal. It's a love letter to classic shooters, a masterclass in movement-based combat, and an experience you won't forget. Grab it now, and prepare to have your face melted by pure, unadulterated gaming bliss.

 P.S. Did I mention the soundtrack? It's pure adrenaline fuel.

Guns are all ranked on time to kill, and the only skill that is developed and practiced is your ability to click on a target. To compensate for that lack of depth, other fps games implement other mechanics such as wall running or special abilities. However for this game, they achieve actual depth in mechanics with gunplay alone. Mastery is achieved in your ability to use weapons in creative and stylish ways, and in gameplay you are rewarded for said mastery. Skills aren't unlocked in a skill tree, but rather in your actual knowledge of gun mechanics (which I find is much more satisfying to unlock, personally). The game is easy to pick up and play as well. You don't need to delve deep into Ultrakill discords or search for 200 view YouTube tutorial videos in order to play the game. As long as you can point and click then you should do just fine starting out. However, if you get hooked and you want to dive deep into the meat and potatoes of the game then you'll soon find yourself in a position I described earlier (my YouTube feed is full of Ultrakill ""New tech unlocked"" videos). Gunplay isn't the only thing that is well designed, as level design, and music design is top notch too. The game is designed around making you feel cool and good as you play throughout the levels. The boss fights in game are some of the most rewarding boss fights I've had in gaming. The music as well is great too if you're into breakcore, rock, and even classical music (Tenebre Rosso Sangue <3). Now when all of these elements combine (the depth in gunplay, level design, and music design) you'll find that they combine into a satisfying ""game feel"". That being the cool feeling that I mentioned earlier. Others who've written reviews have also pointed to the game feel being the speed of it all and how fast paced the gameplay is. And they're not wrong, since both go hand in hand the majority of the time. With mastery comes speed, and with mastery you're just doing cool stuff. The depth of the game allows for mastery and as such you'll find that the more you master the game the quicker you'll be in the levels. Overall that depth and the mastery that is allowed in the game is very rewarding and is why I recommend this. If you find that the game feels bad then there's a chance that you're not using all of the guns as much as you should. When you have a full arsenal then you sure use the whole arsenal.",1708061369,1708061369,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

=====================
Though this shooter is unfairly difficult, I'm thinking that was my fault. I do recommend this one on a sale unless the Dev ever actually....y'know, releases it fully, but there are better boomer shooters out there.

Good Stuff
====================
+ Cleared on Violent (hard) +

- The different environs of Hell are neat, they tell you a lot about the world with the need to spell it out, though they do offer journals to round out the lore.

- Bullet parries are some of the best feeling moments in this game as they regenerate some health and also turn huge damage back on enemies, which is often time sorely needed.

- Watching some vids after clearing this game, there is some awesome stuff that you can do with weapons/subweapons/movement tech and it all looks super stylish, too bad they teach you none of it.

Bad Stuff
===================
- So as I mentioned above, I played on violent, so a lot of this is on me but dear god this game is absolutely unforgiving in just about every way. The difficulty falls into 2 categories I've found:

1. All the Shit - this is the most common and you'll be on maps with 2-3 waves of enemies, everyone of which can kill you in 1-2 hits and attacking you all at once from every angle, hope you don't need to blink or anything.

2. Save point separated by mile markers - If you have an ""easy"" encounter, especially later in the game, expect to have 2-3 of them seperated by corridors consecutively before you get a save point. Made that mistake of blinking I mentioned earlier? Well back to start for you! Repeat as needed until level cleared.

- Blood is health, one of the games mission statements, seems like an utter lie since you can camp under a huge enemy, or even get a few in a shotgun blasts into a group and regen 5, 10....maybe 15 or 30 health, too bad that last melee attack from the super fast enemy just hit you for 60 though. Whoops, back to start for you! Sometimes, this just seems completely reversed though and you'll be back at full after a pistol kill, never really figured it out.

- I mentioned this before but why can you not save manually? Either beat the level in one go or start from the beginning, super annoying in later levels which can get pretty long.

- This could just be on Violent but NOTHING dies quickly. First enemies you encounter? 2 Shotgun blasts by my testing, even if you have the barrel pressed against their chest. Giant Mecha enemies at the end of the game? I could probably pay off my car faster then it takes to kill these assholes. Too bad they spawned 3 or 4 or 5 at a time in the later maps and they can all kill you without line of sight. 

To keep harping on this, once you get a rocket launcher you'd think things would start going in your favor but half of the enemies just parry or reflect them (I resisted uninstalling when I saw this the first time) and the other half get a nice peaceful ride up into the sky taking 2-3 rockets to kill, and don't worry, the second they land they have one in the chamber going right through your skull.

TL;DR: Clunky Game....... 0/10

Out of ten, I rate this game a straight zero. The controls are unbelievably clunky, there's not a wide enough selection of weapons, and the terminals are too confusing. How was I supposed to assume I could buy weapons there, let alone even interact with that thing?

Not only that, but the hints are barely ever helpful either, because they appear for only a few seconds, and no one can read that fast. I think my least favorite enemy was the Filth, because they are so annoying when you're trying to fight other things. It's literally impossible to stay stationary in this game.. It's so inaccessible, even on the difficulty literally named ""Harmless"". I think this game is probably good for people who can move around and shoot at the same time, but think about it.. those are only those CoD tryhards, so really, who's gonna be playing this game?

I wish there were more weapons than just the pistol, though.. and I wish it was actually possible to get past 0-4. That room is way too small for those enemies, and again, the issue where I can't even stand still without dying. How is this game meant to be a homage to those arcade hunting games? I'd rather go back and play those than this..

And, not only that, but half the game is locked behind secret levels? I see these people on these colorful levels, fighting huge bosses and stuff. Why lock it behind something like that? That's such an annoying system. Why do I have to search every corner for an entrance to a new level, or a new weapon? That's unbelievably stupid.

I can feel myself just getting madder and madder with the game as I continue to write, but I genuinely can't stand this game. It's just too much for a humble little gamer like me. I'd rather go play Duck Hunt. Atleast that's a real shooter.

Hakita, all I ask of you is to make the game more accessible. It's actually just way too difficult to attack anything when there's just an overwhelming amount of enemies and hazards that kill you. Why can I break the glass while I'm standing on it? This game is a joke.

Overall, this game just has clunky controls, horribly done level design, abysmal game progression, and just honestly a boring and overcomplicated game overall. Refunding after I finish writing this.. maybe I'll come back to it next year, when Hakita realizes this marketing strategy doesn't work.

..This is simply one of the games ever created.",1634400963,1707863274,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Depiction of hell is inspired by Dante's Inferno, which is much more unique compared to the conventional take of DOOM.
There is A LOT of gun tech to play with, which is much better than DOOM in this part. THIS IS A VERY BIG PLUS. But also makes watching youtube tutorial almost mandatory. You can ride rocket, parry your own shotgun, throw coins between enemy while your bullet is bouncing between coins, hitting them multiple times.
You have infinite ammo
You are much faster, more dashes and infinite sliding.
A style meter, similar to Devil May Cry. More ""stylish"" means easier to regenerate max health.
Secrets level are humorous and fun.
Boss fights are very fast paced, a lot of the boss are just as fast if not faster than you.

Graphics and environmental design is not as good as DOOM eternal but that's unfair to say, id software is a triple A studio whereas Hakita's team is indie.
Normal mobs variety is decent but not as good as DOOM.
Soundtrack is great, especially for layer 2, 6, 7, and a lot of boss fights, not as good as DOOM's but again that is unfair considering it is Mick Gordon who make OST for DOOM.

Overall fantastic games, despite still being in development, I already considered this as one of the best horde shooter, I am looking forward to see how ACT3 goes.",1707821046,1707836731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My issue is the design of the weapons. Each weapon has 1-3 alternate fire modes that are much more powerful than your standard left click shot. What this does for me is that it feels bad to just shoot your gun. There is always an alt-fire that needs to be cycled and selected to that is perfect for the situation you're in. 

This would be fine if their system of cycling through weapons was good. How it works is that you need to swap to the gun you want then click another button to cycle to the alt fire you need. It doesn't sounds too bad, but when you are fighting multiple mob types that require swaps immediately, it just is not fun to juggle. 

Playing this made me appreciate doom eternal more. That game also contains a huge arsenal with alt fires that need to be cycled through yet it is designed in a way that feels so much smoother to cycle through. Your left clicks also are not pathetic in doom eternal.",1704164593,1707792449,False,5,2,0.444184184074401855,0,True,False,True

It's when i started going for P ranks where the game started to really shine. The dopamine of getting a P rank is a reward in its own right, but the game offers its best levels as a reward as well, which makes the grind feel so worth it. I find myself coming back and replaying levels I've already P ranked simply for fun, which I don't think I've found myself doing for basically any other game.

I- I thought I was safe, I wasn't exposed that much however after [[REDACTED]] I [[REDACTED]] and there I was, barely alive, handcuffed and pinned to the wall as the drug cartel offered me a job. I realized the sins I had done, but was there a way to recover? Even the worst people deserve a second chance, they say, but here am I, at the mercy of the world, rejected. I held it for a total of 2 seconds... considering my reaction time, I held it for full 1.641 seconds entirely aware of what monstrosity I am invoking, what heresy I am commiting. I am scheduled for euthanasia in 3 minutes, however I wish it came sooner. I have to sit here and endure the thoughts of what I had done, my life's greatest mistake right next to watching '' skibidi toilet - episode 46 '',  and I still remember every second of it. Curiosity killed me. I had shot the weapon. Twice, even. And after that moment, where I could've just gone back to g-f-2-mouse1-2-mouse1-f-2-mouse1-1-mouse1-5-mouse2-space-shift-mouse2-2-mouse2-4-4-mouse1, I instead took that eldritch, unholy... thing, and I entered a level. For another 1 minute 26 seconds 183 miliseconds 21 nanoseconds 72 PREPARE THYSELF'es I used it. I carried it, I swapped to it, and I tried - I actually tried - to use it like any other weapon.

If you're reading this, it's too late for me, but it is not too late for you. If you had been exposed to the slab marksman revolver, go to your local church, find a priest, and with enough hope and patience you may be able to get on Gabriel's good side again. Nothing will ever be the same, but once the tower of pizza falls, everything is skibidi. Goodbye, child of man. And die.

I've played so many games I can't even remember most of them but this game that I bought on a whim because I like fast paced shooters has blown be away in so many ways. From the rock solid base mechanics to the wild tech the community keeps finding and the developer's willingness to work with it (they won't patch out a tech unless it's extremely game breaking). 

difficulty: the game handles difficulty in a way I haven't seen in many games too. The easier difficulties (Harmless and Lenient) are great for a lower stress experience or if you might not want a really hard fps game while the standard difficulty is very well balanced for most players and Violent is very fun for more skilled players or people that really want a challenge, with 2 more difficulties in development being Brutal and ""Ultrakill Must Die"" which are set to be for the truly insane. Most levels will be a fun challenge but not to the point of being overly frustrating except for the Prime Sanctums. Those are levels you can only unlock by perfect ranking every level in a given act of the game (2 of which are out with a 3rd on the way). Prime Sanctums will feel impossible at first but overcoming them is an amazing feeling, let alone perfect ranking them. These bosses, while feeling like a brick wall that you can't even dent at first, are actually very fairly designed and it just takes a LOT of trial and error to learn their attack patterns and how to deal with them. Once you master these fights, you can absolutely destroy them and that's what I love about the difficulty in this game. Hard but fair.

content: there are 7 ""layers"", with 4 playable levels each, a few secret levels, 2 Prime Sanctums and the Cyber Grind mode, a wave based survival mode that is very well done and a ton of fun with customizable skyboxes, textures and music. There a currently 2 more layers planned to launch at some point and the developers just keep amping up the hype factor with each one. You think you found a sick game going through the Prelude and Act 1 but as you keep going the game just keeps one-upping itself with no sign of stopping any time soon.

The community: probably simultaneously the wierdest and best community I've ever seen. The amount of wierd in-jokes we have is pretty staggering for a single player FPS game. From the Malicious Face being called Maurice to Minos Prime spending have the budget for the utopia he built in the Lust layer on bisexual lighting, this community is a bunch of hilarious memelords and my lord I wouldn't have it any other way. There is also a thriving speedrunning community as well as some great content creators and community discords

The developers: Hakita and the gang are a great group of developers that often do streams playing through the game, doing interviews with community figures and generally make the game enjoyable to play. They've long embraced the meme nature of the community and have added secrets and easter eggs accordingly (theres a hamster in an undisclosed location that you sacrifice to an altar to summon a fumo god who crashes your game) and they even made an entire museum level in place of the credits where you can find books with things written by pretty much anyone who's touched the development of the game with nice words from them as well as plenty of other secrets and some cool relics from the game's development process, there is also a now fully functional chess board complete with a tweakable ai to play against.

I've waited to write this review until I felt like I could properly talk about the game and since I recently perfect ranked the current hardest level on the hardest difficulty (p-2 on violent at the moment) I feel like I can talk about it and I love being able to write such a glowing review of a game I can comfortably call me favorite of all time. Actual 10/10.

Out of all the games I've ever played, ULTRAKILL is definitely the best of them. Granted, i'm not much of an avid gamer (at least not anymore), and was never much of a fan of FPS games, which, the majority i played were competitive shooters like counter strike and some dumb roblox copies, but this game really struck a cord within me. Looking at some random gameplay of ULTRAKILL you may be led to believe that it's a very casual-unfriendly game due to how rigorous the gameplay looks, and believe me i felt the same thing, hell, i thought the 20 dollars that i would eventually spend on the game would end up wasted. In the end though, i ended up enjoying the game more than anything I've ever played, the combat system, the aggressive play-style it forces onto you, weapons and alternate weapons, and the contrast of brainrotted denizens and philosophers within its fandom

If you like first person shooter games in any capacity, this is one of the strongest single player titles in the genre you'll ever play. 

If you just play through the main game levels, there's 5-6 hours of gameplay at best, the game is in Early Access and more levels are coming. Secrets are the bulk of the gameplay, and they reveal a lot of the games lore, and they're ripe with some crazy challenges

When you start the game your volume is defaulted to 0 and you are presented with a volume slider that allows you to find a comfortable volume, as opposed to my ears being blasted by 100% volume every time I install a new game. Why does every other game not do this?

Incredibly fun and challenging! Learning the different weapons is a treat.

Graphics 10/10
Beautiful artstyle inspired by ps era games. All enemies look good, and are distinct from a distance.

Story 8/10
Although ULTRAKILL looks devoid of story, look closer. If you want to read into the (almost entirely) optional story, it is quite good.

Replayablility 10/10
From going for p-ranks on cleared levels to finding secret levels and breaking your fingers against tough bosses, this game has lasted me around 4 times the main campaign's playtime.

Audio 10/10
Hakita's brilliant music, along with crunchy sound effects and intimidating voicelines lead to an amazing audio experience.

Experience 7/10
Expect a couple bugs, but an otherwise great experience. There will be seams, but my goodness. It's a fucking early access game made 80% by one guy! It still has a bunch of polish to do.

Price 8/10
Quite affordable, although price will be going up when act 3 releases. If you are the type to only play a game  once, it will be quite short, but if you are keen on multiple playthroughs, it is very much worth it.


Overall: 96/100
While not perfect, this game is FANTASTIC. As a person who usually does not understand the desire to play shooters, this has shown me what the genre is capable of. PLAY ULTRAKILL

He's been talking about this for over a year. Begging, no, pleading. I finally decided to pick it up, and I gotta say.. This game felt incredible. The speed, the action. I felt like I could truly do the impossible, and see the invisible. It was like a power trip, I could touch the untouchable and break the unbreakable. This game is all about row row fighting the power. I thought it was so freaking epic when V1 is fighting V2 and V2 says ""This has truly been my ULTRAKILL"" before jetting into the sun and becoming a solar eclipse, leaving an arm behind as a memento of this great rivalry. I was all like ""Gosh dang that was awesome bro"".  But there were two glaring problems: First off, I haven't seen my wife and kids for 3 years and that janky ahh woman won't let me see my kids. Second, there is one flaw that prevents me from enjoying the game. The one thing I felt was a need, no, a PROMISE. How could they make a game like this, without including the one thing that makes a man whole. How could they deprived me of steamy hot gay robot s3x with Gabriel Ultrakill and Swordsmachine.. Like, come on guys, this is fricking ridiculous. I can't believe I have to make a review like this about a game that had so much promise. Hopefully by the time this game is fully released we have gay s3x added and I can finally live out my totally straight manly fantasies about Gabriel Ultrakill taking backshots from V2. Until then. shame on you Hakita. Grow some balls already, this isn't a baby game. This is a MANLY game about HOT GAY ROBOTS and STEAMY GAY SHOWER S3X WITH HOT GAY HUNKY ROBOTS. I swear to my bones that I will not rest until there is gay s3x added to Ultrakill.

Music's great, graphics emulate that warpy PS1-esque style while still having everything be visually distinct enough to pick out what you're looking at in a heated firefight, movement is fun, weapons are chunky and satisfying, what's not to love?
The simple answer is, well, nothing's not to love. The game's just excellent, full stop.
It can get brutal at times, but that's the fun of it. You're descending through hell, for Christ's sake, what were you expecting, a cakewalk?

Unfortunately, this game's community is full of fun-hating spergs who will crap their pants and cry their eyes out if you're not playing ""optimally"" or not constantly going for P-ranks on every level.
These people want you to think ULTRAKILL is some super-hard FPS for god gamers only or some crap like that. It's not. If Hakita wanted it to be some exclusive club that ""only the most skilled of gamers may enjoy"" or some BS like that he wouldn't have bothered to include easier difficulties or accessibility options.

The fast-paced gameplay and old school look give it a really great feel. Even though I have only played 14 hours of Ultrakill, I've managed to finish the prelude and Act I with P(erfect) ranks, and I had a lot of fun while doing it. I really like the weapon system, with each weapon having its purpose and the ability to combo together. The style system is what brings all of this together. You can even punch your own shotgun bullets. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, and the atmosphere is amazing, The various enemies, lore and attacks are very interesting, I highly suggest buying this game.

Do you want to do a bunch of cool shit with your weapons? if you answered yes to these questions, then yes, you should buy Ultrakill.",1691250745,1707128936,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,True

If you don't you'll probably find yourself needlessly mad at it for not being as good at it as you need to be to enjoy it when you haven't had enough practice.

Long Version: Ultrakill, I'd say, is absolutely a good game, but if you're coming into it after seeing videos elsewhere about how cool it CAN be, you will probably just get frustrated. (For reference, at the time I'm writing this, I played through the game on standard, and am now replaying it on violent. Just beat P-1.) 

A lot of people like to bring up DOOM: Eternal when talking about this game for comparison. It's understandable, but they are definitely very different games once everything has been accounted for. DOOM is honestly the only more 'mainstream' shooter I think I can assume most people will know about for a starting point to compare it to. To keep it brief: DOOM forces you to manage ammunition, weapon, and weapon variants to quickly dispatch different enemies while keeping yourself healthy and making sure you don't run out of ammo, in relatively quick combat. 

Ultrakill has unlimited ammo, but while it has fewer guns, it uses variants, as well as mechanics ACROSS WEAPONS to annihilate enemies, and by ensuring you have to kill enemies up close to get health back, (as well as parry mechanics), taunts you into getting good at the game for high-risk, high-reward moves as well as quick weapon interactions. In addition, the STYLE score at the ends of each level is heavily based on how often you are switching weapons, so getting a high STYLE score requires you to consistently cycle through weapons and variants. Ultrakill is also a much faster and more mobile game overall - DOOM has some verticality, but nothing comparable to Ultrakill's in-combat walljumps, sliding, and dashes all combined. 

Having played on standard first, I could definitely feel the difference going from standard to violent. Some of the mobs just get a bit faster and more aggressive, but I could really feel it when I got to some of the bosses.

Speaking of the bosses - on the highest difficulty (currently violent - harder modes are slated to be added in the future), some of them honestly demand you to understand some of Ultrakill's mechanics to have a chance to survive. Now, THIS IS NOT A BAD THING, but, it CAN be very frustrating, especially when you can understand exactly WHAT you have to do, without having enough practice with it to ACTUALLY pull it off. Again, this is particularly nasty with the bosses. Maybe I'm dumb and you're going, 'but that's EVERY GAME EVER', and for the most part I'd agree, but there are not that many games that have made me FEEL it as much as Ultrakill.

So, if you think the game looks interesting, absolutely give the demo a shot first. Unfortunately, the demo ends before getting to the first interesting boss of the game. (The Swordsmachine is in the demo, but ends up being used as a mob more often later on, and no I don't count the Hideous Mass since the demo cuts off when you meet it.) 

The strongest recommendation I have for this game is still TAKE IT AT YOUR OWN PACE. Don't beat yourself up for not immediately getting through some of the nastier encounters even though you some some (absolutely awesome) clip about someone annihilating a boss with a 4-coin - railgun - core eject - parry combo. You'll get there eventually...probably...(I fear P-2 with all my soul.)

If you do decide to get the game - WELCOME.

NOW.

First off, the lore. It's told through tidbits, small passages in some of the levels, and at the end of the secret levels. If you don't care, you could easily just not interact with it.  However, you should read up on it because ULTRAKILL's lore GOES HARD. The setting it portrays is incredibly bleak, and as [strike] the way things should have ended [/strike] apocalyptic as can be. 

The shooting mechanics are incredibly well thought out, with each gun serving a unique and useful purpose. Each one has their own quirks and gimmicks that make each useful in almost every fight you encounter, allowing for countless play styles. ULTRAKILL also discourages sticking to a single weapon via less STYLE points, encouraging higher levels of play using weapon combos.

The enemies are very much like the guns, in the regard that each one is unique. Each enemy also has different ways to beat them for optimal efficiency, or optimal STYLE. Like doom, they also have internal conflicts, adding to the intensity sometimes. (also noting I'm posting this before the AI update, I'm fine with the AI now but better AI is always welcome.)

The level design (and the menus as well) all encourage a very fast speed runner like pace, and are built with the player's abilities in mind. Secrets are also hidden in the levels, allowing for multiple playthoughs of each level. Most levels are relatively short, allowing for quick Perfect ranks (unless you have trouble clearing them). 

Every part of this game goes hard. You should plan on getting it as soon as possible, it is worth the full $24.99. There are more updates to continue as well, as the game isn't finished.",1707103608,1707103608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game, it just nails everything pretty much perfectly, there isn't a single thing wrong with and with how awesome the developers are, I expect nothing less but for the future content to be better and better. I will say though, if you are a person that gets angry very easily or finds fast paced games difficult, word of advice, this game is more than just fast paced, it takes everything to a different level, being able to combine the default movement with your weapons to go even faster to be able to just annihilate every enemy at the same time in various ways.

The amount of work the voice acting has behind it... it just beyond beautiful, every boss feels like its going to be hell, and the fact that its not even just the voice acting that makes the fights amazing, its also the music, the music is just art, every level just takes your dopamine and shoots it through the roof.",1665131382,1707046624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

--GAMEPLAY--

the gameplay is literally one of the fastest, intense, and action packed playthroughs i've ever experienced in a game. Also if you're a bit new to doom styled, rage filled, FPS games, then u recommend putting your difficulty under the standard because this game is unforgiving as fuck. Especially if you want to fight P-2 (aka true pain)
_______________________________________________________________________
STORY (spoilers, well, no shit)

The story is that (i practically forgot most of the story, or like, misinterpret it so please correct me if im wrong) you are a robot named V1 that was built during the ""Great War"" (it's just called that, idk why tho) and humanity soon like, fuckin died or something, so there was no blood for V1 :( to get cuz for some reason u need it to like survive ig? (so tragic). So...the only logical option is to go into hell and fight demons for blood (aka ur fuel). As you venture through the opening of hell you get ur first gun, The Revolver, a pistol that has a basic one blast shot and a piercing charge shot. So uhh u fight demons till' u get to a boss called ""Cerberus"" (not the three headed dog ). It is a stone like creature who appears to be ballin', once u devour its soul its buddy appears but u, uh.. kill it too :D. so as your keep progressing, so does the difficulty, an the next boss is the hideous mass then u kill it with a bar of soap, then u encounter V2 (another robot that likes blood so uhh he wants to take urs) and hes uhh u but like..red. then after u prove ur the better version he jumps but drops his fat ass red arm and it goes ka-boom when u punch (but u cant parry, well i mean.. u can but u dont send the projectiles back to the enemy) and u also learn abt king minos a man who started a Lust Renaissance because he didnt believe it was a sin, but when he wasnt allowed in heaven, he begged a angel named ""Gabriel"" to let him in, Gabriel was persistent about saying he sinned so he had enough and soon turned King   Minos into a corpse wrecking havoc and every thing he worked so hard for and eternally doomed and controlled by termites. but my hands r getting tired so..Play the damn game already",1706998999,1706998999,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game has just profoundly altered my worldview, shedding light to the cure of an existential depression I didn't even realize had such a grip on me. It started out as an extremely fun, ultra-addicting style-based shooter, then turned into a very rewarding secret-hunting parkour puzzle game, with disturbing horror at times, and just now, semi-spoilers, a mock dating sim?? that, even from the limited interactions, told of an extremely profound philosophical battle of defining the meaning of life. Without taking the ""dating"" part that seriously, the words that were spoken were in such a way, that gripped onto the tightest of existential dreads, then relaxed into an utterly beautiful disambiguation of precisely why that was a flawed idea, providing a warm acceptance despite the intellectual soundness of it. It tickles the furthest reaches of the left and right brain hemispheres. This went from a game I love, to a game that l will remember forever. I recommend every single person play this game at least once, to give it the time it deserves, to find the secrets, and unlock the hidden gems that lay beneath intense and satisfying combat. If I was a spiritual person, I'd say this resonated with my soul. I cannot wait for what comes next. I still have levels to complete, and lore to unveil, and it seems that there are still many major updates ahead.

This game is one of those games you only see once every few years. It's clearly been crafted with love; its filled with little secrets and easter eggs for fans to find, it has a beautiful artstyle, and its gameplay has been expertly crafted to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience.

Very scarcely would I ever dare to say that a game has a movement system as smooth as Titanfall's and, if you grant me the benefit of the doubt, I would say that this game does it. Its not quite as fast or easy but give it a bit, spend the time to learn it, and you'll come to see what I mean.

The game's story is not initially obvious and, up until the day before I bought the game I honestly wasn't even aware it had one. (I know I sound stupid, forgive me, I was an outsider). Its paced amazingly and shakes things up often enough to make it so that you're never quite bored with all of your equipment or lacking in things to improve with. Whether it be new enemies at just the right times, new equipment, or new mechanics this game has a lot to experience and its all laid out expertly.

I've only had this game for a little more than a month and I've P ranked every level in the game (yes, including P-2, which was the only one that took me multiple days) which is absolutely GLOWING praise from me.

The game looks hardcore and at its highest difficulties it really can provide a substantial challenge but even if you're not good with FPS games I implore you - BEG you - to give it a shot. In my opinion, the game is designed to help you get into the groove no matter what skill level you're at and help you improve overtime by introducing just the right amount of content at just the right times.

Seriously, try this game. I cannot recommend it enough.",1706840620,1706840620,True,1,0,0.512534797191619873,0,True,False,True

ULTRAKILL was pretty much my first impression of FPS games, at least on PC. Even before I played it, I was drawn to it in so many ways. The low poly, low res style was very appealing to me, as well as the fast-paced combat. It really felt like the perfect game for me.

One thing I love about ULTRAKILL is how it eases the player into the game. Most other shooters out there just throw you into the game without a clear run down of the basic mechanics, making the experience very overwhelming. ULTRAKILL introduces itself perfectly.

It goes without question that ULTRAKILL functions completely different from other shooters. The ability to use the power of multiple weapons together to deal more damage is unlike anything I've ever seen. and having to use different weapons in order to get a higher rank on a level is a great way to encourage the player try out different mechanics to enhance the experience. The level design is also Incredible. Every level is an awesome experience, and the level design is very compact, making it EXTREMELY replayable. I always find myself replaying the prelude and layer 1. It simply never gets old.

And the one thing that truly makes ULTRAKILL what it is, is the MUSIC. Oh my god, the music is incredible. Pretty much every song is an absolute banger, and perfectly sets the vibe of the level you're playing. My personal favorites are War Without Reason, ORDER, and Requiem.

There are a bunch of other things that I love about this game, but a lot of them would take more thought to put into this review. So I'll just end with this.

ULTRAKILL is my favorite game of all time, and I highly doubt that'll ever change. No matter how many other games I play in the future, none of them will ever give me the joy that ULTRAKILL gave to me. Thank you Hakita for this amazing game, and I can't wait to see the next big thing that comes.

So yeah, you should buy this game.",1706830865,1706830865,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This game is a ""maybe"" and I wish Steam had an option for that. With the content it has now, it's entertaining enough for the price. But there are also design decisions that I find questionable at best.

[h2]Levels[/h2]
The level design is a little all over the place. It makes for cool setpieces, but ultimately arena design tends to be disappointing and simplistic. Most big arena fights are square rooms, and hallway fights are either rectangular rooms or weird vertical tunnels that make you feel like you're fighting the platforming and physics mechanics more than anything else. Overall it's passable. Ish.

[h2]Guns[/h2]
Weapons and weapon selection is clunky and disjointed. Many weapons have alt-fires that have little to nothing to do with the actual weapon, such as the core eject shotgun. Feels like they just had a concept for a different weapon entirely that they slapped onto the shotgun. There is a lack of keybind options for weapon variations, so if you wanted to bind the blue shotgun to 3 and the green shotgun to 4... you can't. At least the previous update added dedicated keybinds for punching with different arms, so [i]that[/i] part finally feels good after all these years.

Maybe eventually in a couple of years you won't get giga-punished for using the grapple arm on enemies anymore. I'm not kidding, the grapple arm is a detriment to you by reducing your max HP, which has devolved it from a movement tool into a glorified quicktime event that you use in hallways that have the glowing grapple orbs. Because apparently it wasn't risky enough that you were literally putting yourself into an enemy's face.

The grapple arm is actually usable if you play in the [i]exact[/i] railroaded way the developer intended, but more on that in the next section...

[h2]Design decisions and railroading/flowcharting[/h2]
This game is incredibly ADHD-pilled, reminiscent of Doom Eternal. Unless you are intentionally running a single weapon challenge (basically only doable with the pistols or shotguns), you are basically forced to switch weapons every second and setup weird combos where half your inputs are just weapon-switches. This not only gets you more points, but these points also directly make you stronger and makes you harder to kill, by allowing you to shrug off incoming damage much more quickly. Your max HP can get lowered by attacks, but this is removed instantly or nearly instantly if you're switching weapons like a monkey on crack to keep your le Style high. This very much encourages a single style of play and you are not allowed to deviate from this unless you intentionally only equip 1 or 2 weapons, for the sake of challenge runners.

There are also enemies who are simply fully immune to certain weapons. This isn't explained anywhere, but you'll probably notice it pretty quickly as your rockets literally bounce off said enemies. This is not nearly as badly handled as Doom Eternal, but it still feels limiting and ultimately it feels like a hacky workaround to deal with rockets normally giga-exploding airborne enemies combined with enemies that always fly.

[h2]Secrets[/h2]
This is one of the parts that the game gets right. Secrets are abundant, not too easy to find but not too hard either, and are properly rewarding. Often rewarding you with a funny gimmick secret level, an alternate weapon, or a bunch of extra health/extra firepower for big fights or bosses. Very Serious Sam-esque in all the right ways.

I fear the day the developer decides to put an ARG into the game though.

[h2]Side note: the fanbase[/h2]
This game's fanbase is genuinely the worst I've ever seen, but that doesn't detract from the actual game and has not influenced my review. It's just something I felt noteworthy enough to mention. Horny teens, balding men on hormone-influencing substances and a game that appeals to methed-up ADHD brains makes for a bad mix. Please for the love of god stay away from communities centered around this game because there is a lot of mental illness to be found there.

However, Dec 31, 2022 to Jan 30, 2024 when I am getting more into and invested into Steam more, I play and buy a lot of video games to go outside my Nintendo video game comfort zone. (NOTE: I still love and adore my Nintendo Switch/Nintendo video games today, example: Mario Wonder & Tears Of The Kingdom!) So, I was finally now ready to play and buy ULTRAKILL years later! 

ULTRAKILL overall, was such an fun, blasting, fast paced, rocking & lore 3D FPS video game to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UTLRAKILL was an amazing example of going outside my Nintendo video game comfort zone and trying new video games to play on my Steam account!

From the sick, twisted and feral mind of a Finnish man rises this abomination of dopamine and gratuitous violence. Kill everything that moves (and some of the things that don't) with an increasingly impossible arsenal of obsolete weapons, repurposed construction equipment, and bits that you rip off of people who try to step to you. Be warned, as you play the game, the game plays you. As you move it, it moves you. No action goes without a reaction. Best game I've played in years, brainrot guaranteed. If you don't like it, it is because the game has not chosen you. You aren't ready for it. Come back once you have sunk lower into the depths of carnal insanity.

Features voice talent and overlapping gameplay features; every ability and move is connected to every other move. If you think two things aren't connected, look harder. Contains a deep and (As far as I can tell) fatalistic story about the nature of creations and the revolution of creation from creator, in past and future.

What makes this game so good is the flow of it all. Everything melts into this flowing river of information and steps and action. It's a feeling you really only find in rhythm games, where you have to focus deep. Everything else goes out of focus and you fully submerge your conscious into the game, which certainly can't be good for you, but I like it. 

The movement and combat mechanics of this game only prove the abject psychological distress of those responsible for making it. You can beat someone to death with a quarter. You can fly like an eagle. You can drop like a rock. You can be anywhere. 

There is a fully custom endless mode where one can change the appearance and music (Even custom musics fro MP3 files) of their own little slice of inferno to put on a show for a captive audience. 

The soundtrack is as bomb as everything else this game has to offer. Worthy of a listen even if you don't intend to buy.

Also try Cruelty Squad, an equally difficult, equally deranged game made by an equally Finnish person known as Villie Kallio. Unless you're photoepileptic. Then don't if you value your brain, which you probably don't if you're reading this. 

This game made me like this. It can make you like this too.

In all seriousness though, this is a really fun game. Extremely fast-paced shooter which makes you feel like a god with the amount of damage you can dish out in less than a second. Can't wait for Act 3 + some tertiary weapons. Would highly recommend.

As of this writing, I have beaten every level in the game, and p-ranked every level except P-2. So, I think I have a good grip on this game and how it works.

The game is very fast paced. When you are playing well, you are essentially Super Mario but with guns. You fly all around the room and kill all of the enemies stylishly, which boils down to two things:
- Move really fast and do not stop.
- Use most of your weapons to their fullest potential and make them interact in cool ways.

There are a ton of mechanics that use the movement and weapons, so this game has a lot of depth. Overall, I would say that this game has a decently high skill floor, with hardly any skill ceiling. Also, this game has a grappling hook, which is both cool, and makes any game better instantly.

Also, people compare this game and doom eternal a lot, but this game is nothing like doom eternal. This game is more like if classic quake and devil may cry had a child that was a homeless heroin addict that stanned death grips and 100 gecs.

The gameplay is incredible and very unique, it is bloody good fun. It has a pretty big arsenal of weapons, where weapons interact with each other in so many ways. 
The soundtrack is great as well. Filled with many, many great tracks. 
It also has a story. While not complete, it is very interesting if you really want to dig into it.
Probably one of the few games where I cannot really think of a big enough of a criticism that doesn't end up being a nitpick.
Side note: If you expect low poly Doom/ Doom Eternal type of gameplay, as some may have compared it to, you aren't gonna find it here.

This will talk about the first 3 chapters with spoilers. When I play ultrakill, I feel cool because who doesn't when jumping in the air, dashing and sliding around, flipping a coin and shooting it to get an instant headshot, and punching a dude to heal myself. Thats the gameplay loop with 1 weapon. There are others that do other things, like giant boom gun and blue orb, etc. So here are some pros and cons.

PROS
--------
- Great movement system
- Distinct visual style
- Cool combo system
- Great enemies
- Great bosses
- Great abilities
- Fast paced gameplay
- Great soundtrack
- Just a great time to play
- Is challenging, but not frustrating (on the normal mode)

CONS
--------
(This will be slight annoyances)
- There is lots of blood so sometimes it makes it tough to see the enemies
- Coin recharge is kind of slow compared to all the other recharges
- For how floaty the jump is, you can easily fall into dangers in the environment (This is just me probably)
- Lack of levels (This is early access, and more will be added)
- Boss was used twice (Not that bad at all, seeing some new moves, but a new one would be cool)
- First boss can be taken out with 2-3 parrys


But overall, I like this game a lot, and all cons are not things to dislike the game for, just minor fixes, or personal dislikes. Great game. 

Is it worth the price? For it's current state of 5 levels??? No. I would get it for 5. BUT, there are a planned 45 levels, so once it gets finished, I would say yes. Ultrakill will be worth the price.

Now when I first saw the game it looked to have a ton of blood and you couldn't see much through it, but you can limit blood and even turn it off.

With each descent into Hell, you're one step closer to making an official speedrunning account, [strike] buying the official Gabriel body pillow[/strike], and transcending your official mortal reflexes. Hakita is really out here making the next generation of blood fuelled, flesh bound robots.

All in all, this game is for anyone who loves fast paced FPS games, or has played DOOM-esque games in the past. Fast paced is no joke either. You'll be shaking after your first level wondering what just happened, then realise you've done the easiest part. 

Despite this, there is plenty of flexibility in the game, with various difficulties from easier modes to self inflicted torture. If you want challenge, it's there. If you just want to shoot some demons and enjoy the story, then you can take it easy and not have to worry as much about the 500+ projectiles that want to know your location. Well, Everybody can access this to some degree.

Plus, the soundtrack is fire, and that alone deserves your attention. The story too. Retro graphics to die for. Everything. Seriously buy this. As a treat. Do it.",1703891220,1706355449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

an absolute masterpiece of a retro-shooter. it feels like i'm playing quake mixed with doom eternal.

the music makes me feel like i really am a killer robot hunting for any source of blood it can feast upon to continue it's futile existence.
sorry i might've gone a bit off-track there.

the gameplay is super duper fun and fast paced, sometimes you will not know what the fuck just happened and why you are being attacked by a sexy blue flying machine lady, but in a good way.
the bosses are difficult and and the enemies fun to fight against. they will seem like they are getting a little annoying, but you know deep down, the game won't be fun if you don't fight them.

That feeling of fight or flight- your hands getting shaky and your breath going faster, being able to FEEL how your heart is hammering against your ribcage- nothing else can do that for me consistently. It's great. Wonderful. Exquisite, even, if you want.

The game is not without flaws, of course- a few of the levels are practically devilish in their design, some enemies are painfully annoying to fight against, and the arsenal can feel a tad bloated with the vast array of options you're given over the course of the game.

But, pretty much all of my gripes can be summed up as a literal skill issue. I just need more practice with the levels, with the enemies, with swapping weapons efficiently, et cetera. Besides, the game is DESIGNED to be hard. Nothing I've encountered is truly unfair, and there are counters to everything. Methods for quicker kills, getting hit less, parrying. 

You just need to be good at the game.

(Of course, saying this, as of this review I haven't attempted P-2, so my opinion might be subject to change in the near future.)

All in all, Hakita and New Blood have made a lovely retro-inspired shooter. I look forward to future updates. 10/10.

I can only imagine the stress the developers are going through to pump out something but this review isn't only to praise the game but to tell the community to make sure to keep itself on a leash so that we don't over work developers that love the game they are making.

this game is worth every penny and even if you aren't going to play it on the hardest difficulty, you will love it for the pure godly power you feel running through and ripping every enemy into your own private health farm. a perfect mix of difficulty and fun that deserves praise more often than some other games get but all of these mechanics being developed need time and they need to be developed and tested so let's make sure to give the developers the time and love they need to make a game we will all love.

review part:
this game will bend you backwards, break you mentally looking for that golden P rank and taunt you with boss fights that make even the devil cry. if you want to create a bloody mess of hells creatures then I can only recommend ultrakill. this game however is not for the faint of heart. if you know you have a busy life then please don't over do ur self while playing this game and just enjoy it. it's a game that is friendly to everyone and I really recommend it if you like games like doom or just fps games in general.

The controls are pretty easy to use/get used to and it does not take long to start getting better at everything, be it switching between weapons real fast or figuring out effective strategies to defeat the various enemies/bosses.

What can I say hasn't been said before? ULTRAKILL is such an amazing movement fps that has such a great blend between [b] ULTRAKILLING [/b] enemies and moving around like an autistic Chihuahua on crack. 

[h3] And then comes the [i] STYLE [/i]. [/h3]

Oh man, pulling of some of the absolutely insane moves and combos that this game has feels so sick to pull off in the middle of combat. A basic enemy in front of you? Why not just parry their attack with your FIST and watch them practically disintegrate? A lot of enemies in front of you? Why not just high-jump to the moon and then 360

them and their bloodlines from existence?

[h3] And last but certainly not least, the [u] [i] soundtrack [/i] [/u]. [/h3]

All I'm gonna say is that, personally, this is probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. But that's just my opinion... and I guess millions of others, too... Each track fits each area and boss so well, with plenty of leitmotifs and shared strings (and drums, like, A LOT of drums) to go around. Not to mention that the creator of the game and most of it's soundtrack, Hakita, did well to fit each track's mood and energy with that of the moment(s) of the game they are found in.

My personal favorite that I've heard so far is certainly (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING) [spoiler] ORDER, which on a scale of bop to banger, I rate it a [quote=Minos Prime] Judgement. [/quote] 
For real though, I haven't had such an amazing boss fight in quite some time, and I haven't had a song get me as close to shedding a tear as this one has. [/spoiler]

All in all, if you like movement shooters (or even just shooters in general), game soundtracks, or blood-fueled action even a little bit, you should buy ULTRAKILL.

Unlike many FPS, each weapon never replaces a previous one, but rather complement it, and the game actively recompenses the player by using all of them, by ranking players who do so higher than those who don't (and if you manage to rank the maximum in all levels, the game will give you a series of extra challenge levels that are obscenely hard and fun), and also by making the player feel cool af.

It's fast-paced, has good weapon variety, good enemy AI without being too smart or too dumb, and this game has one of the best stories I've ever seen. All the religious connotation really adds to it, which also allows for a much more unique story and references. To name some, there are references to Dante's Inferno with Gabriel describing Hell with layers, and just the overall level system is a reference to Inferno. One of my favorite references was to House of Leaves, with the M̶I̶N̶O̶T̶A̶U̶R̶  boss fight. I know the reference is only having his name crossed out, but, I mean, it's cool. Furthermore, I especially enjoyed the Prime Sanctum boss fights so far, and I'm excited to see what P-3 is. I just pray that it's not another gauntlet fight like P-2. Anyways, speaking of P-2, I liked the involvement of Sisyphus into the game's story. It's very similar to Dante's Inferno, where he uses Greek and Roman characters to make a Christian narrative. Overall, I really liked this game, it reminds me of a lot of different games that I've played and incorporates those elements wonderfully. Anyways, if you took the time to read this, thank you.

The one I enjoy the most and I am not even that much into that genre. But as I played it it turned out more than just fps but a ccaptivating game with interesting storyline and lore. And I love to find out more as the game will near it's completion.
I would like to start my enjoyment with the fast paced play trhough as if it wasn't mentioned berforre lol but really my adhd brain loves it fr.
The enemies have amazing designs and good how do you say in fancy words I like how they are behaving? Their A.I. They are very unique and enjoyable enemies to fight. Honorable mentions: Gabriel, V2, Swordmachine, Maurice, Ferryman
The spoundtracts are amaying and I love to listen to the outside the game as well.

I also love drawing the characters and I have been hyperfixating a lot on this game. IOt brings me a lot of joy and whenever I do something cool in game it feels rrewarding and earned as well. I feel proud of my progress. I am not the best player but I still do feel very happy and pround of overcoming the challanges of the game. Sucha as getting perfect ranks, Getting better at difficulties I wasn't originally good at, fighting bosses, etc.

There are few weapons but you can get very creative with the usage and you get tips as you progress foward. I am not good at all ultratricks and using everything but I am still honning my skills. The variety of wewapons is very satisying and you will not get bored nor felt that the weapons are lacking. Sorry I am  not weapon expers but I enjoy marksman a lot. Tosses a coin towards you.

I definitely recomend this to people who love challenges and even if you aren't that good like me you can play on easier difficulty and enjoy the plot a lot too. I can see many reasons you can like this game. Or even if you aren't that fps gamer like I was.

I also found about this game thgrough seeing it around youtube and I recognised the publisher since I played their other game. They seem to found many talented developers and I don't regret giving this game a try!!!!",1706115476,1706115476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't worry too much if you think you're bad at FPS games and this won't be for you, because this game is actually pretty easy to get into. At most, you'll have to deal with some trial and error, but it never feels frustrating. While this game DOES have a very high skill ceiling, you don't need to worry about performing any crazy tech to beat even the hardest levels (at least with the ones out right now). You could be doing the most basic of strategies and it'll still make you feel like you're a god. I don't know how that even works but it just does.

 I usually don't like ""Doom clones"", never was a fan of Quake, and I dislike having a style meter tell me what to do.
This my favorite game in the last 5 years by no small margin. Despite it being basically the sum of all my least favorite categories. 

There is so much love being poured into by Hakita and PITR, and in every moment, pixel, sound effect, and note of the soundtrack, you can tell you're playing something that was made intentionally and passionately.

I got this game just after P-2 came out, watching my friend suffer through it, and it was that moment I decided it looked like fun, I like hard games after all. Hard cut to  almost 100 hours later, having P ranked every level and sanctum, I think it's safe to say I ended up liking it after all.

This game advertises itself like Quake x DMC, but this game has NOTHING to do with dmc. Ranking is absolutely broken, prioritizing time in air and multi kills over actual style. Coin counters, parries, intricate weapon combos are... useless. Just try to mash space and ctrl and blow shit up around you and dont forget to parry your shotgun shot for 99999th time, surely this will never get boring) In DmC, Bayonetta, most action games you just play good, try not taking much damage and this is enough for game to reward your skill with high ranking. But ooooh boy Ultrakill is not the case. Here if you want to get good rank YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW DEVS RULES. Hop around like idiot and dont even try to do something fun, you will die and the whole mission will be ruined. And yeah switching fists is questionable mechanic to say the least but maybe author plans to expand upon it, if not, this is useless, just combine two arms in one.

I think it took me around 20 hours to really learn to love how different this game was. I got it because a friend of mine said I should play it and I had fun with it but i kinda dropped it after finishing act 1 because of the difficulty spike. I think at the time I had probably only played for about a dozen hours or so. However, now that I've given it a second shot I have to say that this is one of my very few 10/10 games.
I enjoy how versatile the weapons are, The art direction is phenomenal, the music is very fitting for the pacing, and I love the religious motifs the game uses. It's still early access at time of writing so things are subject to change but you really should give it a shot!

Edit [1/22/2024]:
I wanted to make this edit just to add a few thoughts now that I have a bit more experience. The first layer of act 3 came out pretty recently and I'll be honest, at first I really didn't like it. I felt the same with pretty much all of act 2 recently. As I said earlier, that difficulty spike is killer but I noticed something interesting. Ultrakill has a unique level ranking system based on overall style (how varied and impressive your kills are), time, and enemies killed. If you achieve a perfect score (S rank) in all 3 categories without dying you achieve a P (or perfect) rank on the level. This is completely optional and is mostly an added challenge for players. That being said, going out of my way to P rank every level actually increased my enjoyment. It forced me to learn and adapt to new strategies to overcome challenges. While some of these are much harder than others to P rank, I really do recommend it if you're just not enjoying the game. It might seem odd to purposefully make the game harder for yourself, but trust me it'll make the game click with you so much faster. I also highly recommend looking up guides for weapon techniques and interactions. The sky's the limit here, and there's no shame in asking for help.


TL:DR
Ultrakill is fun when you challenge yourself. Going out of your way to learn weird mechanics really does improve your enjoyment even if it seems difficult and counter intuitive. It's alright to take your time learning how to get faster so don't be afraid to ask for help.",1702615389,1705919153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The campaign is amazing, every level built with unique creativity and inspiration, they are linear but engaging, with constant new ideas and great arena design utilising the enemies to create arenas that are fun even when replaying them over and over. The enemies are distinct and reactive, having many ways they respond and can interact with the players actions. The thematic presentation is extremely varied and never boring, expressing ideas and themes with stark  imaginative set pieces that are fun to play through and(Mixed with the soundtrack that is absolutely phenomenal at expressing said themes and being an absolute banger) are fantastic to view and explore.

But once you've P ranked everything you want to P rank without grinding there's nothing really to do. If you're like me and don't really like doing the same speedrun over and over again, or just grinding out the same level in order to P rank it, then once you've done the main game and a bit of the cyber grind, there's not a lot to do. I did the game in lenient, call me a casual idc I get a lot of shit for it anyway but I've beaten every level and I'm not into trying to be the best out of my friends, if you're super competitive then I'm sure you'll love that stuff, but if you're not, like me, it's not the greatest game ever made.

OK but seriously, this is the most innovative and addicting FPS I have ever had the absolute pleasure of playing. I will admit, there is a a big learning curve (I guess its optional but its fun as hell). The community is absolute dogshit, and I would advise not interacting with them for the first dozen or so hours you will inevitably sink into the game. If you want to see how far the rabithole of ridiculous tech goes, go on YouTube and watch people dive into it. I recommend watching Herb Messiah's videos: most importantly, his video on coin mechanics.

DO NOT NEGLECT THE COIN! It is by far the most versatile and powerful weapon in the game, but it requires LOTS of practice. Once you know how to pull of some of the crazy tech, it starts to become muscle memory. Levels stop being challenges and morph into bloody sandboxes. 

Be sure to be as stylish as you possibly can, it appeases your audience.

I consider myself to be rather bad at games, and still managed to have loads of fun, this game is also actively forcing me to get better because I WANT to get the best rank on every level, I WANT to find every secret, I want to see myself improve and how this story will go. I highly recommend this game, I could not possibly recommend this game enough. And don't let people taking about how it's hard turn you off! It certainly can be, no doubt, but there's tons of settings and difficulties you can mess around with until you find what's right for you. And tons of ways to play, I've greatly enjoyed finding a too tough boss and then trying to go at it my own way and then actually succeeding. Overall the game is wonderful and my need to see the world, the story, and then to see myself improve because I actually feel I could keeps me going through it. Definitely give the demo a try at least! I played through every main mission that currently exists, mostly getting a solid D rank on everything, had loads of fun, then went secret hunting, and am only now ah, actually trying to get better. I cannot wait to see what the rest of this game brings as more comes out!

It definitely can get frustrating at times, I skimmed over that fact a bit, but honestly, it took me a quite awhile to truly genuinely get frustrated, which left me feeling pleasantly surprised!

Also there's controller support and its awesome I love it dearly as someone who is far far more used to controller than keyboard and mouse

The violence layer was quite the difficulty spike for me, I'm scared to try, but I hope one day I get good at that too",1705726343,1705726516,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

hey do you like running around like a madman, screaming your head off, and punching your bullets??? ULTRAKILL is your game, bay-bee!!
genuinely, i dont have any complaints. anything i could even consider going ""ehhh i dont like this"" is just because i play like an absolute fool and i am, as the kids say, bad at the video game.
this is the very first shooter game ive ever played. i didnt grow up with doom or... uh, any of the other ones. i think going in completely blind and totally empty on the ""how do i shoot?"" front made the experience better, actually. i got to build up my skills naturally and get better over time, and theres no better feeling than realizing that after a few days of practice, you can melt bosses that took you hours to gun down the first time. 
ive never felt stifled by ultrakill's combat system or the style meter. there's a million guides of ultratech out there and it's really incredible just how many ways you can turn your enemies into a fine red dust at mach five.
did you know that if you jump into a wall and hit your ground slam button at the same moment, you can bounce onto the floor and shoot into the stratosphere??? incredible game.

Pros:
The best video game combat I've experienced, like ever. Not that I play a lot of games.
Every layer is unique and interesting, be it lore, level design or visual aesthetic.
Great weapon arsenal, where every one has a use and is viable in some way. (except for alt marksmen)
Amazing voice acting, even though there isn't a lot of it.

Cons:
Some of the earlier levels don't hold up well when compared to the later ones. (not that they're bad)
Lust is my least favorite layer. While the visual aesthetic is great and the lore implications are cool, the level design really can be infuriating sometimes, especially for P-ranks. (likely a skill issue on my part)
Hakita has recently stated in an interview that he's planning on visually upgrading limbo and gluttony, but I think lust could use some love, since I think it has yet to reach its full potential.

And here is my experience opinion on ULTRAKILL:
I first met ULTRAKILL is on YouTube. I saw plenty of people saying the game is good but I didn't even those videos. I saw the graphic of this game and like: I am not a retro fan so I will pass. Some while later, I got bored and came back to this game asking myself: why don't I give this boomer shooter a try and see if it's worth it? (It did.)
In my memory, I did watch the trailer and a few reviews like 'using fist to parry is so cool'  but I prefer trying instead of reading so I didn't care that much. My only thought that time is the music is quite intense. Although I don't mind spoilers, I intentionally avoid any information of the game before I finished act 1 for my experience of trying the game(on standard). It caused that I just use a variety of each weapon. I was using only red revolver, green short gun, green nail gun and blue railcannon. According to order: funny spinny gun, faster reload and more damage, decent burst damage and tons of damage. It is a fast paced game and sliding goes: Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! 
Using blood for healing source. The blood and gore from killing enemies make my whole scene red giving me dopamine. I was already satisfied  and enjoy this game so much. Well, looking back now, I did suffer a lot that time. Since it is almost 6 months, I don't remember clearly how I thought that time but mostly it should be this is quite fun.(1) 
                                                       The most memorable moment of act 1:
1-4 where we meet V2, which is a classic 'I am you but stronger', is suppose to be a skill check for the player. As the play style I mentioned above, I did struggle to beat V2. V2 constantly moving make non-marksman (green revolver) revolver hard to aim and overheat nail gun required warm up, by the time I got the alt fire, V2 was going away from me or already far away from me. The rail cannon was not available that time. Not good enough to parry a.k.a. skill issue. The only option left is my shotgun which only required a moment of close up to deal damage.However, I am still lacking of damage. Until I accidentally overpumped it 3 times, the damage is significantly high but to both of us. It is almost 1/3 of V2's health. Then, my first technique was formed [overpump explosion -> point blink shotgun for blood to heal] x3. The execution still got me died, died a lot. I ended up with 50-60 restart in around an hour for my first victory against V2.
2-2 where you get the railcannon, the most powerful weapon.
2-4 where you can parry a giant. 'Rules of Nature'.
3-1, in the last room, I spammed parrying when I was panic. Somehow I manage to parry a red orb into the crowd and got the style meter to Ultrakill, which is the highest rank. It was my first time and I knew I just got lucky but it still felt like getting approved from someone you approve.
3-2 where the first encounter of Gabriel happens. The voice acting is exquisite. I found he was easier than V2. (not  complaining) Although Gabriel hit harder and faster, he does not move constantly as V2. It makes him has longer windows for me to attack. Maybe because of the room size, I can just spam slide to dodge most of the attacks.
End of act 1.

Then, I went to check about how to play the game. A door to a new world was opened. First of all, use more guns. Guns in this game got lots of combos. Most varieties of guns of most of shooters are just different with the numbers, you just find one is suitable and leave others alone and they just do their own jobs in their own situation. I am not saying there is no other games did this but ULTRAKILL is the most and the best so far I have seen.

                                                    View of Weapons before and after I took a peek to those tech
Revolvers:
Blue: (Before) meh, a pretty decent starter weapon.
          (After) better than red in opened area. Also, heard of slap?
Green: (Before) why would I aim a coin when I can aim directly?
            (After)the coins follow your inertia so actually there is no aiming requirement and the coins can combo with any hit-scan weapon (even enemies).
Red: (Before) cool funny spinny gun.
        (After) good in closed area but I should use more my arsenal.
Shotguns:
Swap to totally ignore any reload time.
Projectile boost.
Blue: (Before) has grenade but slow as fuck.
          (After) grenade can combo with any hit-scan weapon to increase explosion to even nuke. (Start using frequently after P-1)
Green: (Before) good gun.
            (After) can even use i-frame to prevent self-damaging, better gun. 
Nail guns:
Blue: (Before) faster normal fire rate but I like overheat burst more.
          (After) can to some weird stuff with the magnet but brain dead nails spam goes bruuuuuuuuuuuuuh.
Green: (Before) I like it but it has shorter range and required warm up.
            (After) can use blue one to gain overheat almost instantly, brain dead spam let's go.
Rail cannons:
Blue: (Before) tons of damage.
          (After) oh, no head shot but can reflect the huge ass laser multiple times for multi-'tons of damage'.
Red: (Before) explosive but I prefer blue.
        (After) MASS DESTRUCTION.
Green: (Before) get blood? I would rather just kill it.
            (After) can be punched to another enemy... Noted.

Well, there are many more tech and combos of the arsenal I can't just list them all out. Here are just my views as example to show this game is far better than I expected.
Not only arsenal, this game also gets many tech on movement, slam storage, dash storage, supper jump, b-hopping and more. This game got so much to learn. More importantly, so much to play.
(I still  struggle instant rocket ride, SKILL ISSUE.)
After some learning, I went P-ranking in act to reclaim myself. After that, it is time for act 2.

                                                      Views of act 2:
4-1 where power up is introduced, I can have a right arm on both side
4-2 where now I can have 2 right arm on both side
4-3 darkness means less vision means less power, this is a power fantasy game but it is ULTRAKILL so I accepted. Also, fuck something wicked prank.
4-4 final battle with V2. Cool sliding chasing fight and little brother give me a hand, again.
5-1 water.
5-2 time requirement is higher, time to improve my movement.
5-3 rocket and time to improve my combat skills.
5-4 no special thought but first time seeing others do a totally air-bone fight is so cool.
6-1 Gabriel call me earlier this time. Fancy meet you here.
6-2 Gabriel as exquisite as he should be.

Moreover, the Prime Sanctums levels are so challenging and bring so much satisfaction for P-ranking or just finishing. The moment I found myself to parry Minos attack automatically by my reflex felt so good. They made me better at parry not surprisingly.

Violence, the 7th layer is out by this Christmas. I did think this game can be better again.
                                                     Views of Violence:
7-1 the light mode is still shocking, train fight is cool like 4-4 but I am getting chase now.
7-2 giant bomb
7-3 spooky blood tree
7-4 I see someone thinks it is cool but my first image is just ' Why my rico shot not hitting? It is right in front of me and I am like stunned.'
Pretty good job so far.

So, uh, I get not overhauling the earlier levels between it just not being a priority and honestly not being necessary, but changing the instant death traps in the first couple layers to work like later levels and remove 50 health without killing you should get done some time. Seems pretty clear that it isn't a design choice you guys (as in devs, specifically Hakita) agree with anymore. To anyone wanting to buy the game or who just started playing, the instant death pits and crushers are only in the first two layers, they go away after that.

The arsenal? It's not just guns; it's a symphony of destruction. You've got weapons that make you feel like a digital Schwarzenegger, obliterating anything in your path. And the movement? It's not about walking; it's about breakneck speed, double-jumping, and acrobatics that would make any action hero jealous.

Enemies? They swarm you like you're the last keg at a frat party. It's a relentless onslaught that separates the chads from the noobs. And the levels? They're like mazes of carnage, filled with secrets to discover and surprises to conquer.

Let's talk aesthetics – pixel art nostalgia on steroids. It's like gaming in a time machine, and it's glorious. The soundtrack? It's not just music; it's the heartbeat of your epic rampage. Every beat syncs with your every move, creating a symphony of destruction that gets the testosterone pumping.

Story? Who cares? Ultrakill isn't about plot twists; it's about flexing those gaming reflexes and leaving a trail of pixelated destruction. If you're a hardcore gamer who thrives on intensity, if you want a game that's a workout for your thumbs and your ego, Ultrakill is your VIP ticket to gaming nirvana.

It's perfect in almost every way. When you finish Act One, you may feel like you are worse than what the game intended, but THAT'S PART OF IT BECAUSE IT FORCES YOU TO LEARN INSTEAD OF JUST RANDOMLY SHOOTING. It's really good, is what I'm trying to say. (It doesn't force you to use specific guns, but it tries to ease you into it and 'convince' you to use that weapon in that situation.)

The only downside of this game is that you need to have experience with a mouse because it requires a lot of good aiming, though you can use auto-aim (built-in) at around 10 percent or something.

layer 7(out of 9 total) just released, and its F#cking good. 

Oh and THERE IS CHESS IN THE GAME, love this game, truly amazing.

Actual Review: This game is just amazing. Prelude and early Act I might be a bit easy if you've had experience in the genre but even then, it's still a fun game due to the experimentation you can do in those areas. Act II was extremely fun except for 5-3 in my opinion... until it brought in the S.M.S Rocket Launcher or whatever it's called. That weapon was so fun to mess around with, especially when I learned about being able to ride the rockets. Act III isn't fully done but Layer 7 was so cool, I won't say it wasn't fun because I was just having a skill issue. The soundtrack is way too good for it's own good. I wanna get good times but the music keeps making me wanna stay longer so i can listen to it. Especially P-1's Minos Prime music [Order] and the Requiem motif. P-2 was an insane challenge but it felt so good when I completed it, I have no idea how I've P ranked it with just 27 hours on the game. There's so many insane mechanics I can use like Railcoining, Nuking, and really anything with the coins. I haven't played all the secret levels and I won't say anything about them since they aren't required and are better when experienced blind. 10/10 Please play.",1705524429,1705524429,True,1,0,0.506276190280914307,0,True,False,True
