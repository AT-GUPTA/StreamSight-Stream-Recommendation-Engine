[spoiler]
1. The crew sedates the passengers’ food so they aren’t aware of a celebrity VIP coming on board. 

2. A few hours later, the celebrity’s cat sneaks into another passenger’s room at 2 AM. By cosmic coincidence, he's the only passenger who hasn't been sedated and he's still awake at 2AM. If this were a good game, you might guess he has some cool reason for being up at 2AM in his normal day clothes. A secret mission? A clandestine meeting?! Nope, he just doesn't like chicken. 

3. The killer knocks at the victim’s door to retrieve her cat (lucky break, he's not sedated). This defeats the purpose of sedating the passengers if she just randomly interacts with passengers. She has a disguise but doesn't wear it, oops she's kinda dumb. She could have asked a crewmate, but we're all in on the dumb train. He recognizes her and she fears that he’s going to report her to authorities. She fatally shoves him. 

4. While being pushed to his death, the victim somehow reaches backwards to grab the killer's earring. The killer somehow doesn't notice an earring getting ripped off. The victim somehow dies on a bedpost after being pushed by a ballerina, possibly because he's flailing his hands behind his back like an idiot. 

5. Later on, someone else happens to have a large snake onboard and in a cosmic coincidence it’ll stumble into a room where the lawyer has mistaken a fatal push for a snake attack. The snake isn't involved at all, an escaped snake just happened to find itself in the murderer’s room shortly after the murder was committed. [b]This is the dumbest red herring I've ever seen[/b].

Separately, the game is doused in angry nationalism throughout. I'm not sure if it's worse quoting like 5 times ""a Japanese man's sword is his soul"" or having every murder accusation against a Japanese suspect be a Western frame job, but you're getting both, take it or leave it. I dunno, tossing the body overboard and then claiming it was a suicide or accident might have been more believable than anything we've heard so far. (Murder snakes! Murder cats! Murder ballerinas disguised as assassins!)",1629111593,1709004224,False,5,6,0.404948204755783081,14,True,False,False

For example. I read all those reviews, and am writing this, and the characters are still beating around the bush saying the same thing over and over before getting to the point. The fact I can't immediately shut this down and move on once, I, the player, get the point is terrrrible.

Like, I haven't paid attention at all after the first exchange and nothing new has been said, I'm not lost at all glancing over now. Yikes. And this happens a lot.

I've played through the Phoenix Wright trilogy, and next to any one of those three games, this one just doesn't stack up. Out of respect for PW, I played all five chapters of this game. The game had its moments to be sure, which is why I'm begrudgingly recommending it to PW fans, but they were few and far between, and the extra animation failed to compensate. The investigations mainly consisted of nothing but bloated dialogue, and during each investigation, collection of physical evidence, surprise encounters and depth of exploration were all minimal. Also important to note: Chapter 2 lacked a trial and Chapter 3 lacked an investigation, which was pretty unsatisfying.

Always research a game before buying it
Liked Phoenix Wright = ""maybe"" buy this
Didn't like Phoenix Wright = definitely don't buy this

tldr - if you're new to the Ace Attorney franchise, don't start here!  Go play the first trilogy.  Despite this being kiiiiiiiiiind of a prequel (from many generations before AA's generation), the original games I think have better story telling and pacing, which goes a long way toward getting new players into the franchise.

If you've played all the other AA games before - why are you reading reviews, you (just like me) prob would just play this on principal LOL

--
The main problem is that I find the first game to be PARTICULARLY slow.  Slow to the point that I start to get sleepy every time I try to sit down and play.  *sigh*  There was a lot of issues with the first game - from uninteresting story to mediocre plot twists/reveals to just altogether uninterestingly presented characters - I really had a lot of trouble with the first game.  

I found out via others that the game 2 is really good, that game 1 is just bridging toward game 2, so i plodded on.  I will say that game 2 IS better than game 1 - not the least of which is that the overarching plot finally came out in the last couple of cases.  So yay!  But unfortunately due to just how...meh the lead up to it, even the grand reveal didn't do much for me as I had hoped.  The grand reveal was good - just not ""omg holy shiznit wow!!!"" like the last case of the original trilogy.

There are some very specific things that I really disliked about GAA:

- the jury system is really bad.  I get what they were trying to do, but the problem is that for majority of the cases that featured jurors, they ended up just interjecting with a lot of inane dialog that felt more frustrating and annoying than add to the cases.  Same with the process to turn juror's minds around - only once or twice did that reveal new information - most of the time it was like a hard-stop on the flow of truth being revealed during the case.  I was REALLY thankful that the last two cases they got rid of the jurors.  Surely even the devs realize how useless that mechanic is.

- Holmes' deduction are such a waste of time.  The main problem is that the deduction process takes a REALLY long time because he have a lot to say, and only a few points where the players can change the narrative.  And because he does it once (wrongly) and then we have to listen to it AGAIN for the fix...such a waste of time!  

- In fact Holmes himself is...just overall kind of annoying...?  .__.  Some of the characters i start to like more toward the end (like Barok van Zieks) but Holmes was one of the chara that I was okay with but find mostly annoying all the way through.  I just...yeah okay he obviously had plot-related actions, but as a whole just felt so pointless.  

- Just as a whole I find the characters in this game to be just not as likeable.  Took a VERY long time for me to come around to Naruhodo himself, Holmes was overall more of an annoying distraction, and van Zieks first game was really extra irritating.  I know the prosecutors typically start out as irritating, but somehow van Zieks' arguments sounded particularly inane.  Iris made no impact on me, Gina and Tobias all just kinda whooshed over my head, to the point that even a certain event toward end of the game didn't make me even blink even tho that character is...well you know.  Funnily enough Susato ended up being one of the few characters I liked - but a lot of it has to do with her mincing words less.  There is less inanity coming out of her, compared to all the other characters.

- the mystery was also really meh.  As said before, most of the standalone cases were really rather boring.  Second game's standalone cases were a little more interesting - or at least more than half of the cases i didn't fall asleep on anyway.  However although the last two cases were good, the tie-in's with the previous cases were a LOT lower than i expected.  Some of the stuff that supposedly were meant to be lead-up for the end of the game, when they revealed it at the end, I was like ""...wait that's it?""  ALSO some of the plot twists/reveals aren't a mystery at all, I legit was like ""well duh it's this character.""  When you have two games that existed only to support the last two cases, i really expected it to be a lot better...

I will say that the last hour of the last case was pretty good.  That was around when all the truths are revealed and i really enjoyed it.  but I gotta say...last hour being the only highlight of a 90 hr game is a little... (that said, those 90 hrs aren't all game time, I keep starting it up, get sleepy after 10 min, and then leave the game running while i go do other stuff to try to wake up, and then come back for another 10 min...)  Because of this inability to sit through the game, I just checked, I think it took an entire year for me to actually finish...I started in Feb 2022, and I didn't finish til March 2023.  *cough*

In this game's defense, I will say that this is the first time I played a AA game on pc instead of a handheld of some kind.  Perhaps not getting to lie in bed while playing affected my enjoyment...?  Welp, time to play the original AA trilogy a 3rd time, this time on PC, and see if I feel differently!

edit: welp, just finished the original AA trilogy on PC - and I can say right now that it's got nothing to do with playing PC versus playing on handheld in bed.  Original Phoenix Wright trilogy was AMAZING as I remembered, and each game took around 20 hours (a total of 54hrs ish for the entire trilogy) and the last case BLEW MY MIND ALL OVER AGAIN.  So yeah...if you're a new player and reading this review, go buy the Ace Attorney/Phoenix Wright trilogy and play that instead!",1678581395,1708330679,False,13,0,0.562645018100738525,0,True,False,False

Case G1-1: Actually pretty good case even for a tutorial. Funny or interesting characters, doesn't feel like a tutorial even though it is.

Case G1-2:  Antithesis of previous case. A boring slog that shits on good characters, pulls evidence out of its ass, and introduces an obnoxious self-centered moron who's only funny for the first 5 minutes. No trial either. Feels shoehorned in for the sake of tutorial.

Case G1-3: Who tf said this game doesn't get good until case 5? Pretty good case, subverts what you expect from the franchise, plus I like the new mechanic and the prosecutor.

Case G1-4: Decent case with an otherwise incredibly stupid resolution. Some lines of reasoning could have been cut out to make the trial shorter. I can now see how some ppl might still find the game boring.

Case G1-5: ACTUALLY GOATED CASE WTF. Better than any single case from the original Ace Attorney trilogy imo. Only complaint is that it drags on a while towards the end.

Part 2: 8/10

Case G2-1: Not as good as the last tutorial case, but still alright. I found one character incredibly obnoxious but he won't be returning so that's a relief.

Case G2-2: Amazing case. Redeems characters from case G1-3. Again some parts are unnecessary but overall great.

Case G2-3: Pretty good, thought not as good as the last case, if a little long. The end of the case is the best part, because it redeems G1-2, the worst case from Part 1.

Case G2-4: Not bad. This one is kind of like a half-chapter with more investigation than trial and a small part at the end that was very much filler, so it got boring after a while, but not bad. It's got some pretty good twists that are setting up a HUGE reveal.

Case G2-5 HOLY SHET CRAZY GOOD CASE... except for one piece of gigantic asspull at the end. BUT there also a self-deprecating meta reference, love that. [spoiler]Unless you were thinking of summoning a ghost to the stand? [/spoiler]

I have played through Phoenix Wright collection, and compared to that, this one fixes a bunch of things that bothered me ([spoiler]all of the spiritual aspect of it[/spoiler], lack of things that can happen in a court), adds a couple of cute mechanics to spice up the gameplay. Even though they still are pretty simple, I did enjoy them when they popped up.

These games are a bit more grounded, the cast has lost some of it's craziness, which I did miss, but as a benefit - there's a much larger set of characters that can't be summed up in 1 sentence and have actual depth, so this might be seen as a plus or a minus, depending on what you prefer.

It's important to note that with similar playthrough time to the Phoenix wright trilogy, this game has 10-ish cases, whereas the original trilogy had 14 (if you count tutorial ones). This means two things:
1. Mysteries are more developed and not as obvious. I enjoyed discovering what really happened much more than before.
2. Sometimes, the plot really drags on and stops moving. If you plan to binge all of it, lots of information dumps will be repeated again and again - this was present in previous titles also, but here I think there's more of it, because clues within the case get repeated together with overarching plot points again and again. Because of that, the game really benefits from making significant breaks in between cases, 
otherwise you might feel exhausted at the end, as I did.

Other things that I think would really improve the experience - but I'm sure there's good reason they aren't there:
1. More voice acting!
2. More animated segments! I think there were none in the second game, and it was a bummer

Also huge kudos to the addition of the autoplay, I hope it's also in the Apollo Justice port.

To sum up, I do think this is an improvement over Phoenix Wright trilogy, and worth playing if you liked it, or if you are a newcomer and this would be the first game.",1706973974,1706974551,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game directly confronts issues prevalent in the Victorian Era setting which are just as important to consider in today's society. Each of the characters was fun and memorable with my personal favorites being the great detective Herlock Sholmes for his jovial personality and Barok van Zieks for his stoic demeanor. The story takes several twists on the normal AA formula making it more grounded in some ways than the other installments in the AA series while also capitalizing on the mystery element synonymous with the Victorian Era. My main qualm with the general story is that I wasn't too keen on where Case 2-2 was placed in the story's sequence not just because it felt out of place but because the particular story seemed more prolonged than it needed to be to complete the narrative. Disregarding my grievances, the climax in each plot was nothing short of fantastic. The pursuit theme was only used for the few most epic turnabouts that the player arrives at in the story and I think for that reason it's genuinely my favorite pursuit theme out of all the other AA games. I thoroughly enjoyed playing the Chronicles of the Great Ace Attorney for it is easily the best AA game in the entire series.",1706581867,1706581867,True,5,0,0.569379508495330811,0,True,False,False

So i have just finished The first of the two games in the chronicle, 50 hours played id say its already money well spent! (I believe i bought on sale for  12-13 GBP)
An introduction to the mechanics is necessary for new players and is definitely a must have in the first episode of the game (it has 5 episodes in the first game), having played Phoenix Wright: ace attorney i found it slightly hand-holdy but for new players to the ace attorney games this won't even notice this as the mechanics and gameplay are unique to most other games. Besides the first episode is by far the shortest and mainly sets up the narrative for the rest of the game whilst still being a compelling story in and of itself.

After this 'tutorial episode' The game truly spreads its proverbial wings, In terms of difficulty and Rich and captivating story, Similar to reading a book you simply cant put down you find yourself compelled to continue the investigations and trials in order to satisfy your thirst for the next story beat. 100% of the time its worth it! Great story and unique diverse characters you, don't immediately, learn to love.

Gameplay:
Unique to the series, however Quite basic

Although the gameplay is basic, Point and click adventure- esque meaning examine rooms and catalogued evidence for clues or questioning witnesses, thats all the gameplay has to be! The real satisfaction is using all this information and putting pieces together in your head of how events went down or at least how it could possibly have went down. and uncovering the story which you undoubtedly get invested in (at least i did).

Story:
The game's greatest asset!

The story is linear, whilst this does hold some problems ill list at the bottom in the good/bad points , Meaning no matter what you do the story will play out the same.. This may sound like a negative point but on the contrary. I love Choices matter, Tell-tale like games such as 'the walking dead 'or a 'wolf among us' these stories are great but not as quite as refined as they can be. This is where linear storytelling shines, the writes only have to focus on one storyline and because of that.. the twists and turns are more fleshed out and also the ways in which the twists are revealed are more satisfying as they're usually down to a discrepancy in evidence or witness testimony that you yourself have pointed out. Even though its linear and progresses only if you present the right argument and evidence once you are immersed in the story and acting as a lawyer/detective you truly believe that your choices matter... even though they dont.

Difficulty:
Not Difficult but still a fun amount of puzzle solving.
 now personally i did not find the game hard per say and believe i only failed one trial throughout the remaining episodes(upon which you can simply retry from a similar position in the trial or from the beginning of the trial).
Throughout a trial you have 5 lives, giving the wrong evidence for your current theory will result in a life lost, once no lives are left you must restart the trial which is definitively more of a nuisance than it is necessarily difficult as most of the time you just have to re-watch a few boxes of dialogue before you try amend your mistake.
This all sounds like a hassle but if you follow the dialogue and examine evidence thoroughly it actually ends up being the perfect level of difficulty, assuming you don't get stuck and present every piece of evidence one by one in hopes of striking lucky.

Good:
- Great stories and characters all intertwined with one another
- satisfying payoffs for solves in the form of story progress
- very relaxing game for when BR's or Competitive games are too much
- 50 Hours of story and im only halfway through! Cheaper than a book and its interactive, No brainer!
- Addictive! i think these 50h playtime are only over the course of a week!
Bad:
-Although i love the stylized graphics i cant exactly say they're groundbreaking.
-Somewhat slow start
-A game probably not everyone would enjoy however for those who are interested in detective stories its actually a great find.
- Failure in a trial isn't actually detrimental.. just downright annoying.
- No Japanese voice acting for majority of text (not sure if English is fully voice acted.)

Outro:

Whilst i realise this game may not be for everyone i implore you if you are even somewhat curious or have the slightest appeal... Try it! underneath its basic aesthetics is a surprisingly satisfying gameloop and story.  Especially on sale!

You don't need to have played any other game in the series to understand the story in these two games, however there are many references for fans of the past Ace Attorney games and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The first game has some poor pacing where some things feel like they drag on far too long, but it is still very enjoyable with it's fantastic characters and entertaining dialogue. However, you do get left on multiple cliffhangers at the end of the first game, which can feel a little awkward on its own. The second game is clearly on a budget, which is easily noticeable because of the lack of animated cutscenes and some obviously reused assets. However in spite of that, the game clearly had a lot of heart and soul put into it, because in my opinion, it still manages to surpass the first game in almost every way. The pacing is better and the cases are overall more interesting, with twists and turns that even the most veteran of Ace Attorney fans might not see coming. Also, all of the mysteries from the first game are finally solved in the second (except for Kazuma's headband, it's nonexistent wind is never explained). The second game has a near perfect conclusion for the two games and their characters, and I believe that it may have even surpassed the highest highs of the original Ace Attorney Trilogy. Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. You will find yourself jamming to multiple different tracks in both games.

In short, if you're a fan of Ace Attorney, or even if you are brand new and interested in the Ace Attorney series, you will be sure to enjoy yourself throughout these two games, even with it's few downsides.",1705353965,1705353965,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The pace is super, super slow. There seems to be a lot of filler dialog with things highlighted that don't actually matter (though the highlighting would indicate otherwise).
The whole thing with the Herlock Sholmes... he's such a tedious character. Overdramatic animations and speech patterns (even for an Ace Attorney game, remember I said I loved the first trilogy). The deductions and corrections system is somewhat reminiscent of the ""testimony / press"" system of old, but WAY more tedious. You have to play out each and every dialog line a second time, with the full overdramatic animations and TONS AND TONS OF FINGER SNAPPING. It's just dreadful. Takes forever to get through, instead of just being able to cycle through the dialog lines quickly to get to the one you want to correct (like pressing on dialog in the original Ace Attorney trilogy).
The third case was the final nail in the coffin for me because they introduced a character who just snaps his fingers as a character trait, on top of the filler dialog just droning on and on.

The only way I could recommend this is: ""if you liked the original Ace Attorney trilogy but wish it was slower paced and even more dramatic, with tons of filler dialog, and you love the sound and animation of finger snaps, this is the duology for you"".",1705350331,1705351006,False,3,1,0.505705595016479492,0,True,False,False

I did notice some issues with the way that the backgrounds were upscaled and translated. There's places in London where untranslated text appears on objects like windows and other small details, (Like the pawnbrokers building) which doesn't make any sense. A lot of the text on signs and similar objects blend together in a very unnatural way, and it makes them look very strange. There's also many spots where flat textures are used for detail and end up with blurred or black outlines around them, which makes it look quite cheap.",1704910485,1705208975,True,1,0,0.516023695468902588,0,True,False,False

While I still believe the Ace Attorney Trilogy is the best way to start with the franchise, Ryunosuke's adventures in London transcend what the trilogy has to offer. This is easily my favourite Ace Attorney game.

No case feels irrelevant, there isn't any filler here, each step you take to unravelling the mysteries of the characters and locations in the game feed into a much larger narrative that spans across two games. The way they feed into each other is excellent, getting you giddy when you solve mysteries set up in the first game 3 cases into the second. It feels good. The game never berates you for making a mistake and always rewards you for figuring out what's going on, like a good point-and-click game should. Investigations are detailed, with each item able to be examined from all sides and plenty of optional banter between Ryunosuke, Susato, Sholmes and Wilson to enjoy, which oftentimes is one of the Ace Attorney series' greatest assets. 

The new features, like the jury and dance of deduction don't feel forced and seek to amplify the gameplay, which was an issue in the past few Ace Attorney games. Gimmicks just felt thrown in for the sake of having one, for the sake of having something to set that particular entry apart from the others. Great Ace Attorney avoids this, by allowing the new mechanics to seamlessly blend in with the rest of the Ace Attorney staples. I'd love to see many of the things this game did return in future entries. Multiple witnesses are back from the Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright game and they're done much better here, having ironed out the fat and constant interruptions into a concise, simple system that rewards players for being astute and diligent. 

The story is excellent, right up there with Trials and Tribulations as one of the best in the series. This game simply ADORES the era it's set in, completely leaning into it's Meiji/Victorian era aesthetic and influence. There are plenty of easter eggs for Sherlock Holmes fans and long time Ace Attorney fans here, all perfectly intertwined with a silly, yet unique style of period peace, showing the corruption of British politics and the industrialising Japan, seeking to claim status as a world power. The game doesn't have any preachy political message, but the politics between the two countries do relate to how characters act in game. The music and art are equally as phenomenal, the score in particular, which completely transcends any expectations I had for this game. It is amazing, plain and simple, and remains one of my favourite scores from any video game, ever.

Since this is technically a ""rerelease collection"", Great Ace Attorney Chronicles has a bunch of bonus content to sink your teeth into. A sound test, plenty of concept art from the original 3DS release, tons of videos, including some formerly Japanese only releases of Ryunosuke vs his great-grandson, Phoenix Wright in a court case. There are also some cute bonus costumes for Ryunosuke, Susato and Herlock, however, they're only available in the 2nd game in this collection, which is a little bit of a bummer.

Plain and simple, this is one of the best point-and-click/visual novels ever created and an excellent experience for Ace Attorney fans or newbies to the series. I cannot recommend this game enough. If I could give two thumbs up, I would.

You may not get as great puzzles and gameplay as like, Ghost Trick, JFA, or T&T. But they're still there and it's still really fun. I'm saying I didn't struggle much with this game, but I did struggle a few times, and it was fun during all of it. 

Story is amazing too. Don't wanna say much. If you're not into period pieces, then I guess avoid it. But I think the story could win anyone over.

Localization is great. I regret not playing this sooner, but also I think I played this at just the right time in my life. I was waiting on the Scarlet Study mod that swapped the character names. But I decided to just... accept that the names won't be the same transliterated ones in Scarlet Study. Is the official localization better than Scarlet Study's? I wouldn't judge it like that. They both have merits. Official has such an amazing period appropriate lexicon (it's good to open wikitionary and write any words you don't understand). Scarlet Study is a bit simpler and easier for an ESL to read. Both convey meaning and emotions efficiently. Regardless, I'm recommending the Steam version here, and since the Scarlet Study script isn't available for the steam release as of now, I recommend this official version for you.

First off, I’m still on the first game. The pacing is INCREDIBLY SLOW. I purchased this game back in March of 2022, excited to try a new Ace Attorney game. And I still haven’t completed it. Before purchasing, I did read the reviews, which all mentioned in some way or the other how slow the game’s pacing was. BOY WAS I STUPID TO THINK THEY WERE EXAGGERATING. So, speaking of the pacing, like everyone has said on here, all of the characters including the main character himself, act clueless beyond belief. There are just so many obvious points when examining things and they for whatever reason act shocked beyond repair when uncovering something new. Not only this, but pretty much all sentences of dialogue are extended unnecessarily, even though there is clearly a way to shorten it so that players aren’t steadily losing interest as they read. I don’t think I need to provide examples because I’ve seen a few on the reviews here. I’m actually stunned by how much of the dialogue in this game opts to stretch out for seemingly as long as possible before getting to the point, it’s baffling and totally starts to bore me and clearly others on here too. 

Another thing: the Dance of Deduction featuring Herlock Sholmes is a cute and charming little addition. Seeing Ryunosuke and Sholmes working together to make those correct deductions is really cool and satisfying. However! One thing that I’ve noticed with this feature is that it is childishly easy. All you really have to do is look closely at certain objects or people for clues, examine that newly found clue, and then present it. These clues are hidden but extremely easy to find which made me feel like a little kid playing this game. Whenever Ryunosuke and Susato are glossing over certain objects, there might be a new clue sitting on one of the objects, and they go on to comment whatever they need to comment on the object before vwalla! A long pause and one of them goes “hmm, wait! There’s something here!” “Oh my! Mr. Naruhodo you’re right!” Or something to that effect. It’s just not really worth the dramatic reactions these two give when new clues are discovered during this process. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a new and refreshing concept, but I wish it had been more challenging. 


Yet another thing: when first playing through this game, you are not allowed to skip through dialogue with a right click of your mouse or however else you usually skip dialogue in Ace Attorney. The game, like many others have agreeably mentioned, forces you to follow its slow and prolonged pace. The only thing you can really do is turn on the auto-play option so that when characters are talking amongst themselves you don’t have to press a thing, but it’ll still play out slowly. Oh, and speaking of playing out slowly, the animations that play while dialogue is being displayed can be ridiculously slow. Like, it adds to the slowness of the game it’s actually frustrating. Ahem, take for example van Zieks. Boy were his animations during trials so prolonged and slow! You can’t skip animations either, so it truly adds to the snail pace of the game.

Oh look, another thing: The amount of times a scene has played out in which three or more characters take turns sharing the “……..” dialogue is insane. Like my goodness I know it’s a moment of silence or uncertainty but it just feels SO UNNECESSARY. And I know there’s more to come!

I want to also say that it hurts me to make a review like this on an Ace Attorney game, but this is something that has blown my mind with how slow and nearly uninteresting most of the first game has been so far. I’ve really been trying to be patient with this game, but I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not patient enough! Yes, I will finish this game for completion’s sake, and because I want to know what happens, but yikes will that take me a good 15-20 more hours! 

The interaction between Ryunosuke and Susato is quite bland and uninteresting. This makes investigations even more punishing and boring for me. The way they comment on everything just isn’t as interesting, entertaining, or engaging like the way Phoenix and Maya or even Phoenix and Pearls interacted. Even Edgeworth and Kay were interesting together and made investigations much more fun. There’s almost no personality in these two when they talk to each other. I don’t know a better way to word it. It’s just not fun.

The soundtracks are nothing memorable, in my opinion. I don’t mean this in a rude way, but my gosh is the music so dull! It honestly blends in too much with the background while playing the game. I mean, take a look at the Ace Attorney Trilogy. I LOVE the fact that so many characters had their own music! Like for example, “Happy People” would play with cheery characters like Lotta Hart and Desirée DeLite. Or when the music would change depending on whatever was happening in the game, the mood, and even wherever you went! This game doesn’t do that, making the music very bland in comparison. And the overall audio for the game is so low it’s not even funny. I turn my gaming laptop all the way up to 100 and it sounds extremely weak. I even went to settings in game to turn up the music to max volume. Everything from sound effects to music sounds so soft and muffled. Not loud or crisp and clear. It honestly sounded like I was playing a game on my 3DS, but even quieter than that! Here’s to hoping the new Apollo Justice game isn’t going to be that quiet!

All in all, these are my frustrations and thoughts on the game. Was it worth the $40? Not for me it wasn’t. I’m not saying it was horrible, but it did disappoint me more than I’d like to say. The animation is great, most characters aren’t very memorable aside from Ryunosuke, Susato, and Sholmes. I’m really pushing myself to be patient with this game. I want to see it through to the end! But, it’s still painful to play through because of the pace, and honestly it feels like even Ryunosuke and Susato themselves don’t have much personality. But maybe I’m saying that too early. I just don’t feel that powerful duo spark I felt with Phoenix and Maya. All I can say is, I would not recommend this game to someone who is new to the AA series and wants to get into it. Go to the AA Trilogy for that. It’s such a gift. However! If you are someone who has played the trilogy and possibly all the other games, and you are looking for more, then maybe you won’t mind giving this a shot! I don’t know. I’ve played AA up until Dual Destinies and nothing past that. I was seeking something different and found this game. It didn’t really blow my mind the way the trilogy did. But, I am grateful for it regardless. Just wish I’d waited for a sale before buying :)

Personally, I think the atmosphere and language used in it are better than The Great Chronicles. Because I'm not from a country with language support, I think it's better for the witnesses to speak English clearly rather than using mixed words to make the atmosphere funny. I don't like this. It takes away the tension. I think if you want a more fun atmosphere, it's better to have some jokes between the lawyer and the prosecutor, which would be better than like the old series.

Characters designs are not as memorable, and poses more forgettable.
The puzzles are infuriatingly easy and/or uninspired, to the point that the steamboat mystery is literally just a Sherlock Holmes locked room mystery, with only minor details changed. I did not know about this mystery prior to playing the game, but since the game itself mentions by name the actual mystery it is just straight up ripping for its own use, I feel like that must be held against it.
You can usually see the conclusion coming from a mile away and there are no big turnabout moments, which is a cardinal error for an Ace Attorney game.

I personally find Herlock Sholmes to be an unsufferable character, seeing as he is portrayed here as incompetent and full of himself, essentially not deserving his reputation and relying on unnamed third parties to correct his mistakes. He does cause a lot of innocents to go through numerous ordeals and sees no consequences for his actions, which I dislike.
Mechanically, you have to suffer through his entire deductions first, and then go through them again to course correct. This is not enjoyable.

Another frustrating thing this game does is the ""This element is the Solution of the Puzzle, but only becomes a Valid Answer after you Inspect it once"", which was always terrible when the mainline games did it, and is even worse here since, I said before, the puzzles are REALLY easy. So you want to speed through it because you understand the mechanics, and the game knocks you over the head, because it presumes you are presenting at random. The way they use spatial clues (in that you have to rotate the camera to find additional information) feels extremely lazy to me. From previous titles, I am used to having to combine a relatively small or obscure detail obtained by interacting with evidence (combining pieces, etc.) with a statement, but here it is more in the spirit of ""Flip the camera view 180° and what you need to pick up on is a massive visual element distinct from all the rest that takes up a tenth of the screen"". There is no subtelty or attempts to lead you in the wrong direction, it is just always immediately in-your-face, glaringly obvious, uninvolving.

There is a lot of stating the obvious in this game, which arguably is always a part of Ace Attorney games, but I would argue that it is all in the balance of it. In other titles, it helps because when the game throws a curveball, suddenly it is very useful to know exactly what you can take for a fact and where the rug is being pulled from. Here, you do not find that level of complexity, so it just feels padded and it removes even more of the already low stakes. It adds to the unnatural of the dialogue.

Due to the game not having much of the spark of other titles, what is left is a lot of padding. While there are some moments where it threatens to pick up some steam - let us not pretend it does not have its moments or characters - it just does not feel like it has enough life into it. You experience will be: genuinely well done sequences, scenes or character moments in-between long and dull segments where not much of any interest is discussed, while uninspired character designs move about on screen, and the game occasionally whacks you for daring to try to move along too fast. Because you Inspect first, and Present second, even though Inspecting adds nothing more that could not already be seen.

And I am sorry but -spoilers for the second case- 
a best friend that dies by cracking his head open on a bedframe as he slips on a floor stain because of a cat he couldn't see or feel in his legs is, realistic and unfortunate, yes, but also from a meta point of view a really retarded plotpoint and you cannot build a meaningful character arc for his friends out of this because his death is meaningless. It was an accident, you removed one of the most interesting characters, and you still failed at cashing in on the emotional side of things because he died a ridiculous death. You cannot fuel another person's motivation out of this kind of death since you try to find meaning and strength in the fact the poor chap split his brain matter on the wood floor because he mistep.
There is also a pawnbroker who threatens to blow his brains out with a gun (this is animated) at every minor inconvenience; while I personally relate, I still find it jarring with regards to the tone of the rest of the game.

But as I said, it has its moments; for example there is a joke early on about Ryunosuke's attempts at slamming the defense's desk making a wet slap sound in his greenhorn days, and committing to a firm BANG after a while. Nice touch.

Finally, I think they fudged up the prosecution. The main prosecutor/antagonist does not have that Oomph to him, partly because he is just a vampire Edgeworth with less vivid clothing, and partly because his animations or facial expression feel a little too stiff and slow. He really does not mistreat equipment or appliances enough, and comes up as a static automaton. It does not help that, as stated previously, the puzzles are really simple, so when the prosecution gets flared up, it is about the Defense proving that water can be boiled, which as a reader at best evokes a faint smile if you feel generous.",1704317514,1704317982,False,1,0,0.476933121681213379,0,True,False,False

But if you just want to know if you should buy this or not, then my answer is this: if you're a fan of Ace Attorney, then you definitely should, as I'm sure you'll love it. If you're new to Ace Attorney, I feel like you shouldn't because then you won't be able to appreciate everything that TGAAC does for the franchise, but on the other hand I've seen people that have gotten into the franchise with this one, so it's not like it's the worst entry point for the series either.

I'll start by saying that this, as a duology, is one of the best entries in the series in many ways - visual, story, characters, etc. - however, I would also rather review each game separately, as I do feel that'd be a fairer approach to each of them. I'll also try avoiding spoilers, but do read at your own risk if you haven't finished the game.

For starters, Adventures was by far my favorite of the two. Of very particular note is the fact that, either for better or worse (personally, for better), Adventures was bold enough to actively break many established molds of the franchise. While I understand that the cases being composed only of one-day investigation and one-day trial could be detrimental, I feel like writing the trials with this format in mind really helped the pacing of the game greatly. And, in fact, I also like the fact that there's an entire 'case' that doesn't even have a trial section at all! As I said, a break from the mold. The pacing is good enough that I do feel like no case overstayed its welcome, and the finale of case 5 really makes you feel like you earned hearing the ""Great Pursuit"" at last.

Resolve, on the other hand, for better or worse (personally, for worse), goes back to the series's roots in more than one way, and while I understand that the budget for Resolve was significantly lower than Adventures, sadly I will formulate my next points without that fact in mind. For starters, we're back to every case having a trial section, which makes sense - that's what people play Ace Attorney for - and definitely not something I raise an objection to, however... every single case is forced into the formula of two days of investigation and two days of trial. For better or worse, this means that some cases either drag on for unnecessarily long (case 2) or are simply too short for their own good (case 3), which really helps to killing the pacing of the game. On the topic of the pacing, rumors circulate around that the Great Ace Attorney was meant to be a trilogy, and in fact some people have said that's not true, it was always meant to be a duology - and at first even just a single game - but that'll make my next point even worse for the game: the pacing of the ""grand overarching mystery"" (trying to avoid spoilers but you know what I'm talking about if you played it already) is totally butchered by the simple fact it gets introduced late into case 3 and by early into case 5 you've already resolved it, not to mention how short case 4 already is by itself. And case 5... well, stop reading from now if you don't want to risk spoilers, but... I totally hated case 5's conclusion. The main villain basically just blatantly and shamelessly confesses to everything as soon as Ryunosuke vaguely hints at him being a villain, and that really sucks because it makes 'defeating him' feel rather shallow, especially with one of the best breakdowns and tracks (Resolve 2017) being wasted on Sholmes's 'checkmate strategy' sequence.

In short, I prefer Adventures over Resolve because it has a much better pacing compared to its sequel, Resolve, but they both come in the same package regardless and both games are already good anyways, so this duology is definitely worth playing for avid Ace Attorney fans.",1700713795,1702948567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is largely set in Great Britain at the turn of the century and features Herlock Sholmes - the name changed from Sherlock Holmes to avoid copyright infringement but actually a better name anyway as it fits the character. 

While I like the other Ace Attorney games, the humour in this pair is my favourite of all of them. Herlock Sholmes in particular is a great character - both a brilliant detective, but also a bumbling wally. He is arrogant and silly, and the ""deductions"" game play which are new to the series work perfectly with him. He starts out making a bizarrely but often hilariously wrong set of deductions and the player then has to ""course correct"" him. They're easy but entertaining and really mix up the Ace Attorney game play keeping it fresh and the gameplay more varied.

The setting is also great. I'm British and the bizarre slightly steam punk, fantastical version of Victorian Britain is highly entertaining. The characters all have bizarre totally unbritish names, and are all created as rediculous sterotypes and colourful characters which make the game fun and engaging.

The graphics and gameplay are massively overhauled from the first trilogy on Steam, reflecting them being much more recently made. The graphics are much better quality, with 3D models of the characters and spaces, the music is better quality and a delight to listen to, and there is more variety in the characters and settings with less reusing of assets (which makes sense as the first games were made for the less powerful Nintendo DS 20 years ago, while these games were made for the more powerful 3DS 5 years ago). The gameplay is more varied even in the basic areas from the series  like examining and interacting with objects and spaces in 3D, and  the courtroom scenes (including a new Jury mechanic).

Overall this is a big improvement on the original trilogy, and also a great fun pair of games in a unique and fun setting. I'm looking forward to the 2nd trilogy of Phoenix Wright games too; the first game in that trilogy is older (Apollo Justice) but the 2nd two games were made around the same time as this pair of games. I can definitely recommend the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles to Ace Attorney fans but also to anyone who wants to try the series for the first time. 

You'll definitely get a feel for the game in the first 1-2 hours prior to the refund window in case you don't like it. Although a warning, the first courtroom scene in the first part of the game can be a bit frustrating if you know the series well as you're held back while the game ""teaches"" you how to play. This is a common theme across the series, so don't let that put you off if you like the humour and characters despite that furstration at the beginning.

Buuuuut.. the actual story and writing is so much worse than Phoenix Wright. I stopped playing during the first court case of the second game and I played a lot of Phoenix Wright as a kid and I'm replaying it right now to see if it actually holds up and I'm not misremembering. I can say for sure, I'm not.

The logic puzzles for this game is better, there's less garbage logic and interact with catfish and fisherman's boot solutions compared to Phoenx Wright but the writing makes this a drudge. Especially not for how long the stretch of a court case is in comparison to Phoenix Wright. Not only is each case shorter in Phoenix Wright, it's split into court:investigation:court:investigation:court rather than Chronicle's investigation:court. 

The reason why the cases are so long and the writing is such a drudge is how many times the game repeats the same information over. and over. and over. and beats you on the head with the hint for the solution that it gets infuriating. I don't feel smart, I just feel like I've been talked down to for ages. There is a skip dialogue option but it's turned off by default and that solution is an awful fix since you will then potentially miss actually important dialogue. 

I'd take the sometimes bullshit Phoenix Wright solutions over Chronicle's bad writing any day but it's a YMMV type deal.",1702534441,1702534441,False,2,0,0.491262167692184448,0,True,False,False

So let me just give the short condensed version and then add on whatever extra stuff I wanna say.

Great story with compelling mysteries, good characters and dialogue, excellent art, involves using your brain a lot and being attentive to small details, and it's fun regardless of whether you take it seriously or laugh at some of the ridiculousness. Now to move on to the stuff unique to this game that I want to say.

Having these two games bundled together just makes so much sense. They kinda end up feeling like one long game rather than two separate games because you kinda need to play both, both to understand everything and to get the proper closure on everything. This game is especially long compared to other entries in the franchise, and whilst I don't think it ever felt drawn-out because there were a lot more mechanics at play, some people may find it tiring (though I personally usually didn't). I think the extra visual fidelity compared to the other ace attorney games is taken advantage of a lot to help put the scenes into perspective better.

Overall, it's an ace attorney game that does something different but keeps the same basic principle, and improves on the formula in smaller ways that add up, 9/10.",1702355248,1702355248,True,0,0,0.49328342080116272,0,True,False,False

As a person that has played every single game in the series before this, I'm surprised to say this is easily and arguably the best game in the entire franchise. Yes, even better than the juggernauts like AA1, T&T and AAI2, but that's a discussion for another time ig. 

Seriously though, there is not a single wasted moment, character, or set-piece in this gut-wrenching and amazingly written story. The music, the back and forth sequences between Naruhodo and Barok, the development of its incredibly varied and GOATed cast (shoutouts to my boy Herlock Shlomes)—everything just screams out peak I fear. TGAA's writing was very cohesive the entire way through and there was no point where any of it felt like filler, which is something that the PW/AJ trilogies struggled with. The only thing is the story can feel like a bit of a slow burn. Things take a while to get going with the first two cases, but boy once the momentum starts around third case you're in for a wild ride that will not stop until you reach the very end. 

I rarely write reviews for even most games that I like, but this one left such a mark on me that I'm unable to not gush about it. If you're a fan of the series this game is a must, and you are right doing yourself a disservice to gloss over this entry.

I've played all mainline Ace Attorney games (except the AA6 which I will play when it releases on PC in January 2024) and the Layton crossover so I would consider myself as a fan of the franchise. The Great Ace Attorney is not a mainline entry into the Ace Attorney and should be perceived as a spin-off to the franchise, even though the game is directed by Shu Takumi, the creator of the franchise as a whole, who approached this spin-off in a more liberal way, meaning bigger changes to the franchise’s core mechanics. 
The game consists of 10 chapters varying in length and after finishing the third I was already completely sold on it being the best Ace Attorney game I’ve ever played. 
One thing I always disliked about original Ace Attorney games is the lack of an overarching story, something which the Layton crossover introduced, and one that complemented the concept of Ace Attorney brilliantly making each case feel more important and meaningful. So, I was delighted that this over 70 hours long game wasn’t just cases tied loosely together, but consisting of one overarching story that unfolds over the course of the game. 
The investigation parts were the weakest parts of each Ace Attorney game. This is also true for The Great Ace Attorney, although the investigations that happen latter in the timeline were enjoyable, the introduction of “Sholmes’s Logic and Reasoning Spectacular” really helped the otherwise slower and blander parts of the game by involving you in the gameplay in a really fun way.
The trials also profit greatly by the creative liberty made possible by this not being a mainline Ace Attorney game. The reintroduction of multiple-witness testimony first introduced in the Layton crossover was a great addition and while the summation examination seem a bit forced at times, I really liked how they played into the course of the trial.
The Great Ace Attorney is a great entry to the franchise, one that everyone who even remotely enjoyed one of the more popular Phoenix Wright games should definitely give a shot, you will not regret it for one bit.",1701538943,1701740879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to just give in to the brainrot and write a huge, incomprehensible essay, but I'll try to actually formulate something actually useful.[/h2]

In VERY short, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a duology about a rookie Japanese defense attorney traveling to Britain and.. well, doing some attorney-ing. It is a murder mystery visual novel, so be prepared for A LOT of reading and a lot of thinking. You meet wacky characters, solve intricately crafted mysteries, and accidentally uncover government secrets. Fun!! The game also features some extra side content for those who want it, like silly short sidestories, some behind the scenes stuff (like concept art and unused tracks), and some extra voicelines from the characters in both Japanese and English! 

[b]I want to give two disclaimers right away.[/b] First, I don't think I can recommend this to someone as their very first Ace Attorney game. If you're thinking of getting into this franchise, I heavily encourage you to check out the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney trilogy out first. Mainly because.. these two games are basically the culmination of every single Ace Attorney game combined. The first games are masterfully made and still stand the test of time, but this duology takes everything from the previous games and elevates those aspects to their peak. I'm worried that if someone plays TGAA before the first two trilogies, they'll end up being disappointed. I'm not putting down the previous games, as they're genius in their own.... wright (haaaaaha), but because TGAA has some elements that the original games don't (be it in the gameplay or the narative), it could end up feeling like those aspects are missing from the older games. But really you should play the previous games anyway lol.

Second, this is a VERY long game with a VERY convoluted story. If you're not invested from the get-go, it can get hard to push through. I love the AA franchise and am used to it's antics, but even I struggled a little bit to get through the first case, purely because of it's length. It makes total sense in retrospect, because the case has to introduce all the standard AA gameplay features, brand new gameplay features unique to this duology, the case itself, the characters, and also some seemingly insignificant things that'll reveal themselves in due time. Again, it makes sense for the first trial to be the way it is, but this can be enough to deter someone from playing it so I wanted to say it. Though it's important to mention that there is a ""story mode"" toggle in the game!! So if you're getting fatigued from one thing or another and want to get to the damn point already, that option exists.

[h3]Now, some more in-depth commentary about some core aspects of this game :D[/h3]

[b]Story[/b]
The main focus of this entire game is it's story. Both the stories told in each chapter, and the grandiose overarching story looming over everything. This game is best played knowing as little as possible about it beforehand. Deception, learning to love again, finding your true calling, finding yourself, and found family are core themes and they are handled masterfully. The story is mostly driven by it's incredibly compelling characters who effortlessly carry the equally goofy and serious tone. It's genuinely amazing how well the game handles it's tone. From silly moments and characters (like one of the main characters pretending to be a wax figure and a guy called ""Lay .D Furts""), to devastating revelations about a case and the tragedy of the main prosecutor's character. It's a staple of the AA franchise, and it's expertly done here as well. Even the one-off side characters are handled with care and have noticeable depth to them, which makes the world so much more immersive (Enoch Drebber my beloved). Some are naturally better written than others, but all of them still have a notable baseline of quality. But again, the story is LONG. The overarching story stretches both games - a total of 10 cases - which are pretty convoluted on it's own. But holy shit is it worth it. I spent 90 hours on it and I am probably going to replay it again soon to try and find everything there is to find in this game, and also to experience this incredible narrative all over again.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Being a visual novel, the main gameplay mechanic is pressing a button to go to the next textbox. Still, TGAA has a surprising amount of features for a visual novel. The game is split in two sections: ""investigations"" and ""trials"". During the investigations, you engage in conversations, inspect your environments, and generally gather all sorts of information. Either as evidence for a case, or for fun character interactions and worldbuilding. There is also an additional sub-section in this section, in the form of something called ""The Dance Of Deduction"". These are short segments where you have course correct some deductions made by one of your companion characters. You listen to the deduction this character made, after which you have to rotate your camera around the given 3D environment, find the correct clue, and give the correct answers. Personally, I REALLY did not expect a game mechanic like this, but I am so so happy it's there. These might be my favorite gameplay sections, actually (circus lions, eating soap and gravity bombs lol). Not only is it incredibly fun and engaging to play through, these sections also serve as a very welcome break from the typical loop that follows an investigative section, which is usually just ""Talk to this guy - go here - talk to that guy - show them this thing - go there"". During trials, you do your best to defend your client in court by cross-examining witnesses, carefully inspecting your evidence, and piecing the truth together - no matter the cost. This is where you'll have to piece everything together, and where you'll be yelling out your beloved OBJECTION!'s and HOLD IT!'s while facing off formidable prosecutors who always seem to be a step ahead of you. Outside the box thinking is not only encouraged, but required, with all these wacky things happening and corpses appearing where they shouldn't be ( ;) ). By far the largest chunk of this section will be taken up by the aforementioned cross-examinations. During these, witnesses will take the stand and testify about the case at hand. You can either press them on a certain statement to obtain more information, pursue (if more than one witness are on the stand) one witness if a certain statement from the other seemingly made them remember something, or raise an objection if you found an inconsistency between their words and the court record. And guess what, this section also has a brand new sub-section!! Called the ""summation examination"". Aside from the defense, prosecution, and the judge, there are also six ""randomly"" selected members of the public making up the jury. Independently from the judge, they can choose to announce their leanings on the case. If all the members of the jury are in agreement with one another, the judge can announce their verdict right then and there. During the summation examination, you get to ask the jury on what grounds they decided their leanings, and can try to change their minds. This is done by either finding a contradiction to their statements in your court record, or by finding two contradicting statements among the jurors themselves. Just like the Dance Of Deduction, this serves to break up the usual gameplay loop of the trial, and also to play one of the most banging fucking songs in the entire OST. Outside these two sections, you almost always have the option to go through the stuff you got in your court record - like evidence and character profiles - and your options menu.

I'd say more but apparently there's a character limit? No mentioning the art direction and OST, then. In short,ThisGameIsGood",1701444483,1701444483,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

chills, literal chills

TGAA improved many aspects of its predecessor in terms of graphic and gameplay mechanic, while keeping the same quality in terms of character design and story. however there is one glaring issue of this duology, which is the pacing, while TGAA:Adventures having a rather slow pace which made it kind of a slog to play through, TGAA:Resolve tried to cramp its story only in a few episodes, thankfully it's quite well written that it was still an enjoyable experience.
TGAA meant to be played in simultaneous manner considering its pacing for a better experience.

On a more focused note regarding of the story, as i said above it has a well written story with the somewhat expected twist and turns but it was still thrilling to read. but it mostly shines with the cast, A well written villain, interesting supporting casts, and for the best characters, The great detective investigative partner takes the cake (you have to play it to know which one) and lastly Ryounosuke might be textbook main character but ace attorney MC built different and it was really interesting to see his story.",1701170852,1701172794,True,2,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a prequel spin-off to the Ace Attorney games, with this steam release combining both “Adventures” and “Resolve.” While not the first game to not feature the most well-know character, Phoenix Wright, it is the first time we step away from that time period and instead go back to a time where Japan is getting use to western technology (and culture) England is going through an industrial revolution.

Enter Ryunosuke Naruhodo, whose through events, friends and resolve, becomes an “Ace Attorney” in his own right.

To say that Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a return to form would be a disservice to early games as even the “weakest” titles in the Ace Attorney franchise are still good visual novels in their own right. But this is without a doubt, the best Ace Attorney game since Trials and Tribulations. Now technically this is cheating since this steam release combines “Adventures” and “Resolve.” But the complete package is so great, you might as well consider it one game.

The presentation is amazing. The expressions of characters has been raised to a whole new level and it’s just so much fun to see them; from Ryunosuke’s wild-eyed terror, Susato’s look of disappointment to Gregson’s stress-eating of his seemingly bottomless cup of fish and chips. In or out of the court, important to minor, each character doesn’t just feel like a stand in, but important to the scene, if not the story.

The UI is solid, though it can be a bit jarring If you come to this game from the DS and 3DS and not seeing prompts like “Court Record” and “Present” on the screen, it can take some adjusting to as instead you have to get use to using keyboard (or controller) to press, open evidence screen, present evidence and etc. Also, you can’t get rid of key prompts at the bottom right of the screen, so if you’re hoping to capture some in-game screenshots clean, you’re gonna have to wait for opportunities where it’s not displayed or get a bit creative.

When it comes to the places you visit in Great Ace Attorney Chronicles locations has a postcard-feel to them. The painting-like quality to the locations may not wow players but it doesn’t distract either and is visually interesting enough to not be “just another location” but feel very important and noteworthy.

Adding to the presentation is the music, which is amazing. It’s not as instantly bombastic as past games in the series but has a better build up, with an excellent crescendo and climax feel to it.

When it comes to gameplay, long time veterans of The Ace Attorney franchise will feel right at home, with some added mechanics and some great Quality of Life here, such as saving and resuming from almost any spot (which may encourage save-scumming but also you’re not forced into playing for long stretches just to get to a safe point to save,) pointing out what you’ve searched in investigations, making it handy to keep track of what you already seen, a way to fast-forward the story (though the game doesn’t point this out).

For those who just want to enjoy the story, there is a “reader” mode for those. It could probably being considered a divisive inclusion but the game is at heart a visual novel and there are those who will just enjoy the story of such a visual novel and not worry about gameplay mechanics or wrong choices.

And what a story the Adventures and Resolve bring. It’s a slow going at first but this just makes the stakes feel even more higher as you complete case by case. It gives time for the characters to become more fully fleshed out, to warm up to them (Herlock Sholmes being a great example) and see their evolution, their motives and personalities bloom is a joy to watch alongside Great Ace Attorney Chronicles insane, well-crafted and well executed plot.

Another stroke of genius that Great Ace Attorney Chronicles does is being great at keeping up suspense. This is due to the fact the game won’t instantly let you know you’ve made the right choice at times and will play out scenes that will put your heart in your mouth! (it helps the track usually proceeding it is a banger) as well as using pacing to a masterclass level. And while the Adventures and Resolve do fall on tropes established by the series (and visual novels in general to be fair,) the execution is so well done that even if you predict what’s going to (eventually) happen, you don’t feel cheated. The risk to split the story into two games was a huge gamble but the superb work pays off excellently. And to top it all off is the fact you don’t need to have played any any of the previous games in the Ace Attorney franchise to come is just another feather in its cap.

Is there bad points? Well this being an Ace Attorney entry there is the usual slightly contrived elements to it that the Ace Attorney games like to throw up in climatic cases, the final cases can feel long and Resolve, does suffer from having to recap certain information or mechanics that the player and characters should already be familiar with, as if it expected a few people to start here and If you’re achievement hunting, be aware that some of them, like the series itself, requires a bit of outside the box thinking and are semi-missable (the fact you can replay cases avoids it being permanent and will even tell you where you need to check)

But these are VERY nitpicky issues. The fact that Capcom have released Resolve and Adventures together as one game, at a fantastic price, is a huge blessing. Quite frankly, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a game as great, maybe even better, than Trials and Tribulations and is one that any Visual Novel fan, whether you are hardcore, new to the genre or picky, needs to play. It's simply that damn great.

   [*] Never played visual novels
   [*] Usually feel ""meh"" about point-and-click adventures (at least the few I've played)
   [*] Usually put off by ""anime"" games (I did play Persona 5, really enjoyed it)
[/list]

I really liked:
[list]
   [*] The story was a big surprise! Heartfelt and funny; intriguing mysteries and high-stakes courtroom arguments; intertwining, long-running storylines; and everything gets wrapped up nicely
   [*] Endearing characters: simple but well-drawn; goofy, but the game knows it and does not go overboard with ""anime nonsense""
   [*] Interesting setting: a mix of Victorian England and Meiji Japan; a picture-book version of it, but sometimes tackling ugly topics
   [*] Actually requires thinking: all the facts, evidence, testimonies, and motives are plausible and make sense, if occasionally improbable; it felt good when I put together an argument after actually remembering what was said and what was found
   [*] Just an overall calm, pleasant vibe: the art style, animation, sound effects, and music are all polished and fit together well
[/list]

I had some small problems with it:
[list]
   [*] It's a big time commitment (60 hours for me, or like 6 seasons of TV): it was very engaging throughout, and I'm not sure what can be cut to reduce the runtime; but there were many moments when I was spamming spacebar to get through repeated, somewhat redundant dialogue
   [*] The gameplay is very linear and sometimes feels restrictive: there is only one way the investigations and trials can unfold; the game does not let you walk into a courtroom without acquiring all available clues; there were a few times when I have already figured out the solution but was forced to slowly make my way through the specific steps that the game wanted me to take
   [*] Not fully voice-acted and animated: just a missed opportunity; there were a few nice cutscenes, though
[/list]

+ great music
+ cool character design
+ humor!
+ great overarching story (second game is much stronger in that regard)
+ nice game mechanics
+ Sherlock Holmes! (although not the real one if we are completely honest)
+ long playtime (almost 110 hours in my case)

Cons:
- racism and racist stereotypes (which are not critically reflected by the game!)
- Victorian Great Britain is excessively glorified (it's almost ridiculous)
- the cases of the first game are a little boring and dull
-------------

I generally recommend this game. It is fun to play and it took me about 110 hours of a normal playthrough to get through both games. That's not bad and I am always surprised by how long those Ace Attorney games can get.

Story-wise, the first game is weaker than the second, in my opinion. The cases all seemed a little boring to me and unexciting. The second game is way better, though, and the overarching story is superb! I loved how the cases slowly tie together to reveal a sinister and dark conspiracy - that was fun! Great storytelling!

As someone who wrote his Bachelor's thesis about the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels, I was a bit disappointed by how Sherlock Holmes - or Herlock Sholmes as he is called here - is portrayed. The character in the game is missing some of that serious and stern attitude, I think. But then again, I always respect people taking some creative licence, so it's okay. The humor is great and I love how the games and characters don't really take themselves too seriously. The character design is wonderful as well, just like I am used to with these games.

However, there is one thing that I absolutely don't like about these two games: They are unusually thick with racists stereotypes! Since we play a Japanese protagonist who is spending time in Great Britain of the late 19th century, racist stereotypes are to be expected. However, I really take issue with the fact that the games do not really ever confront racist remarks as something that is reproachable and nothing more than based on flat stereotypes. In a modern game, racism can be shown, sure, but never without critically reflecting on it!! Without giving players an incentive to critically reflect on racist stereotypes portrayed in the game, all it does is just replicate them and further their existence. That is not okay! I mean, those games are played by young people and they always run the risk of believing racists stereotypes and portrayals to be true because they don't know better. This is an absolute no-go! And then there is Victorian Great Britain which is excessively glorified up to a point that's almost ridiculous. Just some food for thought...",1698759241,1698759241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Moving away from legacy affords this prequel series a great deal of freedom, and outside of the general structure of any Ace Attorney game everything is allowed to change - most notably, the narrative. This game tells one, long, overarching story with damn near ever single case being relevant to the wider plot at hand. The very last case is inextricably linked to the very first case, leading to a potent mystery throughout the entire plot. Notice that I said ""game"" here, and not ""games"". This might be a double pack, but for all intents and purposes these are one singular experience. The first title ends of a bit of a cliffhanger, and demands more time from you for a full experience. 

GAAC has really nailed just the fundamentals of what makes any Ace Attorney case good. Not a single case here misses, every one of them is entertaining and engaging on their own merits, in addition to feeding into a wider plot as I mentioned before. Cases are paced impeccably, not booting you out to investigate for too long and thanks to the addition of the deduction dance and a frankly miraculous translation (and character writing), the investigations are no longer the slog they were in previous entries. In the first game, there are no repeated investigation periods at all, with the jury providing the pace breaker that repeated investigations used to provide, which makes me wonder why they went back to multiple investigation periods in the sequel. Once you're in the actual trial itself, it's only ever minutes between new revelations that keeps things interesting and fresh. There's very few instances of the usual ""evidence scramble"" in GAAC trials, where you are desperately trying all of the evidence in the Court Record in an attempt to move on with the game. All of the answers are shown to you plainly, with hints dropped all along the way. Every objection feels justified and makes sense within the world the case has created, making for incredibly satisfying logic puzzles. All of this makes GAAC an incredibly smooth ride from start to finish, and that's without even talking about the things the game does well that aren't just strong case construction.

How strong you find particular characters is a very subjective opinion I tend to find, but for my money GAAC has the best cast out of any Ace Attorney game. This is as shocking for me to hear as I'm sure it is for any Ace Attorney fan, because AA characters have never been bad. Hell, they've never even been mid, the main cast has always been incredibly entertaining. It is, of course, the main draw of the series. But GAAC really takes it to the next level by adding more depth to characters that simply was not present before. I love Apollo and Phoenix as much as the next guy, but Ryunonosuke's journey from untrained student to law expert feels real and realized in a way we never really got to see with either of them. Sholmes is a great example of this. At first, he just seems like a joke. What if Sherlock Holmes was really, really bad at his job? The comedy there is inherent, and the game does a good job of using that to it's fullest comedic potential. But Sholmes also isn't just a punchline. He always seems to know more of what's going on than Ryunonosuke does, and he is a genuinely good detective, just one a great deal more flawed than his personification in popular media usually admits. Without spoiling too much, for instance, his seeming incompetence in the second case of the first game makes a lot of narrative sense by the end of the second game. This adds a lot of flavor to a character that could've just been ""Sherlock Holmes but he sucks"", in a way that the straightforward characters of previous entries could never really achieve. What's more, it does this without sacrificing the immediate quirkiness and charm of any Ace Attorney character that makes them immediately likable and humorous.  That's an incredibly hard tightrope to walk, and GAAC nails it. 

And my god, the music! I seriously cannot praise the music enough, it's legitimately some of the best music for a game I have ever heard. Not because it's hype, not because every tune gets you banging your head and ready to fuck up some witnesses, but because it does an incredible job of setting the stage and pulling you into the world. One of the main goals of this game that is apparent from the outset is to essentially make a 19th century London period piece, so every instrument, every piece of architecture, and every character oozes an over the top old timey London aesthetic that is unfortunately ruined at times, in ways that I cannot reveal without giving out spoilers. But that isn't even a problem until the very last case of the game!. Unlike the previous Yamazaki 3D Ace Attorney games, being freed from legacy themes means the use of real instruments can be used to it's fullest potential to create it's own unique sound. The reliance on string instruments sells the 19th century English setting like nothing else really can, with almost every single character, witness, culprit or client having their own theme that immediately lets you know what kind of a person you're dealing with. These themes can be incredibly varied, but they all still work together to put you in the world of post World War London, an era of exploration and alliances being forged. Look, just listen to Elegance and Excellence - Jezaille Brett's theme - close your eyes, and think of the person the music is meant to signify. It's classy, elegant, snobbishly aristocratic and yet...and yet. There's this strange undercurrent of mystery thoughout it, of depths not yet plumbed. Something...isn't quite right here. Why is it so over the top aristocratic? Why is it THAT prideful? It's almost like the person this music is for is hiding behind something. What secrets is this woman holding? 

That's the music for one of the characters from the very first case. The FIRST. I could seriously go on praising the soundtrack, but it's one of those things where you just have to play the game to get the full effect. Sidenote: For whatever reason, the port job's sound mixing is, how do you say, godawful. There is thankfully a mod that eases it a little bit and increases the volume of the music in game, but it still doesn't quite give off the power that it really should. Sound effects unfortunately did not receive this upgrade in an offical or modding capacity, so they're incredibly crushed and sound like...well, they sound like 3DS sound effects. This isn't helped by the English voicework which is by no means terrible. Actually, it's fantastic. There's just one, small, insignificant but incredibly important problem.

Ryunonosuke's ""Objection"" sucks. I would reccomend using the Japanese voicework, just for a more powerful objection delivery. AA gets a lot out of a little, and having an unsatisfying objection really undecuts the catharsis. 

If you are as big of an Ace Attorney fan as I am, then you'll probably love this game. On the other, if you don't like the Ace Attorney formula and are hoping this one shakes it up enough for you, it's not going to do that. It is still an Ace Attorney game at heart, with all the foibles that presents. The script can be bloated, there are cases of headscratching annoyance wondering what piece of esoteric evidence it is the judge wants, and sometimes characters can just keep blabbing on when all you want to do is advance the case. I got the game on sale, I personally don't know if I would spend forty dollars on it even with as much as I love the AA series. If you like visual novels, mystery stories, or Ace Attorney games, this comes at a high recommend for me. If you've tried a few AA games in the past but you're unsure about dumping forty dollars, I would definitely say wait for a sale. The game's great, though, you should play it.",1698729525,1698730140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really like the ace attorney series but god damn this game is so slow and holds your hand all the time.

The entire first chapter felt like a tutorial that over-explained everything and generally had terrible pacing.
I was willing to continue playing cause its the beginning and i had assumed it would get better once they were sure the player was familiar. 

But the second chapter feels even slower paced. Dialogue is bloated, it takes ages for the characters to say something you have probably already figured out. Characters will spend ages communicating something they could do in a couple of lines. 
One of the big mysteries of the chapter isn't that hard to figure out, but the game decides to hit you over the head with the solution well after you have probably figured it out and then have a the main character continue to not have any idea.

The game basically telling you the solution to mysteries is bad but the story being good would probably make me give it a pass.
However the absolute tedium the game provides in terms of pacing is not something i can excuse. 
It feels like the game doesn't expect nor want you to pay attention. Paying attention to the game is actively frustrating, as it will then spend 30 minutes hitting you over the head with stuff you already know.

Like during a fight scene, Goku will think ""I need to use the spirit bomb I learned from King Kai, but I may not have the energy to do so, and I may not be able to hold off Android 88 while doing so."" And then we'll cut to sideline characters explaining the same thing, then to King Kai on his planet saying the same thing and so on and so forth. 

This game has that peculiar over-explaining, where you'll see something like the judge saying ""Ryunosuke, if you interrupt at the wrong time, you will be penalized."" And then Ryunosuke will think ""If I interrupt at the wrong time, I will be penalized."" and then the person next to Ryunosuke will tell him that if he interrupts at the wrong time, he will be penalized.

In the first case, I knew what evidence I should be presenting, but I kept having to wade impatiently  through endless dialogue just to get to the point where I could start interacting with the court experience. It's really poorly-paced.

I never played past the first Appolo game in the main series (and I played the first Edgeworth game), but part of what made AA games appealing was the pacing. Characters' animations were snappy while the text speed seemed to speed up and slow down to match characters' excitement. GAAC is just so much more verbose and sleepy.

I wanted to like this game, but I can't. I agree with most of the negative reviews that this game's script could be cut in half without any real loss.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I liked it more than the mainline games.
This comes mainly down to personal prefence, but I really enjoyed the victorian epoch setting of the game and most of the introduced characters.

Gameplay:
At its core, this game is a visual novel with detective/puzzle elements.
The game doesn't deviate too much from the mainline games in that perspective, but there are two features, that are worth mentioning:
- There can be multiple witness in the stand at once. The dynamic interactions between these are great.
- The great deductions with Herlock Sholmes. They lighten up investigations a lot. Due to their nature, they are also pretty funny/goofy, once you correct some parts of them and their context breaks from the original narrative.
I don't play a lot of deduction games, but when I resolved an inconsistency and knew exactly the reason, it pushed my dopamine level to a new high. Most inconsistency are not too hard to figure out, but there were 2-3 times I was completly stumped.

Visuals:
Van Zieks alone is a reason for a solid 10/10.
Joke aside, the 3D setting and its particular execution fits the game well.
Emotions and actions are conveyed nicely and way more dynamic compared to its 2D mainline counterpart.

Story:
I can't really write too much, without spoiling the plot, but I will say, that it was a good idea to combine ""The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures"" and ""The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve"" in one package.

All in one, I definitely recommend this game. In my opinion Shu Takumi created another wonderful masterpiece!",1695814718,1695814718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The approach to the themes and their handling of this story is so unique and grounded that it has a firm identity outside of the mainline series, but the ideas themselves clearly tie the two together.

In comparison, this game (after the first case, which is Doing Something With It, I Swear) looks downright subtle with its breakdowns. Shout out also to the third case of the second part for not only breaking the bad-third-case curse that plagues so many Ace Attorney games but being one of the best cases over all in the entire series. I have so much good will for this game that I don't even particularly care that the ending systematically burns the entire thing down. All the ideas of imperialism are tossed out the window for a neat, clean resolution about how everything's essentially fine and there's nothing too severe to worry about, which can be (and is) very disappointing.

It fixes just about all of the problems which plague other games in the Ace Attorney franchise, it draws direct inspiration from a series I associate my entire being with, the soundtrack is the most fantastic of any piece of media I have ever witnessed, the story and interwoven plots are executed with a style which can only be accomplished in the visual novel format; it is all here and accounted for. I’ve played this game twice over just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming while playing it the first time- once on Steam, and once on the Nintendo Switch. Not only did the second run through confirm to me that I was in fact not dreaming, but it even allowed me a greater appreciation for the careful crafting of every element of this masterpiece- a feat I presumed impossible at the time.

	But first, why this game exists. In 2009, CEO of games company Level 5, Shu Takumi, approached Capcom with the idea of a crossover between the Professor Layton and Ace Attorney franchises. In 2010, Capcom would officially give Hino the green light to begin the creation of the project- and later on in the year, while lead Ace Attorney writer Shu Takumi was visiting Level 5 to offer a few ideas to the project, he was swept up in the excitement, and agreed to be a writer and co-director on what would become Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and this game is direct inspiration for The Great Ace Attorney. 

	The game is decidedly different in terms of design philosophy from other Ace Attorney titles- The first original trilogy especially are especially careful with their asset usage, and the cases themselves are usually very short and with a minimal list of suspects. This is slightly expanded in the DS port of the first game, where the case “Rise From The Ashes” is introduced, but its complexity is perhaps better noted as a step in the direction of PLvPW. With two development teams and more writers working on the project, significantly more weight is given to individual characters and animations, backgrounds are much more numerous and detailed, and of course the characters are in 3D. A significant number of ideas are taken directly from PLvAA and placed directly into TGAAC- A number of characters look more or less identical to characters who played different roles in the former. Gameplay elements such as being able to cross examine multiple witnesses at once, as well as witnesses having something to say about the testimony of other witnesses to spice up the drama, are also taken one for one. A decidedly European aesthetic, which wasn’t far off from Layton’s aesthetic but nowhere near that of the Original AA trilogy, was kept as the setting for TGAA. The music direction as well takes a decidedly different turn and aims for a more cinematic orchestral theming. Even the idea that the main character ends up traveling with a certain someone with a penchant for puzzles is taken more or less directly from the crossover, with Professor Layton being substituted by none other than Sherlock Holmes himself, being renamed to Herlock Sholmes (a fittingly Ace-Attorney style of name) in the english translation due to copyright claims from the notoriously picky Conan Doyle Estate, which is the entire reason as to why the duology did not make it outside of Japan for what many feared would have been an indefinite period of time. While The creation of PLvPW did have major consequences on the furthering of the mainline Ace Attorney games, the development team behind the Investigations games as well as Ace Attorney 5 and 6 as well as the troubled development behind the Layton crossover is what allowed for time to recreate the flawed but heartfelt crossover into what can only be described as “An Ace Attorney game without restraints”.

	And so we arrive at The Great Ace Attorney, wherein the formalities held to by the original games in the series can be wrought free, all characters can be perceived as new and able to come across new conflicts without any serious questions about their viability as a lawyer being brought up, and where every mystery unraveled is shown to part of an even greater plot. It is exceptionally difficult not to go into exquisite detail as to why this dramatic series of events is so exceptional without spoiling the entire thing, so I will mention the broad concepts without going into any specifics.

	This game is fairly long. It’s no Persona, but you better be in the mood to read. There is a lot of time spent more or less reveling in the atmosphere of the paradoxically drab and flamboyant portrayal of turn-of-the-century London, and there is a lot of dialogue. As far as length goes, the only case from the mainline games that comes close in length to seven out of ten of the cases in the Great Ace Attorney, is Rise From The Ashes. This game is aware that it is a self contained story, and wants to get everything off of its chest before it is done. I of course have exactly zero problems with this, and almost wish that there were wholly optional sections to just sit and take in the hopeful dreariness of it all. While some of this time ultimately is spent rehashing information to the player that perhaps you already knew, which gets into the question of if visual novels should be difficult or not, significantly longer portions of that dialogue are spent furthering the complexity of interactions between characters and their surroundings, in making the world feel truly alive. Even sections where the game fails to do this are done intentionally as a gag- to save on a few assets for the shrunken budget of the second game, the same character models (and characters, by extension) are used in places that don’t make a ton of sense- but the main character points this out as decidedly suspicious, while his assistant brushes it aside as if it were nothing unusual.

	The plot structure of the game is about the same as what you would expect from the older games- someone has been arrested for the murder of someone they didn’t kill, and it is your job to prove them innocent, while unveiling who actually did it in the process, and luckily, that person is readily available, since they were a pretending to be a witness the whole time. That is the only portion of this game that fails to improve on the original in a substantial way, but it does still improve on it. Not everyone who is the victim is written off as immediately dead, not every murder was premeditated, and there are at least two cases which come to mind where the suspect is not readily available. Better yet, the wrongly convicted have much better opportunity to defend themselves, and one even goes out of their way to explain why they had to have been the killer- because otherwise, they wouldn’t get what they actually want. That sounds like a terrible thing given that Larry Butz exists and technically does the same thing, but you’re just going to have to trust me on that one. The major differences in plot are directly tied to gameplay elements, being Sholmes’ deductions and the Judicial Findings. While the deductions in particular are very easy, I absolutely adore the tension both of them provide and find that they don’t detract from the experience in any significant way. Because of the way the plots are interwoven between cases, it is harder to judge the cases individually as I might in the original games, but if I had to choose, The Adventure of The Great Departed Soul would have to be my favorite case in the game, and by extension the franchise.

The writing in this game much, much drier than previous Ace Attorney games and the humour is much flatter. It also stretches itself out way more than is needed in terms of dialogue which makes the game feel like a slog.

The actual court puzzles aren't too tough but the game treats you like an idiot and practically tells you where to look. When it isn't simple, its jumping off on random tangents that feel completely unnecessary to get where the case is going. It adds to the feeling that the writer was trying too hard to stretch out the length of each case. Despite how random these tangents feel they don't present much in the way of genuine thinking or puzzle solving. 

If you've never played an Ace Attorney game please try the original trilogy instead, or Ghost Trick if you're a fan looking for more of that style of writing but haven't got around to it yet. If your appetite for these games is still kicking after that the Edgeworth Investigation games are quite decent, perhaps not quite as clever but enjoyable if you just have to have more Ace Attorney.

The Apollo Justice games (Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice.) feel a lot closer to this particular game in terms of style and thus I wouldn't really recommend them.

It's quite long, but I liked that about it. A good relaxed game for lazing in bed or on a comfy couch.

Something to keep in mind is this is basically one story segmented into two games spread over five chapters each. There are story elements that are introduced in the first game that don't have payoffs until the second game. I bring this up because one might think the game is paced very strangely or slowly if they are playing through the first game and expect the story to conclude by chapter 1-5, when that's merely the middle of the story.

I liked the new mechanics, such as the ""dance of deduction"" mode that sometimes takes the place of trials. In trials there can now be multiple witnesses on the stand at once, and there's a jury to be persuaded.

I've currently only finished the first game in this collection, but I can say without a doubt that it's already more than worth the asking price. The Great Ace Attorney 1 is not just a good Ace Attorney game, it's the best in the series bar none.

The writing, and characterisation is excellent and fits perfectly with the game's themes. Ryunosuke, the game's protagonist, goes through more character development in 3.5 cases than Phoenix has in 6 games. 

Susato is the best assistant, capable of both being funny and being genuinely helpful as well as having some very good development of her own. 

Van Zieks is the best Prosecutor in the series (sorry Edgeworth) and goes against the tired trope of being ""undefeated"" until they meet the protagonist. They never feel like they're being stupid for plot convenience and they manage to be sympathetic, likeable and badass in spite of being a racist asshole. 

And Herlock Sholmes, once you get past the dumb localised name, is one of the funnies and best-written characters in the series, and I feel like I've barely touched the surface of his characterisation having not played the 2nd game yet.

The witnesses and perpetrators aren't just cartoonish villains who killed someone to further their own gain, they're sympathetic people whose actions are the product of their environment and way of life. And often by exposing the truth, you end up harming them in some unexpected, far-reaching way that arguably, they don't deserve.

All of this is combined with the best soundtrack in the series (particularly impressive considering the Ace Attorney series is known for its banger soundtracks), some really well done character animation and some of the most fun gameplay gimmicks in the series.

If you're a fan of Ace Attorney, you'll love this. If you've never played Ace Attorney and don't mind a lot of reading, you'll love this.

Every character wastes so much time on quirks that aren't interesting or amusing, talking about plot points that go nowhere, talking about plot points that will go somewhere in what the writers probably thought was foreshadowing but was actually just needlessly drawn out filler, or they just talk about nothing. The protagonist is almost as useless as Apollo was in his first case, except this lasts for two whole games. The assistant is bland, though is at least preferable to the parts where an adult is accompanied by a 10 year old girl. I don't know the pedo laws over in Japan, judging by most anime they seem to have none at all, but over here we're not into that. This game does seem to have two unique gimmicks... one which wastes time during investigation, and one which seems like a good idea but mostly just makes every juror into an idiot who doesn't understand the stakes of a murder trial. The only good thing about this game that Trials and Tribulations badly needed was telling you where to go during Investigation. Everything else makes me wish I stopped played these games after Dual Destinies, which was much better than this and had more interesting gimmicks and characters. This is obviously just a poorly written excuse for a game made by someone who just discovered Sherlock Holmes books and wanted to include a character based on that. The inconsistent British accents of every character make it clear that they didn't care about anything besides that.

(sorry, i will get to eventually, Dual destinies left me kinda unsatisfied)
I genuinely believe The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles IS THE BEST game (or games if you count them as two separate games) IN THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE. 

The atmosphere and story are interesting, the game knows how to make you see something a certain way, and then flip it upside down and surprise you. 
The game IS very talkative, and that means the game HAS A SHIT TON OF DIALOGUE TO READ, AND I MEAN A SHIT TON, it is still filled with humor and heartwarming moments, and i never felt as though it was just trying to fill up play time.

I do admit that the first game of Chronicles is slow, like incredibly slow, and the insane amount of dialogue does not help the case (hah) . The second game does  shines through and gets you to finally experience and enjoy a bit more of every single step in your journey of becoming a defense lawyer. 

I had multiple times where i audibly went ""WHAT"" as the game surprised and intrigued me where i wouldn't believe, the over-arching plot the game has is rich, each case you get a little bit of the big puzzling mystery that is looming over the entire game and it is incredibly rewarding to get to each new point where you find out yourself, as Ryuunosuke Naruhodo, what event occurred in Great Britain in which you were thrown into out of mere coincidence as a foreigner who is  also not welcomed very nicely. 

Chronicles consists of 2 games, each one is around 30 hours, making it 60 hours as a whole, same amount of time as the original trilogy. I see it as one huge game with 10 chapters as both are connected with one over-arching plot, as the first game barely has a satisfying ending as a whole if i'm being honest.

TIP: ENABLE TEXT-SKIP IN THE MENU TO MAKE THE GAME DIALOGUE GO FASTER, YOU CAN CLICK SPACE AND NOT WAIT FOR IT TO SLOWLY APPEAR ON SCREEN AS THE ANIMATION IS SUPER FUCKING SLOW.

After some good and bad in the Ace Attorney franchises, Capcom finally took a really interesting yet innovative direction in this franchise after the new trilogy mixed reception (esp. Apollo Justice & Dual Destinies), This game really defines what is an ""Ace Attorney"" game after all

For starters, this is and Adventure & Visual Novel with Courtroom Drama as a main theme. All of the main cases in the Adventures game are written really good for a new-gen Ace Attorney game (the 3rd and 5th case for me is the greatest case in this game)

Some of the new Mechanics such as Dance Of Deduction, Summation Examination, and Multiple Witness (for multiple witness, it first implemented in Phoenix Wright vs Professor Layton crossover game) are implemented really well that it helps our main character doing their investigations/trials and serves more than just a gimmick feature.

Characterization pretty much a solid one, althought it could be better for certain witnesses.

I never got around to asking him to join me playing this game for whatever reason and I put this game off for almost 2 years. I realized I was putting The Great Ace Attorney off because it's the second to last Ace Attorney game in the series I haven't finished, the other being Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright, and I didn't want to live in a post-Ace Attorney world. TGAA 2 (2017) is currently the last Ace Attorney game made as of this date with the last mainline game coming out in 2016.

After listening the TGAA soundtrack the other day, I'd finally decided to finish up the rest of these two games. IDK if there will be anymore Ace Attorney games in the future, if The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles are the series final entries, then they are without doubt a worthy end point for this franchise. The character writing and narrative are some the best this series has ever produced and Ryunosukes's character development makes him my favorite protagonist in the series. My man can go from being a goober to an absolute savage in the courtroom and produces some banger quotes that go HARD.

You can see most of the plot twists coming from a mile away if you have been playing all the games, but at the end the grand reveal is even more stunning than what you'd normally expect, and obviously, with enough writing care to make those twists land properly. The gameplay is way more straightforward than previous games, but that also means there are less spots where ""this evidence truly makes sense but I can't use it lol""

The characters are as memorable as we've come to expect from the series, with the exception of some side characters that pop up once and never again, most of the main cast is amazingly lovable.

Some of the gameplay decisions are tough to stomach in my opinion, but the overall experience more than makes up for them.

Lift, those and the word count jumps by 90% but still conveys the same amount of information.
The cast is extremely dry this time around, the few wacky characters that are present can't properly bounce off anything because of that, resulting in them just being annoying.
The new jury system is a interesting idea, but it never reaches the same impact it had when it was first introduced when it seemed like a dynamic system. The jury exam is sadly linear and will always happen at the same time, a criticism of the system would usually be that it detracts from the Prosecution (the rival character), but since he is so boring this time around, the jury is quite welcome.
The trials are interconnected in this one, leading to some great late game cases, what is not great is that the setup cases often feel unsatisfying or unresolved because they have to build up the final.

It does have an interesting narrative with a few plot twists and the annoying jury thing is only present in 2 trials, but it's not enough to make up for how annoying this is throughout both games.

In the end, I'm just happy I finished it - but all I have to remember it by is some fun plot points marred by a ton of little irritations. Don't even have the energy and care to write more. I just didn't enjoy it for all the reasons I didn't enjoy the first one. Too much slapstick, animations repeated over and over pad the game, dialogue repeating what we already know etc.

Old review:
Ace Attorney chronicles pt 1 (A review after the first half of the game)

I wish I could give a between thumbs down and up for this, but since I haven't played the 2nd part yet, (and worse yet, have very little motivation to DO so) I feel like it shows how little this game captured me. I'm constantly told the 2nd half is better, so I will possibly amend my review after I finish that, but I'm not holding my breath.

I have the most gripes with the jury mechanic which brings nothing to the game, just random bozos that sometimes are way too close to the case to even be in a jury (in one case it's literally the person who committed the crime!?) for it to be even taken seriously. It's time-wasting honestly. Even when they do bring new evidence or knowledge with them, the way of getting there is tedious.

The characters are a bit TOO ridiculous in this game (live swan on head, exaggerated animations that really don't fit the mood, slapstick, goddamn weird posing that wastes time on animation, and holy crap the ACCENTS. I've read somewhere once that writing too thick an accent lowers engagement of prose and I have to agree - so much of the 'bri-ish gov'na dialogue is just impossible for me to read that I ended up skipping it - and losing nothing in the process.)

Slapstick in general is jarring and calls to question the sanity of people in the story. Someone getting hot tea poured over them every time they start to say something incriminating and nobody reacting to that fact is one example of how this can get frustrating. It's a goofy game - and Ace Attorney certainly never was 100% a stern serious game - but this is pushing it too much into cartoon comedy for my liking. I will take a parrot testifying over one more synchronised pose between all 3 witnesses.

Some more random things:
-people constantly bringing guns to the courtroom/somehow having them in prison had me tired. Everyone in this universe is just insane.

-a ton of 'invention' deus ex machina kind of ruins the final case (goddamn cat-flap creating machine really!?)
 
- the game is in love with repeating information you already know countless times. Skipping dialogue is practically necessary to preserve one's sanity.

-The jury mechanic brings absolutely nothing to the game besides pointless distraction. Very rarely do they have anything of substance to add and when they do it's something that could be easily added to testimony of actual witnesses.

The reviews of people saying there is ""too much dialogue"" is also something I have a problem with, as the game very much likes to over explain everything; which means witnesses will talk for MINUTES at a time.

Another thing that also does waste time, in my opinion, is the deductions with Herlock Sholmes. Now don't get me wrong, I love this game play feature and theatrical way he dances around the room pointing out his deductions. However I find it annoying you have to hear Sholmes' wrong conclusion before you get to step in and help him. I would have very much preferred if you could press a button and butt-in with an ""Objection!"" when he makes an incorrect conclusion. It would mean you wouldn't have to waste 5 minutes listening to his wrong conclusion but you still get to join in and steer him in the right direction.

Despite the issues I have with the game, I really believe that anyone who enjoyed the Phoenix Wright games would have a blast with this one.

Up-Update: the climax of trial 5 is so bad, it's a disgrace. As some point a familiar character delivers a piece of evidence left behind by another familiar character, and the initial excitement for this development rapidly goes down the drain as you realize how badly the story falls apart from there. Spoilers:





The crux is the real killer couldn't have seen what happened behind the door because the peephole didn't exist until Susanto created it with Iris' invention. The problem is, during the animation for the discovery of that crime scene, which we are led to believe to be as true as can be, Susanto was pre-occupied with helping Shomles who was injured, and Naruhodo was able to see the crime scene through the peephole that was already there. The game literally shows Susanto not making the peephole but then pulled that out of its butt and to claim ""oh actually it definitely happened.""

Think I'm nitpicking? When the judge give you one chance to prove Graydon is the real villain, the right choice is apparently to prevent Iris' catdoor maker. I can only assume the logic is that the device can make peepholes, so the peephole wasn't there earlier, but THERE'S LITERALLY A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE COURT RECORDS SHOWING THE DOOR WITHOUT PEEOPHOLES! Having a catdoor maker doesn't mean it was used to make the peephole, but the photo is concrete evidence of the peephole having been made after the crime, so the game's preferred evidence is actually not logical. 

When asked how we know the peephole was really made with iris' device, she just claims ""the peephole's size is exactly the same as my device"", when at no point in the investigation progress did anyone notice that, no one even took a measurement of the peephole, or the device, but how she magically knows the exact dimensions.

What a shame, the story was so intriguing up to now, and it crashed and burned into a dumpster fire of just sloppy game design and messy storytelling. I love Ace Attorney, so I've been giving this game a thumbs up till now, but the climax of the finale is so disappointingly bad it has to be thumbs down now.



Update: the end of the first trial in Britain has completely turned around my opinions of the game. I'm fascinated by how the story will progress and applaud the writers for such an interesting cliff hanger.

My original thoughts: 

THE FIRST CASE IS A F**CKING DRAG. It's filler after filler of dialogue, literally, what I just sat through:

Judge: ""What exactly is this [evidence] telling us this?""
Player: ""... Everything, Your Excellency.""
Prosecutor: ""Everything?!"" (shock emoji)
Player: ""Yes, I believe that these [evidence] in the [evidence] here...""
(Pause)
Player: ""... amount to conclusive evidence in this case...""
(Pause)
Player: ""Evidence that will prove beyond any doubt who [did the crime]!""
Witness: ""Shut up!""
(Pause)
Witness: ""Conclusive evidence? How many times have I heard that today?""
(Pause)
Witness: ""You wouldn't-""

SHUT THE F**K UP! ALL OF YOU STFU!

Phoenix Wright's first case was also easy, but it moved fast, that whole trial took 30 mins tops and gave you all the basics of how the game is played. I'm 2 hours into the first case of this game and my space key is halfway in hell from how much I'm spamming it trying to skip the UNSKIPPABLE FILLER DIALOGUE!

Maybe it's designed for newcomers to the AA franchise, but unless a ton of nematodes are picking up the series for the first time, it's easy to the point of insulting. Normally if I feel dumb playing an AA game it's because I'm stuck on a hard puzzle, here I'm feeling stupid by proxy because all the characters wouldn't know 2+2=4 if you don't write it up on a whiteboard and shoved their faces into it.

Giving it a thumbs up only because I'm such a big AA fan I want Capcom to keep making these games, and I'm curious about the lore, but god damn the first level is a masterclass of sh*t game design. Whoever is responsible is found GUILTY and hereby sentenced to replaying the third case from every AA game repeatedly for a year!",1684901703,1688536349,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played most of the Ace Attorney games throughout the years (except AAI2, PWvsPL and AA6) and I must say, out of them all these two games as a whole are the best out of the whole series. Seriously, this divergence was what the series needed. The story is phenomenal, the fact that all cases are connected and slowly build into a one giant story and that story culminating into one giant epic climax where you feel so triumphant and accomplished after this long journey. The characters are all very well written, interesting and memorable, you actually feel emotionally attached to them at the end of the game. The gameplay is such a breath of fresh air, gone are pointless gimmicks, say hello to great deductions to spice up the investigations, multiple witnesses on the witness stand to pursue and the jurist system to pit jurors arguments againts each other. The soundtrack is easily the best OST as a whole in the series, nothing comes close to it. There is only a handful of songs from the other games that can be compared (""Wanting to find the Truth"" for example). For any Ace Attorney fan this is a mustplay and for any puzzle solving/thinking game enthusiast a game worth trying. The only downside is that I got a bit burned out at the begging of the second game so I had to take some breaks from it because some parts are a bit longer but otherwise it was a blast.

If I overlook that one small problem I mentioned, this game is an easy 10/10.

*Big Spoilers bit

[spoiler]For anyone curious, my favorite part of the game is finally seeing Sholmes being serious, him playing dumb just to help Ryunosuke grow and then when the time comes, unleashing his true genius, it's amazing. The final dance of deduction was a cherry on top, the song that play to it was just perfection, it captured the sense of grandiose finale, urgency and the professionalism of Sholmes and Mikotoba perfectly. Then the build up from the walkie talkie to the over the top hologram that Iris just build cuz why not and casually chilling with his good neighbour Her Majesty the Queen is just perfection.

A special hats off to the translators for the first case - one of the big challenges of the series has been how to translate the many pun based character names, and I thought they did an especially great job with the Japanese characters in game one.
If you're a fan of turn-of-the-century Meiji period/Victorian period history, the concept is a brilliant merging of real history (Japan's program sending citizens abroad to learn about science, law, and medicine; treaties requiring Japan & China to only trial European citizens in European managed courts; historical figures like Natsume Soseki) with the Sherlock Holmes mythos.

The story is interesting and the way it unravels keeps me interested throughout the game, especially the second one as it really focus on building up that last case. It felt kinda slow sometimes but it paid off at the end.

The cases are good, the method and the motivation behind each cases are all great. Although, there were many times that the answers are so obvious but the whole court would be oblivious to it, and that has caused some frustration for me several times. The nature of some cases was a little too on the nose early on, but I can still appreciate how everything connects in the end.

The cast, I enjoyed quite a lot. Even some of the one-off witnesses were fun to watch. The animation alongside their personality keep the trial fresh. Not to mention Mr.Sholmes who you will love by the end of the game if not the first episode he appears on. 

The OSTs, I don't have much to say except that it's very good. I didn't notice it at first but when it plays for the last time in the story, I realized that I really enjoyed this game and started to miss it as the music plays. 

So yeah great game. Nice extra content too.

I had only played the original Ace Attorney trilogy before, so I got to The Great Ace Attorney without having experienced the other installments and spin-offs. Even so, I never felt Chronicles was just more of the same, instead it really felt as a step forward with a fair share of new features that expand and refine the original formula.

Since at the end of the day we are playing a series of narrative adventures, let's get straight to the most important aspect of this package: its plot and characters. It contains the usual twists and exaggerations that are commonplace in the first games, and they are masterfully handled here. The plot (the specific of each case and the overarching one that spans both games) are very well written and superbly laid out, I never felt that any scene was lacking nor had any loose end stitched like a patch. Each case is well crafted and never loses the sense of discovery or progression, and there were few times (although they do exist) when I felt it was obvious what was going to happen. Fortunately everything is properly closed and explained by the end, avoiding the inclusion of a cheap cliffhanger to squeeze new installments out of it. This is a universe with many possibilities and Great Ace Attorney still has a long way to go, but the creators do not force the ending to give rise to artificial sequels, and that is something that honors them and I am very grateful for.

As for the characters, there is a great variety of them and they are all properly fleshed out. The secondary characters have a lot of charisma and their personalities are well defined, with special care put to the use of accents, dialects and other paraphernalia that contributes to make them a more colorful bunch. This is accompanied by sensational visual designs and a perfect animation work, picking up the 'minimal animation' style of the original trilogy and translating it to 3D in a quite successfully, with fantastic results.

The group of main characters has a nice balance to it. On the one hand, we have the set of protagonists who are direct heirs to the Phoenix-Maya-Edgeworth trio in the original. In that sense, they are similar characters in terms of approach and personality, but they still feel different and some of them (I will not tell which one so as not to spoil the surprise to anyone) have a deep additional development in the last third of the collection. On the other hand, the remaining main characters breath new air into the formula that expands beyond themselves.

I'm talking, of course, about the world-famous Herlock Sholmes, who is a more experienced and resourceful counterpoint to the lawyer-to-be protagonist, while also acting as an occasional comic relief. With Sholmes comes the first (and super fun) new feature of Great Ace Attorney: the Logic and Reasoning Spectacular events. They are a series of scenes that act as a breaking point in the exploration process' pace and consist of a kind of ""dances"" between the famous detective and our protagonist, where mysteries and contradictions in the crime scenes must be solved, sometimes with the presence of those involved using our observation skills to assemble together the puzzle of the event in question. These scenes are a blast and I always felt like I wanted more, the animation and sound work in them is out of this world and every time I reached one my heart started pounding with excitement. Great gameplay design here.

The innovations do not end there, however, and the already classic trials have undergone an important facelift. This time, one additional ""party"" is included in the judicial process: the people's jury. In each trial we will have to convince not only the investigating judge but also the members of the jury of our position, sometimes using their own arguments against them and pitting them against each other to achieve our purpose. It involves an additional degree of reasoning in the trials that makes them more varied and deep. Besides, now there may be more than two witnesses testifying and being cross-examined simultaneously, so we will have to focus not only on their testimony but also on the reactions of the other people on the stand in real time. It does not have a great difficulty and it's almost impossible to fail when a reaction takes place, but again it contributes to breath additional variety and depth into the original formula.

As for the remaining features, this game achieves excellence in all of them. Visually it is, for me, the most polished of all the entries I've played, with a great deal of work done in environments, effects and, especially, characters. As I have already mentioned before, I am in love with their extravagant designs and animations, full of expressivity and personality even in their simplest instances.

Likewise, audio is quite amazing in this pack. The series' spirit is still there, keeping the old sound identity in menus and actions with SFX that are recognizable by any fan of the franchise, and in terms of soundtrack, this is arguably the best installment in the series. The themes have an immense quality, both the reimagined classic themes (few) and the new ones (specially all those related to Herlock Sholmes, really memorable compositions).

All things considered, this was a memorable experience for me, one that I've enjoyed every second of and I'm already missing. If you are into narrative games, there are few better representatives than this one, and if you are an Ace Attorney fan then this is a must stop.",1629220167,1688138659,True,51,0,0.817711234092712402,0,True,False,False

There is one big limitation:
 SO  MUCH DIALOG!!!

To take one example, the characters hear a ""thud"" behind a locked door. So they have a three-way conversation about how important it is to rush into the room if only the door weren't locked. Then one character asks for, and then receives permission to pick the lock. And does so. And receives a remark about how quickly he unlocked the door. And then another a three-way conversation about how, now that the door has been unlocked, the characters can proceed to rush through it because, don't you remember --- they heard a ""thud"" earlier. Except I don't think my summary has adequately captured the true length of dialog, so I will repeat how fortunate it was that one of the characters was able to unlock a door that was previously locked and from which they heard a ""thud"", resulting in the need to very swiftly dash through, and I wonder what they will find once they rush through the formerly locked door? Surely they need to immediately rush inside to learn what that thud was!

This game is from the 3D era of Ace Attorney, and thus was on the 3DS. However, the game is in HD and features DLC outfits for the 2nd game for free. The Great Ace Attorney games came out later than most Ace Attorney games as it has many of the previous games features, as long as introducing new features such as Dance of Deduction and Summination Examinations, which I'll leave for you to find out what they are. The 2nd game was Japan exclusive until this game came out so this game is very new to us in the West.The game is a love letter to all Ace Attorney fans from the original Ace Attorney director himself.

This game is not connected to the Ace Attorney timeline, so you can play it regardless if this is your first, 3rd, or even last Ace Attorney game. The Great Ace Attorney takes place during the Meiji era, long before any Phoenix Wright game takes place so the lore doesn't clash with the mainline games. Though I suggest playing the original Ace Attorney before jumping into this one.

Shu Takumi, original director of the Ace Attorney games, directed both of the Great Ace Attorney games, unlike him being absent for Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice development. 
This game fixes many flaws the previous games had and also has many pros about it:
+QoL features such as Autoplay (Automatically skips text for you), Story Mode (For those who just want to read the game and not have to play, though achievements are disabled), and Text Skipping (Hold left click to skip text super fast!). 
+The game also has a great plot, funny characters, amazing soundtrack, and even racism. Wonderful. If you're put off by the ""racism"" its because again, the game takes place during the Meiji Era or late 1800s where it's just historically accurate to include racism though it's not very extreme. 
+This compilation is on many consoles, Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4. No Xbox support for whatever reason.
+Also it has a cat. I LOVE WAGAHAI
+Update: It also has a dog. I LOVE TOBY

The game has flaws though:
-Very dialogue heavy, it's pacing is super slow especially in the first game. For example, whenever you present evidence like a photograph and you need to show the exact point of interest the characters have like a conversation for 10 months about how they're confused and you need to present the point of interest whilst prosecution tries to use the same claim that this is unrelated and already aligns with the accusation against defendant, main character starts thinking in head about stuff. Fortunately, text skipping allows you to skip the long winded dialogue so you can actually play the game.
-Plot doesn't get interesting until 3rd case for 1st game. First case is a long tutorial thanks to the long dialogue and should have ended earlier. THREE PARTS for a tutorial case, and theres not even an investigation part. The 2nd case also feels like another tutorial case where you learn about how to investigate, examine, and move around and get introduced to Dance of Deductions. Though the ending for it is kinda lame. It gets good cases 3-5 though.

-To demonstrate how long the game is: The first game took me around 92 hours to beat. This was both using Autoplay and me pressing space/left click to skip text. 
I haven't finished the 2nd game, currently I am on middle of case 3 and around 65 hours in playtime, though others may finish quicker than I do.

To really just sum it all up. The Great Ace Attorney is a wonderful game with funny characters, amazing soundtrack, and a very interesting plot. It also has a cat. Game unfortunately has garbage pacing just like all the other reviews complain about and case 1 of the first game was really long and case 2 of the first game had an underwhelming conclusion.

The TL;DR is its just bad compared to the Phoenix Wright games. Even without the comparison, the ""logic"" this game follows in court is just cringe and backwards.



MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD


Pros
Herrlock Sholmes
A new minigame when gathering evidence
A new minigame when trying to convince the jury

Cons
Herrlock Sholmes is the only interesting character in both games
The new minigame when gethering evidence is exceedingly easy
The jury full sends guilty on the least reliable evidence ever seen
The evidence requirements are beyond ridiculous 
Everyone in the courtroom is f*cking braindead

I know the Phoenix Wright games can be kind of memey with what you need to prove in court, and typically they kind of make fun of themselves with some of the requirements but these games take it to a whole new level. The jury will full send guilty at the very beginning of basically every trial off of the most circumstantial and assbackwards shreds of ""evidence"" ever seen but the game will then require you to fight tooth and nail to prove beyond all shadow of a doubt that its wrong. This is not a new theme in the series, but these 2 games take it to such an extreme that its hard to even force myself through this slog. The second game also includes a trial that would have happened during the first one, was very tongue in cheek about you not remembering it happening and for whatever reason decides to make the prosecutor and jury even more racist this time around, and was just all around in bad taste. Just stick to the main games if you are looking for more action packed court cases.

I think the best way to describe this game is to call it a visual novel which tells a story and you contribute every so often to further the story. Having said that, it does an amazing job telling that story.

Admittedly, I found the tutorial cases a little bit of a slow burn, considering how much you participate in the earlier games in the Ace Attorney franchise. I do think that the slow burn is worth it as long as you level your expectations going into it knowing that this game is predominantly a visual novel.

I genuinely adored the characters, even the little throw away ones. The character interactions and the story are beyond compare and I couldn’t possibly recommend this game enough.

My main complaint with this, and the reason I'm giving it a soft ""no"", is that everything felt so long and dragged out. I do enjoy visual novels, but I'm sitting in my seat screaming what the next piece of evidence is to show or who did it or who to question next while I had to watch a 2 minute long cut scene for my main character to arrive to the same conclusion. The cases didn't seem to be as elaborate as the original Ace Attorney games, and I didn't have to think very hard to arrive at the conclusion. I found myself distracted while playing, which is a shame because I truly loved the old games and the era in history which this game takes place has always fascinated me. I assumed I'd love this game but it was mostly meh. Giving it a thumbs down only because it didn't really capture the magic of the original games for me.

I'm glad it got localized, the music is great, the overarching storylines are good, the graphics are good. It's more Ace Attorney for the fans who have already played all the other Ace Attorney games, and that's really the only demographic I would recommend this game to. If you want to get into the series, play the Phoenix Wright trilogy. If you played the trilogy and want more, play Apollo Justice or Miles Edgeworth Investigations.

Because DEAR GOD this game is a slogfest. this game is stacks on stacks on stacks of overly explained yet entirely simple mysteries and extraneous dialogue that isn't funny enough to justify the absolute time sink of a single sentence at the slowest text scrolling speed known to man. Why bother writing two mysteries when you can write one that takes twice as long because all the characters stop at every opportunity to say ""There's a mystery! ""How did you not notice the mystery?"" ""What mystery?"" ""How could there be a mystery?"" ""Oh, we sure have to solve this mystery!""

Like, the core element of Ace Attorney is the cross examination of testimony, so you'd think with such a long game you'd have lots of opportunities to press witnesses and find contradictions, right? But if you actually count the number of individual testimonies, you get maybe like... eight in a case. A trilogy case would give you twice as much, meaning more puzzles to solve, more lies to uncover, and just more exciting moments. It's not quality over quantity here, either; you're really just supposed to press every statement until some evidence or a statement gets updated, and then you know that you have to use whatever got updated, taking away half the puzzle. It's even easier when they give you a big exclamation point because a different witness wants to say something. Questioning the jury about voting guilty is similarly easy and goes just as slow, but it's a good mechanic and fits right in.

The investigations... are very, very long. Investigation segments in any Ace Attorney game tend to be the less exciting half in exchange for the necessary buildup of mysteries and evidence, but the investigating in this game railroads you harder than ever. Go here, ask everything, look at something, repeat. You're not solving any puzzles besides the occasional ""Dance of Deduction"" (Great segment. Could go a little faster).

And it's not like I hate the characters, either. They're all expressive, funny, and interesting. But the best characters in the world don't mean anything when I'm just waiting for a plot that refuses to move forward at a reasonable pace. If the writers trimmed out some lines to make the game less repetitious and gave an option to double the text speed, especially on first playthroughs where you can't skip ANY new dialogue, I'd still have some issues, but I wouldn't be giving this thumbs down. Great Ace Attorney is a 70 hour game that should be a 45 hour game at maximum, and if this review seems needlessly elaboratory on that point then I've given you a good idea of what you're in for.",1682990946,1682990946,False,104,5,0.653856277465820313,3,True,False,False

In the first game, the new mechanics feel fresh and well-used, the Course Correction minigame is funny and cute, the jury is colorful and adds a lot of great commentary to the cases, and so on. In the second, it feels like the writers are desperately trying to find places to add them to make sure they can have one instance of each new mechanic in each case. It feels the same with a few of the recurring characters: character quirks from the first game get pumped up into full-on character flaws in the latter as the writers try and fail to maintain the previous balancing act from the first game.

Also, it's hard to feel clever when an Ace Attorney game gives you a supporting mentor character who seems to know the entire case before you do, but by the second game, it feels like we're constantly subjected to having someone who magically knows exactly where the case is going long before anything has started but don't tell you anything besides ""Here's a random piece of evidence you might need later, *wink wink*""

I know I've been really harsh on the second half of the game, but all that being said, this game is still a very good Ace Attorney game. For once thing, it is really good at letting you follow multiple trails of logic to the same conclusion. To make up an example, if you're presented with a question about, say, two people who supposedly got into a fight, you could present one guy's broken watch OR the other guy's broken glasses and the game is usually really good about accepting both options. It's also really nice that for once the prosecution feels less like an obstacle who constantly makes up rules and ""updated evidence"" and instead acts more like your foil to ensure that the truth is reached properly.

Susato is Maya expy but a lot more useful. The circumstance is similar too.

Asogi is pretty much Mia expy. But because they can't bring back the dead, he's made survive and taking Godot's role, being masked prosecutor. That and being childhood friend

Van Zieks is Edgeworth expy as being prosecutor related to the big bad. Hostile at first, seeing his old friend in protagonist, ended up as suspect, etc. Except he also take Godot drinking habit.

You thought Edgeworth had it bad with the rumors of being corrupt prosecutor. Van Zieks up the ante with the Reaper title.

Iris is pretty much Pearl expy. A prodigy child actually related to a murderer.

And if you finished Rise from the  Ashes you already know who the villain this time. Down to breaking animation.

Surprisingly, the only 'original' character that doesn't have comparison in Ace Attorney is Herlock Sholmes himself. Unless you compared him with Layton in the crossover.

Overview: A beautiful and fun story game if you're chronically bored (and possibly masochistic), and you enjoy sitting through 30 minute stints of bizarre dialogue before you're allowed to present the clue you figured out 5 minutes into the current section of the story...  ""Suspended disbelief, never heard of it....""

[Long form review bellow, quick checklist at the very bottom of the review]

I first came across this game years ago while browsing for highly rated community games. With 94% positive reviews, I added it to my wishlist, however the high price at the time kept me from pulling the trigger. I had seen some sales come and go that almost tempted me to jump in, but it wasn't until yesterday Steam finally got me! :-D

Background---- I am not familiar with the franchise, so I came into this game a complete newbie. I have played many story based, visual novel type games, and I've enjoyed everyone I've played so far. I also am a big fan of mystery/puzzle games. I cut my teeth on classic Adventure games like Kings Quest, The Secret of Monkey Island and Discworld. Based on what little I knew about Ace Attorney, the glowing reviews, and my past history, I started the game.

The Game---- You're treated to a beautiful animated cut scene introducing you to the world you'll be occupying for the next 5-6 hours as you navigate your first case. The intro is captivating, and I applaud the writers choice of introducing the game mechanics in a Japanese courtroom during the fall of Sokaku, the Japanese period of isolation from the Western world at large.

As the concept of western legal proceedings was new to the Japanese people during this time, the sets the perfect pretext for character dialogue to explain game mechanics, and how trials work, without ruining the immersion of the story. In my opinion, an early indication of any truly great game is how intuitively you are introduced to the world and the mechanics. With that said, while the story flowed well initially, several mechanics were awkwardly shoehorned into conversations over the next few hours of game play. These new mechanics often felt forced and out of place.

I found often I would realize I have discovered something relevant to progressing the story, but I was unable to do anything with that until 30 minutes later a new game mechanic would be introduced that would finally allow you to act on the item you figured out a lot sooner. I soon found I had been ""trained"" to view all new information as part of a formula, I just needed to wait until the game presented me with the question I needed to plug in my answer.

The result of this is you begin to loose the story. I found myself no longer caring about the dialogue, the characters, or anything else that was happening. I knew the next thing the game was going to ask me to progress, my job now became hitting the space bar as fast as I could until the prompt finally came up for me to enter my newly discovered information. Unfortunately, that usually involves sitting through 20-30 minutes of often repetitive dialogue before you can proceed. 

This ultimately becomes the fatal flaw with Ace Attorney, at some point the story becomes the gatekeeper preventing you from moving to the next step. A great novel game ensures text/dialogue is always nourishing you, building tension, compelling you to root for the protagonist, misdirecting you for future surprises, and most importantly of all, a great novel game must excel at suspending your disbelief.

Suspended disbelief is crucial to every story ever told. You've probably experienced how jarring it is to suddenly realize the movie you've been completely engrossed with for the past hour suddenly makes zero sense. I remember watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens when it came out in 2015, and specifically, the exact moment when Rey, who picked up a light saber for the first time about 6 minutes ago, defeated Kylo Ren in a light saber battle..... Kylo Ren, who had been trained as a Jedi his whole life... defeated by someone who just picked it up..... WTF?! 

I remember thinking ""this makes absolutely zero sense at all...."" I mean, Luke, who at least had some training with Yoda, lost his freaking hand when he battled Darth Vader, and yet here comes Rey who magically stomps all over the super villan in about 8 seconds on her first attempt.... it makes no sense at all.

Not the magical mind control powers, the Faster-Than-Light spaceships, or any other of the totally ridiculous things that occurred for the first two hours of that movie.... nope..... just her sudden proficiency with a light saber..... 

Which goes to show how absolutely crucial the suspension of disbelief truly is to a great story. When done well, you are pulled deep into the narrative world the author has created for you to enjoy. No matter how magical or bizarre, you accept whatever is laid at your feet and become a citizen of the universe that is presented to you without questions.

During the first case, the plot holes in the mystery, the formulaic dialog progression, and the forced game mechanics all combine to ruin the suspension of disbelief, and make you all to aware that you're not interacting with a great story, you're simply playing a game and mashing a space bar to get to the next step. 

In the end, Ace Attorney feels much more like the man behind the curtain than the Wizard of Oz, which I found very disappointing given how long I have waited to play this game and all the glowing reviews.

If I was able to refund a game 5 hours in I would have with this one. With that said, since it's mine now, I'll probably try another story to see if they are able to pull me in.

i have been thinking about the final scour between 8 and 7 but it became 9 after i completed both part one and part two

for part one its funny and fun and super annoying but it gets better at final 2 episodes, short animations are fun to watch and puzzle and clues are easy to piece together, some of them when you understand how it all that happens, sometimes it feels great when you know before the game explains to you, and some are bizzare that only will be answered at part 2

part two: another great twist and turns and more questions that will only answer at final two episodes, surprisingly tho not much animation or short ones compared to part one which i find it odd to me, highly reccomend at very least to finish last two episodes/chapters in one sitting as it would be worth it and gets you more immersive",1682033197,1682033197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and the characters were so well written that I had actually believe I was in London during the Victorian Era and that these people (Susato, Herlock, Iris, Kazuma) were actually my friends. It was such a bizarre experience that I would love to relieve again. 

I recommend that you should never play this game with music turned off or listening to other music while playing, simply because the soundtracks are a bunch of masterpieces, not a single song in the entire OST is bad and it fitted well with the time period. Naruhodo's objection theme is a must hear because of how epic it is. 

More gameplay mechanics were introduced to make the game less of a visual novel and more focused on the gameplay aspect of discovering the truth, since the legendary Herlock Sholmes is guiding us along the way after all.

The game featured the most awesome main protagonist, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, who is literally Phoenix Wright's ancestor. Along with Susato Mikotoba being the best legal assistant in any Ace Attorney ever, not to mention his wonderful best friend Kazuma Asogi who is very similar to Miles Edgeworth. And the most badass prosecutor Barok van Zieks, a legend amongst the court. And of course Herlock Sholmes, the most funniest and enjoyable character in the game. 

Overall, everything is great about this game and there's no denying why it is called ""The 'Great' Ace Attorney Chronicles"".

Parts of game feel slow, and there is A LOT of dialogue to get through, but if you're patient and enjoy the mixture of humor, period fitting flavor text, and a ton of information that later connects to other parts of the story, I think you'll enjoy it.

(I love the AA series. It kept me going through difficult years in school, but this... This ain't it, sis. There are enjoyable parts about it, but as a whole it wastes your time. I wonder if they were pressed to make it as long as possible because half of the dialogue could be eliminated and I think it would be a lot more enjoyable. 11 hours played, and 5 of them were wasted with repeat dialogue. It's a very sad and reluctant 'no' from me.

[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]

This courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.

The reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.

The quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",1678804989,1678804989,True,113,4,0.888261735439300537,1,True,False,False

Here's the deal:

1. The first game of the collection was a good starting point, with the new mechanics and story setup, but its actual plot was not super interesting. By itself, I would rank Adventure just slightly above Dual Destiny. It's also super unevenly paced, as the first 4 episodes took roughly 15 hours for me to finish but the last episode was almost 8 hours. Plus, the game used Summation Examination too much and poorly explained in the story.
2. The second game was a massive improvement over the first one, but still, pacing is an issue. The second and third episodes were also super long and we all know the final showdown is the most exciting part, and that makes the 2nd/3rd episode padding worse. The story is well-written and takes turns, but as my biggest complain goes and ultimately made me not enjoying this game as much as I can, is that I feel like the plot takes no new trick, without spoiling it too much.

Overall, the collection is recommendable but not my favorite from the series, far from it; If I rank the two games as a whole, I'll put it below the Phoenix Wright trilogy, below the first Investigation (port it, capcom), about the same as Apollo Justice and Spirit of Justice (port them, capcom), and above AAI2 and Dual Destiny (even though I don't like those, still port them capcom)

I played the first game all the way back in summer 2021 and finally got around to playing the sequel in March of 2023: And while my memory was a bit hazy, I cannot stress enough that the characters are so memorable that picking up 1.5 years later was no issue. As soon as someone came on screen I immediately remembered them, and that just is peak character writing to me.

Things to consider:
The biggest issue that I have with especially the first game is the excruciating slow pace. And the issue to me doesn't necessarily lie in the slow storytelling, it's more that the game often gives you clues so early that you figure out what's going on before most of the characters can. While that eliminates the tedium of the mainline games where I remember often being stumped, not knowing how to continue, GAA takes it a bit too much into the easy direction. 

GAA feels much more like a courtroom drama and less like detective games, which means you pretty much always know the culprit from the get-go and instead of piecing together what happened it's much more like: ""alright, we know the destination, but how do we get there and out of the current conundrum"".
As soon as I understood that I had a much better experience, leaned back for the ride, and enjoyed everything the game was throwing at me.

Especially the second game goes hard. It culminates in a grand finale that to my satisfaction was able to tie up literally every single loose end. It doesn't leave any question unanswered and gives all the characters closure. I haven't felt that good about finishing a story in a while.

One other thing that stood out to me was the brilliant localisation. The team that translated these games went above and beyond. 

I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys visual novels or the mainline series. The second game for sure has catapulted itself into my top favourite entries of the franchise, and I will remember the characters of the duology fondly.",1678023938,1678024259,True,6,0,0.569799959659576416,0,True,False,False

GAAC has the same appealing story and writing found in the Ace Attorney mainline games, but with an even more appealing setting and supporting cast. The Victorian era allows for a tiny bit of steampunk ""magic"", but otherwise forces the investigation and logic to be reasonably grounded, with fewer plot twists dependent on deus ex machina solutions.

On the other hand, GAAC is perfect to get into even if you've never played an Ace Attorney game.

At around 40-50 hours total, the 10 GAAC chapters will definitely feel long at times, but all of the gameplay mechanics are at their most polished, so at least that time is spent reading the fun dialogue and interesting plotting. I'm glad I experienced the two games as a single package -- if there's one major complaint I'd make, it's that the first game is heavily tuned toward setting up the mystery and climax of the second game, so you're not wrong if you feel like it's a slog in some parts, with mysteries that feel relatively low stakes. Thankfully the setting and new characters are more than enough to keep your interest.

By comparison, the second game is a real barn burner. It does feature the same Grand-Conspiracy-in-the-Justice-System seen in the other AA games, but there's enough twists and tweaks for long time series players that keep it interesting even if you can see some of the major twists a mile away.

If you've liked any of the AA games then GAAC is a no-brainer to play. If you're interested in visual novel-type games in general, then GAAC is a great entry point into the Ace Attorney series",1627874243,1677875436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a magic in human relations, the way we can perceive each other nature. Love. Compassion. Laugh. Sadness. Hate. Looking at our weak and good parts. How people interact with each other. This story is filled with colorful characters, and each one of them brought at least once, smile on my face, if not more complex emotions. They create together believable London society, everybody with their reasons and sense of duty, even minor characters from jury.

Ace Attorney brings out that sense of duty and explores it in such a way. That at some point... even if you don't acknowledge it at first, I was glad for every part of it.

The first case (which in the past has always been a quirky tutorial that lasts the shortest amount of time to introduce gameplay mechanics and characters) has now become a 4 hour slog. 3 pauses to save as the case continues to be drug out, momentum shifts just for the sake of momentum shifts, and painfully obvious contradictions that are drug out over paragraphs of dialogue before you are allowed to point them out.

Someone was wrongfully accused and as a lawyer it's your job to uncover the truth. At the core of this is a visual novel with a lot of gameplay elements. But be warned, It's not a passive experience far from it, you will be actively presenting evidence, focusing on topics, identifying inconsistencies in certain statements and more. You will have to put your thinking hat on and will have to be in the right mental energy when playing this. 

The writing and story is very easy to get into. But don't expect too much character development, most of the time you spend time on the case at hand and rarely will you have interactions outside of them. I think this was by design in order to focus on the courtroom drama. The writing often takes an interesting and absurd turn of events unfolding as the investigation continues. The main characters are likable and sometimes we get bits of humor, it helps not to take things too seriously. Overall it is well written and keeps you guessing on what could happen next.

The music and artwork are simply excellent. 

Some of the negatives are: a lot of coincidences in the plot, verbose writing like the story sometimes repeats itself with clues or deduction already established.

Now this is a big game, well actually you get the 2 games for a total of 75+ hours. There is a lot of reading with no voice over and that did put me off at first but I got used to it. Personally, I found it exciting and unpredictable. I never played the other Ace Attorney games and I’d definitely recommend this one for anybody wanting to read and play something interesting.

This recommendation won’t do without a slight “Objection!”, however, as this ~70h long two-game collection unfortunately suffers from occasional pacing issues[/code]

To be honest, the question whether you’ll like [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] or not is quite easy to answer - if you’ve already played an [i]Ace Attorney[/i] game before, that is. Simply answer the following question: Did you enjoy whichever [i]Ace Attorney[/i] game you played?

If the answer to that is yes, chances are very high you’ll enjoy this one too.
If the answer is no, well - [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] might be a spin-off featuring a new setting & characters but the gameplay itself only received few adjustments, so make of that what you will.

However, if the answer is “I never played an Ace Attorney game before”, great news: [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] are an excellent place to start, as they require no previous knowledge of the franchise. Franchise veterans might be able to catch a few references but you’ll never feel like you’re missing anything. But what can you expect of the [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i]?

As with the other (mainline) [i]Ace Attorney[/i] games, the two games part of the [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] collection are visual novels, which means you’ll mostly read through a lot of dialogues. You’ll accompany protagonist Ryunosuke Naruhodo on his path to become a defense lawyer in a fictionalized version of late 1900s Japan & Great Britain. Both games consist of five story episodes, each offering a case with “investigation” and “trial” sections. As with a TV show, don’t expect these “episodes” to be self-contained however, as findings from a previous case might have a connection to later events.

The best part of [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] is, without doubt, it’s one-of-a-kind cast of characters. It’s a pleasure to see Ryunosuke Naruhodo, the protagonist, grow into a defense lawyer dedicated to the truth but it’s the many side characters that really make [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] so entertaining. From the trusty judicial assistant Susato to the “great” detective Herlock Sholmes and an abundance of strange/loveable/hateable witnesses, defendants & culprits, there’s a lot of memorable characters to be encountered – as is typical for the franchise.

If it wasn’t for spoilers, I’d gladly recount just a few of the strange (in a good way) side characters that meet in court. In case you haven’t already played an [i]Ace Attorney[/i] game, you might think of [i]Professor Layton[/i] side characters in terms of how unique/strange they can be (probably one reason why the two franchises had a – surprisingly great - crossover game on the Nintendo 3DS). And it’s important that they are like this, because you’ll encounter them quite often.

As mentioned, [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] features “investigation” and “trial” sections. During investigations, you’ll try to collect as much information/evidence as you possibly can before you’ll head to court. This mostly involves talking to witnesses and searching environments, which in practice is mostly about cycling through a few set dialogue options and clicking on things in the environment as if it were an extremely easy hidden object game. And as investigations are requiring you to find everything before entering the courtroom, you basically can’t miss anything.

This is how it used to be in previous [i]Ace Attorney[/i] games as well and frankly, I always found the investigation section to be a bit dull – sure, they’re needed to set up the “trial” sections but they’re offering so little actual gameplay that I might’ve actually preferred them to be just dialogues instead. Thankfully, [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] add a new gameplay mechanism to the investigation sections, the so called “Dances of Deduction” which involve solving small puzzles through the power of observation – together with Herlock Sholmes.

These “dances” are honestly pretty easy puzzles where you just have to present the right observation at the right time. But they’re delightfully presented, with lots of camera movement, which is quite a change from the static camera angles present throughout the rest of the game. I thought these dances to be a welcome addition to the investigation sections and only really wish there were more of them.

The “trial” sections of [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] on the other hand are where the set-up from the investigation pays off. You’ll have to attain a “non guilty”-verdict for your defendant, which can be done by cross-examining witnesses, pointing out contradictions in their testimony and presenting the right evidence. In terms of gameplay, this amounts to only a few button presses but finding the right solution requires some thinking (and careful examination of your evidence) – or perseverance. The age-old [i]Ace Attorney[/i] problem of knowing the right solution but not being able to find out the game wants you to present it remains in this game collection as well – although it only happened like 4 or 5 times in total.

New to [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] compared to the other mainline [i]Ace Attorney[/i] games are multiple witnesses that need to be cross-examined at once (= watching out for all witness reactions to other witness statements, then calling them out) as well as a jury system. Throughout most trials, you’ll not only need to convince a judge of your defendants innocence, but a jury of six people as well – which is basically another way of listening to their statements and calling out inconsistencies. A nice change of pace but more of a fresh coat of paint than a major gameplay shake-up, really.

Concluding, in terms of gameplay, [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] offers what’s known from the series as well as a few welcome additions, that are more of an enhancement than a big change. It’s a visual novel with minor puzzle elements but the focus remains on the story, as evidenced by the inclusion of a “story mode” that plays the entire game for you – so you don’t even have to engage in any gameplay at all, if you want.

In terms of story, without going into spoilers, [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] offers a mystery that only seems to get deeper and deeper during the first game until it slowly gets resolved during the second. You’ll begin to see more connections as the plot unfolds and thanks to the great cast, you don’t really want to stop playing until the last case if finally done.

That said, [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] is quite long (~70h) and it doesn’t help that it suffers from occasional pacing issues: dialogue drags on sometimes and many events are recalled way too often. Especially the investigation sections can move at a snail’s pace sometimes, compared to how many developments the trials usually offer. Additionally, the first game could've used a bit more ""pay-off"", it feels like it's mostly setting up the second game in this collection. I also feel like the “final big bad” turned out to be a little bit too predictable in the end, considering how many hints the game drops in that regard.

Anyway, in total [i]The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles[/i] makes for a great [i]Ace Attorney[/i] experience for franchise veterans and newcomers alike: An interesting central mystery, an amazing casts of characters, a great soundtrack make for a fantastic visual novel. I do wish that more gameplay was involved and that the pacing was a lot tighter at times but overall, this collection offers another two great [i]Ace Attorney[/i] games of high quality.

While there were games from that list that I greatly enjoyed (notably Spirit of Justice and the Layton crossover), the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles remains as what I personally consider to be the peak of the Ace Attorney games. Lovable and memorable characters, charming music, great usage of the 3D visuals, and a beautifully written overarching story. 

While I do admit that the first game fell a little to the mundane side (both story and pacing wise), the second game takes those problems and manages to not only polish them up, but somehow manage to bring back underdeveloped plot points and wrap them up in a natural and enjoyable way. Returning characters either keep their charm from the first game, or become even better somehow, and seemingly one-off characters are brought back in a way that makes them some of the most memorable of the cast. It's no wonder then that people comment on how the first game exists to provide the necessary bases to make the second game as good as it is.

Overall, a fantastic experience, and a delightful duology. To any Ace Attorney fan contemplating on whether to give the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles a try, it'll be a definite recommendation from me.

A must have set of visual novels that seek to captivate you with an engaging narrative.
To start of on a very positive note.

Graphically, the shift to 3D is fantastic.
It's very expressive and the way they utilise it to show off wacky characters/scenarios that this series is known for really helps to elevate the experience.

The characters are just a whole lot of fun!
Well written personalities and witty dialogue help engage you in cases for however long they may go on for.

The cases themselves are fantastic.
Featuring the strongest writing the series has ever seen, the vast majority of these cases are super strong.
Though for the sake of not spoiling anything,  I cannot go into detail.

T H E   M U S I C
Really hypes you up, and the instruments they go with not only fit the mood real well, but are an absolute joy to listen to.

Only real negatives I have are that I feel some of the cases go on for too long.
The first game in this duology in particular has some pacing problems, since it from an investigation phase to being back in court, with no in-between.

To somewhat compound this issue, the jury system also outstays its welcome, it's used nowhere near as much in the sequel.

But honestly, that's about all that bothered me without going into greater detail.

I think it's on par with Justice for All as the worst AA game for me, the trials all seemed to follow the exact same formula every time and that made them feel monotonous and uninteresting, plus the investigation parts were not so much investigation as they were just info dumps. 

But I kept playing because there was a very slow but promising plot developing alongside the main cases, and I'm glad I did because the second game is leagues above the first. The characters are way more interesting and they get pretty good developments (I personally really liked how Gina grew up during both games), the trials feel more unique, and the development of the most important case that was slowly building up explodes in the second half of the game, and it does in spectacular fashion, I never expected so many surprises.",1675360242,1675360502,True,2,0,0.524801492691040039,0,True,False,False

To be fair and wanting to play every game in the series, (even spin offs) I bought this game when it came out. I was hesitant due to the setting not being my favorite but was still hoping for good story and characters to make that irrelevant. Gotta say I'm disappointed. 

I was REALLY hoping that these 2 games would get better. I have heard countless times ""bro, it gets better in the 2nd game, trust me."" That never happened for me. Where this game peaks is in the 3rd case of the first game in my opinion. Some of the new additions to the ace attorney formula like the jurists and ""Summation examination"" that were pretty fun the first time around. The animations and characters are very well detailed for ace attorney and I found myself surprised how much animation there was at times. However, that's all I can think of when it comes to the positives.

I really tried to like the characters but I just found them really boring compared to those from the main series or even investigations. Barok Van Zieks is definitely my favorite of the bunch and I was somewhat interested in his story for a bit but it didn't hold my interest for long.

These games DRAG. And I mean really drag. I went back and replayed dual destinies for the 2nd time recently (which is by no means an amazing ace attorney game) and it was so relieving how much less filler there was compared to the great ace attorney. Like holy shit some of the filler cases are longer than the finales in the main line series. I'm usually all for extra character dialogue and diving deeper into their personalities, and I also like to present everything to each character to find some hidden dialogue most of the time, but In this game, most of the time they just go on and on and on about the same point for minutes or something that could be talked about in a couple of sentences is extended to a few paragraphs.

I love the humor in this series. It feels clever and witty and despite it's anime style, doesn't often go for the lame pervert and wacky random = funny humor often that anime often has. The original trilogy's humor felt somewhat similar to the Simpsons if that makes any sense. But wow, these games are just wow. The humor sucks. 95% of the jokes do not land. Most of the time I was laughing was due to some funny animations. So not only are the characters not very interesting in my opinion, they aren't funny either. So when you have a bloated, padded game with hours and hours of extra dialogue and can't deliver on the 2 most important aspects of making me want to read it, the results aren't good.

I know I'm gonna get shit on by fanboys of these games as I have seen with other negative reviews on here. But as you can see I have 74 hours in this. I took my time, I paid attention, I tried to get invested with the characters, but it never came. And it took me all the way up to the 2nd game's final case (about 1 hour in) to realize that I was no having any fun at all.

After quitting and finally freeing myself from this torment, I ended up looking up and skimming through what happens in the finale of the 2nd game since I heard it was controversial. [spoiler] Not only are there walky talkies, but fucking holograms. In the late 1800s. I know ace attorney can be wacky as shit but god damn that's just lazy writing. Apparently Ryunosuke is not able to fully prove that stronghart is the reaper/professor, so they use technology that never existed at the time and the Queen of England herself to convict him. Marvelous writing. [/spoiler]

Anyway, who cares what I think right? Just some idiot on the steam reviews saying a bunch of nonsense. Most of the people reading this will be fans of this game which is okay. If anything I said made you rethink buying this game, then I have great news for you. These are games you don't actually need to play as they are story games. You can simply look up a walkthrough (preferably no commentary) on youtube and get nearly the full experience there. Actually, if you decide you want to turn on the ""story mode"" that this game features, you'd still be getting the full experience, as it does everything for you!",1675230121,1675230121,False,1,0,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

Taking place in the 1800's Japan and Great Britain following a different lawyer/judicial assistant combo I felt this was a very fresh take on the series. The gimmicks of this game were great, no magic/spiritual power needed, and it all fit thematically. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Simple Gameplay, basically a visual novel
-Fun mysteries
-Fun quirky Characters
-Accessability options to turn it into a straight visual novel.
-Music is great
-Level select for completion once beating the game
-Good voice acting for cut scenes, this is not something I often think about, but the accent work is excellent. The main characters are Japanese students in Great Britain, so they speak a British dialect, with a Japanese accent.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-This is a problem persistant through the series, but there are parts where testimony can be contradicted with multiple pieces of evidence, but only one works, and then the rest are brought up to coroborate. 
-A few times I could piece together large chunks of the mysteries, and had to wait for my character to catch up, at one point it was obvious to me but the character had to go through multiple panic attacks.
-Some evidence can only be partially investigated until something happens
-Text is a bit slow, and I found myself often fast-forwarding and then reading the court history. 
-No fishing

[h1]My Level of Experience with the game[/h1]
I took about 100 hours to beat, (I left my PC on a lot and would do other things so not sure that is true). I beat it in to segments taking a break between Game 1 and Game 2. Took less than a day to clean up achievements thanks to the chapter select.

As a PC port, devs really put efforts into mouse controls which you can walk through the game flawlessly with mouse alone. If you prefer mouse + keyboard it's also totally viable. 

However the game part suffers some mechanical problems such as having multiple viable choices yet only one is correct which can be quite frustrating. Another problem is pacing, especially the holmes part, but enabling skipping from options solves it very easily.

This game is, unlike that trilogy, firmly based in its historical setting in all ways. Racism, taxation, international politics, relationships and conspiracies are all key elements of every case and it feels incredibly real and immersive unlike the original series which seemed unwilling (at least in localized versions) to even acknowledge it was set in Japan. The fact that this also set in the Victorian era helps lend credibility to some of the more out there and previously non-nonsensical elements of the original trilogy. Many technologies we have today simply did not exist, and the game takes advantage of this. 

As a game on its own, GAAC offers an incredibly tightly wound and complex narrative that ends in a very satisfying way. Some cases definitely felt out of place in the moment, but all of the pieces eventually fall into place. The characters are also very charming, including Herlock Sholmes who brings so much to the table in both the story and gameplay. The two games together are also surprisingly long, taking me 60 hours to complete both. It did drag at times, for the most part the game has a great momentum filled with shocking twists and genuinely funny moments.

I'm going to assume you're somewhat familiar with the series in this review.

Even though the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a duology, it makes perfect sense to think of it as a single game. If all of the previous games' central narrative arcs were started and finished within their own scopes, here the ""main plot"" spans both games - and the first one ends on a cliffhanger, no less. And honestly, this works quite well - all characters are given plenty of time to develop and shine in all stages of their personal journeys.

And that's what really sets this entry apart from the previous ones - characters feel less like just actors in their roles, and more like actual people with complex thoughts, ideals and relationships. 

Let's take the central antagonist of the story - Lord Barok van Zieks. At first he looks like Edgeworth with cranked up von Karma factor and turned into a vampire. The parallel is clear. Of course, he's an undefeated prosecutor with disturbing rumours about him. How much of them are true? Well, he's very clear about one thing: he absolutely [i]hates[/i] the Japanese (so, you). And he'll let you know about this every chance he gets. 

But of course, there's much more to him that meets the eye. Learning about him, understanding his motives, fighting against him and cooperating with him in court... how do you do such things with someone who openly despises you and your people? How do you make anything but a total hate sink out of such a person?

And this is fitting, because racism and xenophobia are quite a theme of the game. I'm not sure if this is intentional commentary or delicious irony that the two countries chosen for this conversation - Japan are England - both... [i]struggle with the idea that others are just as good as them[/i], let's just say. But I feel like it's done very well, and both sides have their own heroes... and villains.

On the topic of heroes - since the main stage is 19th century London, one of the characters present is [strike]Sherlock Holmes[/strike] Herlock Sholmes, and it's an excellent reimagining of the character for modern, weeb-ish audiences. He's portrayed as a lot more erratic than you're probably used to, often needing someone to bring him back to Earth - and his morals and ultimate motivations are pretty questionable, to the point where you wonder whose side he's really on until the very end. Oh, and his mental health and stability are as iffy as ever, but at least he's not shooting coke (on screen at least). I'm very, very pleased with how he turned out, especially since he ends up being a major character.

I'm not without complains, however. First off, there's this Japanese circlejerk. The [b]JAPANESE SPIRIT! HONOUR! JUSTICE! FIGHT! LIKE A TRUE NIPPONESE![/b] nonsense is sadly present, and in quantities a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Your sidekick, Susato, is your perfect Yamato Nadeshiko waifu who's strong, perceptive, educated, but demure and endlessly devoted to your cause. The game gets points for her having a crush on someone else than you, that's refreshing at least. And even though the cases in general are fantastic, there were a few moments where I thought the characters acted in a nonsensical way; considering this is a game all about finding flaws and contradictions, this got in the way a little. But that's pretty minor, all things considered.

Also, Ryunosuke simply isn't as cool as Phoenix. It's a pretty tough act to follow - even though Nick started as a bit of a loser himself, over the series he turns into a badass of legendary proportions. Ryunosuke... doesn't. He just becomes competent. I'm ultimately fine with that though, this game is a dance of many characters, not just the hero.

To wrap things up: I'll be honest with you. I felt the series peaked with Trials and Tribulations. Apollo Justice was pretty good too, Dual Destinies... okay, and Spirit of Justice I couldn't finish. This, however, is just as good as the original trilogy. So if you got burned a bit with Ace Attorney, rest assured that this is a glorious return to form. An absolute must play to all fans of detective fiction.

Firstly, I think this game does a lot well with what it is.

Lets start with the background and work forward. The design of it is a lot better than the remastered trilogy, as the movement menu shows off all the locations you can currently visit and doesn't make you backtrack across various other setpieces to get to where you need to go. The mechanics are more robust than just psychelocks and occasionally pressing everything a dozen times, the examination of evidence is SO good (I so wanted to inspect the receipt in Case 1-2 early, that really could have been a save from Mia if the player didn't figure it out yet), most of the characters are better, more fleshed out versions of parallels from previous games (Giving Maya stand-in a stronger presence as the more competent one was a big plus to me, it always felt like Maya Prime was a bit underdeveloped as just a damsel in distress that is occasionally useful). The detectives (plural) are all more competent or funnier than Gumshoe, who was a catchphrase machine and local punching bag, the Edgeworth is more edgy and worthy (and actually scary. When Edgeworth Prime showed up in the original trilogy, I approached it like ""Ok, so this is the REAL prosecutor who is contesting us"" and when this one showed up it was ""Oh shit the vampire is going to kill us all if he gets pissed off"" and has more or less so far believed in justice.) The justice system is screwed not because the prosecutor took more than their fair share of the dinner but because the system is so new that nobody has a clue what is going on yet. The mechanics with the jury and the multiple witnesses adds so much to an otherwise boring process.
I mean seriously, just going through the character list everyone seems better than the original:
Judge: They seem like they actually care about justice, rather than some notion that the prosecutor is always right.
Maya:  Competent, strong, can kick the ass of anyone who tries her.
Phoenix: Has a real reason he is outwardly stumbling over every little thing. We are expected that Phoenix Prime passed the bar exam, but Naruhodo is just a student.
Inspector Gumshoe: Has 3 standins, each to a varying degree of competency and fun. The first one is straightfaced, a bit eccentric, but loyal and determined. The second needs Adderall, but is generally either fun or smug and dances on either side of the line to fit what perception we need to have of him. The third is the closest to Gumshoe, but tired. 
Larry Butz: Not present so far, keep up the good work!
Witnesses: They don't feel like one note personalities, instead they seem like 2 notes. A step in the right direction, but not bad considering the lot of them we will meet once and discard.

Now onto the things I personally didn't care for in this game:
The entire jury trial thing could have been handled better. At the beginning I reset because I was thinking ""Fuck I can't press willy nilly because it causes the game to make me lose without the life system."" But nope that was required to continue the story. It is not a good look for the game when I can view progress as losing. That wouldn't be so bad if the game's UI glitches out if you do anything the game isn't prepared for. If you Alt Tab and do anything, or scroll using a trackpad, or walk away for a bit, the game will break itself to pieces. I have lost a bit of time just getting back to where I was in the story because I had to restart my game because the right movement key would get stuck. And then there is the fact that the entire thing is a cloud save, limiting the options of offline play on this singleplayer game. I doubt that this visual novel's file takes up *too* much storage space, we can spare a kilobyte or two on it.

As for things I am neutral about, the graphics are ok, the entire theming is pretty interesting but also infuriating for entirely understandable reasons (Hate that it has to happen, do not mind that it is happening because it is accurate), 3rd case was a bit rocky, but if we consider our boss's questions as a lesson to us, we can kind of appreciate the lesson learned that we should be hunting for the truth, not a guilty verdict. I cannot feel one way or the other about the actual locations we find ourselves investigating.

Overall, 7.2/10. There are a few quite annoying glitches, but the other UI is good, the characters are great and poke fun at the original trilogy and how hammy it was, the motives are more comprehensive, and the gameplay overall has improved.

I'm SO GLAD I made that choice, because not only do these hold up to the OG trilogy, but in my opinion they FAR surpass them. (TLDR at the bottom)

[b]Writing:[/b] The writing is really good - fantastic story throughout the two games' storyline, with intricate elements to each and every case and a very compelling overarching plot that is SO SATISFYING to finally solve in the end. The mystery is never too easy or too hard - the original trilogy of games was a bit weaker in that regard, and often I had to resort to online guides. Here, nothing is immediately obvious or given away, but it's not so frustratingly hard that it borders on illogical, so it's a genuine delight figuring out the mysteries that have been laid out for you to unravel in every case. The cases also all felt like realistically plausible events, which is also a large improvement to the OGs.

[b]Characters:[/b] Every member of the main cast is likeable in some way, and I found myself extremely fond of almost everyone by the end. They're all multidimensional and really feel like real people (even the more ridiculous/eccentric ones. shoutout to Herlock Sholmes. love that man), and that attachment to the characters made me enjoy playing through their story all the more. Even the one-off characters manage to be interesting, and unlike the original trilogy, none of them are so ridiculously frustrating to deal with, or just plain annoying, that it takes the fun out of the game (i.e. Moe the clown).

[b]Visuals:[/b] The animation was something I thought was going to be off-putting or strange at first, as I was used to the charming but effective limited 2D animation style of the OG trilogy, but it absolutely surpassed my expectations. The 3D animations allow for some cool effects that weren't possible in the 2D version. The animation may not be the high quality you can see in other games these days, but I think it's quite charming and works well with the game's style.
The backgrounds are all very pretty and detailed, and the GUI has a cool aesthetic that very much fits the setting of the game and helps to immerse you in the 19th century feeling. I also quite like the occasional anime-like 2D animation scenes and the narrated prologue sequences, which work with the rest of the game quite well too.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] Typical Ace Attorney duality of investigation and courtroom sections, both of which are engaging and fun to play. There's some expansions from the OG trilogy to both sections - the investigation sections have one ""Dance of Deduction"" sequence per episode, which areinteresting both visual- and gameplay-wise, and I think they're a really good minigame to help break up the long visual novel investigation sequences (also they're funny and endear the characters to me even more. they are simply a little bit silly <3). The courtroom sections, meanwhile, now have summation examinations, add another component to the courtroom gameplay, giving the whole thing some more variety and keeping you engaged even through hours of gameplay taking place in the same courtroom.
Also, as mentioned above, there are a couple of anime-style animated sequences, and almost every case is preceded by a narrated prologue sequence in the style of a Sherlock Holmes story, which is different from the rest of the game but a charming touch as well.

[b]Music:[/b] GOD. THE SOUNDTRACK. The two composers for these games really did a FANTASTIC job, and I could honestly write entire musical analysis essays about their outstanding work here. Rather than sticking to synth tracks like the OG trilogy, these games have fully orchestrated music, and while at first that seems like something you'd need to get used to, it not only fits the aesthetic of the game much better than synth sounds would, but also pays off in the form of letting you hear some absolute BANGERS, as well as pieces that really tug on the heartstrings and make the game so much more impactful.
The courtroom soundtrack sticks to the usual Ace Attorney formula, having set themes for the defendant's antechamber and ""court is in session"", a moderato and an allegro version of a cross-examination theme, a bare-bones ""suspense"" theme, an ""objection"" and a ""pursuit"" theme, and so on. These also remain largely consistent across both games, with the notable exception of [spoiler]the last case of the second game, which brings in GREAT variations that really make you feel how much more serious everything has become in comparison to all the earlier cases, and helps with the climactic finale feeling of it all[/spoiler].
Outside the courtroom, we also follow the formula of having an ""investigation"" theme, as well as different character themes. These are all really well done, with a lot of them being really catchy, and all of them very memorable. Kazuma's theme is my absolute favourite, not only because it's a really good piece of music by itself, but also because of [spoiler]the variation it goes through throughout the two games - there's four different tracks that prominently make use of his leitmotif, and I adore the way they represent how his character changes with the story.[/spoiler]
Overall, an absolutely outstanding OST. Definitely one of the strongest parts of these games.

[b]Voice acting:[/b] Most of the game isn't voice acted, as is typical for Ace Attorney games, and sticks to the visual novel formula of text boxes with scrolling text. However, there IS occasional voice acting, and in my opinion it's really well used! I played the game with English audio, so my primary experience is with the dubbed voice acting, but I did also have a listen to the Japanese version, and I have to say I think all the voice actors did a fantastic job. I especially like Susato's English voice acting, and Van Zieks is very well done in both versions. Overall a nice touch!

[b]Bonus content:[/b] The ""Special Contents"" menu offers some fun additional content that I quite liked making my way through while taking a break from playing the actual story! I like that the achievements menu has a checklist for the multi-parters, and the unused music, concept art, bonus voice lines and extra mini-episodes are all very cool to look through!

[b]TLDR:[/b] Fascinating story, interesting and likeable characters, engaging visuals, fun gameplay, BRILLIANT soundtrack, good voice acting, and neat extra content - an absolutely fantastic set of games that is 100% worth the money. Cannot recommend enough. <3",1671307631,1671308263,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
1158850,128630816,76561197994168366,0,21,2384,0,2182,1671320472,"Short version: By far the worst game in the Ace Attourney franchise(including Apollo Justice and Miles Edgeworth games). Only play this if you've played ALL of the others, and want more, and are an uncritical player who's willing to play a weak(but by no means awful or necessarily bad) game in the series. 4/10


Long version:

Roughly speaking I agree with the various negative reviews. The game is really bland in all ways. If the characters in the other games are 9/10 on average, here they are 3/10. They're boring, uninteresting, unfunny, simple...essentially the same is true for the writing as a whole. The story is very lacking compared to the other games(even the ones without a game long metaplot), and the cases are especially bland.

And yet, this game has been written by the same person who wrote most of the other Ace Attourney games. After finishing the first game in this dual-pack, I set out to find out why the writing had taken a nose dive, and there seems to be no easy answer to it. It truly shocked me to find out that it indeed was the same person who wrote this and the other games, I was sure it was an inferior copy-cat who tried to emulate the style without understanding the essence of the Phoenix Wright games. To think it was the same person...

The funny dialogue? Gone. The interesting characters? Gone. The complex and deep plots? Gone. The imaginative and creative cases? Gone. The great pacing where each scene took as long as it needed and no more? Gone.

The dialogue is bland and boring, the characters pale in comparison to the originals, the plot is extremely simple, the cases are lacking, and the pacing is absolutely awful. Every character says three times more than they should, text wise, repeating the same things in different words but without any sort of interesting twist to what they're saying. This leads to all dialogue scenes, whether in the court or elsewhere, to be exceedingly long-winded where barely anything is said but it takes a huge amount of time for the player to go through. 

This bloats the entire experience to an unhealthy degree. Each case feels way too long, but barely contains anything. In the previous games the cases felt like they were long cases, but in a good way, where the court sessions were divided into segments by the investigation scenes where you looked for evidence and talked to various characters about many a thing. This created the feeling of an ""epic"" court battle where the prosecution and the defense battled with all kinds of claims, evidence, and so on. In this game, it's only one court session where they use huge amounts of time to state simple things. In the old games, they told information quickly and effectively, and a six hour case felt like it contained a dozen twists and turns. In this game a six hour case contains a single turn that's churned out extremely slowly and painfully.

It's like the cases are at the same time compressed(in terms of gameplay, events, twists) and stretched(in terms of text and the time it takes to go through the simplest of things). This makes it a chore to go through the cases, rather than a joy.

Frankly, the game almost feels like a deconstruction, or even subversion, of the original games. Given that it's been written by the same guy, I expect he grew tired and bored of his own tropes and wanted to do something different, which went horribly wrong. The old games had extreme and bizarre characters? Make them bland instead. The old games had investigation where you uncovered clues and evidence? Nah, you don't do that at all. The old games had you thrust into situations where you, as the player, had no idea what was going on but neither did the characters? Here the player always knows what's going on but the characters are always baffled and dumbstruck by everything, even things that should be obvious to them. 

This is made especially clear by something I will put in spoilers: [spoiler] You never catch a murderer. The first case is literally the only one with an actual murder in it, as such, and the culprit gets to go free due to political stuff. An obvious deconstructive subversion choice. The second case is deemed an accident(though in actuality it's manslaughter at best, possibly murder at worst depending on how you interpret some things). In any case, the culprit goes free with everyone nodding how sad the ""accident"" was. The third game is a manslaughter(seems to have been done in the spur of the moment), but due to falsified evidence they get free(and are your client, thus you made a murderer go free). The fourth case there's not even a murder, and it's a freak accident(albeit one of the people should definitely be tried for attempted manslaughter as she tossed a knife toward another person). Even the final case is involuntary manslaughter.[/spoiler]

A great problem with the game is the actual gameplay. It used to be that Phoenix Wright games were about deduction and logic(albeit Phoenix Wright moon logic, but logic nonetheless), where you actually had to think about what to do, why, and so on. Here the characters spell everything out before you even get to think about anything. As soon as you press a witness and hear what they say, your side-character will say ""Oh boy, I wonder if THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER YOU MORON, PRESENT IT ALREADY could be the answer?""

All the joy of the gameplay is sucked dry by the bizarre babying of the player in the worst possible way. To make things worse, there's actually a visual novel mode where you don't need to do any gameplay elements to proceed. With such a system in place, you'd expect they'd make the normal gameplay devilishly tricky and fascinating, but no, it's dumb as rocks.

Finally, of note are the three new gameplay mechanics that  have superceded almost all of the old ones. Presenting evidence and pressing witnesses is mostly a sidenote, as you instead do the following:

1) Give the real answers to observations made by one character who has made incorrect theories on the observations. This is an interesting mechanic, and the only humor in the game is found here if you make the wrong theories yourself, but the problem is that it's always blatantly obvious what the real answer is, and there are only 3-5 different answers altogether. Essentially the mechanic is so simple that it's hardly even relevant. If you had to combine 3 different things to create 1 coherent answer then we'd have an actually interesting gameplay element, but it's so easy and basic that it's just plain annoying.

2) Pit jury members against each other. Cute idea, but incredibly formulaic by the second time you're forced to do it(and you usually do it twice each case, wherein the flow of the narrative is always the exact same, which makes it incredibly lame and tedious to go through). Also, extremely simple and you always know within seconds what to do. As with the first, too basic, simple, and easy to be of any value.

3) Multi-witness pressing. By far the worst of the mechanics for one simple reason: You're literally told the answer in THREE separate ways the second it pops up. Whoever thought this was a good idea is, simply put, incompetent. Might as well have the game automatically choose the answer for the player, since you get a) a loud sound byte that says ""THIS IS THE ANSWER"", b) the witness animatedly doing something extreme you can't possibly miss, c) a pop up exclamation mark showing up in the exact specific witness to make sure that even the dumbest person on Earth will instantly know what to do and when. It's incredibly frustrating because if you had only the animation and none of the others, you might have something interesting here, where the player would have to pay attention to the body language of the witnesses to deduce when they're alarmed by a statement. But no, instead the developers decided to toss the mechanic in the garbage bin by essentially making it automatic. Absolutely baffling decision making on their part.",1671145854,1671145854,False,5,3,0.44623565673828125,0,True,False,False

I particularly love the twists this game provides for those of us who are Sherlock Holmes fans.  Without spoiling anything, the game even finds a way to explain the existence of the Holmes stories as they were published in The Strand Magazine (The Randst in the game), and you'll get little sprinklings of Sherlock Holmes lore throughout the games.  Easter eggs for the die hard Holmes fans.

It's two games in one, and each of them easily push past the twenty-hour mark.  You're going to be playing this for a while, but it'll seem like the game is just flying by.  It doesn't drag at all.

Full disclaimer, I think the game is amazing (see my hour count), but perhaps for those who wanted to get some no spoiler cons (assuming you want a comparison to the original Phoenix Wright Trilogy):

- Some of the accents can be difficult to understand in written form (especially if English is a second language). There are important story elements that can be missed if you don't know how to parse a English Cockney, German, Italian, or Irish accent and one character talked like Shakespeare, etc...,
- The game is easier than the Phoenix Wright Trilogy in my opinion during the court portion of the game in terms of deduction.
- Investigating is also more linear and easier than in Phoenix Wright - although it's probably more fun with the addition of deductions (it's also harder to get stuck looking for that last clue)
- The game is somewhat anti-British in its portrayal of some of the colonial English people (but I didn't mind)

That being said, the story just comes together so well in the end, the characters are all so fleshed out and established with complex motivations, and the ending had me shed a tear. I thought the backdrop of the 1900s wouldn't work well but the developers do a good job incorporating into the story (e.g. how to conduct a murder trial without finger print tech). It's also a very long story - 80 hours to finish both games if you play at a normal pace without distractions.

In terms of game mechanics, the new additions to the standard find evidence and present it AA formula are also a good change of pace. This includes jury trials, multiple witness on the stand, examining evidence for new clues.

I've played the original Ace Attorney games in the past, and they've always been amusing. It's nice that we've finally got some overseas stuff here in the west, and they still keep me amused. 
The only critiques I can give are that there are a lot of behaviours and quotes from all of the characters that get extremely repetitive and old fast, and there's so much talking where there are times that I'm like, ""Come on! I wanna progress! Stop talking! I know what I have to do! Enough already!"". 
I was curious as to why it never made it across the border. But as I progress through the the Chronicles series, I can kinda see why and have a few theories: 
1. There are country-based stereotype jokes and elements that can offend some people in this day and age.
2. Depictions of suicide.
3. Blood is present (Knowing Nintendo, they do like to make their stuff family friendly in the west compared to Japan. Yes, I'm aware Nintendo didn't make Ace Attorney. But something like this happened with Sony with another one of Capcom's games where they wanted Lady's and Trish's rears in Devil May Cry V to be censored on their console release).

It's a bit of a slow burn, especially in the first half, and its plot involves high-level political corruption that might be hard to wrap your head around at first, but by the end, it becomes a rollercoaster ride of twists and turns that makes it all worth it.

My only complaint is the soundtrack. It's not bad, and there are a few nice tunes, but the vast majority of it blends together in an unmemorable mess of classical stuff.

This game/games was amazing. The story was phenomenal with each case being an interesting tale with twists at every turn, sometimes you had some cliche parts which fit in quite well and sometimes you had some stuff were you are like ""eh, that could have been done better"", but there was not a single part of this that i would consider bad. Obviously the cases are unrealistic with many many coincidences propelling the story forward but this is a main staple of all detective games as there isn't much to get around that and still have the case be intriguing, but i found it dosn't hinder the story at all and adds to the experience. 

The story follows a case by case story-line each expanding on the tale of Runo (the shortened name of the main character), showing the young lawyer's journey from nothing to greatness with a very intricate subplot that spans both games in the series and ends in an epic 2 part finale. Each of the main characters has a deep personality that has you grow attached no matter how annoying they were to start (looking at you Sholmes) and every case features a cast of wacky sub characters to help spice up the court proceedings. One thing i think people will like is the lack of magical happenings that featured in the Phoenix wright series, as much of that was used to bail-out the player in a end all scenario and its much better written in this game.

 The evidence and cross-examinations i found to be quite well put in without super obvious guidance but some good hints here and there, but sometimes its not clear at all what you need to choose so you just filter through the evidence list until you eventually choose the right thing. One thing that really hinders this game is if you leave a case mid-way; Cases often take 3-4 hours and everything is procedural, so if you stop playing and forget what exactly happened or how a piece of evidence relates to something past you can get stuck reloading till it just happens to be correct. One thing i really enjoyed about the evidence was the ability to view most of it in a 3d space and poke at it for clues and details, sometimes even opening things up or combining 2 pieces of evidence.

The music in the game is fantastic, constantly setting the tone and allowing the player to truly put themselves in the shoes of Runo. My personal favorite theme is Iris's as it perfectly fits her character. One thing that really threw me off however was the occasional voice acting, as I played the game i built up unique voices for each character in my head and every once in a while (like every 2-3 cases) you would get a voice acted segment and while its the characters definitive voice, i feel its sparse use really clashes; The interjections in court however were fine in my opinion (Runo's did feel a little lack-luster at times) and it did add to the characters and the court experience.

Overall i give this game a 10/10 but do be warned about its length, i'm fast reader and it took me ~30-35 hours to finish (though reading fast isn't a big impact because the game limits text speed  when you first read it which i understand its to properly pace and set things up but was annoying)",1667751529,1667751529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I didn't think it was possible to recapture the same quality and magic of Trials and Tribulations, but Shu Takumi is an absolute madman and actually did it. Resolve (or The Great Ace Attorney 2) is the ex-aequo best game in the entire franchise. I believe there are four key factors to this:

[olist]
    [*] They really take advantage of the duology format. TGAA1 (Adventures) is slow to get going because it introduces all the characters and mechanics; it's essentially all setup. Thanks to this, however, TGAA2 is ALL payoff. It's a thrilling ride that doesn't let you go until the very end.

    [*] The new gimmicks (Sholmes Deductions, Jury and Multiple Witnesses) range in quality from fantastic (Deductions) to inoffensive (Jury), but they all have a very important thing in common: they don't ever break immersion. Ace Attorney 4 to 6 are plagued by gimmicks that, especially during trials, completely break the suspension of disbelief. AA world is a wacky one, but in the courtroom, evidence is all. Apollo could detect twitches and involountary movements of the witnesses and it somehow kinda counted as evidence. Athena had the absolutely stupid Mood Matrix, a dubious machine that detected discrepancies in the emotions of the witnesses. It somehow kinda counted as evidence even though the mechanic was a giant ""trust me bro"" every time it appreared. Here, none of that immersion breaking nonsense is present. There's still plenty of nonsense, but good nonsense, not the kind that pulls you out of the story.

    [*] Ace Attorney always suffered (some games more, some games less) from characters and gags that got annoying or obnoxious after a while. Here, it's kept to a minimum. Somehow, even Herlock Sholmes, that initially seems to have the potential to be an incredibly annoying character, turns out to be an unforgettable one.

    [*] The writing is just... SO DAMN GOOD. Takumi was absolutely inspired when he made TGAA. Maya and Trucy were adorable sidekicks, but they were just so annoying in the long run; Susato is not only not obnoxious, but extremely sweet and competent at her job and is by far the best assistant in the series. Sholmes and Iris are just exceptionals companions and their antics never stop being funny. Barok van Zieks is the greatest prosecutor we've ever had alongside good ol' Edgeworth, and his gags hit on the mark every single time. I could go on and on, but these are just some character-related examples.
[/olist]

Overall, it's a must for fans of visual novels and even newcomers to Ace Attorney could potentially fall in love with the series. These two games are just that good and I will miss Ryunosuke and the gang so much.

These are easily two of the best games in the entire franchise. To start with, the characters are all great, whether likable or detestable, with some surprises along the way. The writing is tight and the mysteries fun and engaging, with only a handful of places where I found the logic flawed.

I also found myself amazed at the games' historical accuracy. I have a history degree and an interest in Victorian Britain, and there were some facts included in these games that I actually didn't know. The game's depiction of period-accurate racism is actually very complex and compelling, especially watching certain characters learn to grow beyond it.

One final thing I have to mention is that the music is EXCEPTIONAL. No exaggeration, one of the best video game soundtracks I've ever heard.

In short, a fantastic pair of games that you don't have to have played the rest of the franchise to enjoy, making them a great starting point for new players.

I would prefer more investigative power and less dialogue, it feels like every case follows a formula- the game only gives you certain bits of information and then changes it as it progresses so you are constantly on the back foot. This can be frustrating if you have already figured out the probable causes, leading you to just try and guess what the game wants you to think. Sometimes you know what you want to say but it isn't clear how to present evidence to explain it. As you go through it you will read dialogue, present evidence to dispute something, the statement will change, rinse, repeat. The Jury section was interesting and an enjoyable change, but I want to see more innovation. Previous titles had you checking fingerprints, blood stains, crime scenes etc. 

The characters aren't very likeable, 'Sherlock Holmes' is a moron, you actually feel like an idiot playing the game; making assumptions based on a crime without any analysis of a murder weapon etc. Seems like more of an insult to Holmes than a love letter.

When i first read Shu Takumi would return to direct the next AA games on 3DS i was very excited only to be disappointed later when it turned out to be Japan exclusives. Well, here are the two AA games in one package and man... I'm even more disappointed with these two games than i was with Dual Destinies. These are probably the worst games i've played out of the whole series! 

Both GAA1 and GAA2 are are mostly the same in terms of music, graphics and gameplay so i will be summing down both games in this review. 

The story takes place in the late 1890's and our new protaganist is Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of Phoenix Wright and who also happens to be a law student. Ryunosuke travels to Great Britain to further his studies and meets Herlock Sholmes. I'm glad Capcom USA wasn't able to change the setting to LA again this time, but how is this going to connect with the English localization of the mainline series? I guess it won't, also did we really need yet another family member of Phoenix? This really just undermines his character as some lawyer prodigy but, fan service i guess.

The visuals are really good, probably the best the series has ever looked in HD and in 60fps with some patches. The animations are very smooth and nice to look at. They have definitely improved but they're so repetitive that it gets annoying at how many times we see the characters have the same reactions. There is some partial voice acting but most of the game is just text. The sound effects are mostly the same as older games and the music is nothing worthwile it's mostly generic Japanese and British scores.

The pacing is so slow and boring, you have to read so much before you can move on to the next chapter and the developers were aware since they game added an auto continue mechanic so you won't fall asleep. Deduction is a new gameplay element by explaining the crime scene with logic and reasoning and by contradicting our new idiot detective, Herlock Sholmes. This guy is incredibly annoying, he ruins the tension of the case just by being goofy all the time like why does everything needs overly comedic these days? I usually stop caring about finding out the culprit as soon as Sholmes starts hiding and dancing around the crime scene. 

The long awaited multiple witnesses and jury gameplay mechanic hinted in Apollo Justice has finally made it into the series and it sucks HARDDDD... The whole point of a court trial is to convince the judge, or in this game's case, six jurys, that your client is innocent. You would think that the jury would need to be convinced in real time as in unscripted gameplay, you're supposed to show the right evidence at the right time to make your case more convincing or make mistakes and the jury will doubt your defendant for guilty. If more jurys believe your arguments the higher chance of you winning, if less then you lose... But if it's noting like this, then what would be the point of having more judges if the gameplay is practically the same as having one judge? 

Well, that's exactly what it is, the f**king same as previous games... It doesn't matter how many mistakes you make the whole trial stays scripted and you have to convince all jury for you to win so there is no real tension nor difference with just one judge or one hundred judges... Like what is the point of this new mechanic just to show more relevant characters in court? This was supposed to appear in Dual Destinies until Takumi decided not to direct that game because Capcom screwed up his vision with Apollo Justice. I'm sad to say DD turned out to be the better game than both Great Ace Attorney.

In conclusion, this franchise is over, Shu Takumi had a great run with the original trilogy and Apollo and i'm sure the franchise would've stayed strong had Takumi not left the series to the B team of Capcom. (which did a great job with Investigations 1&2 and AA6) Sure, Ace Attorney 7 will come along and sell a couple of units and the series will be dead again for a while but i won't be there to support this crap anymore.",1665261704,1665262881,False,2,0,0.438405781984329224,0,True,False,False

For one thing, the trials are far too easy, with the answer almost always being to press everything, and then present on the one new statement unlocked, often with a piece of evidence unlocked or changed right then and there (especially since you begin trials with so little evidence). Furthermore, there is something of a paucity of witnesses, and certainly of memorable ones, and there are no dramatic transformations of the culprit at the end of cases. I actually believe that both of these issues stem from a larger structural one: forcing the square peg of Holmsian ""locked door"" mysteries into the round hole of Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney thrives on its cast of colorful witnesses, and having enough evidence that you have to actually think which one applies to the given situation. ""Locked room"" type mysteries generally have few witnesses and little evidence, allowing for (S)holmes to show off how smart he is in picking up on little clues that others miss. Therefore, this combination does not work, and I simply cannot understand why people were so desperate to see this brought to the West.",1664829426,1664829426,False,1,2,0.497754216194152832,0,True,False,False

Mechanically it is very similar to the earlier AA games with a few differences. There is far less investigation tedium I find, most of the time you are looking at obvious clues at scenes and talking to witnesses, very rarely you have to present a specific piece of evidence to move the story on (although it does happen).
In the courtroom, there are a few additional mechanics to spice things up, but nothing major - you still have to press statements and present contradicting evidence most of the time. Which is perfectly fine.

What is truly outstanding in this game in my opinion is the music. While the amount of tracks might not be that high in the end, all of them are very memorable and fitting to the scene, and they are all great.

If any fan of the AA games has not tried this one, I strongly recommend it!
