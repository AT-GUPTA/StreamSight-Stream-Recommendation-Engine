[u][h1]GTFO's Lackluster Content[/h1][/u]
As both a player who's been here for years and who has dealt with the team behind the game; they don't care. The game is being abandoned and now that Rundown 8.0 is out, the game is finally on its final moments of life support. We as players were keenly aware of the development of GTFO having a slowdown or complete stop with the release of the ALT:// Rundowns, and had a grim look at the future of the game. The game as it stands is honestly not what you would expect to be the experience that they advertise. The game offers little reward, much of that reward being copies (there are legit SO MANY mask copies and I FUCKING CALLED IT! R8 of course just had to make the halloween mask duplicate), and if you like numbers on your screen from completions, that's all you really got besides the ""apparel"". Their remakes of ALT rundowns are not good, The rundowns have been met with constant issues. ALT R4 for example had an issue with OG players specifically where if they played any expedition they would not be granted any apparel (the only reward in the game). To reverse the lost apparel for those players they enacted a reset request of R4 progress for players to get the apparel back. I sit missing 2 pieces of apparel because, honestly, fuck the reset request. To talk about the matchmaking system for the game, you are essentially required to utilize discord because people have abandoned matchmaking as it was always very poor. Don't have discord? Tough shit. Let's talk about tencent a little bit, shall we? Let's see if this review gets the badger treatment. Tencent acquired a majority stake in 10 Chambers, source can be found [url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-buys-a-stake-in-yet-another-game-developer/1100-6482867/]here[/url]. This proves to be a problem if you've ever seen anything made by them or how they like to do things. I won't get into the details, but their majority stake in 10CC has left a bad mark for this game as a whole. 

[u][h1]Community Purity and Older Rundowns[/h1][/u]
The GTFO community faced an extremely sickening display of seizing control by the team, more specifically user 'D0CR3D' of the community management team, sending EULA threats to users such as Rayalot of the community for aiding in spreading modded content back in the early stages of the game around Rundown 2 and 3. The attempts by the moderation team and Doc included infiltrating the communities of modding that were propogating and getting users to 'turn in' their friends that started it. As of now, these actions are no longer permitted in the community and 10CC has fallen back on modding slightly to avoid further backlash. Regardless, there is still evident control over the communities of GTFO such as the unofficial modding discord which, as their rules explicitly state, you cannot play older rundowns within the server. They also made a clear choice to utilize code copiler IL2CPP rather than Mono to make it harder for modders as they have less access to the source code. The fact these events even happened is a shocking and really shitty display of their care about their players. If anything, players should not support a team which makes content both lacking in quality and make the environments and gameplay a worse experience overall. The general player will not be seeking this out or know about this information easily unless they've been here for a long time, so it's helpful they are made aware. To fight their whole dumb issue with older rundowns, I have made a guide that specifically takes you through the steps of downloading them for yourself. As a player, you have access to the public builds of the game and, thus, the older rundowns. Here is the guide:

[u][h1]Bugs[/h1][/u]

GTFO had been in its Early Access state from Rundown 1 to Rundown 5, releasing its 1.0 full version during Rundown 6. You can really compare GTFO to cyberpunk in the fact that they had rushed a product to a full release despite it being unprepared to handle the expectations that come with it. Many bugs have existed since EA, fair for a game that is still in its stage of growth, however 10 Chambers has a continuous history of just not fixing them or fixing them in such a way they make the issue even worse or spread to other things instead. For instance, they 'fixed' the DMR reload issue where only 99% of the bullets were reloaded into the magazine, however, many other guns still had presented this issue. For a long time we had mods that fixed this issue and many others since the developers were so lax at fixing them. For a game to have life support via mods to fix its concurrent issues and new ones while they sit idly by is just a display of a middle finger to the face. As much as GTFO could have been, it really fell off the train of hype many players were hoping it would go, even me. Many of the modded community is dying and the people who try to tolerate the game still are getting fed up of the game just as much as 10 Chambers because the love for the game has faded. Even pirating this game is not worth your time and energy. In summary, do NOT get this game either you OR your friends as it might contain a lot of content by the end, but it will be made by a team that wanted to make a cash grab to get it out of its sight after only a year out as a ""Full release"" ""game"". Another one in the books for a waste of resources.

[u][h1]TL;DR: GTFO Good?[/h1][/u]
-_- No. If you buy, get a refund ASAP. Get a game where the team behind it cares about their players and their game enough.

Its difficulty is artificial, the stealth aspect isn't tense at all - it's boring.
The gunplay is to be commended but at the same time, the way you shoot leaves you open to be immensely inaccurate.

The developers have this weird relationship with the game where they are constantly working on new levels, but seemingly haven't really done anything to take the experience to the next level.

Here's your gameplay loop:
Go to point A. 
You cannot enter point A without getting Key A1 from point B. 
Get Key A1 in point B. 
You cannot get to point B without getting Key A2 from point C.
Get Key A2 from point C. 
Now go to point B to get Key A1
Now go to point A
Now ex-filtrate.

There must be ways to make this more exciting right? I've played a few rundowns here and there and I cannot see any change or difference.
I'll be playing more and updating this if my mind changes, but I also feel like I'm going to burn out before that point comes.

A great pro is that there's a somewhat active discord, but the people on there are very hit or miss.",1708793024,1708793024,False,3,0,0.478394001722335815,0,True,False,False

Managing resources and determining which rooms you need to clear is the crux of solo play. As a result, missions are decently replayable since the methodical approach to clearing rooms depends heavily on randomized resources enemy spawns and your melee skill. The bots aren’t great, but they don’t actively get in the way like many other coop shooters. You can clear most missions easily with bots, though they seem to struggle with heavy gun-play and you obviously can’t split up for separate objectives. Honestly, my main complaint is that the game doesn’t seem to let you play solo without an internet connection. 

Bugs:
- The game can fail to launch or make lobbies sometimes, I haven't identified if this is an issue with the game itself, network or proton layer stuff yet.
- Enemy animations can go a bit goofy.
- Some maps have environment clipping.
- Resource boxes can spawn in inaccessible places.
- Occasionally the entire environment can get culled out for a second when going through doors, which is a bit weird and jarring.
- Bots often stand outside the warden exit scans.
- Bots can phase through gooed & closed doors, which can ruin a run if it happens right before a full-team scan event.
- I’ve had the game crash twice after completing a mission, but I didn’t lose any progress or artifacts. 

Clunk:
- Some tools like glowsticks require a left-click charge to throw, these inputs don't seem to get buffered and can be lost when swapping between weapons/tools.
- The hacking tool can fail to unlock doors if you swap away from it after the last hacking input.
- Commanding bots through the 'q' menu is generally too slow to use mid-combat, but I don't think there's a good fix for this, as even a gesture wheel could be awkward.

Assuming 10 Chambers doesn’t abandon this game, and you’re okay with methodical stealth into excellent gun-play, this game is great!",1708747412,1708747412,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would recommend this game to everyone that like cooperative shooting game. I like the horror atmosphere, it's spooky. Plus, there is no microtransaction at all! Thanks dev!

But beware, this game is not for everyone because of the game difficulty. It's not just hard, this game was really hard. And what I mean by really hard is you going to die and restart for a LOT of time. There's almost no checkpoint system! So if all your team die in a 1 hour more playthrough, you need to restart from beginning (this game actually have checkpoint system, but it was very RARE. I play for 20 hour and only found one checkpoint in the first mission lol. So let's just pretend there isn't any checkpoint system). Luckily in exchange for the high level of difficulty, there is no time limit to help downed teammate. So you can always help your downed teammate without having to worry that they will die.

This game really emphasizes cooperation. You cannot solo this game. GTFO have bot, but we can't rely on them for most of the time. So it will be better if you have one or two friend, then fill the free slot with bot. There's a matchmake system to find or joining random people, but you need to wait for a while to find a free room (most of the player in this game find a teammate from discord server. I don't use discord so its quite hard to find other players). So, if you have friend that like to play games like this, maybe you could ask them to play this game together first.

There's a lot weapon and tools that you can use in this game. In other games, usually we have favorite weapon or tools and always use it in every match. Its not recommended to do that in this game. You gonna need different weapons and tools to finish different mission. Sometimes you need to fail first to know what weapon is best for the mission. Just try some weapon until you know what is best for you.

Also, the tutorial in this game was really shallow. Lot of mechanics that didn't get explained at the tutorial. So I highly recommend to see some beginners guide first at YouTube to understand more the basic things.

Last thing: This game often got 44% discount at big sale event. So if you want to try this game, you can wait until this game have big discount again.

Set in a dystopian underground complex overrun by terrifying creatures, this game plunges players into a desperate fight for survival that will test their teamwork, communication, and nerves of steel.

One of the defining features of GTFO is its relentless difficulty. Every mission is a brutal gauntlet of danger and tension, where one wrong move can spell disaster for you and your team. From hordes of relentless enemies to complex puzzles and traps, there's never a dull moment in GTFO. Success requires careful planning, coordination, and precise execution, making victory all the sweeter when you finally emerge triumphant.

Despite its punishing difficulty, GTFO is incredibly rewarding to play. The sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds with your teammates is unmatched, creating moments of pure adrenaline-fueled excitement that will keep you coming back for more.

However, it's worth noting that GTFO is not a game for the faint of heart. Sessions can last for hours at a time, and the steep learning curve means that progress may come slowly at first. Patience and perseverance are essential virtues for surviving in the unforgiving world of GTFO, but for those willing to rise to the challenge, the rewards are well worth the effort.

Visually, GTFO is a masterclass in atmospheric design. The dark and foreboding corridors of the complex are filled with eerie lighting and haunting sound design, creating an atmosphere of constant dread and tension. The creatures that lurk in the shadows are grotesque and terrifying, adding to the sense of unease and danger that permeates every moment of gameplay.

In conclusion, GTFO is a must-play for fans of challenging co-op experiences. Its relentless difficulty, thrilling gameplay, and atmospheric world design come together to create an experience that is as terrifying as it is exhilarating. Whether you're facing down waves of enemies or unraveling the mysteries of the complex, GTFO is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.",1708377867,1708377867,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. The gun mechanics offer a satisfying experience, with a commendable level of realism in handling firearms. However, players are advised to ration their ammunition judiciously for set-piece confrontations, rather than indulging in frivolous shooting with the game's array of conventional weaponry imbued with futuristic elements.
2. Diversifying the gameplay are a variety of gadgets and deployable assets, reminiscent of iconic features seen in classics like Aliens. These additions not only add flair but also provide strategic depth and invaluable assistance during gameplay.
3. Immersion is further heightened by the game's stellar sound design, particularly notable in the atmospheric corridors where players are enveloped in an unsettling symphony of eerie cries and ominous noises emanating from lurking adversaries.

Weaknesses:

1. Despite the inclusion of AI companions, the true essence of enjoyment lies in coordinating with a well-organized team utilizing communication tools. Given the game's multiplayer focus, solo play may lack the same level of satisfaction.
2. The core gameplay loop risks monotony, particularly evident when players find themselves navigating levels with scarce resources due to unfavorable circumstances. This repetitive nature can detract from the overall experience.
3. While customization options are available, they remain limited in scope and would benefit from further refinement and expansion to provide players with more meaningful choices.",1656363583,1708373902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game mechanics is really cool but the problem is there is no save system and you have to be ready to play a few hours straight to beat the single mission. If you have to leave, you have electricity or internet cut off, the game crashes and you realizes you just completely wasted a few hours, you will not get any reward for that.

Moreover, these guys did not manage to develop an Alt-Tab support. Any time you Alt-Tab or press Windows key or receive some popup the game crashes. I mean this is something everybody managed to handle like 20 years ago. Also, the game heavily influences your background applications so they are starting freezing and lagging, especially Chrome.

I am writing this review because I was playing a mission for like 2 hours and then (5 minutes ago) the game crashed because one of my Chrome extension crashed and showed a popup which never happened before. And I lose all the progress. It happened to me a few times. I tried, I really tried but this is game is just a piece of crap.

Definitivamente no es uno que se pueda jugar solo, al menos no despues de los primeros niveles. (Habrá quienes sean profesionales en el asunto y si, pero realmente esta categoria de dificultad el del rollo trabajo en equipo, colaborativo y de mucha coordinacion. 
Las gráficas se pueden casi como palpar, el juego te sumerge en la realidad de su mundo muy rápido. La ambientacion, la iluminacion, los sonidos, todo muy bien logrado.
Es ademas un juego con una curva de aprendizaje alta a mi parecer. De mucho ensayo y error, de frustraciones y tal.

If you are worried that you don't have friends that want to play with you, fear not.  The GTFO Discord server is so dedicated (77k users) that it is easier to join or host a lobby and group up with others there than the actual in-game matchmaking.
With this in mind, the player base is also older and more mature which is an added bonus.

I've played the first two runs and it's fun with friends, but the lack of any progression mechanics like upgrades or gear makes losing a run (which are pretty long, by the way) feel like a huge waste of time and effort. 

If you complete a run you might unlock a shirt or something, plus maybe some very scarce and sometimes useless single-use buffs.

""Just installed it on my OLED 512 GB Deck. Game loaded fine, but starting R4A3 crashed the Deck (display went black, had to hard turn off).
On the 2nd start I changed only texture quality to half, started R4A3 again and it loaded fine. No idea if texture quality is related though. Standard control settings with gyro are new to me, but the game does work. Using recommended Proton version, which is 8.05.
I have clocked over 800 hrs in the game, 99% on Linux desktop. And looks like (despite the initial crash on cage drop) it works well on Deck too.
You could try to delete the game, that should clear the Proton Prefix and the shader cache. Maybe that helps?
Otherwise the game seens to work though. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce your issue on my Deck(s).""

Positive points :

- The strongest point of the game is definitely the atmosphere. The music, the feeling of vulnerability through the scarcity of the resources, the stress of putting commands in the terminal in time... just wow. 
- Every mission is a investigation as you don't know exactly where to go and you have to figure it out by looking for information mainly in terminals through commands (Lethal company stole this idea 100% and it's much better in this game as you can have access to lore or special commands depending which terminal you are on). 
- The gameplay feels great as it is refreshing to see a coop-game with stealth mechanics that are enjoyable, the fighting is pleasant too and the weapon gamefeel is great. What I enjoyed is also that the game encourages a lot teamwork in order to survive (sharing resources, terminal mechanics) which leads to qualitative communication between players. 
- Community : when we started the game with my friend, we got onboarded by two gentle souls that really helped us to get the game basics, so as far as I know, there are few players, but they are really nice!
- You also have access to the whole gear from the beginning of the game which is really welcomed. (the only things that you unlock are skins. So better get to work for this sweat gaz mask that won't change anything to your game experience beside jokes in the lobby).

Improvement side: 

- the weapons would need some more balancing as there is clearly some weapons are completely useless and some others that have no real weaknesses.  
- Some mechanics of the game are also frustrating, the infection system (maybe we haven’t figure out how to deal with it yet) and the fact that some missions are going smoothy until the last zone where you get an insanely challenging wave of enemies where you get swarmed Sarah Kerrigan style. 

Conclusion: great challenging horror game, especially with friends.",1707559018,1707559428,True,2,0,0.500884413719177246,0,True,False,False

Edit: if you do really want to try it solo then expect the bots to just phase through solid doors, walk to the start of level, realise there's no path to you, then become statue. Why is this? because they are incapable of opening doors or doing anything besides just being a useless walking turret.

Once they scaled the difficulty and 4 players were required, I dropped the game as I had nobody to play with, and the idea of matchmaking with random people did not appeal to my anxious ass.

I still read the changelogs and news, watched a few videos, but never got back into it — something that I now kind of regret. I believe it's time for me to inject and get sent down there once again.

Initially I really enjoyed the game, it was really unique and had a huge learning curve from any other games I normally play.
Though the problem I had was that I got burnt out too quickly on this game. 

There is such a lack of variety with the enemies that you encounter that it begins to slowly feel more repetitive to me. It no longer becomes a task of being too hard, but just how much time and tedious effort I need to go through to accomplish a mission. When playing initially as well, the maps were generally stagnant and not too different from each other, but thankfully doesn't stay that way with different extraction points.

[b][u]Backstory[/u][/b]
Got this game since the first week of early access to play with my brother, but the game was never balanced around 2 players and didn't really explain mechanics well. 

So we just waited and came back to it at rundown 4, much more bearable in duo but still felt odd, he didn't like it so i got left alone and tried matchmaking, it didn't go well so discord was my only option. 

There I learned how to play and meet some folks that i talk to this day, this game has an amazing community but it spread out away from the official gtfo discord for the most part.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
I'm not gonna explain game mechanics since we already made a quite lengthy guide about most aspects of the game go check it out. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2359433203
[b][u]Main issues[/u][/b]
Developers were ignoring most of the annoying bugs or didn't bother to fix them since rundown 1, not to mention a plethora of new ones every rundown.

Almost half of the weapons are a weaker version of already existing ones, are extremely gimmicky, or are unnecessarily hard to use. For example, you have 5 SMG-type weapons in the game, all of them are a little bit different from the others but there is one that is objectively better stat-wise than the rest. So out of 18 primary weapons you will be using like 7 or so.

After finishing any level once you will be able to plow through it with ease, map layouts stay the same and so do the objectives.

After the ""release"" when they announced that they were leaving early access and increased the price, the game became much less stable with every consecutive rundown after that point, no matter how good your pc is or what settings you play on everyone gets frame drops at certain parts of levels.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]
The game runs like shit, it's full of bugs, it's hard to get into, and sometimes just decides to waste your time cause of the combination of those two issues.

[b][u]Not worth buying right now, not for this price and in this state.[/u][/b]",1644692419,1706109495,False,4,0,0.566172301769256592,0,True,False,False

Imagine, if you will, spending several grueling hours on a mission. Communicating with your team, busting your a** to play as perfectly as possible, looting every room to give yourself just a bit more of a chance. And despite some terrifying f***ups, you all manage to push through to the finale of the mission. Knowing how bad it's about to get, you run back through all your previously cleared rooms to pick up anything you may have missed that may help you.

And then the audio cuts out. Lag spikes begin happening to unplayable levels. The game begins unraveling at the seams around you.

Your friend, who's hosting, begins madly trying any possible fix he can think of because the devs made the GENIUS decision to not have ANY checkpoints in missions. So if s*** falls apart for the host that's f***ing it, 3+ hours of effort GONE. All of you stay in the call as every possible solution he attempts fails.

And then, as he's doing this, your other friend gets curious. He looks up the specific things that are happening to you all and he finds something. Turns out, it's NOT the fault of your host friend's internet or PC at all.

It's the GAME'S fault.

See, your friend informs you that others have had the exact same issues that you all had, under the exact same circumstances. Others have had their MULTI-HOUR runs completely destroyed due to no fault of their own.

And then your friend tells you that, not only has this been a known issue for AT LEAST A YEAR, but that THIS ISN'T EVEN THE ONLY LEVEL THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM.

And just like that, your drive to play the game anymore f***ing dies. Because who the f*** wants to spend 3+ hours on a mission only to have it all thrown in the trash due to some bull**** bug? 

I actually quite enjoy this game most of the time, despite the BRUTAL difficulty. I can spend hours upon hours wiping on a mission with my friends and still want to keep trying, even as salty as it makes me. Because, at the end of the day, even if we have a devastating loss right at the end it was still OUR FAULT. We f***ed up a play, ran out of resources, underestimated how bad a room might be. Oh well, s*** sucks but we'll learn from it. 

Losing a great run right at the end due to bugs? That I am NOT okay with. Because that ISN'T our fault and the fact that some of these game breaking bugs remain unfixed YEARS later is genuinely f***ing inexcusable. This is a $40 game that has been in development since 2017 and you're telling me that bugs that have been around for YEARS, that can easily end your multi-hour runs, still haven't been fixed?

The game is challenging and heavily relies on teamwork for success, and the game is also primarily stealth based so don't go into it looking to shoot up the place, there is mandatory loud sections but outside of those specific situations you never want to intentionally go loud

There is also an interesting story if you find all the logs in the terminals, and in later Rundowns you even have actual character dialogue throughout the missions. You do kinda have to piece together the narrative based on the logs but it is pretty interesting once you connect it all together (you can also just watch lore videos on YouTube who will piece together all the intel for you into a proper timeline)

There is also bots to fill in for missing players on the team, however the bots do kinda suck so unfortunately you do have to actually rely on having human teammates if you want to be successful in most levels, don't expect to be able to just solo the entire game. You can command the bots to do stuff so they are slightly more advanced than the ones previously seen in Payday but they are still pretty primitive and stupid at the same time. Game is pretty much unplayable unless you are lucky enough to have friends to group up with

The bots will waste resources by stealing any ammo bags, tool refills, or medkits they find while looting and will use those things on random players when they don't really need them or they will just use them on themself, and bots cannot be commanded to sync up stealth kills so in stealth sections bots will either just sit around doing nothing or begin to waste ammo by opening fire with their guns if one enemy becomes aggro on a player. And also unlike Payday, the bots in GTFO do function exactly like players in the fact that they will eventually at times require resources since they have the same limited ammo and limited health as players do",1705890489,1705890489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's in a niche, and it works to be the best game it can be within it, and I think it's a damn good time. It borders on ""you must hate yourself"" difficulty in the later stages of most of the rundowns, but the atmosphere, tension, and feel of the moment to moment gameplay, especially when coordinating with friends, is just superb, and scratches a certain kind of itch.

I only have two nitpicks;

1) Look, I don't care how [b]hArDcOrE[/b] the game is, bots shouldn't cause friendly fire damage. No game has it work like that, and for good reason. I shouldn't be punished just because the AI decided shooting through me to get to a shooter I was taking care of with a bat was the winning idea. I have other criticisms of the bots, like wishing you could have them hold a position, etc, but honestly just turning their friendly fire off will shut me up, it's really the only thing I care about.

2) PleAASE let us leave permanent marks on the map that we can manually clear if we want to, like PAYDAY 2's preplanning. My short-term memory is ass, so being able to plan routes, and marking items we can't carry now but might want to double back with later, etc... it just seems like such a slam dunk for the tactical gameplay this already pushes, I'm not sure why it's not an inclusion.

Combat is hard but satisfying with greatly designed weapons followed by the satisfying pops of the enemy melting from gunfire or getting squashed with a sledgehammer. But you are just a person who's been thrown in a pit with monsters not a trained soldier and its apparent.

Thinking under pressure, resource management and situational awareness become important often and most of your decisions come with consequences that could even end a run after 2+ hours of hard work. 

If you decide you hate yourself enough to try and complete every map, you'll be challenged in many different ways. Different combinations of error alarms, enemy types, surge alarms, infectious fog etc force you to play differently from map to map and adds to the pressure of not letting your team down if you are seeing something for the first time. 

As you progress, you will go through skill spikes that can lead to spending days excruciatingly trying to complete a single level, forcing you to get better and better until you can complete it. Then, you'll return to a level you previously thought was insane and it will be a breeze because of how far you've come. It's really dramatic how much room for improvement there is despite the simplicity of 2 guns, 1 tool and a melee weapon.

The final rundown has a great narrative to it and really brought all the lore to a satisfying conclusion. Plus, the final level R8E2 really puts everything you've learned to the test and completing it gives you the kind of satisfaction that few games offer. Namely, because of the journey to get there (many hundreds of hours most likely). The feeling is akin to beating a dark souls game or something similar that's meant to make you choose between trying for the 20th time or smashing your keyboard. You'll keep trying until you MASTER the level and finally succeed, except the biggest difference between this and other games is that you're relying on three other players to have the same level of skill and motivation as you. 

The community is mostly great and very helpful, especially with new players (unless you drop into a level that's way beyond your skill set, so try to do them in order). Sometimes you find regulars to play with, and you'll always remember the people you complete your first E-tier levels with. This game is no easy task, and it is a journey if you go for 100% completion so be prepared to get invested. Also if you vibe with someone, ADD THEM. Finding someone reliable to team with reduces the frustration of bad pick-up groups substantially.

Last piece of advice, please tell any pros you meet that you're good because you have [less than 500] hours in game, or because you've played CoD before because that makes us laugh and we enjoy it as we carry you.

Otherwise It is quite frustrating to play in 2023, as it is heavily dependent on the teammates and matchmaking doesn't work anymore (you have to matchmake through discord server, which is not hard, but still frustrating a bit), bots are there, but unless you are very good, bots will not carry you far.

In short, all the positive moments about this game are contradicted by negative ones:
+ The game has intriguing lore
- But it is hidden behind logs on the terminals, which you will not be able to read at your leasure as public matchmaking requires you to act, not sit with logs and terminals

+ The game has challenging resource-dependent gameplay
- But it does not feel balanced. You can play cautiously and slowly for the whole session, have a stable surplus of resources, make one mistake with one monster at the final objective - waste ammo and as a result loose nearly a two-hour game at the final extraction point (which may take like a minute) because several team members ran out of ammo

+Ok, sometimes challenge is good - it makes you cherish the spoils of the session and crave for a rematch
- But there are no real rewards for the match*
*(no rewards other than cosmetics, which you cannot really enjoy - all characters looks +/- the same, no matter the cosmetics)
- No fun replayability (replaying the sessions feels exactly the same as playing before)
- The sessions are just too damn long due to stealth mechanic to feel the urge for a replay if you lost.

+ The combat is impactfull and brutal, monsters have many points of dismemberment
- The monsters are clunky and chaotic in their movement and not in a good way
- Due to how challenge in a game is organized - there are a lot of times great combat feels like a big disappointment when you discover you wasted just too much ammo. And there may just be no way to correct you mistakes long into a match - as addtl. ammo / resources my be locked behind optional alarm doors, with a 50-70% chance to waste more ammo then is actually behind the door

And list goes on and on.

In short - I felt very compelled to play this game and each time I played it I was either somewhat underwhelmed by success or angered and frustrated at the loss.
If you are a casual gamer or even a gamer with a slight dip to hardcore like me, but with no exact team of friends I would strongly advise you against buying this game in 2024",1705251085,1705253948,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Playing with less than 4 people is another story. Bots are basically housecats. They will run through doors you are trying to close, frequently will not fetch items, will wander away from bioscans, will get stuck in the environment, and will listen to commands maybe 60% of the time.

There is no actual difficulty option. And, for the game-play itself, it involves getting your load-out set up—you press go, you're given an objective, and you do it. There are a decent amount of enemies, a lot of which are just re-skinned versions of a previous type of enemy, with very few unique enemies.

Counting non-re-skinned enemies, there are only 14 enemies.

Counting all the enemies, there are around 23 enemies, and I'm unsure if the developers are going to add more.

The atmosphere is horror-based, and if anything, this game hits the nail on the head for that feeling of horror. The sound design is great, and the music is forgettable, as I don't even remember if they have music in the game.

To give an honest review score, the game itself is a solid 7/10. The game is good, but the investment is high, like needing at least three people to play at the same time.

You. Need. Friends. To. Play.

GTFO takes alot of patience and time, each level is roughly an hour or two. The games entirely about stealth and progression is slow but the satisfaction of clearing a level is probably one of the most rewarding. GTFO forces cooperation or you and your team just wont be able to clear rooms. The main focus of this game is stealth not the gunplay even though you'll end up carrying two all the time. Each level is refreshing with new enemies, differing objectives and maps, this also means no one loadout is good for all maps. Alerting a room of sleepers or touching a squilliam tentacle is probably the most gut wrenching feelings one can experience, You get only seconds to ready your defences and are thrown into gunplay.

Although I haven't played GTFO for long this is definitely a fun game to pick up with a few friends and play all weekend.

This game is awesome.

EDIT: Edited for muh steam 2022 awards task thing

This game is still awesome and they are even bringing back old rundowns, tho retrofitted to the current version of the games mechanics and balance which may upset some people (the games a bit easier since the original releases of the early rundowns)

EDIT2: Running true solo is a nightmare but fun.  The modding community is pretty cool too.

EDIT3 - FINAL EDITION: With the game “”finished”” now, I’d still like to say that I still love this game a lot and have had so much fun going through it.  It really was made for me, co-op horde shooter with resource management/survival horror aspects.  A truly niche game.

[b]However:[/b]

10cc have to be one of the laziest fucking developers ever.  Obviously they rate above AI tards and asset flipping fucks, but as an actual game developer, they seem content with only doing the extremely bare minimum as time went on during this games development.  Bug fixes are few and far between with the game still suffering from ancient bugs and constantly reintroducing older ones.

It feels like development truly ended at rundown 7.  The passion they once had, gone.  That’s probably when Den of Wolves was in full swing.  They left it to a skeleton crew of interns to bring back the older rundowns and then spent “”””two years”””” making rundown 8.  Not to mention the absolute joke that is their bug hunters.  No doubt just a close group of 10cc sycophants who don’t know the first thing about QA testing. 

I haven’t even mentioned their past treatment of the modding community, they are better now but that doesn’t excuse what went on years ago.

I’ve had my fun.  This game was awesome.  But it could have been so much more.  So much potential squandered.  Rather than commit to developing GTFO, Instead they’d rather make another fucking heist game.  SAD!  I’m hesitant to continue supporting them after their lackluster treatment of gtfo.  We’ll just have to see.

Anyway.  Game is still fun.  Make to sure have atleast 2 other friends if you’re starting off.  I’ve never once used matchmaking but apparently it sucks big time.",1619899375,1704777042,True,1,0,0.49171796441078186,0,True,False,False

GTFO for me if I were to describe it to someone new is that is it truly the Dark Souls of co-op shooters. A high difficulty that continues to get tougher demands ever increasing teamwork efficiency, where a failure or lack of communication can result in an entire mission going into the bin, and everyone returning to the menu. Resources are scarce, levels are long, and stealth without alerting a horde is crucial to survival.
Failing to prepare before a scan or alarm, even if a room gets awakened can overrun you and your team easily if not experienced and alert.

Though difficult this game has a lot of great points and a very satisfying finish whenever you finally extract out of a lengthy mission or one that had resulted in multiple wipes. But as great as this game is, it has flaws.

Very big flaws.

As a whole, the game sometimes breaks. There are bugs, glitches, and crashes depending on your system. Players can desync, despawn, or become entirely invisible to you. Matchmaking in public queue can be a gamble, players range from skilled to new, and some just cannot mesh well with the rest of the team.
A whole entire discord server for specific matchmaking was created which is a far better alternative, but unneeded if the game had mildly more functional public abilities; However, this doesn't make it unplayable, just frustrating at rare occurrences.

Besides that, this game will continually push you out of your comfort zone. It will keep throwing seemingly impossible odds at you and your team as you discover new places, new rundowns, new secrets, and most crucially; New enemies to face.

The tutorial doesn't hardly give you much of any context, nor does the weapon descriptions. If you're new and reading this, I highly suggest giving this a go if you are patient and methodical about your playing. If you want to speedrun and solo, then no. Even if you had seen people on youtube solo levels, it isn't anywhere as easy as they show it to be. You will die. You will fail. But you will learn over time and practice. I recommend reading some guides on steam such as true weapon stats and beginner tutorials before playing.

In my near 100 hours I haven't met a player who was down-outright hostile to me for being new, rather they helped me out quite a lot whenever I didn't know what to do. Just be polite, ping your resources, ask questions, and always say to others before starting scans to prepare.

If you work together, you survive. Otherwise you'll end up gtfo'ing right back to the beginning again.

Years later, and it's still the same old same old. Boring, simplistic gameplay of sneak and wave defense in samey looking halls.

- Awesome concepts! Love the themes and gameplay
- Multiplayer issues I had were basically the same 2 or 3 issues everyone else has already listed
- Great game if you have a consistent group to vc with
- Terrible game for singleplayer. Too hard alone and AI system just isn't there yet* 

*Not expecting the devs to cater to a singleplayer experience, the game is clearly not advertised to be that way. Just to me seems to limit the types of users and longevity of the game

[u] Longer Review: [/u]
Really loved the concept and theme. Had a blast when I could get a whole team on discord! Really only played it with my siblings and old college buddies and had an amazing experience! Super fun gameplay!

Sadly, I'm 24 and my life/responsibilities leave me super busy with very little time for video games. Which is a problem for this game since:
[olist]
    [*] I do not have the time to sit around waiting for players in a lobby (where I have never been able to join another session or seen anyone join mine)
    [*] My friends' and family's schedules are busy too so that isn't consistent enough to play 
    [*] I often do not have the social energy to search for teams on the devs' discord server
[/olist]

Honestly, if the devs came out with a sequel game or something similar that had a valid singleplayer option or better AI mechanics, then I would buy it in a heartbeat. For now though, it's just not for me.

If you're reading this, do not have these issues, and like the game concepts, then you should def give it a try. It's awesome when you can get a proper session going!",1704155677,1704155677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite numerous stumbles, hordes of bugs, and questionable design decisions over the years, the game manages to stick its landing. Thanks for the wonderful memories :')

Now that all previous content has been ""remastered"" and re-released in one complete package, there really is no better time to jump in.

That's it. Good luck! You're going to need it ;)

___________________________________

[b]Incredible. I've been following GTFO since its announcement and so far, it's been worth every second of the wait.[/b]

Essentially, GTFO is a stealth game in which a team of four gets sent into labyrinths of differing depths to complete objectives then escape. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. I'm not going to detail the game mechanics as they make more sense when seen than read, but trust me on this: the game is damn hard. In my opinion, this is the real draw of GTFO- its hellish difficulty and team play. 

GTFO necessitates a level of team coordination that is rarely seen in games, let alone in the survival horror niche. One mistake can, and very likely will, cost you the entire match. There is no hand-holding or forgiveness. Needless to say, do NOT buy this game expecting a run-and-gun or something you can breeze through mindlessly. Communication and coordination are of the essence, and if you don't have a mic (or the willingness to cooperate/take orders if that is the case), then you're going to have a terrible time. You AND your poor teammates that is, because [b]every misstep or selfish action you take will snowball into something larger that can break the entire team.[/b]


[b]But enough about that! Here is a down-'n-dirty of how to have a good time:[/b]

1) Use Discord. The GTFO channel is currently the best way to match with people who speak your language and is in your region. As mentioned above, even if you don't have a mic you can still either match with others without mics (though I'm not sure how well that'll go), or simply agree to cooperate with or listen to people that do have mics.

2) Coordinate loadouts before starting a match! No team needs three snipers or three bio-trackers. Talk with your team. In my experience (playing Alpha, Beta, and EA), you at least want one sniper for scouts and two sentries for hordes. The other stuff is up to team preference.

3) [b]LISTEN to your teammates.[/b] Understand what they're saying. [b]Simply hearing is not enough.[/b] Consider everyone's ideas and discuss the best way forward. Please don't talk over people when you sense the slightest inkling of differing opinions. Even those without mics have valid opinions in the text chat. [b]Don't be a dictator, plan TOGETHER.[/b]

4) Don't hog or binge resources. Really, don't even try it. You will drive yourself (and your team) into a guaranteed failure. Always call out what you just found or picked up, mark what you can't carry with MMB, and constantly check your teammates' corresponding resource levels. Inventories are public for a reason. You can see what someone has just by looking under their name in-game, or tabbing into the map screen.

[i]TIP: Sentries should be top priority when tool refill kits are found. They are your best friends when someone accidentally triggers a room or when there's a mandatory holdout, and their utility can't be replaced. C-foam launchers can be substituted with grenades, bio-trackers have infinite usage, and mines are seldom used unless combined with C-foam or if you're trying to snipe-plode a giant.[/i]

5) Don't try to solo a cluster of sleepers. Coordinate with your teammates! What I usually do is a Charge-321-Hit countdown once everyone is in melee range of a target. Announce ""Charge,"" count 3-2-1, release on ""Hit."" This tactic also works wonders on giants from the back. Don't let your guard down until you're sure your target is dead, however- if you didn't see an orange radial pop from your reticle, continue melee-ing immediately. Don't shoot, or the whole room will be alerted.

6) Don't run ahead of your bio-tracker if you do not know how enemy AI work. And if you are the bio-tracker, call out enemy positions using degrees if it's not in someone's immediate area. If you hold LMB, you can mark moving/aggro'ed targets. This is incredibly useful for when there's a scout nearby or when there's a horde. Mark, mark, mark! Your team will thank you.

7) Talking of scouts, if you're prone to accidents, the ONE place NOT to screw up is in a room with a scout. Their scream will not only alert the room, but also summon another horde. IMO if you're inexperienced, the best option is usually to set up sentries outside the scout room, send a sniper in to headshot the scout, then run back out to hold out. Your risk of being wiped is far lesser this way. Don't try to melee it unless you know what you're doing, or your team approves an unsure attempt.

and lastly...

8) [b]HAVE FUN![/b] GTFO may be stressful, but don't let it get the best of you. Remain level-headed, laugh off your mistakes (given that you survive them), banter with your teammates. Really. You're gonna need all the morale you can muster in a game as dark and punishing as this one.

I got it during a 2023 summer sale and its the only game I played that year with almost 1400 hours played in 7 months. Now I wish I got this game earlier; however, I think now is the best time to pick up this game and play it to the end. It's a unique horror fps that's far better than any other zombie game with teammates. Other zombie games are all alike but this game emphasizes stealth, strategy and teamwork. You may want your own group of 3 other friends to play with but GTFO uses Discord, as opposed to in-game matchmaking, to play with others. You'll easily find other people to play with. I highly recommend picking up this game, especially when on sale. When you start playing play the first rundown focus on the basics such as using terminal commands, like a programmer/coder, to look for resources and objective items such as personal IDs, hydrostasis units, or keys. But don't feel like you have to completely finish a single rundown as you have 7 others to choose from. Feel free to switch between rundowns for the A and B expeditions. But don't expect this game to stay slow or easy. Eventually you'll want to learn how to pick up the pace and use your knowledge of the game to get through the more difficult expeditions. By using the consumables in the game it can make all the difference between getting through an expedition more easily too. There's a skill ceiling that you can work up to but its still straight forward enough that anyone who knows how to shoot can just join in. But don't let that make you think you can just shoot your way through all the enemies. You'll be resource dependent and you'll never know if you probably should of just melee more than shoot going from zone to zone. And even though people completed difficult rundowns and expeditions, they always come back to it eventually. I certainly thought at first some missions were too complicated but then once I got through that metaphorical wall, I really began to enjoy the game for what it had to offer and wanted to keep playing more. Even if I failed an expedition after trying several times with others, there's still something about trying again and again and learning how to play better that makes the game so much more pleasing.

Do I recommend this game with friends? Yes

This game is an in-progress horror survival puzzle masterpiece. 
The game has nice touches, its lighting and overall atmosphere are top notch but with my good memory, I can see that there were limited assets used for building the rooms and it got repetitive. 

The Guns: The Equipment handles nicely, and the damage of these weapons is all over the board. It has more to do with the weapons role than actually making sense. Pistol and SMG have more ammo but can drop an enemy is 1-2 shots just like the assault rifle. Shotgun damage is odd but understandable due to the Role the Devs have given the two. The Sniper Rifle has Severe Limited use here due to its low ammo count and unforgiving mechanics.

Years later, after the recent free weekend, and i came to change my mind about GTFO, thanks to a friend. The game isn't just about being stealth, you can move freely as you will, as long as you know what you are doing. Planning strategically or charging right into rooms, it's your call and you bear the consequences of it. It's still undeniably hard as I've seen my friend doing a 2-3 hours run, even 4 sometimes.

If you have three other friends who can work together (or learn to do so lol), then you'll have a great time and I wholeheartedly recommend it. But there's some caveats:

1. It has a horror [i]theme[/i] but it's not really a horror [i]game[/i]. It's really not that scary.

2. You need a party of four. I wouldn't even recommend it with three - the missions and difficulty are absolutely designed around having four humans. I haven't played with bot companions and I don't plan on it.

3. It's pretty hard, and the missions can take upwards of 90 minutes with few (if any) checkpoints. You have to be okay with losing and just enjoying the tactical challenge. You won't complete most missions on the first try.

If those three points are acceptable to you, then it's a great time. The visuals and sound design are amazing. Grungy sci-fi horror that reminds me of Alien.

The stealth mechanics are basic but effective. And once you inevitably wake up the sleepers, the gun fights are fun too. The game doesn't really punish you for breaking stealth - it's more a matter of if you can afford to expend the health and ammo.

The skill ceiling is crazy. The only progression is cosmetic, so the only thing carrying you into harder levels is your ability to improve (and you will). If you've played Death Stranding, it's sort of similar to how you start off scared of the BTs, but later come to know their tricks and how to out-maneuver them.

So grab three friends and go bonk some sleepers on the head. And don't forget to turn your flashlights off.",1703726827,1703726827,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game heavily reliant on multiplayer.  My experience with it was terrible.  I waited 20 minutes before I ever got into a multiplayer game and that game was still missing a player.  This is because everyone who joined me would immediately drop the match when they saw I was a brand new player.  There were people in matchmaking, just no one willing to play with new players.  To the two that did play with me, thank you.  

What a way to keep your game alive people.  It was pretty discouraging getting dropped on and waiting to play a game for so long.  I have since tried to get a refund.

Time limited SKINS now too.

This games development is
""Cant bring anything useful to the game what are we to do?""
""Make it time limited forcing people to play it!""

Didnt help that their whole 1.0 release was full of so many bugs it was gameplay ruining to play, i dont expect anything they release to be stable until months after its release at which point the community moves on with their lives as they cant experience older stuff due to this whole time limited bullshit.


This was my thoughts back then. Since i made that review the dev team has gone back and reworked EACH rundown to now work with updated stuff and re released them all as permanent additions to the game.

GTFO is ultimately a deeply niche game. My opinion has shifted on GTFO for many reasons, back and forth. I don't think this game is worth it for the majority of people, the bar to entry is simply too high.If you're even down a player from the traditional 4 setup, it will seriously impede your progress later into your journey. If you're a solo player. forget it. Maybe if you're willing to do A LOT of heavy work (basically everything) and have a solo mod but it's still extremely difficult the further you go in and i'd argue almost impossible for E tier levels. Even a traditional 4 player setup means that everyone typically has to be playing at their best.I think the game has a lot of merits and at times, it really does shine as long as you have a consistent group of 4 to go through the ""Rundowns"" (Campaigns, essentially) but that just isn't a realistic prospect sometimes. Online matchmaking is frankly not good enough although i appreciate that 10 Chambers tried. Bots are just not good enough to make it even to medium difficulty levels. Ditch them for players as soon as you can.

Don't treat this game like a Killing Floor,Left 4 Dead or WWZ. You're going to have a really bad time if you do that. GTFO is it's own beast and mechanically is very different. To the point that if you're expecting that kind of experience or wanting that kind of experience to turn around and not play this. It's definitely more of a tactical shooter at times.

Level design has dramatically changed since i last reviewed this game, it was a lot more stealth oriented and while that is still an emphasis. It does have a decent level of focus on combat through the use of Alarmed defence sections, Reactor defence sections, Uplink Verify sections and sometimes you will have to deal with an Error alarm which respawns enemies sometimes for the rest of the level which can be pretty difficult to deal with at times. There is a massive emphasis on teamwork, this is essentially a team building exercise. If you don't work together, if you get greedy. Nobody is making it out alive. The difficulty later on in D and E class levels is more often than not a mechanic to deal with, rather than a particular enemy. Dense Toxic Fog. Exploding spore mines. Maybe complete pitch black darkness. Reactor Setups followed by mad scrambles to find a code from a terminal in a nearby area while enemies close in. So many more ways that this game adds pain ontop of everything else. It's really not going to be for people who are expecting a relaxing experience. This is intense. Not the fun kind of intense either, it can be genuinely stressful. It's the kind where you open a security door and are immediately confronted by a difficult enemy suddenly while also in a rush for time while also having issues with even being able to see enemies period.

My opinion on the stealth mechanics has mellowed a fair amount, it does feel relatively shallow at times but does require cooperation between your team. It's deceptively simple at first (Yes the red light, green light stuff is real.) but when everything else gets thrown into the mix. It becomes a more complicated affair. Opting for stealth is the best way to play the game but it can be a boring way at times.I recommend clearing out most of the smaller fodder enemies and then setting up louder kills on the larger ones as sometimes they can be clustered together which makes it difficult to take control of the situation. So a stealth kill waking up another enemy is inevitable. 

Terminal trawling as i like to call it is a necessity. Searching through terminals (essentially computers) for objective items and supplies are a necessity if you want to finish the levels in a decent amount of time, at least if you're going through the level blind. You're not also just scoping out supplies but planning out a route. At first this doesn't seem so bad but it gets very tiring towards the end of a rundown. It feels like a cool immersive mechanic that gets really old. It would help to at least have some form of recording item ids without having to tab out of the game and write it all down. KEY_GREEN_320 in ZONE_32 AREA_B as an example gets really old to type out over and over again.

I'm going to keep talking about the enemy roster to a relative minimum, they are best found out yourself. Smart weapon  choices can counter them as well as just being good at stealth in cooperation with your team. It's also a good idea to have a backup plan.. Tools really do facilitate a lot of this.  Sentries to cover flanks your team is too busy to deal with. C-Foam to keep doors secure,to pile up more enemies to max out the amount of kills you can get from a mine when it breaks. A Bio Tracker that is downright an essential part of your tools, being able to tag enemies during an assault/defence or make it easier to facilitate stealth in low visibility environments. It actually becomes a little bit of a crutch if you're using one so i suggest giving it to a lesser skilled player who is good at call outs or Bots.

Your weapons are the most important part of your load out, they'll dictate how much ammo you'll use up and what sort of options you have as a team. I recommend at least one person to opt for a form of special weapon high damage. Scatter gun,High Cal Pistol, Hel Rifle or the Hel Gun and for them to be as conservative at possible with primary weapons with a pistol, hel revolver (My personal favorite.) or machine pistol. It means you will always have an option for a certain enemy types. Also, always opt for engaging an enemy from the behind, in stealth or in combat if you can manage it. Damage Multipliers from attacking enemies from behind are much higher than you would have normally. Particularly on the back of the head. This is the same case with melee weapons in stealth. Very important mechanic. It's the difference between going loud and smoothly executing a difficult enemy in stealth.  

I have to talk about the overall setting and story of the game, it's so so very slim at times but so very rich when you can get it. It's a story with space left for interpretation. Lore events are fragmented. Leaving you to decipher what the hell is even going on. Which is fun if you're an active reader. The later rundowns have a lot more story in them. It also has a lot more environmental storytelling, something a lot of the earlier rundowns lack. To the point that it makes the first few rundowns feel very bland. It's unfortunately very difficult to access without looking it all up online. The only major source of background story is through terminals and terminals do not always have them. They do not save to an index of sorts. Which is a shame. I won't be spoiling anything. If you find something weird or strange about the situation you're in, it's typically on purpose to serve the narrative. The game is a pretty neat mystery for you to unpack and takes you to some pretty unexpected places. 

I find it difficult to say whether or not this game is good.I wish i could give this a more mixed recommendation as an option because it's more accurate but i'm giving it a negative one because i don't think it's for most fps coop players. It's good for certain friend groups. You know the kind. Milsim types who love playing on Insurgency,ARMA 3, RON. They get together for a few hours to play a solid session and they are used to a team dynamic. But for everyone else (Yes, even if you're missing a single player.), you're going to have some serious diminishing returns to the point that you probably won't see the end of a rundown and for solo players or people using public matchmaking, you're pretty much staring at the gaping maw of hell when it comes to difficulty. 

Ultimately however i think 10 Chambers has created a very interesting game, aesthetically and design wise but i do hope their next game will have a wider broader appeal and is more accessible in Den of Wolves.",1577768742,1703396516,False,3,0,0.571508109569549561,90,True,False,False

Level design:
The game will tell you to go to X and do something there, so you go there but you will always stumble upon a door that you are missing a keycard for going to the objective, so you have to explore other doors in order to get the keycard. In the end you pretty much explore the entire level to scour for supplies so you can survive.

Half of the levels are filled to the brim with infectious fog that will make you lose health and reduce your max health every second you sit in it, the game will offer you fog repellers to deal with it, but they are very limited in terms of usage, range and runs out very fast, so unless you throw them at the right spots you will have to deal with walking blindly in the fog and get next to no health for the remainder of the level.

If that isn't bad enough, there are monsters in the fog, your visibility is actually so limited you can't even see 1 meter in front of you until you bump into a wall or an object, so unless you have a teammate that is willing to talk 24/7 and have a bio tracker equipped (It tells you the location of enemies), and has the patience to tell you if you are facing the right direction or not, you are screwed. More often than not, you are screwed anyway because the game always puts clusters of enemies right nearby each other so even if you quietly kill one, the nearby ones will automatically aggro so it is up to team effort to take them out all at once before one of them alerts the whole room.

Going loud moments:
If a monster hears you making enough noise, they will start getting up and alert the room, so your only option is to sneak up to them and melee them in the head, a lot of times it will go wrong because either people fail to execute killing a cluster of enemies in 4 seconds or the monsters are just so annoying doing the schizophrenia movement that one of them wakes up, because every single monster has a separate timer that makes them scan nearby movement and sound every 8 seconds or something for 4 seconds long, and it fastens if they hear nearby sound/movement. So it is already annoying to try and get close. So, they get alerted, and you start going pew pew because all monsters apart from the basic type one or two, are deadly to confront with melee.

All levels has alarm doors, you will have to do at least 6 of them in every level and you have to do them if you want to continue to get to your objective. You can be as tactical as you want with setting up turrets at the right positions behind doors or mines but bullets are definitely getting spent. It is basically wave defense while trying to secure areas in the room the alarm door is in. Not much of a problem, other than if you run out of ammo you are basically dead because they just swarm you over otherwise.

Ammo:
It is the single most important resource in the game and there ain't a whole lot of it, you don't have enough for an alarm door because your teammates shoots like a stormtrooper? Did they coincidentally also loot all the ammo bags for themselves and you didn't find any? Good luck surviving. It is already scarce if you go perfectly stealth so imagine all the other scenarios.

Because it doesn't matter if you hit every single headshot, if your teammates miss that will hurt the whole teams supply.",1702081557,1703349936,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I only have 2 missions left in Rundown 7 which is arguably the hardest of them all. GTFO is a diamond in the rough, with empathise on the rough.
The game has a huge learning curve, few accessibility options and is downright unfair sometimes due to technical errors or limitations. It is not a game for everyone.
Here is why I still recommend it despite all of that. GTFO is about failing, learning from your mistakes and find a new strategy. The R7 mission 'AWOL' is a perfect example of this. You are thrown out there without a clear objective and have to struggle to figure things out. We've probably failed around 20 times if not more and we all have over 50 hours of playtime at this point. But then something you try works... You try that strategy next time and suddenly the mission goes from insane to something doable. Hope starts to rise and today we finally managed to complete the mission. Such a good feeling of overcoming great odds.

This is not a game for everyone and I wouldn't want it any other way.
However, here are some things I would want another way:
- Personality settings for the boss, to tweak at what treshhold they heal or resupply you. A lot of times they stop shooting because you went from 100% HP to 75% which snowballs into a very bad situation.
- Ordering bots to drop their supplies so you could pick them up instead would be nice.
Some maps are too long and should have a checkpoint.
- Checkpoints should persist even if you leave the expedition, if they don't want us to have a bunch of checkpoints up at once on different maps they can just make it so the last dissapears if you open a new expedition.
 [strike]- More story content, currently R7 is pretty much the only rundown that has any and is by far the best content the game has to offer.[/strike] With the release of R8, I deem this improvement fixed.
- Maybe something like a booster reforge system would be nice, just to get rid off excess boosters. System is pretty optional anyway.",1684870882,1703159176,True,76,2,0.837360262870788574,0,True,False,False

First i liked them and now i hate them and because of Mike, who was complaining so much that i started to hate them even more. Rundown 3 was ok rundown and rundown 4 i am stuck on E1. R5 is the WORST! Hard as all hell and many loud missions. Me and Mike managed to get to D1 level and this is where the game and bots are glitched - bots wont go to the alarm scan zones and thats why we lost that rund and after that i crashed. Rundown 6 is the rundown that i like the most - finaly some good story and how the infection got into our world. and rundown 7 that is somewhere between bad and good. Some of the missions also have secondary or third objective that is not needed to complete the mission, BUT  IF YOU DO THEM, YOU GET NOTHING! USELESS. Also most of the rooms in the rundown are just copied. Not to even mention all of the missions can take up to 1 - 2 hours. and the objectives are also almost the same. 


Now infected aka sleepers- most of them can be triggered by walking by them and shooting BUT SOMETIMES A SLEEPER WAKES UP FOR NO FOKIN REASON When i kill an enemy. I dont mean like 5 metes, but like 20 metes away from me. Now their what they are - basic -striker - melee and shooter - shoots at ya. And there are also their big versions. Now special infetced - spitter - cant be killed and vomits infection at ya (infection reduces your hp), Scout - summons more sleepers if triggered. Mother - SPAWNS FOKIN BABIES! Shoot her belly to kill her and QUICK! Tank - Can be only killed from behind and is though as hell. Snatcher - he takes your teammates away from ya. This is my favourite enemy, but only because Mike got scared when we first foud out about him. Chargers - My nemesises, because they dont have head critbox and also there are scout versions of them and big ones too. Invisible enemies  - they also have scouts and big ones. Now bossfights - Queen mother - more hp and also spawns babies. Kraken  - boss fight of r6, Immortal - he is what he is - you cant kill him and is on r7E1. 


More to the bad parts - Bots, sometimes they are so stupid that they go on the otherside of the closed doors and they dump all of their resourses into someone (they prefer players) and sometimes it doenst even look like they are shooting, luckily they cant get detected even if you are moving - THAT IS THE ONLY + ... because most of the time they just die to a big striker - like what happened to me - they just stand and are getting hit. 

Now to the matchmaking - you need to matchamake through their discord to play with players, because matchmaking doenst work. GG 10 chambers for being stupid, like seriously. This game also has A BIG PROBLEM WITH CRASHES! I was waiting for Mike to join the game and after 20 mins it just crashes. 
Update: rundown 8 is trash.

And the difficutly.... Its hard af, stupidly hard af. The difficulty at first was fun to play against and after my 100 hours in game i completly hated it. Those last 200 hours i was replaying rundown either with Mike or all other players. this game is dead for a fokin reason. In short - Confusing story (in the rundowns anyway), Stupid difficutly, no proper ai for the bots, many glitches, and no proper rewards. I wanted to like this game.

Now, this game is a serious down-bringer for those who RAGE faster than a BOILING KETTLE and people without MICROPHONES. It requires upmost communication level and effective cooperation to survive. Now, without further ado, let us list some nice and bad things about the game so far:

- Pros
> This game is COOPERATIVE and CHALLENGING.
> Involves FRIENDSHIP BONDING and GRAND STRATEGY SESSIONS.
> Helps with your AIM and STEALTH skills, requires GOOD EYESIGHT and ACCURACY.
> Demands UPMOST FOCUS and JUDGEMENT in most situations.
> POP and BLOW HEADS of MONSTERS with joy!
> Involves SURPRISES and JUMPSCARES from the shadows.
> Meet NEW FRIENDS through MATCHMAKING!
> Guns can go BLAZING during HORDE INCOMING!

- Cons
> All you feel is PAIN.
> You cannot be RAMBO unless you are experienced and well-seasoned player.
> Enemies can KILL you within SECONDS if you are not careful.
> EXTENSIVE RESOURCE MANAGING (you can consider it as a pro if you are good at it.)
> PROMOTES EMOTIONAL DAMAGE and RAGE (if you are sensitive ofc)
> JUMPSCARES are OFTEN if you are not careful and observant.
> You are ONLY HUMAN after all...
> Gameplay is mostly revolving around STEALTH (depends on your team's core playstyle)
> HIGHER CHANCES OF DYING during HORDE INCOMING. (again, depends...)

So far, that is what I feel about the gameplay most of my time, trenching and kicking through Rundown 1. Feel free to add in your pros and cons as I might have left out some factors too! As far as concerned, this game is RECOMMENDED to all players, who wish to improve their COOPERATIVENESS LEVEL.

Thankfully, that isn't all this game has going for it. Moment to moment gameplay in GTFO is a rollercoaster between tense stealth and frantic action, and the atmosphere of its environments and storytelling are very easy to become immersed in. The gunplay is satisfying, and resource placement within the levels ensures you both explore the environment and are always rationing what little you can find.

If you enjoy stealth, resource management along with risks here and there then you will enjoy this game. Most the time stealth is the best option but when things go south you switch to gun play which is fantastic. Only downsides I've personally have had are the glitches/bugs that happen especially on checkpoints and that if you don't have a group of friends then the only option is hosting lobbies on the official discord. This involves playing with random people from East/West USA and even EU so ping is an issue sometimes, also if the rundown is not popular or new it might take +/-25 min for people to join. Some of the harder levels can be overwhelming when they take 1 - 2 hours to complete but this depends on the skill of your team and how many times you fail and have to start from scratch or checkpoint.

Pros:
- No unlocks/progression on guns or equipment.
- Good environment and atmosphere.
- Different weapons and monster mechanics.
- Team coordination and communication.
- Level completion rewards with cosmetics.
- Good community willing to teach new players.
- No level grinding.

Cons:
- Glitches/bugs may ruin the experience.
- Long matchmaking queues. (Official Discord)
- Lobby ping is rated by the host.
- Some people might not want to talk on mics.

Really good game in my opinion just wish it was more popular.

Enemies are well-designed in that they all have weaknesses in some way shape or form, and with a little experimenting its not hard to uncover. You can tell what an enemy does at first glance either through what it does, how it looks, or how it interacts with the environment, and the same goes for tools and resources you pick up as well. 

As you explore the level maps and sub-maps, or ""Rundowns"", you uncover new difficulties and challenges that stack collectively with ones you've previously encountered the deeper into the world you go.
Besides that, all equipment, guns, tools and other gear are unlocked from the start while the only things you unlock through regularly game-play are cosmetics. 

I can't speak very well for the squad AI because its been a mix of extremely reliable or horribly unpredictable, but it takes practice with the squad interface menu to use them properly. Whether its playing alone or with 2 other players, all it takes is a little oiling up to get used to it.

But don't make the mistake in thinking its a traditional horde shooter , its more of a stealth game then anything. You probably spend like 30% Shooting , another 30% Looting and using terminals and then 40% Doing Stealth. If you are searching for an action ''Horror''

if you want a Shooter where u mindlessly just shoot everything i would recommend going to play Warhammer Darktide.

Game seems harder then it actually is , just observe what your teammates are doing , follow and take notes. And you should be fine

My one and only problem is actually the community and the people that play the game, i can best refer to some people that play this game as : Mentally Challenged troglodytes in a wheelchair.  Lets take a look at the loop of GTFO

1. Pick the first level because you are new
2. Wait for lobby to fill up or matchmake
3. Get in lobby and either type or tell everyone you are new
4. Either you get cussed out for being new or maybe on a rare occasion you wont
5. Play the level
6. Get cussed out for doing not well, even tho you clearly stated you are new 
7. In the After game lobby get cursed at by Mentally Challenged troglodytes in a wheelchair.
8. Reconsider if this community is not just filled with all of those.

If you are lucky to have actual functioning humans on your team, then congrats you will probably have fun. On the opposite end , if you are unlucky , you will get dipshits with 9000 hours playing the FIRST LEVEL and not taking in account new players will play the FIRST LEVEL OF THE GAME, i mean in my head its pretty logic , but i guess logic don't come to everyone in this world.",1702583774,1702669200,False,0,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

I've been playing this game since it was in early access, and I find the style, lore, and characters really cool. However, I can't fully recommend this game for one simple reason: IT'S INSANELY UNBALANCED.
Yes, I said ""unbalanced"" and not ""difficult"" because Dark Souls is difficult. It means you can defeat a boss or another type of difficulty with a lot of effort, a good strategy, and farming/better items. Here in G.T.F.O., no, you can be a korean pro player, but you will fail no matter what you do.

1) Enemies are too many.
2) Enemies are too fast.
3) Enemies deal a lot of damage.
4) You are always low on ammo.
5) Levels are pitch black, and the only good flashlight is the big one.
6) Enemies sometimes ""respawn"" due to a glitch, so you have to face the same enemies more and more times.
7) There's a lot of (toxic) fog (toxic for you, not for the monsters, obviously), and this will also further compromise your vision.

In order to succeed in an expedition, you need tons of luck, especially for the ammo packs, tool refill packs, and medkits, and an excellent team combined with a lot of patience and trial and error.

Difficulty aside, the levels are all the same with just a little bit of tweaks here and there. I mean, come on, be more creative! I don't want to downvote this title, but it's a 6/10; I can't give more than this.",1609174722,1702585949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Feels like old-school co-op games, your very first run you have access to everything and consequently everything is about learning and improving your own gameplay and understanding. The only forms of progression are cosmetic unlocks and finding consumable boosters that last for 1~3 runs each. A lot of the fun is finding the best way to handle anything thrown at you both personally and as a team and occasionally push the limits and do really silly stuff stacking boosters.

It has matchmaking if you don't have friends but I would recommend forming teams via the official Discord server, and as much as I hate having to join yet another Discord server for anything you end up with much better players who have also passed the filter of the minor inconvenience and also beginner's resources.

It can be unfair, very unfair if you're on a first blind run of a level and suddenly handed a terrible curveball, but that's part of the point. The better you get and the better your teamwork gets you'll be surprised how fast you adapt to those surprises on the first try, or you can do some looking around on how other groups approach those moments, since the only randomness is in enemy and object placement. The encounter and level design isn't always perfect, but it typically feels very intentional and there's plenty of moments where you open a room or punch in a terminal command and just immediately know a developer set it up solely mess with you for the fun of it. If you fail you just aim to demolish it the next time.

Ammunition economy can be very important and you're expected to do a lot of sneaking in most levels to alleviate the starvation especially when first starting out. As you get better you begin to realize just how much you can get away with in melee and begin to question the need for sneaking (and maybe shooting outside of alarms) at all sometimes. The feel of the actual shooting is good in my opinion, it might be rough starting out as it's very deliberately designed to reward good shot placement and controlled bursts to consistently stagger and kill. Some weapons have a much easier time with handling if that ends up being an issue. As you get better you're more efficient and have more ammo to dump in the emergencies that will happen less often.

As for complaints/shortcomings, for networking stuff: the lobby system can be a bit janky but creating a new one or switching hosts typically fixes issues. Since it's peer-to-peer hosting sometimes latency issues crop up but I've only ever personally had egregious issues over very long distances or specifically bad hosts. I've had progress not save to the master server maybe once or twice over the years and had to rerun a level those times.

For gameplay stuff: Rare bugs can crop up with objects becoming uninteractable or players being stuck carrying objects, with a possibility of being softlocked for that run and having to restart. It can be a real buzzkill but it's happened less and less often as time's gone on.

You, unfortunately, must be the opposite: you must learn to compromise with your comrades for the best of the group and for the objective; you must learn to compromise when your situation becomes less-than-ideal (a common experience during your expeditions into the Complex); and you will compromise yourself to meet the demands of the uncompromising Warden. No cost is deemed too great to reveal the mysteries of the Complex.

I've played this game since the first rundown during Early Access, and while I missed an entire rundown (and partially missed another), I did get to finally fill in the gaps when the game properly released. My admiration for it has never abated, and I will forever sing it praises for being uncompromising during an era where game experiences are more often than not compromised for a population that refuses to meet a game on its terms.

This is not for the faint of heart, those who seek a less demanding experience, or those who refuse to work with others. If you can accept that and meet this game on its terms, it's one of the most memorable experiences of its kind.

It's very hard and pretty unforgiving - you might spend an hour working on a expedition only to get wiped and have to start over, so be aware of that and consider if that's something that would frustrate you or if you'd enjoy the added challenge and pressure the high-stakes.
Also, it isn't a horde shooter - I think many people have the impression that's what it is but it isn't - the game involves stealthily clearing out areas by patiently sneaking and using melee weapons while gathering resources and objective-related items, punctuated by segments of heavy action with gunplay.
I've read a lot of people saying they had issues with the in-game matchmaking system but it's worked great for me and I've never had an issue finding people to play with using it. I only got into the game in December of 2023 so maybe they've fixed the matchmaking issues others who played before me have reported. It is best to play with friends but if you don't know anyone who plays you should be able to get pickup groups together that are adequate!

Updated review I think its been.... 5 years now or something later.

I played on the closed beta and really enjoyed the game when it first came out, there was a lot of funny bugs and exploits but we eventually got them all fixed. This game holds a special place in my heart, its one of the first closed betas where I left like I actually helped with game development, even if just a bit.

The Sad reality for me though is that I can not enjoy the game. Its soooo hard, everything has to be so perfect I have not been able to play it sense the first maps released. I feel like you spend HOURS just to have someone die, or make a mistake and everything falls apart and you have to restart. Great game but a bit too difficult for me personally, at least when there is other people involved.

-The graphics look nice
-The performance is optimised

Cons:
-No lore or cut scenes
-Constant searching for loot just to get garbage items that dont help fight waves (like flashlights, glow sticks, and lock breakers)
-Always running out of ammo
-Weapons just dont have 1 hit potential
-Headshots dont do extra damage for mobs that have the most health, it just incentivizes spraying the mob in the body (isnt satisfying to kill)
-Lack of mod varity, just the same ones over and over again
-Fog viability is horrendous, cant see an inch infront of you in most rooms
- Fall damage barely jumping off a small height
-Menu is mediocre, learning curve to it
-The text in this game has a double vision effect to it, just makes it harder to read the objective
-The objective doesnt overlay when using the console. This is the one time you need to know the exact item you need to copy it in the terminal requires you to memorize and go back and forth in the game to just type it in

I was willing to put up with a lot of their bullshit when it was an early access game. And even stuck around when they doubled down on the worst parts of the game out of early access, hoping they'd turn around before ending it.

But no, the game is completed now and still doesn't scale properly to a non-4 player teams. And bots are a pathetic attempt at fixing this which can as often be a liability as an asset.
All the different tools are needed to complete levels (the sweaty tryhards will try to tell you otherwise, but they're full of shit.) and some levels require you to be acting at a rapid and agile pace, using these tools. Except the tools on the bots are basically still used by you but through a very clunky and unresponsive menu that limits your ability to move. And even if you are able to get the orders to these bots out in time there is no guarantee they will not fuck it up worse than even a new player with less than 1 hour of playtime could.
Resources are extremely limited and carefully thought out use of these resources is paramount to completing a level. And yet the bots will happily taking these resources and use them wherever they see fit. Which can often be in the wrong place, which can end or massively complicate a run.

And aside from that there are some ridiculous design choices which modders have proven can be easily and elegantly fixed without ruining anything about the game. Things such as:
- The ability to put a resource back down after picking it up so someone else can hold it.
- The ability to combine two half used up resource packs into one fuller one.
- The ability to point your flashlight in the direction you are running instead of flailing it about to the side.

The levels can often take well over an hour to complete, and with the extremely punishing design, you are always at risk of wiping. The devs, after years of complaints, finally added a terribly buggy checkpoint system, which is still worthless for the average person because you cannot close the game and return to your checkpoint later. Once you return to the main menu or close the game, all progress is lost.

The atmosphere, world building, and moment to moment gameplay of GTFO are all great and would have made for an absolutely phenomenal game. If it had been made by any other developer. 10Chambers has continuously expressed their intent to make their game as disrespectful and outright hostile to it's players.

Be warned, in my honest opinion. this game really requires friends to play. Randoms can be fun, but the amount of coordination and communication required to succeed would make it very difficult to play with people you don't know.

If you want a challenging co-op horror shooter that feels fair and BS at the same time. This games for you. I will update this more as I play but so far I have completed roughly 5 missions and each one has been extremely diverse, fresh, and enjoyable with no two objectives feeling the exact same. Each mission has its own unique objective and for the few that share the same objective feel completely different with unique level design and varying puzzles to conquer. 

The slogan for this game is ""Work Together or Die Trying"" and they really mean it. This game even with 4 friends using discord requires so much planning, setup, and coordination it feels extremely rewarding every time you extract from the mission with everyone alive. If you just try to rush in with no planning, you will die, horribly. If you don't try to sneak and work together to take down large hordes, you will once again, die horribly. 

Not only is it a phenomenally difficult co-op game, but its also extremely fair and respects your time. Every time you complete a mission for the first time you are granted with a random cosmetic item. Every time you complete a mission in general you are rewarded with a randomly selected perk that can give you buffs with some can even be so strong the can hinder stats (IE: More turret damage and faster reload but you take more melee damage.) Which allow for even deeper build diversity and deeper strategies. 

All in all, I would rate this game a solid 9.5/10. Sometimes the melee can feel jank and the darkness can be a little annoying, but good god this is one of the most rewarding games I've ever played with friends.

Стоит ли оно того? Конечно стоит. Это уникальный продукт, другие кооперативные шутеры просто не предложат тех испытаний и того подхода, которого от игроков требуют 10 Chambers.

В данной игре кооперация, умение адаптироваться и быстро думать, а также грамотно оценивать обстановку и подбирать лучшее решение для наступающих проблем - главное.

Игра грамотно сменяет стелсовые эпизоды и эпизоды громких столкновений с противниками, хорошо вознаграждает правильный и аккуратный подход и очень жестоко наказывает за любые ошибки.

Контента в игре сейчас очень много, доступны все миссии от самого первого релиза игры в декабре 2019 года вплоть до самых недавних, самых интересных и сложных за все время.

Ограничений по стилю игры нет, но каждый из уровней диктует наиболее оптимальные лодауты, которые стоит брать в зависимости от сложившейся ситуации.

Оружия в игре много, и оно все отличается своей направленностью и задачами. Какое-то оружие лучше работает против орд мелочи, какое-то лучше работает чтобы быстро убивать больших монстров, есть усредненные образцы, которые примерно одинаково справляются с обеими задачами, а есть сверх-специализированные образцы, которые стоит брать только когда диктуют обстоятельства.

Это сложная игра. Очень сложная. Она может не зайти с первого раза, возможно ей придется дать время, чтобы понять ее прикол, возможно придется идти не по хронологическому порядку миссий, чтобы не умереть от духоты и понять, что в игре реально есть что-то интересное.

Но оно правда того стоит. Это уникальная игра, которых на рынке до этого в принципе не было.
С релизом последнего набора миссий, с выходом ачивок и по сути окончанием истории данной игры - свой ценник она однозначно оправдывает.

Один лишь момент, который может кого-то отпугнуть - в соло все пройти не выйдет. Будут нужны люди. Либо друзья, либо рандомы из их прекрасного сервера в дискорде, где лично я не встретил ни одного неприятного товарища, либо даже просто внутриигровой матчмейкинг.

I have a complicated history with this game. I started Spring 2022 during rundown 6 playing with my brothers, and we didn't make it very far at all. After a couple wipes of R6B2 we gave up. But I continued playing on my own with bots and was able to get all the way through R6D1 and R6CX. 

Rundown 7 came out a few months later and I convinced a few more of my friends to play, and we got to R7B3 but couldn't go any further. Following that, I stopped playing for several months. 

Once rundown 4 came out my interest was piqued again and I got back into it and put a couple hundred hours working through the rundowns solo with bots. For everyone who complains about the bots, they really are quite helpful once you get used to how they work. They have good aim (usually), can kill sleepers silently you accidentally wake them, and take no infection. The worst times to use them are during reactor and warden protocol missions, or against chargers/tanks/mothers. Some of my greatest accomplishments with the bots were R6D1, R2D1, R3C1, R4C1 secondary.

But that leads us to now. Maybe things are different because I played rundown 6 before, but my enthusiasm for this game has just been flattened. My first upset was in R6A1 when you open the last door before the MWP and the lore log didn't play. I figured it was a bug, and a week or so later when the patch came out with the bug fix of audio not playing, I tried it again. No lore. Apparently all the lore has been removed. The second issue I have is the decision to move the extension missions up a tier, without changing the difficulty at all. How does it make sense to for R6AX to have multiple scouts, two class 5 alarms, two full zone alarms, flyers and shockers, but then R6B1 has two class 3 alarms, one scout and a few flyers. It feels so disjointed and anti-climactic, and I don't understand why they would change it. Rundown 6 was the first rundown out of early access and I wish they would have just left it alone. I've tried three times to play it and I just don't have the heart anymore. I hate that I feel this way about a game I've put hundreds of hours into and dozens of hours learning about the lore.

The Game:

I realize I haven't really talked about the actual gameplay. I would say it's excellent. The guns handle well, there's tons of them and the tools are all unique and allow you to play many different ways. The core gameplay loop of sneaking, planning defenses, and hectic alarm sequences is very satisfying. There's a handful of missions that play fairly similarly (gather items, retrieve/process item, create uplink) but reactor startup, warden protocol, and error alarms really change things up. Also the enemy variety is really good. At this point I'm not sure what they could add that wouldn't be a repeat of a monster already present in the game.

You don't necessarily need friends to play, but playing with bots is limiting. I wrote about this above, but the average player probably won't get past C-tier of most rundowns. Some D-tier missions are doable if you are really skilled and get lucky, but  D-tier reactor mission, or any missions that ""require"" you to split up are pretty much impossible. Tanks and mothers are very challenging because the bots don't treat them differently than any other enemy and you basically have to kill them yourself. Error alarms are very challenging because the bots like to run through doors as you're closing them, so shutting doors behind you and mining them usually results in a stranded and killed teammate. Chargers are also challenging as the bots will switch to melee as soon as they're in range, and that can quickly result in a team wipe. 

If you have friends to play with, the game is significantly easier. Even two humans and two bots is a huge step up over three bots. The biggest downside to the game if you're playing with friends is the time commitment. Missions usually last 45-90 minutes, and in rundown 1-5 there are no checkpoints. Losing a mission once or twice and result in a wasted night. Most people I played with could only play for 3 hours, and a wipe, particularly at the end of the mission was always a mood killer. That led to all of my friends quitting the game before we ever finished a single rundown. If you have a good group of friends with a lot of time on your hands, you can work your way through these rundowns and have a ton of fun. If you're like me and have kids or a busy job and can only play a few hours at a time, it's going to be very challenging to make any progress.

Verdict:

I would recommend this game to anyone who has a group of friends that like strategic, co-op games, or a solo FPS player who wants a challenge and doesn't mind learning the bots behavior. If you don't have a group to play with, it's going to be challenging to find a team as the playerbase has really dwindled. I hate that I no longer want to play this game, but I did get a lot of enjoyment out of it and I can't say I wouldn't recommend it based on some personal preferences. Also, this game has some fantastic video reviews on youtube. TuxBird's and Macrackle's are favorites.

 I had this game sitting in my backlog for 2 years, and I finally got around to playing it with 2 friends over the free weekend. We only played for one mission, so please take my criticism as a new player's first impression which didn't go too well. To my understanding, there is no place like a shooting range to acclimate to guns and equipment. The times we performed stealth it was hit or miss. There were the obvious mess ups that could be attributed towards a player moving at the wrong time. Other times we had cases when a player not remotely near an unaware enemy would alert it. Rooms that had more than 3 enemies huddled together proved to be difficult. We couldn't tell what we needed to do in order to clear out the room. One of us got stuck in place because the sleepers were continuously searching without a reasonable pause to move. The larger enemies are what we had the most difficulty with. (I was just told while writing this exactly why they proved difficult). We had 2 hammers and one spear (me), we consistently were aiming at it's head, not the dark portion of the body like I have just been told. The game did not communicate well that we had hit the wrong part of the large sleepers body. Either we would wipe upon attempting to kill it, or at least one of us would go down. Don't get me wrong, I love the ambiance, this game has unmatched tension, and the sound design is immersive, and grotesque.

We ran into a bug where tabbing out has a chance to fire your weapon if equipped.

The game doesn't have the smoothest optimization, and lacks the swathe of graphics settings found in other high fidelity games.

Tldr: the game is great in creating an atmosphere, but it falls completely flat when telling the player if they did a game mechanic/system right. Feedback from being damaged is also lacking. 

I might come back later and try playing with people in the discord. I won't write the game off completely.",1702248993,1702272413,False,1,0,0.502617835998535156,0,True,False,False

GTFO is an excellent game that do less out both despair and the relief of victory. If you can manage to pull your team together well enough to execute a plan through the inevitable panic.

Enemies aren't too spongy, but are quick and deal lots of damage faster than you might expect which requires a lot of coordination and quick thinking to to put them down.

Where the game suffers in my opinion is that the weapons are not very punchy and have kind of weak sound effects. The enemies are slightly generic, however they are still unsettling mostly because of the atmosphere. The pacing can also be very slow, considering that stealth is sort of essential to resource and health management.

Lastly, the visual aesthetic and presentation are amazing and horrifying at the time. There's sterile droning and presence of cold machinery against the frayed and panicked prisoners that gives a truly hopeless feeling. The intro was so jarring that I think I'm going to remember that for some time to come.

This is a remarkable and probably a different game than what you are used to. If you do not like ""different"", then you may not like this. This game is incredibly tough and requires team work at a high level. This is the sort of game that is amazing to play with friends. And if your friends dont play it, then the ""GTFO discord"", which is integrated deeply into the game experience, is a great place to make new friends. This game may not be perfect, but definitely a great game. GTFO is kinda hard for newbies, but when you get used to the gameplay: you're gonna love it!

I'd definitely reccommend it to anyone looking for a hardcore challenge that emphasizes teamwork!",1581636801,1702272341,True,2,0,0.523907661437988281,0,True,False,True

There's a saying in game development that goes something like this, ""Never make a placeholder look good enough to ship."" Reason being you'll always think, ""It's good enough for now,"" and convince yourself you'll change it later all the way to release, and it seems developers today are having to relearn everything we've known for decades. GTFO does this with its gameplay which clearly has not been significantly changed since trying to get something basic but functional, much like Dead by Daylight.

It's clear they want the game to be scary, but they failed to learn anything about the games they emulate.
- All mobs react to sound but are blind.
- All mobs are damage sponges to body shots.
- Most mobs have ranged attacks or long-range melee.
- Most mobs don't telegraph well.
- No special mobs have drawbacks for what they gain and scouts are invulnerable when alerted.
- There is very little variety despite the constant surprise in the cries of the characters at yet another sleeper.
- Players are given lower health, ammo, and equipment at the start of all missions regardless of performance. (This in and of itself can be fine as it's clearly world-building to show that that the prisoners are disposable to the Warden.)
- Supplies are very limited in game.

Together this means knee-aching crouch-walking through every level to preserve resources, and though you can sprint and coordinate most kills with little threat you'll inevitably take more damage than going slow. To try and break up this lack of action the game forces you to fight hoards of enemies at mandatory 'security scans' which make no attempt at working within what has already been built into the world. Stand in a field, a siren blares, and then you have to go to randomly designated points or follow a scan circle. At the end of the level you'll usually be made to run to the exit, then stand still and wait, as if that allows it to live up to it's name.
There, now you have your stealth and action boxes checked.

None of this is scary, it's frustrating. It's an imitation of media that came before:
- Left 4 Dead. Holding out against hoards of zombies, being quiet or going loud, and sprinting to an extraction.
- Aliens. Descending into a dark, ruined and alien place filled with monsters alongside your buddies, strapped with definitely not enough tools for the job.

The artists, writers and generally everyone working on building the world did a fantastic job, and there are certainly moments that are obviously excellent such as the moment when finding the matter wave projector. It's readily apparent [i]someone[/i] cares to make this game look good but it is absolutely not mixing with it's gameplay in the slightest. The trailer has more story building than the actual game which teases at things by showing how you enter the shaft, the strange high-tech mechanisms, the weird structure of the various sub-levels, or by playing audio logs. But the characters don't really react, they make no attempt to escape, they never fight their orders, they don't make plans or banter (unless you make the unfortunate mistake of giving the scanner to an npc) and nothing even seems to come of the tasks. What is there here to keep people wanting to know more?
What's keeping anyone wanting to come back at all?

Tl;dr
If you watched the trailer and got excited thinking about what could be going on, go write it down yourself and have fun with it. I guarantee you'll create something better than what's in store for you here.",1643599990,1702181722,False,5,0,0.531033873558044434,2,True,False,False

[h3] Great to play with some friends to have some spooks and fun. [/h3]

This game is one of the most outstanding horror shooters I've ever played the first time I booted it up with the boys we played for 5 or 6 hours straight, It was such a genuine thrill and everything from graphics to performance is brilliant.
Walking into the horrific complex blind not knowing what monsters your going up against is super thrilling.
I can run the game butter smooth at over 100 fps, and the bots aren't as bad as people have told me they are.
I already have 70+ Hours on this game and only up-to R2 with multiple more to go, sure we've failed and had a few [spoiler]fuck[/spoiler] ups that have screwed us over but that hasn't stopped the fun.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys horror or shooters.
This is a must play for me.

GTFO is not your regular shooter on the market. its a completely different type that identifies itself as very unique and interesting. GTFO heavily utilises its surroundings, sounds and vibe to entice and to immerse the player(s) and it does so very successfully. With the latest Rundown being Rundown 7: RISE . This new Rundown brings a visual and mechanical over hall that in my opinion greatly does GTFO a justice. Previous rundowns felt claustrophobic in some areas which where great in some areas, however this claustrophobia feeling has quickly faded after Rundown 5  as the rooms have been expanded vastly and gives more of a hollow and shallow feeling that excites me. And with the inclusion of the visual/mechanical overall, its as good as a Morning coffee and a spliff. 

GTFO isn't for everyone though. if you like running in and killing lots of zombies and shooting everything that moves. then maybe DOOM ETERNAL is that game for you. GTFO slows things down into a strategic objective based zombie survival shooter which i haven't seen ever. Ammo and resources are limited, communication is key but not always essential and teamwork makes the dream work. GTFO can go from a slow paced green light red light shooter, to high intense combat in a second. one wrong move or kill can either beat you to your breaking point or kill you. That's why teamwork is very essential to this game and that's one of the many reasons why i very much enjoy GTFO. However with everything, it has its negatives....

Replay-ability and progression has always made me come back to play older games like HALO and with this, this is where my problem starts and fades. GTFO has progression but in a way that's fitted with the theme of the game. It used to if you completed specific bulkheads (which I will get into soon) you would get more physical cosmetic items. Now its if you beat this level you get the gear no other bulkheads are necessary which does upset me as it takes away the grind and the replay-ability of this game. However with new players who aren't familiar with this game will prefer this way of unlocking cosmetics which I cannot be upset about. Unfortunately there are no other types of cosmetics in this game expect for physical ones. These include Mask, Tops, Trousers, Backpacks and Overall Colours. A nice selection  however due to my extensive brain rot and fried dopamine levels I'm left blue ballsed with not only how you unlock them but there isn't a reward/incentive for completing harder bulkheads. I NEED MORE 

However as of 03/12/2023 all the older rundowns which include: 
Deviation
Infection 
The Vessel
Contact://Extended
Rebirth://Extended
Destination://Extended 

Are now available to play and this to me was the update that makes GTFO one of the best hardcore co-op horror shooters of today. There's over 70+ levels to play ranging from the easy 1st rundown to my personal hardest rundown being the 5th one REBIRTH. You now get to experience GTFO to the fullest ( still waiting on that 8th rundown 10 CHAMBERS ;) ) now onto my personal favourite part about this game... The bulkheads aka 'layered difficulty' 

Layered difficulty without a doubt in my opinion is a god sent for GTFO. You have 3 different types of difficulty being in the form of bulkheads. first you have;

[b] HIGH: [/b] 
The High bulkhead being the main objective and primarily the easiest one. This one can be anything and is normally shown when you are choosing which level to do. These bulkheads contain your standard enemies but can also hide some horrific monsters.

[b] EXTREME: [/b]
The Extreme tests even the best players in GTFO and in FPS's. Extreme bulkheads can be very easy to do but have extreme consequences when beating them ( for example Rundown 4: B2 Extreme). Id recommend Extreme for the player who knows the mechanics of the game and is looking for a good challenge. These bulkheads can contain horrific monsters such as [spoiler] BIRTHERS AND TANKS [/spoiler] but with teamwork, can be killed quickly and efficiently 

[b] #ER02:// OVERLOAD: [/b] 
Overload tests the patience and skills of the best of the best GTFO players. These bulkhead objectives are gruelling, hardcore and can break your spirit into multiple pieces. These bulkheads contain the most extreme enemies that will either make or break the run. Such as [spoiler] SHADOWS, SHADOW SCOUTS, SHADOW SCOUT CHARGERS, BIRTHERS AND TANKS [/spoiler] but with very good teamwork, communication and strategies, beating these levels feels so rewarding and pleasurable. 

And if you manage to somehow beat all of the bulkheads in a level, you unlock the secret medal which is [spoiler] PRISONER EFFICIENCY [/spoiler]. This medal is the most rewarding and also the most challenging. I was only able to get 1 of these medals in Rundown 4 being on A2: ""FOSTER"". But to anyone that has been able to get the medal i tip my hat off to you Sir/ Ma'am. 

The Weapons and gadgets in this game feel bulky and hard hitting which i love personally. The different types of gadgets to help you complete the levels look and feel so good that honestly brings the immersion to a whole new level. every gun and gadget has a purpose and can be used in different scenarios in levels that can benefit you greatly or if used wrongly can do more harm than good. I wont cover all of the weapons and gadgets but my normal load-out  in this rundown is the Heavy SMG, Revolver and Bio Tracker. The hard hitting heavy smg feels incredible to shoot with and had good range, good ammo capacity and hits very well. Same thing with the revolver and the Bio Tracker to scan any Scouts in the area or to ping the on coming hoard. 

Overall GTFO isn't your run and gun zombie shooter, its a game that focuses on teamwork, environment and strategies that no game has been able to do it in a way that GTFO has done. It feels super immersive and every hit and every shot feels damaging and hard hitting. Progression and replay-ability do lack somewhat in this game but with the inclusion of layered difficulty and boosters and the fact all the previous rundowns have been implemented to this game, it looks like 10 Chambers are doing something about it and i cant wait to see what they'll do in rundown 8 and the future of GTFO.

fuck yes, i was originally going to call this, the left for dead 2, or some other ground breaking, era defining game, but tbh, i think this is beyond any left for dead in exponential amounts.

     Somewhat more indepth info and experiences from me:

     Compared to a lot of other ""low-man co-op"" multiplayer games that ive played recently, (SCP 5K, Escape The Backrooms, Lethal Company, Deeprock Galactic) GTFO is one of the best. Its a perfect combination of strategic stealth, and conservation of ammo, and then out of now where bam, some sorta mutated degen gets pissed off and now the entire floor is after you.

     Single Player - Actually really fun, you have complete control over the 3 teammate bots and what they do, and they function pretty well on their own when you're too busy to do so.

     Multiplayer - Matchmaking is not recommended, but they have a very VERY active official discord which is great to see. Community from the individuals i've played with have all been understanding and accepting to new players, some even willing to run multiple missions and give guides and advice. Shout out to ""Dumbass Cat"" and ""Ali's Son""

     Levels, and Replay-ability - Most, if not all levels are unique. There is so much variety that it makes sense that every level is a complete new environment, with different interactions. I cant spoil too much, but just when you think you start to understand everything, something new hits you in the face.
Later tiers of harder levels have multiple alternative endings/objectives that also push the barrier of what you and your team are capable of, with marginal benefit.

     In game cosmetics - when i first heard this, i thought that it implied DLC or micro transactions, but as it turns out cosmetics are randomly dropped from completing levels, which gives players more insensitive. 

     Money where your mouth is - The devs have already stated they are committed to not having any micro transactions in GTFO and that content releases and updates will be free, Im sure everyone is aware that there are hundreds of examples of companies falling back on these kinds of statements, but i would like to believe that this kind of standard and prestige that GTFO has, will be upheld to however long they can.a

     Performance - I run GTFO on a 3070 Ti, and an i7 - 12700k, with 64 gigs of ram.. so i cant really complain about intense usage or resource tanking. However, i've never had any issue with the game at 165 HTZ on a 2.5k (2560 x 1440) monitor with visual or audio bugs, UI or in-game glitches, nor anything deloading, unredering, or just straight up not working. The only issue i run in to is if someone has an unstable connection. When someone is lagging, the game kind of breaks in some funny ways. But the way they set up their connection and networking due to this, is very good. This way, keeps all players synced and connected and there isnt really any chance of desycning",1701581458,1701581458,True,2,0,0.534816503524780273,0,True,False,False

Very repetitive cycle on each and every mission.
These missions can also take anywhere from thirty minutes to two hours depending on the experience levels of you and your crew, as well as the size of the map\number of encounters.
You also have all of the weapons and equipment as soon as you start the game. Cool. I get it. Though, that leaves less room for a sense of progression in an already stale and unrewarding title.

The hardest thing is that there are moments when enemies are ""on alert"" and if you move even a centimetre the whole room wakes up on you. That means your team can screw everything up pretty quickly if even just one of you slightly move at the wrong time. This game shouldn't even be advertised as a shooter IMO, it should be advertised as a stealth game. Me and my friends expected a more hardcore version of Left 4 Dead, but this game is not that at all. Ammo is insanely limited, and It's a lot of creeping around and stabbing sleeping enemies in the face. I had the patience for it, but my friends didn't, which is why my play time will probably forever stay at 24 hours unless I can convince them to play again one of these days. The game is nearly impossible solo. There are bot teammates that you can order around, but they aren't smart enough and can harm more than help sometimes, as they take up a lot of resources like health and ammo. You can play without bots by yourself, but that slows the missions down and can have you in a run for an hour or two just to die with no progression to show for it. It took me and my friends about 4 to 5 hours just trying to complete the first mission through trial and error. 

TLDR: It's a good game with great atmosphere, just make sure your friends are patient and are up for a brutal and unforgiving challenge, because without friends to play with you're screwed.",1701127692,1701127711,True,2,0,0.532684087753295898,0,True,False,False

Full credit to the team working on it for listening to the community and continuing to be proactive with development. The game is still extremely challenging - still amazing with friends - and still nerve wracking when you're surrounded by sleepers. Seriously, check the game out if you haven't already.

To put it simply - this is an outstanding game.

Whether you choose to go commando style and shoot up whatever you come across, or the stealthy option (my friends and I prefer the latter), you will need decent teamwork and crisp communication. It will be frustrating, it will be rewarding and it will be fun. The feeling of finally conquering an area that you have struggled with is a type of joy that I haven't felt in any other game.

The developers have outdone themselves. I didn't think they could improve upon what they had in the beta, yet with a few tweaks and the addition of bots (that are more than capable of holding their own) I was very happy to see further improvement. It is refreshing to see a development crew who genuinely seem two care about two things - their audience and making a decent game.

At game start, you pick your load out for you and your team (Or solo, if you're a madman), and you are sent down into an underground complex by a mysterious entity called “The Warden”, to explore your subterranean prison and complete objectives, or fetch quests for the said Warden. 

Which from what we can gather, you're prisoners who are expendable, hence being sent down to the long abandoned complex that's now filled with these grotesque mutants that will eat your face off to do the Wardens bidding. GTFO has a HUGE emphasis on stealth, exploration and strategy, and if those aren't you're forte, you're not going to have a good time on this.

[b]Graphics[/b]: I love how streamlined all the assets are. The game is beautifully designed, and how [b]10 Chambers[/b] manages their assets is honestly amazing and will never cease to impress me. 

Each level, despite using the same assets in a lot of places to streamline how well the game runs, each level always feel unique enough to be completely separate to one another, whilst still being part of the same facility. 

[b]Soundtrack[/b]: Eerie, unsettling, and then battle music when you know you've f*cked up. It works, it doesn't need anything more, anything less. Every sound in the game is so well done, crisp sounding and in your face when it needs to be. 

One sound I need to specifically highlight and give extra credit to is; Chargers. OHMYGOD, they sound horrific and I absolutely love it! Their movement sounds, breathing, it's so unsettling even when you've heard them a 100 times before. I love them so much.

I also feel like I need to add context; Creatures will essentially give you a warning with “flashing” (a glow on certain parts of their body whilst they're sleeping, as a warning that they are aware of you), and a “beating” sound, when they are now quite aware of you moving/making noises/flashing your torches at them. You get the 2 stage warning before they scream and wake themselves and everyone else around.

[b]Menu[/b]: Extremely clean, great intro into the game and honestly sets the tone extremely well. A nice array of settings to fiddle with, and they give you every option you could want to add friends into your game. Copying lobby code, invite through steam and/or matchmaking which is still in it's early stages.

[b]Final Conclusion[/b]: I finally owed writing a review for this game, considering it is in my 10 top favorite games of all time. 

GTFO, does not care for your incompetence, if you cannot learn from your mistakes, learn how to deal with the enemies that are presented to you, maps, tactical placements of your gear, you will not win. I like to annoy people with calling this “The Dark Souls of Shooters”, and honestly whilst I started that as a meme, It's fairly true. 

GTFO is difficult, and it takes pride in being that. It takes pride in the fact you will spend up to 4 hours on a run, to make one mistake and have to restart the whole thing, but somehow, it's never punishing enough that you don't want to play it, you see exactly where you went wrong, and how to correct it when you try again.. Not many games have that, and it's one of my favorite parts of this game that shines above most.

Further things I want to highlight; no perks, no cosmetics, no DLC's (they update the game with new rundowns and get rid of the old level packs as time goes by, so you have a constant variation of levels to play through), the whole game stands well enough on it's own and has solid gunplay, gameplay and even just that smidge of story hidden amongst the cracks to make it a well rounded, fun, engaging experience. 

Nothing beats that “Expedition Survived” screen though, and once you've triumphed through it all, that screen is the best thing you will ever see.

Now with all that aside, this game definitely isn't for everyone, and it genuinely plays and feels better when you have a consistent team. You build new strats together, communication flows better, I can't imagine this being fun with randoms, but they have a tone of servers for players looking for people to join them, and now they have matchmaking through popular demand. I understand that having 3-4 people to play with isn't an easy thing to have.

Also something else to note; GTFO does NOT scale. It is the same difficulty all the way through (They have added even more content and challenge with extra higher difficulties and areas to explore and complete). 
Enemies also are partly randomly generated, but levels will have specific caps and requirements (e.g 1 scout, 1 titan, 20 sleepers) so enemies will not be in the same place, unless it's one of the level specific mutants, even then it can still be in a different area. 

Whilst I've seen this game get a lot of flack over not scaling to less players, it honestly would not work, and it would not be the game they have wonderfully crafted to this point. It needs that brutal, cooperative experience, that will probably start arguments with your friends.

This is a labor of love, you can tell. I can't praise the developers enough for making an early access game feel more polished and be one of the best co-op games I've played to date (Which by the way, there are (last I checked) 9 developers working on this game. 9!!!) GTFO honestly deserve so much more praise and love than it gets and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tactical shooters that offer a challenge with friends!",1611798811,1700838243,True,117,1,0.876062870025634766,10,True,False,False

It is very fun and challenging. If you like playing hard video games, this is the game for you. I have 21 hours in the game and I haven't even beat half of the levels in this game yet because there's so many missions. There is no difficulty setting in the sense that the mobs will always deal the same amount of damage no matter which mission you choose. You cannot go from ""hard"" to ""easy"". The difficulty however lies in the mission you select. Each mission has a depth, and the deeper you go, the more enemies you will encounter and there will also sometimes be secondary and ""overload"" objectives that can heavily increase a mission's difficulty. Currently, the only purpose for doing these side objectives are for personal satisfaction. Granted, it does feels great when you beat them. Some missions contain harder map conditions like intense, thick fog, poison gas, pitch black darkness, or a lack of resources.

If you have any basic experience with command prompt for Windows OS it will help a little bit. You have to use the in game computers to locate items and resources. I recommend watching a guide on terminals if you aren't familiar with command prompt at all. You can also just type ""commands"" on a terminal and it will tell you all the functions you can do at that specific terminal.

The guns are fun, and the stealthy melee combat aspect feels fantastic. There are some missions where you are forced to go ""loud"" the entire mission where you defend an objective such as a nuclear reactor. Some missions you should preferably stealth as much as you can to conserve resources like ammo/health and extract after you gather the required materials in order to unlock extraction.

Out of the missions I've played so far, the gameplay loop is basically this:
1. Stealth to enemy zombie and bash it in the back of the head.
2. Communicate with your teammates on where the zombies are, and if necessary, 3-2-1 a group of zombies at once.
3. Progress through the level and eventually you will reach a door with an alarm. This means that you have to now go ""loud"" for at least a few waves of zombies that will rush your position. These zombies are omnipotent in the sense that you can't hide from them (just like all zombies that are alerted of your position in this game.)

Alternatively, you could also go loud in every mission, for the entire mission, but this isn't recommended as you will run out of ammo for the alarm doors. Some missions have tons of alarm doors.

Teamwork based horror game, 9/10. Shame this game doesn't have more players, I think the price tag and lack of advertising is what is making it feel unpopular. There is also no PvP in this game, although there is friendly fire so technically, there could be if you and a friend are fucking around at extract.",1688096973,1700644291,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

If you think this game is like l4d2 oh boy your in for a ride (R5E1). 

For single player's - If your gonna play the game alone cuz you don't have any friends it will be very hard, you will mostly play with bots. Or you can solo, but alarm doors over level III will change your mind, it shows how 1 person lacks to do everything themselves, so you need help from the bots or players, after all this is a team based game for a reason. 

Rundowns - There is only 7 rundowns which has several expeditions ranked with difficulty of A to E tier. 

-A tier -You can win the whole A tier expedition with bots easily, and you can solo some of the A tier expedition but not all of em. And all tiers have main mission, secondary, overcharge.
You can win main mission with bots but you need real players for secondary and overcharge this applies to all tier's cuz secondary and overcharge makes the game very hard. For example secondary and overcharge makes A tier like B or C tier . B tier like C,D and so on.

-B tier - Spikes the difficulty up a little bit, but you still can win the whole expedition with bots but it wont be that easy like A tier. You can solo few B tier expedition but it will be very hard and time consuming. Average time to complete an expedition for solo players takes over 2 to 3 hours and the time increase when tier's go up. It will normally take 2 hour or less to win an expedition with bots. With real players it will be an hour or less but only in A,B,C tier. D,E and tier is built different.

-C tier- Is when you see the flaw of the game you cant't solo you need teamwork, bots can't do that you need real people to win this tier and onward. You can win some C tier with bots but it wont be like B tier. And forget about soloing it. Every rundown combined has over 14% success rate so you can see how difficult this game is. And if you lose an expedition you lose all the progress u made in that expedition let's say u lost 2 hours of progress u do that from the beginning again, 2 hours wasted quite hard isn't it?, cuz there is no checkpoint in this game only Rundown 6 And Rundown 7 have em so losing is not an option.

-D tier - Oh boy this is where hell starts, you ain't gonna win D tier with bots. You need 4 people to get a better chance of winning or at least having better experience of the game. It's better to get destroyed with other people than getting wrecked with bots alone at least real people will know your pain. And If you don't have any friends you can use the official GTFO discord server to find people to play with cuz the matchmaking in this gane doesn't work.

-E tier - Yeah chief i don't wanna talk about it. You either GTFO together or die together.",1690359466,1700536877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Genuinely, it's likely one of my favorite games ever.
It's challenging, but without being too heavily aim based, which is fantastic for me, since I have some issues making it so I can't aim very consistently.
The sneaking, the planning, and the awareness I have to have is my favorite thing about games, and this one does it so well! Avoiding enemies, the 'alert levels' of them, learning how to avoid and kill things without waking everything up... It's all done beautifully.
Also, they added subtitles. Which is extremely nice, because I had no idea what was happening for a few levels without them.

The one downside?
You need a full team of four to finish certain levels.

Now, it does let you play with strangers and team up! However, if you're like me, you may not enjoy teaming up with other people, which means you end up stuck with a team of full AI, or, in my case, one friend and two AI.
The AI order controls aren't exactly easy to remember if you don't play often, though I would say they're fairly good at their jobs of helping you without carrying you.

Genuinely that's my only issue. I just really dislike being forced to play with strangers in order to finish all the levels and unlock new ones.And while I could certainly use better aim, no amount of me being better is going to fix enemies coming from multiple angles when all my AI are dead. 

If you're thinking of getting this game, I completely recommend it! But maybe get a friend (or three) to also commit to it.",1700272132,1700272132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll admit I'm not the best, and nor are my friends, but a lot of the gameplay decisions just seem incredibly strange to me. Having a horde-like enemy that has a range-based attack instead of mauling you with their obvious mouths is such a missed opprotunity. Not spawning in with full ammunition/supplies just makes things far too reliant on RNG/scrounging literally every nook and cranny just to be at maximum capacity. Not to mention the massive time commitment each level takes, if you know where everything is, you can probably get through it in less than 20 minutes, but each mission for my group has taken us anywhere between 30 minutes to a couple of hours, and that's not including retries and restarts. The game does not respect your time at all.

Sterling game so far, even playing solo with 3 bots. One of the initial draws of this game for me was the ostensibly crisp sound design, weighty gun animations, satisfying hit registration, tension, atmosphere and more. All these points have been all but confirmed for me as I played through R1A1, B1 and B2 and tested the various weapons and tools. The stealth aspect of the game has tension that is palpable and requires target prioritization, patience and sometimes boldness with a hint of luck to get through. When things do go to hell in a handbasket, which they tend to do, the subsequent panic and scramble sure gets those adrenal glands working overtime.

Also, I don't know who designs the sounds for this game but they sure as hell are doing a bang up job of it. From the monsters to the ambiance to the guns etc, it's all a bunch of juicy goodness. The visuals are rather striking as well and it all helps build this ominous, ""we shouldn't be here"" and ""let's just go home instead"" atmosphere.

One relatively small but important part of the experience worth mentioning is the feeling that washes over you should you successfully extract and the marvelous theme that plays along. This absolute banger aids in the release of a huge amount of dopamine which in conjunction with the adrenaline simmering down creates a very special feeling of triumph. It all comes together very nicely as the tension that's been kept up is suddenly released and you can finally exhale after 1-3 hours.

While the bots might not be the sharpest tools in the shed, they are serviceable and very useful for hordes. I can't speak for the experience with randoms or friends but considering the overall performance of the bots, I can only imagine it is better as advanced sapient-to-sapient communication and coordination becomes an actual option.

All in all, I am very pleased with this game and can only imagine how fun it would be with a dedicated team of friends. If you play with bots it might stifle the potential fun a fair amount depending on your preferences and temperament but for me it works very well anyway and so I still recommend it for solo.

Sneaking through rooms to find keys while smashing the heads of sleeping AI gets tedious quickly.

Unit variety similar to left4dead special zombies or trap units like those in back4blood (or barnacles in half-life) would add greatly to this game's replayability and require players to be more aware of their surroundings and more strategic in their navigation of spaces throughout the map.

From what little I've had a chance to experience, I can safely say that having unlocked missions is a good change.
I haven't been forced into constant infinite enemies as mid mission quirks
Invisible enemies are still genuinely well implemented even when mixed with regular enemies. I still appreciate that turrets can't see them unless they're biotracked.
Unfortunately I'm still seeing scouts spawning past blood doors. This time it was an optional blood door we could ignore, but come on. Don't do that. I don't think its that hard to add some spawning rules to prevent that. Exploiting doors and audio range to kill a blood door without pissing off the scout in the same room is something I shouldn't feel compelled to do, not that we did this time.

Level design is kinda..eh. Seeing a staircase go down into an empty pit, where you climb another staircase so you can access a terminal, then climb down a ladder immediately after the terminal so you can climb up the next staircase that goes back up to the area/height you were just at is...uninspiring. You could at least try.
Enemies are still awkward climbing ladders but at least we haven't been funneled into ladders, and normal enemies have something approaching an animation. Regardless the end result is they kind of just pop up on top of you, so ladders are something you avoid like the plague.
Had a scout pop up a ladder on us again, fortunately it didn't instantly deploy but I'm going to say its probably not a great design to watch the icon of a biotracked scout go from the ground below you almost directly on top of you in an instant.
I still do not like how ladders are implemented, especially since they're still haphazardly placed around the maps in places that don't make much sense - I have seen maybe 10 sensible ladders and the rest are just kind of there to justify their own existence.

Level gimmicks could do with more emphasis on the exploration thing.
Every game is a looter shooter or other generic shooty shooty. I want to see more emphasis on actually fun stuff like being teleported, having all of the lights turn off, having to do stuff in awful fog, making us go back through the level after having the mission objective alter it (like, say, turning the lights off?) or the fun twists where you go through a mission full of normal enemies and get to a hold the position objective wondering where the enemies are until a shadow bites your ankles off. More of that, please.

The old gripes from previous review versions:
 - Telegraphing infinite enemies, especially in mid-mission optional objectives.
Telegraph them appropriately, or don't do them. Doesn't help your stealth teamwork game when you can just end your 20-40 minute run because you decided you were doing well and wanted to see what the bonus was, and the bonus spawns infinite enemies in rooms with scouts and you're not even half way through the main mission yet.
 - Scout motion doors: Looks like its still a problem, but the one we encountered was an optional loot door so we happily ignored it.
 - Ladders are still poorly implemented both mechanically and as actual map features
 - Error alarms are fine.
 - The invisible enemies I had heard about and dreaded turned out to be actually good.

tl;dr game has some unpolished bull, like scouts behind motion doors and very badly implemented ladders. The level design is pretty weak overall and the game could seriously help itself by having way more missions with interesting twists like turning the lights off or changing the enemy type on us, less generic horde or run to spawn endings. Make us stealth through a horde of scouts to get back to spawn and if we screw it up have to run and hold the line. Do something interesting.

I'm stubborn and more of a perfectionist than I'd like to admit, still can't really recommend.
Once you get beyond the terminals the game starts to feel pretty hollow pretty fast, still fun if you have 3 friends who know how to hold the left mouse button and take their hands off the keyboard when you tell them to.",1633245139,1698827780,False,5,1,0.499787658452987671,4,True,False,False

If you like a co-op survival horror shooter that's like if Alien Isolation cheated on Metal Gear Solid with Squid Game and had a misshapen lovechild, then this is your game! Also, if you do have some command prompt experience, keep that knowledge tucked in the back of your head. You'll thank me later.

Right off the bat, the game has a steep learning curve, so expect to die... a lot. But, once you get the hang of the basics, the planning stages are where it's at. The resource boxes, items, and boosters are randomly generated as well, so no experience in the same stage is quite the same. You also have full access to the loadout, so experiment to your heart's content. But of course, while one gun has strengths, so, too, does it have weaknesses. So plan accordingly!

I'll be honest, though. If you don't have the patience for a slow, methodical game, then this might not be for you. There are bunches of runs where I would be hours deep into a rundown, nearly complete it, then die at the last moment only to restart from the very beginning. It's frustrating, but it's still fun nonetheless. Just that sweet taste of victory after fighting through a hard grueling run feels so good! 

But, I do implore you to at least look up some videos of gameplay and see if it's your thing. What got me into it was watching Markiplier solo the very first stage in one of the early access rundowns (which was probably at GTFO's hardest). This vid was... I think 2 or 3 years ago? But anyway, that's my review. If you do get it, good luck! You're gonna need it.

The quote ""Work together or Die together"" is not just here for the ""cool"" effect, the whole game is based on cooperation and communication with your team.
You have little resources, you don't even start each level with full ammo, and you'll need to look around to find stuff helping your team stay alive. Share ammo, health kits before one teammate goes down, because the whole team might follow.
Using terminals to search for items and objectives through some useful commands can and will help you be more effective.

You are encouraged to choose your fights, either be sneaky, stealthily eliminate targets with your melee or prepare well before triggering the whole room. Because all the different kinds of monsters will be legion and ruthless against you.
Sometimes, you will have to defend yourself against waves of enemies until you complete an objective to progress.

The game is meant to be played with other people to have the ""real"" experience, but there are bots filling the team that you can control with quick orders. They do the bare minimum, so get yourself some team mates.

For the Lore-looking rats like me, there are hints and dialogues telling you a bit about what's going on, but the real treasure will be hidden in terminals.

Overall, the game can be pretty rough at the start, but once you begin understanding how it works, I can assure you that it is a blast.

The marketing will have you believe that this is a no punches pull tactical co-op game. It simply is not. The fact that all the levels that have ever been released have been beaten solo, is evidence against that. If you want the true GTFO experience, you need to play with 3 other people that have never played the game before. And (at least for me) that is unrealistic. (without sales) This game is $30. Having your group spend a total of $120 on a game that you might not even like, is a bit to far fetched for me. If you REALLY want to play this game, Just play modded. And if you have to turn to a modded community for good content, I wont recommend the game. All of that being said, I will not stop playing this game anytime soon.

-Great and challenging stealthy version of the classic Left4Dead2 Horde style game.
-Most likely need friends who are down for a challenge
-Great Community Discord for help

PROS
-Aesthetically great monster design
-Lore is there for you to find in a thematic way if you pursue it
-Gunplay is top tier
-Challenging rush of adrenaline
-Lots of missions that all have unique circumstances and challenges to throw at the players

CONS
-Need at least 2 other friends to join for an optimal experience in my opinion (community discord is there to help but the popularity of this game isnt too high so getting someone isnt always happening)
-The aesthetic can seem like a bunch of generic assets to some, one of my friends had this wrong opinion and I will just mention it
-Some may find the challenge not fun",1698066544,1698066544,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You need to have at least one friend, but a full four-man is no longer needed if you're used to shooters that make you manage your resources more tightly.  3 players is a decent sweet spot, as the bots AI has been improved a fair amount, and they will now pickup and apply med/ammo packs themselves based on the person with lowest stores. Its honestly pretty helpful, inaddition to using the q menu to control them, I could see even playing this 1 player like a squad strategy game being fun at times, though puzzles may get frustrating. 

I wholeheartedly recommend this game if your looking for a very atmospheric and creepy horde shooter with stealth and puzzle elements. Honestly is legitimately scary sometimes. The fog maps f**k me up. Honestly a really fresh take and a unique game. There's some cool lore here to find too.

Aight, so I jumped into ""GTFO"", expecting some run-of-the-mill horror action. But man, as I descended deeper, it felt like I was diving into the heart of Russia itself, facing its rawest realities. Ain't just monsters down there; it's like battling life on them tough Russian streets.

Every dark corridor, every violent, naked monster coming at me, hungrily – felt like tales I heard 'bout life in Russia's underground. The struggle’s real, man, and it's cold as hell. But here's where it gets wild: amidst the shadows, there’s this... unsettling sexual excitement. Like, these creatures ain't just after your life; they're thirsting for more.

Man, I was prepped for some scares, but wasn’t expecting this kind of adult terror. The Russian depths are hiding more than just vodka and secrets; there's raw, erotic energy lurking in the shadows. Makes you wonder about them cold Russian nights, and what really goes down when the lights go out.

So, if you think you’re ready for a trip through Russia's raw, sensual, and terrifying underbelly, give ""GTFO"" a spin. But if you ain't ready to face the erotic horrors waiting in the dark, might wanna rethink that descent. Keep ya head up and always remember – Mother Russia doesn't play.

Otherwise, you never see those types, and what you see instead is regulars who really enjoy this game. I think GTFO hints at the future of gaming. I think we all really revelled in this world of being distanced and non-talkative after 2014 or so, the gaming frontface became moba games where no one talks and everyone flames, the lacking identity facilitated flame and grief, and then there's games like this that ask you to implement your Discord and ordain that you use voice chat or you'll never make it, and I think GTFO is this excellent form of turning cogs in your head that may otherwise collect cobwebs if you're used to a world of no one listening, because this game is either one listens and wins or they don't and die. and, no one queues up with people who don't talk off the initial, so I feel that this was an ingenius form of perhaps not anti-cheat, but definitely anti-grief- you vet who you're playing with, if they don't talk they get kicked, if they do talk and are mean, bratty or rude they are kicked, and it all self-moderates itself. Biggest hurdle is utilizing the manual matchmaking system through the Discord channel, but once that leap of faith is done, the game plays well, never crashes, and there's a community with their own favorite missions. I really enjoy the darkness and the gun sounds/fx/visuals in this game.

8/10, it sat in my library for two years collecting dust because of those matchmaking hurdles, brushed it off, learned the Discord technicals, got in a match finally, played it, loved it, wrote this review for it. Only thing that rubs me wrong is when people are so good at the game that they're just sherpa'ing people around to no gain, unimmersed and making irrelevant talk about life/politics really nerdy-like instead of immersing themselves into the game and verbalizing as they see stimulus instead of holding a conversation about the strengths and weaknesses of Doritos vs. Pringles while hard-carrying 3 people around the map, but that only happened one time and I doubt that something like that will happen again. Losing a game hits kinda hard in this videogame, but winning has it's intensity and the triumph has its' own unique feeling.

As is the game is incredibly challenging with the deepest missions proving to be impossible without extreme skill, luck, and circumstance on your side with a team of 4 experienced players. The enemy types are diverse and engaging with the exception of the ""melee"" units. There are explicitly ranged enemy types that are balanced and manageable, however the units intended to physically hit you instead get a mid range (longer than your short range melee) homing tongue attack that is difficult to dodge if not outright impossible. This game would be a great survival exploration horde shooter if only the horde was tolerable. You will find yourself getting killed due to the homing mid ranged attacks sweeping around corners and them scurrying around in the darkness outside of melee reach. The melee giants as well have an even longer range, even higher damage, ""melee"" homing attack that can easily bring you down, with their actual melee attacks being even more lethal. The game doesn't have a difficulty system and instead opts for the ""deeper"" you go the harder it gets. Meaning from the jump everything will feel extremely strong and difficult. I would highly recommend this game given certain conditions:
Have at LEAST one friend to play with (recommended to have more)
Be willing to redo the same mission repeatedly sometimes to a frustrating degree
Be willing to find teammates to play with (most likely thru their discord server)
Be extremely patient and cautious
Willingness to commit 40+ minutes to certain runs.

This game is a very atmospheric and beautiful game that has a unique game play loop, it has a very intriguing story (which is tied to each mission meaning some story parts will be out of reach), and super fun and engaging weapon and melee mechanics and systems. The aesthetic, UI, and feel of the game is top notch. A constant and consistent stream of new content to enjoy. Given the correct balancing and tuning, a super reliable and consistent game to enjoy. AS IS:PLEASE PLAY BELOW 2 HOURS TO REFUND IF UNHAPPY, there is a very significant risk that that may be the case and 2 hours should be enough to get a very rough feel of how the game feels even at later stages.

Bots are a poor substitute for human players, and while the design is required to be more niche than a standard FPS bot, they're pretty bad. They will definitely get you killed, and some missions (i.e. enemy types) are functionally impossible to complete with them due to their limited functionality. They sometimes glitch out and fail to react when being attacked, or experience difficulty when enemies make it within melee range. If a player is down they lose all sense of self-preservation and commit suicide to make the revive. Certain items are not subject to your commands and they will waste them on cleared rooms, while refusing to use them in crowded rooms (lock melters).

Visually, it's a masterpiece. The underground tunnels and the horrifying monster designs are so well done that they give you the creeps. Every step you take, you're on edge, and that's what makes it so thrilling.

But the real magic is in the teamwork. You're not just playing with your buddies; you're surviving with them. Planning tactics, sharing resources, and watching each other's backs become second nature. It's like being in a high-stakes action movie, and you're the star.

The difficulty level is no joke, and that's what I love about it. Every mission feels like a massive challenge that pushes your team to the limit. And when you finally overcome those challenges, the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched.

(Making this review for people who don't know what the game is all about but heard that it's a hard game)

For people who don't know what this game is about, it basically is an inherently cooperative-heavy ""strategic"" ""stealth"" shooter game with a huge focus on using any means to complete the tasks.

Note that I emphasize the word ""strategic"" and ""stealth"", because while you definitely must shoot a sh*tload to survive the horde, the focus is more on the strategic side and proper communication with your teammates than anything else. Most of the time, you're preparing your gear/guns/boosters, gathering information via terminals, setting up mines/sentry guns, planning your return route, managing resources, and stealthily bashing sleepers' head. (And, oh boy, you will have to play stealth 90% of the time for sure if you want to maintain your survival rate.)
All of which wouldn't matter if you didn't properly communicate with your team and trust them with your life.

[h2]Control = Tag-of-War[/h2]
Usually, there are two phases. You either fight to gain control of a room or you desperately try to plan a way to gain control of another room. It's a dynamic where you don't need to exhaust yourself with adrenaline rush from start to finish, but you now have anxiety that won't g away until you complete the entire mission. The game knows and basically makes the missions either 30 minutes long or 1.5++ hours long, no in-between (exaggeration but you get the gist). You will get sucked right in and have no way out until you gain all the control you need for the mission; then, you just need to GTFO of that level.

[h2]Enemy Noises = Ally[/h2]
Admittedly, apart from some missions, you're generally living in the darkness. Being stealthy is a good idea since your ammo is very limited. So, you need to use melee weapons instead. The dynamics of the weapons are nice and all that, but to take hits, you need to be careful with your steps. Utilize their heartbeat and squishy noises to detect their activities, because if they detect your presence, you need to blast your irons. Fast.

[h2]Risk != Reward[/h2]
What if you don't want to stealth? What about going around shooting everything down and showing them who's the boss? Well, sit down, tough guy. This game doesn't care about you. No matter how risky or safe your playthrough is, if you or your teammates screw up, everything's over. You could have spent your entire afternoon on a single mission, but if you get horded unprepared, your progress becomes null. That's why (in my opinion) this game is hard (apart from tedious ""hacking"" and troublesome enemy types), as the high risk can ruin your sanity real fast, and failing rewards you with a nuh-uh.

[h2]Game = Recommended (with a *)[/h2]
All in all, it's a very nice experience where you're thrown into whatever hellhole you signed up for and bet your life on the line with your plan and strategy. If you are a masochist (like me and friends who convinced me into buying this game), you will love it. [b]*BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE TO CO-OP WITH*[/b], as this aspect is extremely crucial to actually passing a mission with consistency. If you have no friends, go to the Discord server and find yourself mates to jump in and suffer together with you. I guarantee the pain, suffering, and fun will keep you going no matter how hard the game is.

To sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's kinda like a Dark Souls version of Left 4 Dead lol.

I was playing this during its early access period (mainly rundown 5). To say the least, this isn't for the impatient or those looking for fast-paced action. Even with the addition of bots and many QoL improvements post-launch, this is a game that asks you to be slow, methodical, and most of all, a team-player. You will be stealthing most of the time. There is also no progression in the game outside cosmetics. 

If you have at least one other patient friend, you're okay with failing a majority of the time, and you're one that enjoys challenges, this is a very unique game for you that no other game fills. The teamwork successes in this game are incredibly satisfying, the atmosphere is tense, and the gameplay feels so tightly fine-tuned, I can't help but marvel at what this game is, and what it offers.",1640144340,1696696223,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Playing solo is not the greatest idea, there's little player scaling, so you'll be expected to fight of the horde of creatures meant for a 4 man squad, all on your own. Sure, there's bots, but they're not the sharpest tools in the shed.

This game is insanely hardcore. A single mistake in a plan or alerted monster could be the end of your run. Quick thinking and a competent team is essential to play.

Gunplay is slightly above average. The crosshairs are pretty unreliable, and ammo is sparse, but shoot well and you might just make it. There's a rotating selection of weapons for each rundown, so you wont get bored with the same gun.

Personally, that price tag isn't worth it if you plan on playing alone. If you plan on going with a squad of friends, make sure you guys are all certain you really want to play. That one guy who doesn't want to play could be the deciding factor on if you escape or not.

Great difficult Coop FPS survival horror with an emphasis on stealth, coordination, decision-making, strategy, tactics, efficiency, and communication.

If you hate stealth, you will likely not enjoy the game.

Recommended to have:
1. A good mic for voice chat
2. Friends/ teammates to play the level with (up to 4 players)
3. A lot of time to commit to finishing a run (20m-3h)

For Point #1:
There is text chat and a radio commands system as an alternative to a mic, but voice chat using a mic is strongly recommended especially for communicating objective related 'passwords'.

For Point #2: 
There are AI bots you could give basic commands to do stuff, but good players are almost always better than them. 

There is a matchmaking system, but I recommend joining the official discord server to look for players or join games. They have Looking For Group channels for many regions (NA, latin america, E. EU, W. EU, Asia, Oceania, Africa) and an LFG channel for beginners.


For Point #3:
Knowledge of the levels, events, enemies, mechanics, and team familiarity will make playthroughs go faster. 

Rundown levels are ordered vertically by Alphabet and horizontally by Numbers, with the  difficulty increasing from top to bottom. Main Story levels are the 1s (i.e. A1, B1, C1, and D1), which are required to be completed to access the higher number levels in each tier (A2, B2, B3, ...) and provide a good vertical slice for newer players and introduce cool mechanics/ gimmicks to existing players. The 1s have a more detailed objective direction and terminal usage hints which helps new players learn.

A 'Checkpoint scan' system was added to help reduce the frustration of spending a lot of time repeating the easier parts of a level, and, IMO, as a balancing element against first time surprises, mistakes, level RNG, and random BS happening.


Lastly, there are Anti-Kiting measures in the game in the form of Heartbeat monitor above the health which is elevated during combat situations, when you spam bunnyhops, or sprint for too long. Strafe Running (e.g. holding W+A or W+D) was nerfed, locking you to walking speeds. Dodging (Shift+A, Shift+D, Shift+S) seems to be faster but covers less distance as well. Sliding does not seem to affect the Anti-Kiting measures much, but I might be wrong.",1577451603,1696199272,True,1,0,0.528301894664764404,0,True,False,False

I can not express enough how happy it makes me to have good bots that are programmed well and the ability to issue commands and change their gear to play with in Co-Op that are not made to intentionally suck and sabotage you because the devs want to force you into matchmaking with randoms. As a Aliens Fireteam Elite and World War Z vet, thank you for finally understanding.
Game has way more immersion and atmosphere than so many AAA titles. Including Baldur's Gate 3.
I can see why they decided not to add female characters to the game, and I can accept that. I would love if they did add females, but perhaps this is for the best to avoid... Certain issues. Behaviour by certain people over certain things honestly makes me feel disgusted.

Difficulty of enemies, the challenges of the maps, scouts, barnacles (Whatever they're called), all fine, scary, and thrilling to combat and overcome. The challenge modes add replayability and me and my friends loved trying them out and doing the super hard ones (we will always remember the immense chaos we had during our first OVERLOAD level)

But it's just that infected fog that just ends our sessions too early too often. No issues with regular fog it makes the game challenging as you can't see the enemy, making you play slow and meticulous. However when you take damage every nanosecond you're in the poison fog it ruins any plans to consolidate your resources you've been saving for the potentially worse engagements you will have deeper in the facility, and thats a big issue when ammo, medical, and tool packs are rare to start. When this gimmick is literally constant for most of the rest of the rundowns then the success of your session might all come down to RNG based on how many fog repellers the lockers and crates contain before you take your first dive. 

Hope infected fog becomes less of a cheap ""Obstacle"" gimmick to be seen in rundown 8.",1695778567,1695778567,False,21,2,0.640099465847015381,0,True,False,False

So we have to restart till finally they are able to see each other. Little annoying, but doesn't ruin the experience.

Once you've delivered enough solid content to Payday 2 it is time to start your own company and remake the genre from the ground up. And this time it is better. While Payday 2 lost its way halfway through its life with abundant and out of place DLC, GTFO maintains a strong direction.

This game is horror, teamwork, and gameplay mashed into a hardcore combination. From the moment you boot up the game you experience a unique atmosphere. It is graphically fantastic, optimized, and scary all at the same time.

GTFO takes real teamwork. If you're unable to gather a group of four you likely won't be able to experience the whole game. This is the reality of the game's approach to hardcore co-op. Though this is punishing for anybody who would like to gather a quick-match group, spend some time alone, or enjoy a game with a single friend, the satisfaction of having a reliable group is huge. A group of four will have a fantastic time with this game as they spend all afternoon retrying the same mission over and over until their practice and perseverance pay off. The fantastic gunplay, appealing visuals, tried co-op mission design, and the unique mechanics make this experience a real reward. 

The hardcore approach of GTFO is punishing for the unacquainted, but it is a gift for those that put in the time. You might die after only three or four hits when you are recklessly shooting enemies in the legs, and you might lose valuable health when jumping from ledges. However, you will also understand the level's layout after a few scuffed runs, and you will learn how to approach each door's challenges after they've beaten you down a few times. This is the kind of design that makes failure a rewarding experience. This allows you to jump into each level for the joy of playing it, and the fun of the gameplay is the primary reward. This is the focus that has unfortunately become secondary in many games, but GTFO is here to remind you of what playing a game should feel like.

10 Chambers Collective has given everybody a gift. At the least, they have earned their $30 from anybody that is interested in co-op shooters. GTFO is one of the best games that I've played in a long time. It is not afraid to appeal to a certain audience, and it does not try to apologize for it either. Everything that this game does makes a cohesive and enjoyable experience that truly is worth something. I am excited to have found the game, and I'm looking forward to all the future content that I can trust this developer to create.",1593450370,1695394972,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,True

I've played this game since old Rundown 2 in Early Access, played solo, with people and with bots after 1.0.

The core gameplay is fun, I really like 4 player co-op games and this one brings us a unique experience, combining stealth and adrenaline rush combat. Killing the creeps is satisfying, the looting is ok, I could imagine a bit more variable item spawn, but it's still good. The weapons are fun to use, the voicelines are really good in my opinion. There is ""no"" or deep lore to hunt, so after this time, still have questions about what the game is about etc., and it only gives you hints, which is sad i think, but not a main issue.

The main issues are the level design, the bots, weapon balancing, too many bugs, and the repetitive objectives. Even though I know the reason why the level design is like this, there is no variety, there is no new layout, new rooms, I can tell you what is the whole map's layout I'm playing on by first sight. The weapons are really unbalanced and most of them useless. There are 16 main weapons, 13 special weapons, and almost all of them are useless. Few of them are very situational, most of them are just weak and useless everytime. The soundtrack was better for me in early access, I don't like the current ones, but this doesn't count as an issue, completely subjective. But the bots are the most stupid entities I've ever met in a video game. The pathfinding is terrible, they are always glitching, they never do what they should. They usually go through the doors and stuck on the other side. An enemy somehow reacts when I kill one even though they are separated with huge distance. The fall damage is a joke, you fall 2 meters and you get 15 fall damage. I often meet the bug when I see only the skybox while I'm standing right between 2 rooms. The sounds and music often bugs out, the enemies often stuck into the wall. The objectives are very repetitive and boring, that's one of the reason the maps are pretty bad. R2D2 and R3A3 are completely the same, R1D1 and R5D1 are the same and so on.. There are only a few maps that I can call unique at this moment. The matchmaking is non-functionable (only when a new rundown comes out, and Rundown 8 will be the last), and the only way to play with people is through Discord. At least we have this option, but it shouldn't be the default. The optional objectives (extreme and overload) could be fun, IF they would be unique AND fun.

GTFO is an early access game disguised as a full game. It's full of bugs, broken promises, performance and gameplay issues since its inception, and continues to this day. Its design is so broken, a game made 10 years ago has done it better.

What GTFO is advertised as : Unique and challenging Co-op horror shooter with emphasis on stealth and totally not a run and gun game.

What GTFO actually is : A (literal) run and gun game with peashooters and blindfolds.

Every single level in this game is a different variation of : get in, clear a room, perform a scan (which trigger an unskippable horde until the scan is cleared or other task is done) then extract. You spent a majority of this time (upwards of 20 minutes) crouchwalking everywhere and waiting for the timing to kill enemies, fight horde and then crouchwalk for 20 minutes again. After a few mission the immersiveness and horror element fade away quickly to be replaced by frustrations and boredom when one mistake or bad wave spawn kills you randomly and you're thrown back to the lobby. Most map in this game is very dark, making exploration extremely slow if you want to play it safe. Some even have fogs that limit your vision to melee range and some fogs even gives you poison status that limits your max health. Very often you are forced to perform stealth kills or fight hordes in these fogs with no workarounds. Even then, sometimes stealth is made pointless with some levels giving you so much resources that you can just wake up every room and still have enough ammo to spare for every scans and hordes you will meet (with enough map knowledge).

The enemy design in this game is absolutely horrendous. Regular enemy move way too erratically. Every shot make them stumbles in random direction making precise shot impossible. Body-shot kills drains like half a mags on some guns and even less precise option like shotguns only works on super point blank ranges to the weak point making gun play miserable. This is not to mention the completely wacky AI all enemies have. Very often the enemies will just walk past you completely to get the guy behind (since they seems to lock on to random players and only go for that guy) some big enemies can just randomly do a double hit (lethal at 80% hp, is a bug and isn't fixed) and more dumb behavior like them not being able to hear sounds through a closing door or the fact that weak points in this game is destructible. Yes you can accidentally shoot a giants head out and have it continuing walking at you, ruining your sniper's ability to one-shot kill it because it needs to be a headshot and no, shooting out the enemy limbs or legs don't lower their damage or slow them down. This game's gunplay boils down to you and 3 people shooting sandbags with bbguns til someone has to reload and you die. You'd get a more satisfying gun play and interesting/engaging enemy design out of L4D than this

Speaking of L4D(2) lets talk solo experience. L4D is best played with friends obviously but there are bots to help with solo play and so is GTFO. The difference between the two however, is shocking. GTFO bots are completely horrible and unreliable. They have tendencies to walk into hordes of 15+ enemies with their melee weapon (as they are programmed to use melee as soon as enemy walks close to them). They are also limited to fire in bursts (even against hordes) and is incapable of using some tools properly. When available, they will attempt to use supplies on you (even against hordes and even when you are near full ammo on some of your guns which often cause massive waste of resources). They will attempt to fire their weapon at the slightest, smallest line of sight from practically infinite range. If they hold a shotgun, they will try to shoot an enemy 50 meters away if they can see it. They will also try to shoot enemies through closed doors. If you are down, all 3 bots will try to revive you simultaneously (even when there's enemy attacking do you see the pattern yet). In L4D if you are down, only one bot will try to revive you while the other provide cover fire, a curious behaviour programmed into a 10 year old game that can't be replicated in this game for some reason. GTFO bots are also very prone to friendly fire. They will unload their guns into you without a second thought. They also have tendencies to just randomly move in front of you when you are firing, instantly dies to burst weapons or sniper fire. Oh and did you know the devs used to say this game will never have bots ? Funny how that turned out.

Now lets say you bought the game anyway and wanted to play with other people, great. In-game matchmaking is a mess and straight up doesn't work. Why is there a ""matchmaking"" for a PVE game with multiple levels people may want to complete you may ask ? No one knows. The really funny part is however, the developer's solution. That being having you, the player, simply join their discord and look for party there. DMing host or post your own LFG messages in the channels. Sometimes the party is already full, maybe they already started, good luck figuring that out. Why don't this game have an in-game lobby browser when practically every shooter in the past 20 years have this ? No one knows.

Overall GTFO is a complete failure in both technical and gameplay. Failing completely to do anything right except being ""difficult"". It is as if a person look at dark souls, think the only reason why the series sees success is its difficulty, decided to make a souls clone where the character moves at a snails pace, takes forever to swing his sword, dies in a few hits with limited healing and call it a challenge. I wouldn't even have problem with that if the game at least ""works"" half the time. Every play session I have had with this game is plagued with technical issues from lags or visual glitch that makes the game unplayable. Practically everyone I tried to convince to play got bored or quit in frustration. Every time we completed an expedition be it success or failure, it usually takes so long or is so frustrated with it we just call it a day.

So, should you buy this ? Hell no. DRG and L4D2 did everything this game does but better. But if you do, keep these points in mind :
-You should have a decently beefy pc.
-Get 3 other people who is willing to play with you for a long, long time. Preferably if one of those guys can type fast (This impacts gameplay i'm not even kidding)
-Research levels layout/relevant terminal commands before starting a level.
-Be patient.",1623254460,1694599063,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positive feedback time.
The recoil is ridiculous. I get were going for a horror feel here, where your weapons work against you with ammo consumption or whatever, but I've tried every single gun and it sucks.  NONE of them feel good to use, and the scopes are atrocious.

Which leads me to my next point, hip firing is useless. You hip fire a shotgun and the pellets go into oblivion, for some reason. 

Why put charging enemies that run BEHIND enemy lines, if your scope is too awful to hit them close, and you cant hip fire? Why even HAVE a hip fire?

As well, the undodgeable attacks from enemies is wack. You're telling me speedy Gonzales can run behind our lines, hit us with his undodgeable tentacle tit for 12hp, then run away? What? There is ZERO player collision with enemies, leading to retarded interactions where you're trying to shoot an enemy inside your teammate. But you cant play with other players because the game is dead, so you're firing into your bot companion, who is still shooting at a wall hoping to hit the enemy on the other side.

The enemies are super unfun to fight too, you're telling me this is a stealth game right? Well why is there an alarm door at every single turn, forcing me to break stealth? 

I can forgive if the enemies aren't that fair to fight if they aren't intended to be fought guns blazing... But they clearly are if you give us constant max level alarms.

This isn't even accounting for the 20 frame animations these goobers go through, making it impossible to hit headshots (which dont even matter because headshots dont one shot).

When you're playing alone with bots or with an uncoordinated team, it sucks. There is a ton of potential in this title, but it is ruined by a development philosophy that makes it very hard for developers to add in new meaningful content. A lot of these points will most likely be fixed from their roadmap which will obviously bump up my rating. But the very slow development speed makes it hard to keep playing this one long-term. 

[h1] Review Score: 6/10 (7/10 with friends)[/h1]

[u] Pros: [/u]
[list]
    [*] The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. The game does an incredible job with its graphics and usage of lighting. You truly feel claustrophobic and you are not alone in the dark. It feels very oppressive which is what you want out of a sci-fi horror game. It's one of the strongest aspects of this game.

    [*] Sound design on guns, turrets, voices, monsters, and etc. all sound very solid and meaty. Every gun sounds punchy and monsters make distinctive echoes. The music during combat sounds pretty great! It adds a lot of tension and adrenaline starts to rush into your veins. However I am little disappointed in the variety of music overall. Although, there is a lot of weird sound volume consistency that breaks immersion often for stealth sections.

    [*] The use of environmental hazards(except infection mechanic) is very well done. There were many times where going through a thick fog was this terrifying. Especially when you see one right in front of you. Going through every room feels like a puzzle to solve. How you approach each room is up to you, but fast and decisive thinking will be key to winning many rooms.

    [*] Very co-op heavy, it rewards teamwork and coordination. Very good planning with your mates to handle all the situation. You need someone on motion-tracker duty, you need someone on turret and defensive duty, you need someone who is good with stealth kills, and etc. When the team is firing on all cylinders, you feel like a cohesive unit.

    [*] The terminal are incredible immersive tool used very well. The terminals allow for free keyboard usage. The game will help you on how to use the right commands, but when you are proficient in using them... you feel like that ""hacker"" member of your group. It may seem like a weird thing to compliment, but rarely do I see co-op games ever do this and this game utilises it well into the overall game-play flow.

    [*] A good blend of Stealth and High-alert game-play. Stealth is very important in majority of the room encounters but when you see a door with an alert warning on it... you start going into planning mode. However in later stages they throw way too many alert doors, with so little ammo & health in-between to work with.

[/list]

[u] Cons: [/u]
[list]
    [*] There is no gear progression or anything related to it. Other than cosmetic progression which is okay, but there is no weapon customisation either. Temporary boosters are nice to have to help even the odds a bit, but there is not much sense of accomplishment other than you beat the hard level. You may argue that not all games need a progression system, but all the points listed below gives it a reason as to why this game needs one as soon as possible. In the road map, they don't seem to actively working on implementing this at all. There really isn't much for you to latch onto for long-term play here...

    [*] The game-play difficulty on later floors feel more like steep curves than gradual increases. Because there isn't any sort of ways for your character to progress to keep up to new challenges thrown at you, you honestly feel like weak from start to finish. While you can argue that is part of experience, it's not really fun when I explain the other game-play issues I have with this game. 

    [*] Gun-play combat generally feels awful. Guns never feel like they have any realistic accuracy to them, hip-fire is mess and the recoil on scope is so high. There isn't a way to customise cross-hairs or even remove them. Muzzle flashes are so cranked up and exaggerated because of the lighting that I feel like I will have an epilepsy attack after unloading a clip. Reload animations are lacking any depth to them, which lowers the ""personality"" of many of the guns. Guns that have high power like snipers or revolvers and guns with high starting ammo are always picked more often. The game's decision to not give you 100% ammo is an interesting idea if it was done as a modifier in certain floors, but not as the norm. It poorly balances many of the guns to which one does more damage and has the most ammo efficiency... rather than letting the gun shine through with their own niche.

    [*] Melee combat has never felt awful to execute... enemies have inconsistent gore and hit boxes making it confusing on where their bodies was hit. All of the enemies have fast mid to long range hard-to-read attacks that takes chunk of your health. It feels very cheap and more frustrating than challenging or fun.

    [*] Severe lack of enemy types and design variety. All of them pretty much look the same. While they may act different or look bigger(smaller). Their overall design is much to be desired. There needs to be more stronger distinction for each type and bring new ones to the table. After awhile, they just feel ""samey"" and can get visually boring fast.

    [*] The infection mechanic is probably the most unlikable game-play mechanic. There is a very limited way of lowering or removing it. It builds up way too fast and a lot of ways to get in many of the later floors. It severely punishes you for simply touching anything related to it. It exponentially increases the difficulty without adding any meaningful game-play experience. There really should be med stations where you can at least cleanse this infection, but have limitations to it like one per person only. Or have it so med packs cure a small portion of infection like 5-10% per use. Or simply put a hard cap for infection levels like up to 50%.

    [*] Some tools feel far more powerful and useful than others. I have played this solo and with friends a lot and gotten far in many of the levels. Also I have seen other people play on Youtube and I rarely see people use Lock Melters or Long-range Flashlights. C-Foam launchers or C-Foam grenades are TOO good to not have and Glow sticks are so useful and abundant. Fog Repellents feel like they don't last long enough for it be used often unless forced on certain maps(infection fog).

    [*] [strike]Lastly, the removal of older content whenever a newer one is added. This design philosophy makes it harder for the game to actually grow in terms of content. Instead of improving and adding on top of current content, they just outright remove it entirely. [/strike] So what you played in Alpha and what you play right now has been the same amount of content. The environments still look similar, enemies are still the same, mechanics are pretty much the same, and etc. This creates a false sense of development in the game's life cycle. Once you finished at least majority of the levels, there really isn't any reason to come back to them. So veteran players will run out of content to play for several months until the next rundown. (Disclaimer: I am happy that old rundowns are coming back. Just wish they add in new content in-between them as the game hasn't had any actual new content for years now. But credit is due that it was a highly requested by the community.)

The gameplay is focused around stealth (optional) but there are parts of very chaotic, stressful fights that you have to keep focused on what you are doing which creates a very unique experience. The amount of content in this game is very large as there are currently 7 rundowns which have many missions inside of them, rundown 1 has 6 missions and it took me 18 hours to complete rundown 1, and the later rundowns are larger with 12 missions and some missions has up to 2 optional objectives along with the main objective per mission. The gameplay is quite hard, but not enough to be annoying. I would like an in-game server browser to play with others, but currently it is heavily relied on Discord, which isn't bad, it just breaks the immersion. While there is a system for matchmaking, no one uses it and its not great. The weapons in GTFO are very unique and there is at least 2 guns for how you like to play and are very balanced. How enemies have very realistic bodies that break apart as you hit them is very unique. You have to manage resources wisely and efficiently as there are not many resources so melees are very helpful. You have to communicate with teammates, establish plans, and execute them with little room for error.

The game offers a unique experience no other left 4 dead clone is able to provide, it's a very good mixup of stealth and action with a very solid groundwork behind it.

It's brutally hard and definetely not something that can experienced fully without some dedication.

The game however is infested with bugs and since the developers have moved on a different project most of them are to stay.

Speaking of the game was put on life support after not even a year of updates, we are just getting old content ""slightly"" remixed from time to time but that's pretty much it.

Is it worth a buy? If you want to try it with friends sure, avoid matchmaking like the plague, you need proper communication to get through most levels.

Stealth is a big element of the game as you are often out numbered by monsters that can kill you quickly. Tension comes easily as you creep through the dark hallways and rooms towards your next kill, or you miss your melee attack, generating noise and awaken all the enemies in the room, forcing you to go loud and desperately try to survive in the ensuing firefight.

Every drop has you chasing certain objectives which at first seems difficult to determine how to do it. Finding a terminal and utilizing basic coding, you can gather all sorts of information ranging from the location of your objective, location of supplies, lists of security doors, etc. Supplies are always in demand and you are almost always running low, making your melee weapon your best friend, allowing you to sneak up and kill enemies silently and save ammo.

GTFO switches between stealth and chaotic shooter with hoardes of enemies that are hell to put down. While most levels have both types of play in it, there is no inbetween the 2 styles. Both require a lot of teamwork (open mic recommened) and strategizing. It has a decent balance between tactical planning, cooperative stealth, and horror shooter aspects. The game itself is difficult no matter how much time you put into it amd completing a level is always a great feeling no matter how good you are. There is some replayability and with the addition of all the previous rundowns plenty of levels to give lots of playtime.
The only reward for completing a level is that you beat a level, so if you need progression to enjoy a game, probably not for you. Due to this however there is no balance issues between just starting and being an experienced player so having teammates of various time in game will not ruin your experience. With that, the bots in the game are very difficult to play with and while having a bot on your team is fine, playing solo with bots only will make the game more painful than enjoyable.

For 22 hours i was trying to find something REDEEMABLE for this game(and for game pricetag) and i found NONE.
Stealth(which is a core gameplay and almost mandatory) is boring; melee combat and enemies - boring and clunky; gunplay(base shooting mechanic) - two times boring and clunky. One and only thing which is average/good is dark atmosphere of horror in deep underground.
Base mechanics are very unpolished but the latest patches added just mere cosmetics and a couple of levels, but add nothing to improve the base gameplay and make it somewhat fun.
For example - when you have a 3 use medkit and you see a 2 use medkit you CANT stack them together to make it 5 you just swap them(i saw a 6 use medkit once with 120% heal). COME ON.
This title belongs in Early access, definitely not in FULL RELEASE with such a pricetag.

STAY AWAY. It simply NOT fun at all. Or follow this game name when you find it on Steam store page.

A massive difference on how GTFO is played compared its counterparts is that it heavily values discipline and cooperation. Through discipline, there is a sense of obligation to commit to the bit of being a prisoner sent on a death-sentence of a quest. That provides immersion, a change of atmosphere that most games won't let you experience. Through cooperation, there is accountability for one another's actions and their consequences of depleting resources, time, and even lives. It creates a sense of dread that finite's what you can and can do at the time, because of each and everyone's cooperation.

I have loved the game since early access, yet, one flaw I find within the game is when memorization and independence takes into effect. Memorization is an issue, as it creates a pattern that makes the experience lackluster. A memorization on account to how to finish an expedition makes the experience feel less inviting for immersion of the darkness and desolation. Independence comes into play due to heed of wanting more, without the company of your expected companions. It seeps out the enjoyment of being afraid with friends, being in distraught and frustration over a miscalculation, the adrenaline of aiding and running together, it makes the expedition a grueling task for completion, not an experience.

To conclude the experience itself, the fun and thrill of GTFO heeds for there to be companions to scream and run along with within the expeditions. There is a need for direction that provides the immersion many would ask for a game that's cruelly asking for your deaths. It creates an experience that leaves you tiring after a session, yet that will leave you and your companions having to say it was all worth it, for the thrill it brought and some nice pair of new, unnoticeable pants.",1632204633,1692942341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER, I still think the game is one of the best co-op experiences you'll ever have, that being said, you actually have to enjoy the slower and more thoughtful gameplay, especially since it gets sort of repetitive when you play enough levels. the vast majority of the game involves sneaking through a room hitting guys on the back of the head, and then opening a door. sometimes that door has an alarm, and sometimes you mess up hitting the guys and you end up gunning them all down anyway.

the graphics fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly, and they can be easy to run when turned down since 90% of the rooms are covered in fog anyway, rarely, if ever, have we come across bugs that affect gameplay, and I have enjoyed the constant updates to the game (i bought the game when rundown 7 was out, and only after did they start releasing rundowns from the beginning), definitely worth the full price imo, but good on sale too, especially if not sure about the game

it is pretty important that you have people to play with, your team can make or break how much fun you have, although i have been a part of a few yelling matches and rage quits (always blame someone else for waking them up), and of course, you can always find a team using the discord which ive heard is a pretty good

There's a big emphasis on stealth, resource management and teamwork. The game is HARD and will not hold your hand. On the harder missions a couple of mistakes can easily doom a run.

Even the starting objectives are vague and it's up to you and your team to figure out how to complete even the main objective. Really gives of the impression of being dropped in without any second thought. 

The gameplay is quite good. Guns look great, feel great and sound really great. Melee weapons are satisfying and each one has it's use. Tools are also well balanced and feel like they all have their use.

However, the thing that will keep me playing is the difficulty. One might even say that this is the dark souls of 4 player coop. I'm the kind of dude that likes to intentionally cripple myself in games just to see if I can beat it with a disadvantage, so of course I love how unforgiving and difficult it is. If you don't like hard games I would not recommend GTFO at all.

The negative:
There's only one slight problem with the game and it really is a small one. The game has some jank to it some weird collision issues and hitreg, slight netcode and visual bugs. 
Nothing that ruins the experience by any stretch of the imagination but clearly something that I wish would be polished away. It has that ""early-access"" feel despite being a finished product. 

Overall it's a real good game with some minor technical issues. I would get it if the above appeals to you, even if you don't have anyone to play with, as teammates can be found in the official gtfo discord (It's what I did) and the community is generally nice and welcoming.",1692372497,1692372497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although they are slow opening up to the idea now, they are about 2 years 2 late.

SHORT VERSION:

 If you are looking to buy the game to play with friends, I would recommened getting it when it's on sale for -25% or more. The game has an alright amount of content, which will keep newer people busy for a while although you shouldn't expect anything new from the game as they only plan on adding another 2 sets of missions before they stop updating the game.
(Recommened using their Discord for matchmaking instead of the ingame MM system, it's just straight up awful)

MODDING COMMUNITY:

 If you end up enjoying the game, I would STRONGLY recommened checking out the modding community as some of the missions and quality of life imporvements makes the game feel like a completely new game and is objectively better than the base game.
The mods range from QoL, vanilla styled mission, to actual hell on earth for veterans of the game, with some rundowns also made for singleplayer or duos.

OVERALL LOOK ON THE GAME'S STATE: 

The base game has progressively become more and more stale with the devs deciding they would rather move on to another game and abandon GTFO due to their poor choices in the 1st year of the game being available on Steam. 

For people that have been playing the game for 2+ years, it has been a constant downwards spiral of the devs never meeting the community's expectations. This ranges from failing to fix common and easy to fix bugs, content droughts, and implementing boring and tedious mechanics. Thankfully the modding community managed to succeed where the devs failed when it comes to interesting content. If it's not obvious yet, I wouldn't have as much time on the game as I do, if it weren't for modding.

It's currently in the stage of receiving it's last recycled rundown (ALT://R6) after which the new and final Rundown 8 is planned to release. Which any player with a lot of experience probably doesn't really expect much anymore.

You'll set off alarms entering doors. You'll trigger tentacle spreading scouts and set them off, causing waves of enemies to come storming at you from the darkness. You'll enter dense fog with no visibility and stumble over a sleeping enemy who'll wake up the entire room and attack you. You'll repeat that mistake except this time the fog will be infectious (or spicy as we like to call it) 


If you don't look up some YT tutorials (Check out Mastoor on YT) You'll spend hours and hours doing trial and error attempting to figure out wtf you've to do. 
You'll learn that Terminals are a key to figuring out where you do and DONT have to go. 
You'll realize there's more than just human sized sleepers in the darkness....
You'll love the guns and the sights on them. You'll love the sound of them as the sound of your shots echo throughout the large rooms and caves.
You'll start off by thinking that the long range flashlight/fog repellers/glowsticks are useless.... and you'll gradually learn of their importance..

You'll die ALOT. Honestly you might end up hating this game for a while.
Then you'll rebound and go into the darkness again with added vigor.

You'll get better. You'll enjoy it. Buy it. Find 3 friends. Have a blast. Enjoy.

GTFO is an awesome game with excellent execution with adequate twists on the FPS tropes/cliches. Truly a Tactical Horror worth playing with friends (Up to 4 player). If you don't have a team, I highly recommend to check out the GTFO Discord.


[b] Unique Aesthetic and Visuals: [/b]

GTFO's visuals and aesthetics are unlike any other FPS game out there, blending many artistic elements together to produce a truly unique horror game. 

GTFO takes inspiration from certain sci-fi horror elements such as H.R Giger's (specifically Biomechanical) artstyle where biology is integrated with machinery as one, the Lovecraftian (Cosmic Horror) feel to the horrid monsters infesting the complex, or even the futuristic brutalist architecture/design with small hints of other architectural styles for variety in the level design just to name some elements I have seen.

Furthermore, GTFO slaps a meaty amount of flavour text, jargon, and info-graphics into its HUD, menus, and world design creating what I like to call an ""Info-centric artstyle"".

All these elements together produce such an excellent vibe to complement the horror and sense of unknown within GTFO.


[b] Sound Design and Ambience: [/b]

GTFO's Sound Design is simply phenomenal, distinct, realistic and enhances the game. 

GTFO understands that it is at heart, a Tactical Horror game, and the sound physics compliment this well. Every action (Player or enemy) produces stereo sound which echoes with an appropriate amount of ambience, creating a realistically believable and satisfying atmosphere which enhances the auditory feeling of GTFO.

The weaponry has nice percussive and distinct sounds allowing players to tell what weapon their teammates are firing by sound alone and the meaty sound when the bullets hit enemies or blow away body parts is juicy. Additionally, bullet casings have stereo sound when they hit the floor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2cPJHYSlWU). 

Every enemy sound within GTFO was created by heavily distorting and editing real human voices, which creates a recognisably human yet monstrously mutated sound profile. Furthermore, certain enemy types have distinct sounds which allows players to recognise their enemy by sound alone (i.e, the loud bassy thumping of larger enemy hearbeats/footsteps). Hell even the alert roar of the horde is directional and is different depending on the type/amount of enemies that are coming for you (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf03h9D0iHM). 

Additionally, enemies make certain sounds during their telegraphed attacks or abilities, giving the player information even if they can't see which is helpful due to the lack of visibility and abundance of darkness in GTFO.

On the other hand, the facilities alarms and TTS coms are punchy and inorganic. These sounds usually disrupt the quiet ambience of the mission and with them they bring a sense of dread and thrill as you know the alarm on the objective necessary door has alerted the horde.

All together, the unique Sound Design and Ambience of GTFO enhances the auditory feel of the game and even serves as a decent means of information gathering to the player, highlighting the tactical intrinsic of GTFO.


[b] Gameplay and Teamwork: [/b]

GTFO's gameplay is somewhat distinct despite being another FPS and the crucial need for Teamwork is paramount to avoid failure.

GTFO may be an FPS, but it attempts to throw twists into the formula to spice up its FPS elements. GTFO takes a conservative approach to guns, where you as the player are advised and rewarded for limiting the use of weaponry where ever possible due to the scarcity of ammunition and abundance of enemies. This dynamic also pressures the player to make every shot count and certain enemies increase this tense pressure. This to me, is GTFO's successful portrayal of the pressure of wielding a modern weapon, the expectation and anticipation to fight and the stress of logistics, not typically found in other FPS titles.

GTFO then takes this a step further and introduces the importance of visibility as a form of knowledge to your aim. Certain levels/rooms are simply pitch black or covered in fog which at times can be infectious. Even when your visibility is fine at times there are shadow enemies which are hard to spot without sufficient lighting or gear. This makes landing your shots even harder due to your hindered vision, requiring you to stock up on utilities such as glowsticks, fog turbines, bio trackers, or bring weapons with better flashlights/sights if you wish to enhance your visibility. This importance of visibility, I feel, is an overlooked part of the FPS genre. Not many FPS titles dip into visibility (or lack thereof) as much as GTFO does.

""Work Together or Die Together"" is an incredibly apt slogan for GTFO. To complete a mission in GTFO, you and your team will need to understand, move and react quickly and skilfully to any given situation and be able to adequately plan ahead before continuing. The level of teamwork required becomes more and more demanding as you progress deeper into any rundown, with the A levels being beginner friendly and D-E levels requiring decent teamwork, skill, reactions, and target priority.

Another part to GTFO's teamwork is the importance of resource management/logistics. Communication with your team, allocating inventory, and asking for appropriate resources when necessary helps immensely when it comes to improving your longevity and attrition.

In conclusion, GTFO's gameplay attempts to create a somewhat unique FPS experience through unusual (by industry/trope standard) methods and demands an increasing level of individual and team competence.


[b] Story and Lore: [/b]

GTFO's story is well hidden within the game through out the hefty flavour texts, world objects, missions, etc trying to draw upon corporate secrecy and classified information as it's main draw on the player.

I feel that the sense of discovery and secrecy really pulls you into the rabbit hole of GTFO's story but I won't explain that here to remain spoiler free.

oh man.. I really love this game, its frustating but ADDICTING, even tho you failed many times, you will be addicted to try, since the graphics and game mechanism are insanely GREAT.
- Once you success survived from a mission, you will be rewarded with Cosmetic to indicate that you have succeeded. its just Cosmetic, no Stats Effects so far.  
- No OP (Over Powered) weapon in this game, so there will be no Perfect Weapon. Im sure the developer purposely did this to make the game difficult.
- Some weapon like Shotgun and Machine need to charge for a few seconds first before shooting.
- No Flamethrower
- No somekind of Exploding Frag Grenased to easily hurt swarm enemies
- The HQ did not packed us with Medkit since the beginning.
- Can not deactivate Friendly Fire.
- Can not change the difficulty setting.

This game updating fast. I know the developer really worked hard for it.

I would recommend this game because it delivers an experience entirely unlike anything else. In the majority of situations, you will need to silently dispatch enemies to avoid wasting resources on fights and enemies. You will need to prepare for alarm sequences that awaken enemies with tactical ideas, such as holding choke points, reinforcing doors, and moving as a group to cover one another. Terminals require you to enter commands manually to search for objects throughout a level and complete objectives.

Right off the bat, this is probably one of my favorite cooperative games out there. It is extremely polished and is very unique in many parts of the game and receives free updates many times a year that bring new levels, enemies, and weapons to play with. The developers should absolutely be commended for sticking to their roadmap and promises, as they have already delivered many of them. There isn't any form of monetization past the price on the game itself, and you start with every tool and weapon unlocked already, only earning cosmetic items for completing levels. The developers have also stated that microtransactions will never be a part of the game, although DLC supporter packs are not entirely out of the question. This is fair for this game, as it is around half the price of a AAA game and delivers free updates on a semi-regular basis.

Talking about the game itself, many aspects are done extremely well. Audio and Visual design is first-class, it runs great and looks great on basically every system aside from complete potatoes. Each level is designed to focus on a certain element of the game and really push itself, bringing a very unique experience in every level you play. Cheese strategies have mostly been ironed out although a few exist, which helps the game be more grounded in teamwork in my opinion.

A common argument is that the game is simply too difficult for people with a limited friend group. This is entirely fair and it becomes almost impossible for an average single person to beat a C or D-tier level even with bots. However, this game explicitly states that it is cooperative in mind and design, so the ample warnings kind of discredit this argument. Still, it is valid criticism.

Another argument is that levels designed after checkpoints were introduced take an absolutely insane amount of time to complete, at a minimum of a hour and a half up to three or four and a half. This can make scheduling time to do these levels challenging and is really inaccessible for those that may not have time to sit down and play this game. Even in earlier designed, shorter levels, one should still expect an hour and half for the majority of these levels to be completed, excluding failed attempts. This game really is not friendly for those that want to pick up and put down games quickly, such as those that may travel a lot.

In short, here are some key points to consider if you're playing this game:
[h1] Key Points to Consider [/h1]
Pros:
- The game is very well designed in level, audio, visual, and general gameplay aspects
- There is plenty of tactical depth and teamwork is required instead of encouraged
- There is a lot of content to go through for each tier of difficulty
- Weapon balance is very good and you can choose based on comfort and strategy, there isn't really a hard meta
- Consumer-friendly practices by the developers and new content every couple of months (at least in the past year, there was a lot of drama regarding modding and datamining when the game first came out)
- The game is very well polished and exceeds that of AAA games, very few bugs or issues
Cons:
- The game is extremely difficult for many people
- Some may find the game to be confusing and convoluted
- Average solo players will not be able to access much of the content in later levels
- There is no meta-progression elements (this is debatable as a con though)
- Levels can take extremely long to complete, it is not friendly to pick up or put down quick

after 600 hours of GTFO I can say something about the game for people who want to buy it.

Okay, this is a hard team based shooter where you have to adapt for upcoming shit.

1. Team: Communication is the key here, you need a good team for many levels cause the game does not adapt the level. If you drop alone or as a duo the game won`t give a shit about that and u will have to fight your way trough all the enemies. And yes there are some chinese ultra high tier players that are soloing every single level without shooting and taking damage but I am not one of them and I guess u too so better find a team. And 
A microphone is highly recommended ( not needed but highly recommended ), as I said comms are very important, if you run out of ammo during an alarm u will have to say that to your teammates. Your only option will be the text chat and trust me, you do not watch the text chat while shooting the enemies.
How to find a team: If you dont have friends like me then the official discord server is your solution. There are many players searching for a game, sometimes it is hard to find a lobby for high tier levels but not impossible.
Then we have matchmaking, no one uses it and it is dead, I honestly dont know why people are complaining that the the matchmaking system isnt working. No one needs it cause u have the discord server.

Community: The community on the discord server is pretty nice. If u have questions, problems or want to discuss something u will find people to talk with.

2. Gameplay: Each rundown has multiple missions, some objectives are the same and some very unique. But many times u play like this: Go quiet meeling al the enemies and clear room after room, use guns only if you fuck up and wake up everything or doing alarms. Clearing rooms requires sometimes killing multiple enemies at the same time and that is also where communication is required.
In the beginning (menu) u will have to choose which weapons, tools and boosters u want to take in order to complete the level. Sometimes we even give ourselves roles, example: one man takes high caliber and goes for big enemies and the others control the waves (machineguns, assaultrifles etc.).

3. Graphics: Well the graphics are not something insane, u can clearly see low resolution textures but the game hides it by making the levels very dark. And to be fair it is very good cause it creates a very dark and depressed atmosphere supported by the unknown of the level, limted supplies, screams etc.
The cosmetics in this game are okay, there are cool backpacks and gasmasks but some of them have the same 3D model and only a different color.
The gun design is in my opinion very good, they look very realistic and every gun has its own unique 3D scope.
The HUD is ""integrated"" as a projection in your gasmask, it looks very good and if u kill an enemie close u will see blood floating down your mask. Or after u change the mag u can see it on the floor.
The level design is okay, many of them are rooms and corridors with many doors, however sometimes its different.

4 Bugs: There are bugs, the game is out of early access but in my opinion it should be still in it. Many of them are visual bugs that are not critical ans sometimes even funny. Some bugs can save u the run and some will end it.
However the ""critical"" bugs are very very annoying.

Examples: visual rendering bug ""black dot"" , u will have a blackscreen for a few minutes then it goes away. 
                 crashes
                 connection problems and desync
                 stuck enemies in walls 
                 foam glitch where the foam flies trough the door and makes it impossible to hold the position
                 enemies spawns (sometimes), spawn direct in front of your face or wrong amount of spawned enemies, R7D1 
                 especially

and finally luck, dont get me wrong but R5 especially is based more on your luck then on your skill, if a scan goes to deep or it moves to slow u can restart, if in R7E1 you wont find enough ammopacks in the reactor u are fucked. 
Stuff like that is only on a few levels but for gods sake sometimes I want break my monitor because we were unlucky and died after 2 hours of a smooth run.

Coclusion: The game is unforgiving mistakes or bad teamplay but at the same time it challenges you and pushes u to the limits, the feeling after u finished a hard run is something else.

All in all, if you want a challenge, team based gameplay and u are ready to tolerate bugs, u are welcome in the deep and dark complex, slaaaves.

Just for reference. My two friends and I have completed R1 all the way to R5D1. With the exception of about two E1 levels that we plan on coming back to later. We also do every overload and secondary if the level has them.

I love this game, however, GTFO's philosophy around difficulty is actually kind of frustrating. So much of GTFO's difficulty comes back around to blinding the player with fog. Just about every level in every rundown after you hit layer C1 and over becomes a fog simulator. It is really disappointing that the devs couldn't find a way to add difficulty beyond limiting the player's vision.

Most of the difficult levels become so gimmicky.

""Survive with fog, but this time the fog is denser than usual.""
""Survive with fog, but this time you have no disinfection.""
""Survive with fog, but this time you have no fog repellers/turbines""
""Survive with fog, but this time we spawn a tank every 4 minutes""
""Survive with fog, but this time activating the generators will make it worse""

The game ALWAYS comes back to fog being the main difficulty mechanic. It's not unforgiving in its challenge, it is boring though. Imagine playing L4D2, but every map was in the sewers but with a tank spawning every 5 minutes. Or Dark Souls had every map being a swamp but didn't give you any moss to cure poison. It's doable, just not entertaining.

Update: We got stuck and lost to 3 tanks spawning near the end. Couldn't do a bioscan because one of my friends got stuck inside the stairs near the exit. Reviving and rejoining did not fix it.",1690377178,1690708595,False,5,0,0.549521684646606445,0,True,False,False

6 large egg yolks
1/3 cup (70 grams) granulated sugar
2 cups (480 ml) heavy whipping cream
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar (for the topping)

Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Place a large pot of water on the stove to boil.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Set aside.
Pour the heavy whipping cream in a medium-sized saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the cream is warm and bubbling around the edges. Remove the cream from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the warm heavy whipping cream into the egg and sugar mixture making sure to whisk well as you're pouring it in. Then, slowly pour in the remaining cream and continue whisking until fully combined. If there's a thin layer of foam on top of the mixture, you can skim this off with a spoon at this point.
Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, then evenly distribute between four 6-ounce ramekins.
Pour the boiling water into an 8-inch square baking pan (or larger pan if you prefer) about 1/3 of the way full. Carefully place the ramekins in the baking dish. The water should come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins. If needed, add a little more boiling water to the pan.
Carefully place the baking pan in the oven. Bake at 325°F (163°C) for 35 to 45 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Remove from the oven and carefully remove the ramekins from the pan using tongs or pot holders and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Once chilled, blot the tops of each custard with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture. Sprinkle 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of sugar on top of each custard, shake it around into one even layer, then use a small kitchen torch to carefully caramelize the sugar. Allow the sugar to harden for 1 to 2 minutes, then serve and enjoy, or refrigerate for a few hours until ready to serve.",1690310844,1690310844,True,311,115,0.74594569206237793,4,True,False,False

It's basically you get plopped into a map with 0 explaining and they expect you to know everything off the start.

I expected the game to be a cool run and gun shooter with clear point objectives, not get dropped into a cave, expect to be typing into terminals, doing weird a** commands and try to find objects. I can see the appeal for some, but the game to me is a over hyped shooter that people fan girl over for the graphics.

Most of its difficulty really just comes from the fact it has obtuse design approaches which just make its core ideas harder to understand for the player.

The game's menus opt for ~lore first~ instead of usability, so as soon as you start the game get ready to be confused. When I started playing my friends and I who have never played the game before spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out which type of match we should be playing in, and how to start a match. There's really no reason in the year 2023 why players should be expected to have to learn how your game's menu works or what they're even doing in it - I think that means your menu is poorly designed.

The gameplay once you get in is...just okay. The variety comes from different enemy archetypes and room layouts, but at the end of the day most of what you end up doing is a loop of ""enter room -> sneak kill zombies -> find objective -> leave"", occasionally broken up by some wave defence sequences. It was sorta fun for a couple of matches, but after that it quickly started getting repetitive. Some environments look different than others, but I couldn't see myself playing it for much longer than I currently have.

I think one of the more disappointing parts of it is just how a lot of people tend to frame this game as being ""difficult"" and people just need to get better in order to play it. I play plenty of games people consider hard games, so I guess my hot take is that I generally don't think the core gameplay is that really ""hard"", and that the difficulty mostly comes from what I'd call obtuse UX decisions. A game that feels hard usually has me feeling like I've done something wrong or made a mistake I need to improve on next time, but honestly every time I've lost a match in this game I've felt like it was because the game didn't communicate critical information to me, or that it was intentionally being obtuse about what was happening to make it feeler harder than it is. I think this coupled by the fact some matches can take upwards of a couple hours with no checkpointing...idk, I have better ways to spend a Friday night.

I get the impression the audience for this game are people who have played for a long time, which has made the experience for newer players pretty alienating by-design. If you're on the fence about this you should probably be ready for that going in. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't, but either way it definitely feels like a game that could stand to have a UX pass or five.",1689700249,1689700249,False,0,2,0.415094316005706787,0,True,False,False

- Easier missions do-able with bots (who are usually fine but can be frustrating), but an organised team is recommended. Unsure of single-player viability at higher difficulty missions (there is no difficulty setting - each mission has a set difficulty)

Pros:
- Top-notch visual style and atmosphere. Market-leading in my opinion.

Coming from someone who doesn't consider themselves a hardcore gamer (GTFO is my most played game by far) I think its a great experience and highly recommend it. HOWEVER, this game is not for everyone.

As many other reviews will tell you, this game is one of the best at creating a sense of dread and impending doom. To this day it is probably the only multiplayer game that can still scare me. The gun play is responsive, rigid but not restricting, and truly hammers home the idea that you are not the apex predator. The stealth combat is fun, perhaps even more so than the shooting, and doesn't bog you down or make the game feel too slow.

However;

There is a lot wrong with this game. While I personally haven't been put off by it, there are a lot of bugs. Compounding this problem is the fact that your average level in this game takes around 60 - 90 minutes, with even the shortest ones being around half an hour. Spending all that time on a game to have a bug ruin it will definitely sour the experience. Personally the length of the levels is the biggest problem and the reason that after over 300+ hours in game, I can only stomach one or two levels a month. The A Tier of the game (The first and easiest of the levels) is far too easy for a veteran, the B Tier is similar but has some tense moments and some bad RNG that could result in a wipe, I feel the C Tier is this game at its best. Beyond that the game becomes nearly unplayable for your average user. I understand that the niche and main draw to this game is the hardcore nature of it but come on, 8 of the most difficult enemy in the game followed by 4 of the second most difficult enemy in the game on loop for 3 hours isn't fun. 2 or 3 deaths is fine, encouraged even, this game is supposed to be hard, 4 or 5 I'll take, skill issue right? But 15 + hours on one level is madness, even for a vet. And then they go and add secondary objectives.

These devs are some sadistic mfs.

So why after all that trash talk would I still recommend it. Because I keep coming back. After all these years I still load up the game and play another mission or two. With the new bot mechanic I can beat A and B tier and I still think its pretty fun. Every once and a while I drop in with some friends and we hammer out a C level, maybe even a D level if its not too bad.

For 30 dollars, you can at least give the game a try. I think its worth it.",1689094901,1689094901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

unfortunately this game still has some big flaws and i dont even mean the bugs. this game is not only still in alpha but its very much disappointing the longer you play. you basically have to come into missions with prior knowledge of whats to come so you can best prepare weapons for the levels since not every gun is going to help you depending on how the mission is set up. for the nay Sayers. you could enjoy using a sniper that does high damage then find out the majority of the stage is covered in fog so thick you cant see but maybe 5-8 feet past your face making said weapon pointless unless you wanna be a cod quickscoper.

the other big issue this game suffers is the guns. wile the gunplay is actually rather top notch feeling very nice to shooting and aim with. the overall performance is a joke to which the sweats will stand by as if its perfect and needs to changes and that anyone who says otherwise is just bad.

you have no gunrange to test weapons and are only able to see the numbers of weapon stats on a wiki so you get a very vague description of how guns work. and alot of them just feel like you are shooting plastic beebees at aliens trying to chomp you to bits. 

the missions started off very copy past then we started to get more variation and new tasks you have to do which does make it feel very unique per ""rundown"" but ultimately it falls short because of its dogwater combat. the game also sports the biggest oxymoron i have ever seen in a game that wants you to be stealthy and conserve your very very limited ammo you have weapons that have a soul purpose is to ""stun"". no they are not shock darts or concussion/ frag rounds. no they dont always knock foes over. its just a low damage gun that will give you very brief pauses in enemy movement but mind you its never a few enemys. you will get hoards of foes and its just so bloody annoying.

It will test your patience because when you die, you will have to start at point with only the knowledge of how you died. I personally prefer this game with as few people as possible. I enjoy how hard this game actually can be solo. In all honesty, its impossible for me to do most of the levels without the help of others. The AI needs a lot of work still. They will stand in a spot and just die. They will not listen and the command prompts are hard to get used too. The only pro to having a bot in place of a human is they rarely miss. AI needs a good amount of work put into them to make it fun for people that don't like others. if you don't have any friends or like to play with a community that just wants to show you everything. This game might not be for you. The community is great. People will love to help a new player out. But most of the time they just want to beat the level for you. They have the best knowledge to help you understand the game. The new experience of trying to figure a game out is lost when you play with experienced people. Some people prefer the help but if you are like me. well, good luck. This game is not forgiving. It doesn't matter if you are solo or have a full party. You will get the same strength against you in any level. Can you live with your mistakes that got your team killed?

if the Dev team was larger or if they partnered up with a bigger studio (multiple studios) they could possibly get things to where they want while staying in control of their project.

There's a strong artistic direction on it that you can feel from the very first screen to the computer gameplay, they went all-in and it's a real pleasure to experience that.
The mood is fantastic, the gunfeel is incredibly good (even though a sound feedback when your gun is empty would have been nice), the enemy design is on point. The art direction - especially on the latest maps - completely catches up for technical aspect

My main point of concern is, like a lot of people I think, the difficulty. Not necessarily because it's hard, but because it mixes a very unforgiving experience with long playtime (sometime above 2h) and the lack of any basic exposition to new threats. At the time I'm writing this review, I've lost two time after 1h+ gameplay because of an encounter with an enemy that was never shown - the second time, it happened while being chase by an infinite wave of monsters. It's a die and retry where the ""die"" part last hours. Basically, it often crosses the line between hard and frustrating at almost  every mission. 
Very few maps have a checkpoint mechanic, added after the release, but it's broken (I've always ended up with a massive bug after using one of those). I really don't mind the difficulty, but I would have sold my left kidney for a true checkpoint/save system every 15-20mins. 

I would still recommand it, unless you have no-one to play with (the AI is functional but not very smart, it can help on the lowest difficulty missions but you'll need a friend or two to complete the other ones). It's a unique experience that's worth playing, and I've played it more than most other recent coop shooter game.

One of the best horror games I've played in a very long time, not because it is scary (although it definitely can be tense at times), but because of how purely fun the game is. The devs are incredibly active in not only updating the game with a new map every single month (called rundowns), but also in engaging with their community on Discord.
The game focuses heavily on teamwork, stealth, and the preservation of resources in order to survive and succeed. There are no difficulty settings and unless you are working alongside a well-coordinated squad, the game can be brutally difficult. GTFO is best played with a full 4-man squad, preferably with friends, for the best and intended experience. Teamwork is the key to success as you stealth your way past rooms in order to preserve your resources for the Bioscan doors as they always result in a firefight. The devs encourage anyone who is looking for a squad to join the Discord and meet people. Not to mention the community is very friendly and welcoming.

If you thought you were tough, GTFO will push you to your absolute limits and then some. Brace yourself for an experience that will leave your nerves shattered and your heart pounding like a drum.

From the moment you step into the dark, foreboding depths of GTFO, you'll be immersed in a haunting atmosphere that never lets up. The game's visuals are stunningly atmospheric, with dimly lit corridors, grotesque creatures lurking in the shadows, and an eerie soundscape that will send chills down your spine. It's a masterclass in creating tension and unease.

GTFO is a cooperative survival horror game, and cooperation is not just encouraged; it's essential for survival. You and your team will be thrust into unforgiving environments, tasked with completing challenging objectives while fending off hordes of nightmarish creatures. Communication and coordination are paramount, as a wrong move or a misplaced shot can spell instant death.

The gameplay mechanics in GTFO are nothing short of brutal. Every step you take, every door you open, and every bullet you fire could alert the enemy and send them swarming towards you. Resource management becomes a delicate dance, as you balance your limited supplies against the constant threat of annihilation. The tension is palpable, and the stakes are always high.

But what truly sets GTFO apart is its unforgiving difficulty. This game doesn't hold your hand; it mercilessly punishes every mistake you make. Each encounter feels like a desperate struggle for survival, with a razor-thin margin for error. GTFO is a game that will test your skills, your wits, and your nerves like few others. Be prepared to fail, learn, adapt, and push through the maddening challenges.

GTFO is not a game for everyone. It's for those who crave a nerve-breaking, pulse-pounding experience that will leave them mentally and emotionally drained. It's a game that demands your full attention and rewards those who persevere. If you're up for the challenge, GTFO will deliver an unforgettable journey into the darkest recesses of terror.

So gather your most resilient friends, steel your nerves, and prepare to embark on a harrowing adventure that will test the limits of your courage. GTFO is a masterpiece of horror gaming that will haunt your dreams and keep you coming back for more. Just remember, when you enter the depths of GTFO, you're in for an experience like no other.

Gunplay leaves room to be desired but other parts of the game like having to physically type at computer terminals to hear logs and locate objectives is slick. What I do not agree with is its decision to not support local play, and vault old content with each new major update.

GTFO is online only. No officially supported offline mode, No LAN parties. I don't care how widely available an internet connection is nowadays, and I'm not going to waste my time with [quote]Don Mattrick: ""We have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360.""[/quote] tier comments disagreeing with this point. I'm not paying 2/3rds the price of a AAA title for a game I won't always be able to play. As of writing, we just had a cloudflare outage that made a good chunk of the internet inaccessible for about an hour.

The game's content, known as run downs, are vaulted and replaced every six months. You can download the old rundowns online from people in the community who saved them, but it's honestly quite sickening you have to go to such extremes if you wish to return to old missions you really enjoyed, or unravel its mysteries as it was intended. (learning the story through the rundowns from the very beginning) On top of this, you ought to google ""GTFO EULA Threats"" that are made by the game's team, towards people who mod the game, try to find stats, or play old rundowns. I despise this, it's like being monitored by helicopter parents in your free time.

At the price of $39.99, even at its current sale price of $29.99, I do not find these practices acceptable. They can be called rundowns, but to me they are just seasons of a live service If I wanted to deal with live service BS I would install Fortnite, Apex, Halo Infinite or even Destiny 2. (which is even worse about this!)

I'll still play it while it's free but I'm not giving this game money until it the situation improves, and you shouldn't either. I don't expect it to. It's honestly such a damn shame. I really think that this game would have more reach if all its previous content were available to play. Newbs would figure things out the hard way in earlier rundowns while veterans can pick up where the game left off last time.

You want a hardcore cooperative PVE shooter that goes from tense to frantic in a split second like GTFO,  plays offline, supports LAN parties and even has 4P splitscreen? Save some money and grab Space Beast Terror Fright instead. Make sure to start with the Grind Mode playlist or you are gonna be way in over your head. 

I also quite like Extinction mode in Call of Duty Ghosts, but it has a very high cost of entry (digital hardened edition is a MUST) and for the PC port specifically, while hosted by Valve servers, is still Online-Only. The console versions support local play, lan parties and 2P split screen but you'll have to pay for online play.",1655801693,1688076903,False,9,2,0.598676323890686035,7,True,False,False

The only big downside is that the game NEEDS 4 players. The game is marginally playable with 3, but ammo is so short in most runs that the lack of 2 guns and utility really makes it.

When I first played in the beta, the experience was hellish.  Completing an A or a B mission felt taxing and  insanely gratifying when we finally won, and at the time I could barely fathom surmounting a C-tier level. After playing it thoroughly for a while, I've gotten used to the adrenaline filled action and the hurdles the game regularly throws at you, to the point where A and B missions are an absolute breeze, and C-tier is my new standard. 
It's a wonderful feeling, getting a palpable sense of progress, and becoming a more capable survivor for not just the benefit of yourself, but your entire team. 

In regards to newer players, this game is brutal. It takes a long time to get into, and there are many nuances to the gameplay loop that fresh players will take a while to absorb. I recommend spending some time with someone already experienced, or having a whole troop of fresh players with you so you can figure things out together.

On top of being a ludicrous adrenaline surge, the dynamic music during stealth / combat is utterly fantastic. The sound design is utterly immaculate. On occasion I will play it solo just to appreciate how well put together the ambiance is. The guns are punchy, the effects are flashy, and the game's color palette is dark and evil. It also runs extremely well on even low-tier graphics cards.

Just when you think you've mastered every obstacle, the game will throw more at you. 
Every threat feels avoidable, every mistake feels like you could've done better somehow, and it forces you down a path of improvement. 

I feel as if the developers are finally figuring out what that truly want out of this game with the advent of Rundown 7. The gimmicks in the modern levels have gotten very fresh, and they are experimenting in ways that were inconceivable in times previous. All the mechanics developed from the previous rundowns are beginning to coalesce into a masterful experience. 

As of right now my biggest complaint with the game are the bots. Sometimes you need to run a team with one bot on it to make up for a missing player, but the bots are specialists in holding onto shitty utility items and avidly wasting ammo. On occasion their pathfinding will bug out and they will refuse to stand in a team scan, jeopardizing a whole hour's worth of work. These issues are conceivably fixable in time, and there has been talk of improving them further. To date a full team of bots could carry you through C-tier if you're attentive.

To close, I recommend a dark room, a friend or two, and some good headphones. A solid run can absolutely drain you when you finally pull through, so remember to stay hydrated.

I’ve changed this cute little happy review to actually say something. It’s disappointing how short timed and mismanaged this game turned to be. 

Started in R3, enjoyed the hell out of it with friends and have always had fun with every upcoming rundown, even if it wasn’t all that well received. However it’s tested my feelings with R6. At first I enjoyed it and liked the extension, but I then realized that became a problem. 

R4-R6 have had extensions, short almost pointless levels that gave the community a small chunk of something. The time frame it took to make those 3-4 levels MAYBE would’ve made a new rundown like back in 2020. 

When R7 released it was the cherry on top. The bugs are insane and i’ve never enjoyed but hated a rundown more. Bugs with the snatcher, sniper melee still in the game with massive desync, the bots, checkpoints, host migration, that door bug that can trap sleepers. 

But they fixed the door bug and sniper melee in the summer?? Awesome! Not like it took them forever to do it and they only did it because their game was being presented in Gamescom and they wanted a good image!!! It didn’t even fix those bugs entirely. 

The development has unfortunately become a joke. Barely one rundown after the 1.0 release and Ulf misses Overkill and wants to make a heisting game. They say they’ll manage both games but you don’t even see any sort of communication with GTFO alone. 

A lot of the community medias aren't as active, including the discord server. Don’t trust their tells when they say they have 100,000 active members, those people only joined for the Alpha back in 2019 and forgot to leave the server. 

Who knows, maybe this all happened because of the Tencent incident back in R4. I love this game, and I’ll still come back on time to time, but vanilla GTFO isn’t really doing it for me anymore.",1599195831,1687897106,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a big horror junkie, this game is something I've been wanting to get my hands on for a while, but honestly for how many redundancies there are in the core mechanics and how little much they've done to improve upon them since this game came out, I'm a little disappointed.

There is a good amount of this game I do enjoy. The terminals, the 'don't tell your story, show it' vibe, the melee and gun range, and the minimalist out of game menu is all neat stuff that stands this game out from the rest, as for the mechanics this game [u] wants [/u] to be known for, it strangely just feels like they all shoot each other in the foot, not allowing anyone of them to fully flourish

-Stealth-
A big promoted part of GTFO is the urgency to be stealthy, never to get ahead of yourself and stay cautious. I can say that the mechanic works, and I haven't encountered any technical problems so far but its no where near being a unique and well thought out part of this game. It is essentially crouch->move->stop for 10 seconds->move->slap or stab depending on your melee->repeat, and when having to slap hundreds of tape worm riddled sleepy heads again and again, it can get very repetitive, very fast.
The game also offers no alternative for this other than to avoid the room they're all in entirely or move past them (either which often isn't an option). Eventually, you'll start to get impatient and just cause a slap fest, making stealth null

-Horde shooting-
If at any point you have a fucky wucky with the above mechanic, you'll trigger this phase. This is supposedly not an ideal situation [b] that you as a player should be avoiding at all times. [/b] That being said, you will soon discover horde triggering is an utterly unavoidable part of this game. 
Visibility by design is abysmal, so having to accurately spot, shoot and stab hundreds of angry naked worm people (plus the fact that a would-be satisfying head-shot doesn't always kill them) is a massive head-ache. Unlike stealth however, you are given a variety of tools to help you in this situation; C-foam and mines to slow down enemies, sentries to hold choke points, and bio scanners to help you keep track of what your dealing with, all of which are designed to minimise you having to interact with the horde. 
Seems like there are two progressive paths away from this; A) give players an option to avoid hordes entirely in some scenarios or B) make hordes a fun shooting range event like most other horde-shooters, this game however is sadly stuck in the awkward mid ground.

-Horror-
Why I got this game, the big spook that sends adrenaline through you, perhaps (arguably) one of the biggest promotional features of this title, a feature that it sadly, like so many that have a horror-tag before it, falls so very far of.
Now I know I sound like a gate-keeping bum, but lets just look at what two things mechanically make a  horror game.
- Vulnerability 
Feeling unarmed even when you are anything but is what a great horror game accomplishes. This pressure can amplify the feeling to get anything that needs to be done 'done now' and greatly increases the rewarding feeling of completing a task. Whilst the above paragraph about 'Hordes' makes it seem like they accomplish this, the one further up about 'Stealth' shows that you are hunting these things, not the other way around. Similar to games like 'Dead-Space' or 'Evil Within', why should be afraid of something that you've already killed a hundred of? Answer is: you shouldn't
- Unpredictability
Not knowing is a defining feature of fear, its why most horror movies and games are far more horrifying mid way through then near the end. It can be done through RNG or even out of place events, both not too hard to implement. Whilst honestly I haven't witnessed all of what this game has to offer, It felt pretty predictable a few missions in.
Whilst this games atmosphere and creatures seem perfect fits for horror, it fails to exaggerate both of these defining tid-bits

In the end, the attempted stealth ruins the horror, the attempted horror ruins the horde-shooting and the attempted horde-shooting ruins the stealth, and we're left with just a hard game that's just not fun.
I'll continue to play it a bit more and see If I can prove myself wrong but in the meantime [b] i'd heavily recommend you and your friends play 'Deep Rock Galactic' instead. [/b] 
its actually very fun and knows exactly what it wants to be, plus the cosmetics don't suck ass.

I give this game a 5/10

ten chambers may not be the best dev team out there. people are not shy to praise or degrade them. but none of that matters when you can piss your pants infront of your friends. this game is best played with three other people that you know, it really tests you're ability to work together as a team. like REALLY tests you as a group. sometimes the one thing that makes or breaks levels is communication. 

the re-playablility of this game is questionable, really because from rundown 2 and on you really don't ever want to redo some missions ever again. its FUN, don't get me wrong. some levels you just don't want to revisit after completing them. but if you're a completionist like me, you'll love the amount of challenges and secondary tasks there are to complete. 

overall the gunplay in this game is also very good. the monsters are very well done, some really make you break a sweat. i can't really comment much on the overall fps quality of this game with big fancy game words; i really just think the gunplay and overall weapon crap is pretty dang good. i find among my own team we even have very diverse loadouts usually.

theres enough to fit everyones style of playing. im the sniper, i always have been and i still am in the game. i look things up on the computers and find out where we need to go. another teammate mains biotracker, and they're hella good at it. they also love lore, and read every log to us while we sneak through levels. one is simply called ""monkey"", they're our melee god. really they usually have the lowest health from preferring to hammer instead of shoot. the last is our turret guy, they know all the best places and everything good and bad about each turret. they also love to main shotguns. it even gets down to character, i love bishop to annoy everyone by pinging every resource box/locker. our biotracker main loves hacket for being irish. you also get to name all the enemies funny names if your team has a sense of humor. 

overall,  10/10 would recommend. 
also i definitely suggest singing the pizza theme from spiderman 2 every time you encounter a scout, makes it a little less tense.",1687665690,1687665827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gunplay is pretty solid but the game discourages you from using your gun to preserve resources. On top of that, there are a lot of redundant or useless weapons where another one is just better than the other in every way (ie smg vs carbine).

I personally feel like the game lacks a certain identity. It doesn't know if it wants to be a stealth survive game with friends or a horde shooter. In my eyes it does ok in both aspects but iv'e seen it done better elsewhere.

The game has it's moments for sure but sadly i don't think new rundowns change enough about the game to keep it interesting long term. At best each rundown adds a new ""mechanic"" or a new enemy that shows up maybe once or twice. But I don't think it changes the core loop enough to keep players engaged. 

I think the game would have benefited greatly from dedicated matchmaking or a server list. It would allow players to find the experience they're looking for. The community of this game falls into 2 categories, optimal players that really know their stuff, or new players looking for a fun survival atmospheric experience. The latter of which rarely make it to C tier or beyond due to the hardcore nature of the game.

All in all I enjoyed my first 80ish hours with this game,but it drags imo and there isn't enough for me to keep playing.

My only complaint is that there aren't more games like this. A shooter with non horror elements like this would also have been great.

Only minus is that you have to play with other people to actually have fun, the singleplayer is a pain as it gives you 3 bots to command which the developers have made as easy to control as possible but it's still not the same level as human players.

The game does not also teach you a bunch of stuff and phrases, to learn and play with other people I had to join the discord, everyone on it is older than 15 (or at least the people I came across) so you know that they won't throw slurs at you for being new to the game.

""like left for dead

updated review:
Game is really hard. Had a level last up to six and a half hours. Though that was just grinding at a checkpoint halfway through, which does not erase previous attempts' time. Realistically from start to finish without the failed attempts it was probably more like two hours.

Game is balanced around four players. There are no scaling mechanisms for fewer players. This game is meant to be hard. Seriously. This is some CBT levels of difficulty. I just wish it didn't take 3 hours to get through a level. Guess its not that bad because I can't stop playing.

I gotta say though, getting closer and closer to a level completion after spending ALL morning on it, and then finally crossing the finish line, really is euphoric. Maybe less in a ""I completed it"" way and more like ""the shackles are off and I'm free"" sort of way. But still.",1577136745,1687420336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had this review in the writing for a while now. I didn’t play the game since release so stuff could already have changed but the core gameplay mechanic isn’t, which is a huge flaw. I started playing this game with friends but everyone broke off at a certain point because of the sheer boredom the game gives me.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
In the loadout screen you have the choice between a main weapon, side weapon, some sort of tool and additional modifiers. The last being collectibles you find in maps giving you bonuses. They range from being nice to have to very useless. Main Weapons are not always a bigger version of something, they are usually the main weapon you kill things with. Non specialized weapons that kill simple mobs during waves. The pistol was my favourite as it has lots of ammo compared to the others. Side weapons usually specialize into something, like snipers to take out the special unit scout that basically calls a small wave unto the player.

During gameplay you have a main task that is a copy pasted task like retrieve x thing from computer or something the like. During that you mostly use terminals to ping locations of batteries, parts etc to proceed. This part is actually really neat and is actual gameplay that is totally unique. This really adds a lot of teamplay especially if you decide to split up to save time.

Now during that you try to scavenge for additional supplies. Ammo etc. The RNG sucks, as it can sometimes spam you full of health packs but no ammo or vice versa. The main combat is brutally boring. You will need to sneak into every single room, charge up your hammer and pray that the RNG didn’t decide to randomly startle an enemy because you just took out two or three sleeping enemies at once. Stealth gameplay is fine if its based around a good system. Not one that focuses on 90% of the gameplay to wait until enemies stop blinking, then you sneak closer , rinse and repeat until they die. 

This is if you play the game the developers intended and made it, if you see speedrunners or just people who play this game a lot they will just bunny-hop-crouch trough the map. Additionally they made the already long maps(taking 30mins to 2-4!!!hours) even longer by making already cleaned rooms getting enemies respawn.
Incase you actually have to defend yourself against hordes the game actually gets fun. You setup turrets, freeze doors at certain spots etc in order to slow down the enemies so you can get around an alarm door. Which is mostly at tops ¼ of levels gameplay time.

Also I just didn’t expect a game to take 1-3 hours in a multiplayer focused game. And this is really bad because the game tricks you into having actual fun levels and ideas. The first levels are like this 10-60 minutes at tops. Sorry I don’t have that much time especially since you cant really reconnect to a game.
I feel like if stealth was rather suggested in order to save some resources at times but not 100% necessary it would a fun game because the gameplay systems could have made a  solid foundation for a coop shooter. Foundation, as the game has no that much of a replay value for a lot of people. Maps are not that different, tasks even less. 

[u]Story[/u]
There is some interestening stuff going on, especially with the amount of environmental storytelling. But its not like the “rundown” system is a campaign that tells a neat story.

[u]Sound[/u]
Good environmental sound design, albeit characters don’t say anything and weapons sound like peashooters.

[u]Graphics[/u]
They did a really good job to hide a lot of mediocre textures in great lightning and fog effects. This is really a compliment as think the game is totally fine looking and focuses or rather exceeds in giving me a good grimdark atmosphere.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
GTFO has a great atmosphere. That’s the only thing the game did really well. Every other category is rather subpar, bad balancing, be it repetition or length of maps. The general gameplay foundation is also focusing on the wrong aspect, as the stealth part isn’t complex and fun enough to make most of the game focus on that. The small combat encounters are fun but nothing better than any other coop shooter out there.

Below average multiplayer coop fps.

The actual content of the game is really fun. I still haven't found a weapon combination that I'm truly in love with, and that's probably my biggest complaint about the game. There's a mission in R7E1 feels a little ""gimmicky"" as well.

Audio: 5/5
If you have a section you're stuck on and keep dying, it's quite frustrating to keep hearing the same character audio over and over. Also a lot of the ""talking"" gets loud, and it's difficult to clear rooms when you can't hear any of the enemies. I'd recommend turning off the dialog options. It made the experience significantly better. The ambient music and enemy noises are also very well done.

Atmosphere: 5/5
Turn the lights off in your room, only play at night, and have really good headphones in. One of my close friends started screaming like a little ***** the first time we met a new enemy.

Time Played vs Money Spent: 9/10
There's a decent amount of content, but replaying it isn't really worthwhile. I've nearly beaten the first rundown, and we just started on the 7th. When I buy a game, I try to go for $1 for 1 hour. I've already passed that number by quite a bit and I'm just now starting to get a little bored of the game (mostly because my group keeps throwing bodies at a mission instead of playing literally any of the other ones).

Content Releases: N/A / 10
I haven't been playing the game for that long, so I can't speak much on this. I did read somewhere that the end of the game is coming though, so we'll see how much gets added. Either way, this is tied into my ability to get a good return on the purchase so I'm not too concerned.

Other Factors:
The content is pretty hard as you get further in. The learning curve is pretty smooth, and if we had to replay any missions we used to struggle on, I'm sure we'd easily beat them. This might not be for everyone, but I quite enjoy difficult games and it's been well worth the time. My only other complaint is that you absolutely need 4 real people (3 plus yourself) in comms for the later missions, as the bots aren't the best. What can you expect though.

Final Score: 9/10 Would like to see some new weapons. Really fun game though. Make sure you have 3 other friends with similar schedules to you, don't buy the game alone.",1676934125,1687057569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

--Previous Review --


I really like this game, the game play is super unique and interesting with a great deal of replay ability and difficulty but it does have one major downside that I can't allow myself to fully recommend this game. 
The developers actively remove old content from previous rundowns. Because of this the game is already 1/3 of the potential size it could have been meaning your missing out on a whole bunch of content if you buy the game now. 
I only learned of this when I finally finished my coursework and got back into the game and persuaded a few of my friends to buy the game with me just to be met with the realisation that the not only can I finish the first rundowns content but I also missed the entire second rundown. The 3rd rundowns is notably worse as an introduction to the game as well for newer players as it does not introduce new ideas at a natural flow like the first rundown did.
It is also worth mentioning and stressing at this point this game is HARD but at the same time very satisfying. This means if you have less free time than everyone or god forbid you friends schedules rarely line up (already have this stress organising DnD nights) you will rarely ever get to see the more interesting later levels of each rundown which is a huge missed opportunity and really takes away from the game as a whole.
If the developers ever back track on their decision to actively remove massive chunks of content I will happily change my review to recommend this game.",1592069153,1686084623,True,0,0,0.708617031574249268,4,True,False,True

Even during challenging levels, you get to problem-solve and I look forward to future updates and improvements. I'm probably going to have a lot of hours on this game.

PROS
-Good graphics
-Good story concept, although currently shallow and not much explanation given
-Resource scarcity combined with environment and enemies makes for a compelling horror experience
-Really requires strong teamwork and coordination
-Random map generation adds some variety to environments
-Terminal system is awesome (albeit a bit shallow at the moment).

CONS
-Sometimes the random generation (RNG) of the maps can significantly affect difficulty. (e.g. not getting any boxes in the first few zones for medipacks/ammo)
-Enemy hitboxes can be very wonky at times, which can cause issues with stealth and break immersion
-Customization is very shallow, no weapon attachments or appearances and melee weapons are just reskins
-No matchmaking system (as of 12/28/19), if you don't have a friend group to play with then maybe wait on that feature
-No communication ping system in game - using Discord or some other voice chat application is necessary
-While the specific areas on a map are randomly generated, the objective for each mission is always exactly the same and the mission items are usually in the same areas, which limits the potential of that system

OVERALL
GTFO is an enjoyable co-op game that requires strong teamwork, communication, and hopefully some prior FPS experience. With that being said, it definitely feels like a game in early development and lacks polish. At a lower price tag I would say its worth purchasing now, but for over $30, it may be a good idea to wait for the game to be a bit more feature-rich.

The game heavily relies on stealth mechanics, but unfortunately, this aspect lacks depth and fails to captivate players. The repetitive nature of sneaking around quickly becomes monotonous, leaving players longing for more engaging gameplay elements.

One of the major drawbacks of GTFO is its over-reliance on stealth without offering any substantial depth to this gameplay style. The mechanics feel shallow and lack the complexity needed to make stealth an exciting and strategic component of the game. As a result, the gameplay becomes dull, repetitive, and devoid of the necessary challenges to keep players engaged for an extended period.

The concept of standing in a red circle to open doors is a disappointing design choice. It feels like an arbitrary and unimaginative way to progress in the game. This lack of creativity and reliance on repetitive actions only serves to dampen the overall experience.

Furthermore, the scarcity of ammunition prevents players from embracing a more dynamic and action-oriented playstyle. Instead, they are forced to rely on the mundane and unexciting stealth system, which quickly becomes tiresome. A more balanced approach, where players have the option to employ different strategies, would have greatly improved the overall gameplay experience.

One of the glaring issues with GTFO is its basically nonexistent matchmaking system. The lack of an efficient and effective way to find suitable teammates severely hampers the multiplayer aspect of the game. The matchmaking system makes it frustratingly difficult to form a cohesive team and hinders players from fully enjoying the cooperative gameplay that GTFO intends to offer.

Furthermore, the developers' restrictive stance on mods prevents the community from enhancing and expanding the game in meaningful ways. This limitation not only hampers the potential for user-generated content but also denies players the opportunity to transform GTFO into a more diverse and compelling experience.

It's important to acknowledge a few positive aspects of GTFO. The atmospheric elements within the game are praiseworthy, creating a tense and immersive environment. The gunplay, while infrequently accessible due to scarce ammunition, does exhibit solid mechanics and provides brief moments of enjoyment. Additionally, the sound effects contribute to the game's atmosphere and add a layer of authenticity.

In conclusion, GTFO has the potential to be an amazing game if it weren't for its overemphasis on stealth mechanics. The lack of depth and repetitiveness associated with stealth greatly diminish the overall experience. Tedious door-opening mechanics, and limited ammunition availability only serve to compound the game's shortcomings. The absence of a functional matchmaking system and the developers' reluctance to embrace mods further hinder GTFO from reaching its true potential. While the atmospheric elements and occasional glimpses of engaging gunplay offer some respite, they are simply not enough to salvage the game from its fundamental flaws.",1683282546,1684319006,False,2,1,0.373693406581878662,0,True,False,False

It's got a handful of bugs here and there but its getting constant updates from the dev team, and they're still adding brand new content like new enemies, new weapons, new levels, and new lore. 

If I have one criticism its that the bots are almost useless. Their pathing can be inconvenient at best, infuriating at worst. Sometimes they'll decide to melee a horde of enemies despite having 100% ammo in both of their guns. Sometimes they'll refuse to place down sentry guns or mines when they are doing nothing else. They friendly fire way more than they should, and often prioritize useless resources/consumables over more useful ones.

The devs straight up refuse to implement at least some sort of lobby/server list in-game. The Matchmaking button is useless because no one uses it. They expect you to know through clairvoyance that you need to get into their Discord to find people to play with, and if you don't live in a very populous region and/or speaks fluent english, well f you, you won't find people to play there also.

So now you see yourself with only two options. Play alone, or convince your friend(s) to spend $30 on this weird game too. The vast majority will end up with the first option. Which also means you won't be having fun, because there is another set of problems the devs refuse to address.

The game dificulty is handcrafted for 4 people. But the devs refuse to create any sort of dificulty scaling, so if you are alone, you get to face the same challenge you would with a full party.

But don't worry, after only a few years of the community begging, they were benevolent enough to add AI bots to ""help"" you. Help on quotes because they are so basic and dumb, many missions are actually easier without'em.

So by playing alone you will only go as far as the second level of each rundown, leaving 3/4 of all the game's content on the table simply because you can't find people to play with.

most the game revolves around you doing the exact same melee attack 1000 times on 1000 retarded AI that look the same + dont expect to much effects variety, just same heading popping 100% of the time... and sure you have a ""couple"" other melee weapon choices and a quick melee attack, but yea... you wont be using them unless ur bored.. which probably will happen faster then you think, as it can be fun for the first few hours as its all new... but then when you start to realise how shallow the game is... na du start to endlessly p[ay wack a mole or realise how lazy the dev was balancing weapons / levels etc etc...

yea... 

so even though you will be spending most ur time playing whack a mole... dont expect good melee weapon variety or quality, just the same attack and effect over and over and over..., melee side of the game is still very much in the alpha stage of development and the devs have no plans to ever finish it or fix it, obvious fact the game has been out of early access for some time now and they have no plans on the drawing board to fix their games gaping pot holes and infact refuse to even recognise these pot holes even exist... so u can already tell this game is not going to improve much with time.

so...

you have guns yea>? yes you do, but they basically are balanced to encourage you to spend most your time doing melee and to use them only when a alarm trips etc and as far as weapons go they all look decent, generally sound decent, as for effects... feels like they dropped the ball there and also within balancing as yea... how much ammo u can carry often makes no sense, their accuracy or damage output also often doesnt make sense, simply put every gun will have something about it which defies all logic and its just the devs lazy way of balancing the weapon side of things so they dont have to play test there own levels really at all for proper balancing... 

this is also why weapons generally have about as much range as ur toy nerf gun... im serious and why often a small pistol is way more powerful the a BFG, yet the lore and technical data for the weapons... dont support this logic... basically the devs break their own game lore and logic for their own convenience when it means they have to some proper dev work, something they clearly dont want to do...

hence to try keep it fresh, you dont get access to all weapon each run, so each run has some taken out, some added back in and they also keep adding new game levels, but yea as for new enemies... either they suk or are a lazy re-hash of exiting ones, as such u better get used to virtually seeing the same few enemies over and over with 1 especially 99.9% of time...

and you would think with how much the game revolves around doing melee most the time... they would have put allot of effort into fleshing it out... but no, as suggested it grows old fast if you have more then 2 brain cells.

level design is also often a issue, after u done it enough u start to realise basically all that the devs do to ramp up difficulty is by throwing in a drop and play game mechanic... eg throw toxic gas here., some more there or.. throw a mob spawn here or there and thats ur difficulty boost... 

basically they throw it in anywere and dont really properly play test or balance or fine tune the level or experience for players in most cases or for the majority of the levels... despite this being like 99% of the dev focus since release, till now and for the future...

... as such most levels are built around this lazy repetitious design and sometimes dont even have a part to them which feels like the devs actually fine tuned anything, some feel 100% computer generated level design and placement, simply there is no evidence the devs even did anything.

this also becomes a issue for actual story set pieces as well, were the devs obviously set things up specific for story progression... yet... some parts are even more simplified and lazy then the general level design... they are straight up alpha quality in experience, were some set pieces do feel like they got little more attention, but again only can be considered partially enjoyable one time and after that they are a drag... specially as AI is as dumb as it gets.

AI basically just runs straight 2 u, with only a few exceptions to this rule, but because they have not been scripted very well, once u learn what they do, they are easy to dispatch with any weapon that can reach... again bringing up how most guns function like nerf guns etc to encourage u to play certain way, rather then doing some proper play testing and balancing for each level and the games weapons... so get used to using the same melee weapon and same attack animation for 1000 years and save the ammo for the obviously drop and play game mechanics with limited testing that spam enemies at you, while forcing u to do a ridiculous dance that makes no sense, other then the devs were to lazy to fine tune or play test so they just threw in something that will raise the difficulty without needing them to play test as much.

again... as many mention, the game is not balanced for singleplayer or with AI players very well... they basically released the game with broken player AI, that did more to help the enemy kill u then anything else and that basically hasnt changed much for the harder levels, they become a total nuisance, but as the devs dont want to do any proper playtesting or balancing... well dont expect this to improve by much or if at all long-term... as their dev plan is pretty lazy and designed to make it look like they care and are working hard on the game still... yet so many many many big pot holes.

etc etc...

as such i cant recommend the game, even on sale, this game is only suitable for people who are desperate to scratch that certain itch ( i was one of them, but it failed to satisfy), have 3 other friends they can hook up with (i played solo and with friends) when they want to scratch that itch and dont have to high  standards (i have above average standards compared to most gamers... u know.. u get what u pay for standards $5 game = $5 game...etc) when it comes to games in general are pretty easy to please and most rounds the boys are just for sh**** and giggles, hence dont play the game with full immersion in mind or to take it seriously, as it will destroy its own immersion at every opportunity it can., unless ur brain works on COD level logic, then u might find urself being rather engrossed by it, but for gamers who like good games... yea... cant recommend... its not a good game... its a ok game at best for the first few hours, then it turns into a repetitious drag and the only reason ur doing it, is now just clear the content... were whats ur reward? maybe a so so cosmetic... sorry the game doesnt a proper reward system for completing its missions... as suggested half the game is still stuck in alpha, despite being a  released game... maybe check back in 3-4 years? if on the fence or wait for something better, is what i suggest.

I finished tier A1 on my second attempt and tier B1 on my first attempt just with bots. The game IS easier now in general, and also the newly added AI are more capable than many players probably are, with only a few instances of micromanagement required. In fact they don't make critical mistakes, immediately obey your decisions and always support eachother with high cohesion.
I imagine the game could even be easier with AI depending on your comrades. At least in the first two stages. They saved me from damage and possibly death multiple times directly.

They make minor mistakes, such as being unable to follow moving security scans which I think slowed our override speed - but i'm unsure, leaving some items behind, and being unable to open doors to get to you; close doors behind them. They also cannot synchronise stealth kill, but instead scramble at an alerted enemy with melee. But I did well anyway it seems.

I had a lot of fun too. 
However, all this being said playing with friends was more fun, and like dropping down two more difficulty settings as the enemies no longer target you as highest priority.

- very poorly designed search for players inside the game (matchmaking)
- no character level and prestige (weak motivation of players to play)
- weak customization, we can get for completing the mission - a random item (part of your costume) and opening the next level
- plot of the game? (forget)

I consider all of the above to be a game base, without which interest in the game quickly disappears.

Quite a high difficulty for beginners and a high entry threshold (on the other hand, this is a fun challenge in the company of friends). Other games have the characteristics of weapons and equipment, but here they forgot about it or will they force us to look it up on Wikipedia?

The game is broken into ""Rundowns"" which are limited timed levels that are fairly unique, and have only been getting better as the game is updated. You start with the low difficulty maps and work your way further into the ""dungeon"" to progress and unlock cosmetics. All weapons are unlocked from the start so there is no pay to win as far as I can tell since I've been playing the game.
As far as the actual game-play it's 4 player co-op stealth shooter. You have to sneak and use melee to progress through the level and complete what the warden sent you there for. The game is very much designed that if you fail the stealth checks, you will run out of ammo and die a horrible death. If you don't stealth and conserve ammo you will likely run out of ammo during the horde doors, which are unavoidable scenes that to progress you must survive a horde of mutants that you will absolutely need your guns for.
Learning to stealth and take down the mutants silently is your #1 priority, master this and you will have a huge leg up when it comes to the harder levels.
This is the game I wanted Killing Floor 2 to become...

Make no mistake: You will NOT enjoy this game if you are planning to go it solo, depend on bots, or overall just plan to use the built in match making service.

The game needs a lobby and the ability to host games with a search function. Right now? The game just lets you host an unlisted mission, then randomly pulls from a group of people without taking into account pings or location. So often times, you will end up with people in your lobby who will just leave, causing you to have to rehost the lobby because it won't start looking for players to refill those empty slots.

Even with bots, there are some missions that are nearly impossible to complete without voice communications. I have reached out to some members of the team over at 10 Chambers in hopes to address this, but was told that it was a ""Talking point"".

A Multiplayer game with a subpar matchmaking system is not good for the long term health of the game.

The reality is far more boring.

Matches will take an extremely long time to finish the way the game was ""meant"" to be played, actively encouraging you to  slide down the slippery slope into banality.

I mean, why discord? This game has a lot of potential, but if you make it this hard to matchmake, then why bother? Not everyone has friends who has this game. I get that the point of making a group play from start to finish is to build team play, but not everyone has the time or inclination to set up a small group of strangers just to play a game.[/strike]

[strike]A little suggestion, although I doubt devs will read this, is to allow players to come and go as they please. This has its cons no doubt, but the pros outweigh the cons of the current system.  like, really? joining a Discord group in the hopes of finding a lobby that just happens to be on the level your'e looking to play? You'd be finished with a whole rundown by the time the stars align.[/strike]

[strike]Granted, a matchmaking method akin to CS may end up posing challenges in terms of loadouts, as players will have different loadout preferences. But maybe you can do a placeholder bot that carries its previous player's loadout until someone joins? I dont know how you'd actually do the mechanics of it, but at least figure something out. [/strike]

Matchmaking aside, the bots are ok-ish, definitely better than I expected. The tension is always there, not knowing what waits in the dark adds to the overall ambiance of the game. Pacing is dictated by how the players want to play, risk management is definitely a requirement here. 

Weapon selection also gets a plus for giving players an idea of what kind of performance it brings. sure, these are not numeric stats, but it's described well enough to help players choose one that suits their style. 

[strike]One major markdown I have for gameplay is the ADS. Sure, hold to aim adds to the gameplay, as it's the game's way of making you work extra to hold the gun up. but on the flip side,  it's downright tiring. I can understand if you want to keep this as hold-ADS, but please consider adding toggle ADS as an option.[/strike]

Overall, it's a great game if the player is up to the challenge of carrying bots. Or with friends. Or both. [strike]Perhaps one day you'll implement a matchmaking system that makes it more friction-less for the player.[/strike]

""Old-time"" players are too good, so if you join them, you will be carried through missions with no way to meaningfully contribute, and plenty of ways to irritate them and get kicked out.

There are too few truly new players who would be on your level, and if you manage to find them, you will be overwhelmed by the complex user interface and gameplay mechanics, the non-customizable difficulty etc.

It's as if the developers learned nothing from Left 4 Dead or similar cooperative games, which existed for 10 years (!) -- the very first mission after the super short and simple tutorial is already ~40-50 minutes long and you are likely to get wiped after spending 30 minutes in it. That is just bad design.

  [Old] I've never had more fun figuring a game out, usually I figure games out quick but I was totally and utterly lost at first but so intrigued. only played with a mate and solo and havnt beat the 1st mission yet but once you start to figure it out it becomes really satisfying when you conserve resources and play smart. Also just figuring out the main objectives is not like any other game I've played, theres problem solving and life or death decision making all throughout and I've only had a small taste.

  [Updated] I'm not entirely sure of the patch notes, I love playing this game blind, but the friendly bots they added really helped me enjoy this game and feel like it was possible as solo or duo. I finally completed my first expedition 20+ hours in the game. Besides jumpscares there's not many games or movies etc that came make me feel truly scared but this game evokes a level of dread and hesitation with every step. 

  As difficult and complex as this game is it is fully teamwork oriented, I remember trying to solo it and even using stealth and every item I can find to my advantage the security doors got me every time. Having 2-3 bots makes things so much better, and the A.I. doesn't blow your cover and can even do simple tasks. There's hardly any other game I don't look up guides for but the mystery and unknown challenge is making this game so much richer every time I play it.

Why? How is the original extraction point not good enough?  

Let's fill the whole level with toxic fog with specific order of correct sequence to clean areas - fair enough. Collect N batteries to jump start the reactor? Why not bring these batteries from the upper levels in the same way we do with HSU's? They are commonplace enough... So yes, instead of making logical and organic environment the devs are just trying to screw up the players which tends to be annoying

Thanks devs, you've really improved this and made it actually playable whilst still retaining some challenge. My friends and I played this years ago at LAN and got so frustrated we left the review below. Getting to the objective and then being challenged to return to the start with limited resources, brutal friendly fire, and a constant horde was a step too far.

Now it's much more about the atmospheric challenge and exploration, along with an interesting cryptic story! Thanks so much for listening to the majority.


Original review below:

GTFO is a stealth and communication game over a horror game, and can be a blast with friends. The creepy, macabre atmosphere of the environment is really well constructed and fun to move around and explore, but is only so dangerous because of the micro-missteps you can make that quickly ruin a run.

And that's what makes the game so hard to recommend. If the game were more forgiving, or had more forgiving modes, you and your friends might work your way up to the challenge of the higher difficulties. As it is, unless you and your three friends are excellent shooters, communicate perfectly, and share resources optimally, you'll definitely end up playing the same levels over and over again which whilst the same in structure are randomised in terms of risk, making some playthroughs feel much more unfair than others.

Is is 'Left 4 Dead' if 'Left 4 Dead' only launched with an 'Insane' difficulty mode and half the ammo.

The premise is fantastic; the focus of the developers to prioritise making it hard over enjoyable is not.",1591786677,1681674842,True,0,0,0.591952383518218994,5,True,False,True

=======================
a. Buy it with friends or gift it. 
b. You need friends to play this
c. Take note you cannot save anytime.  So any mistake thats it!
d. Why you cant play it solo? enemies will hoard you while doing other tasks
e. Join discord to play with other players
f. Enemies are random generated. Which means every play through is different 

What to expect?
1. You will die multiple times
2. Stealthy or Die
3. You need to team up or Hoard will kill you
4. Don't repeat your mistakes or you keep dying
5. you will melee most of the time
6. Ammo and Health packs are scarce 
7. The Higher map level will require you to use more of your guns.
 
This game immersive with friends. funny, annoying and most of the time frustrating it will test your patience.

Right now the character selection is kinda boring i hope they will keep there promise for character progression where you can level up skills. also customize the look of your characters, skins, etc.

Perhaps a save point? as it is right now its kinda flat. There is no point of moving forward if there is no reward. The only reward i can see is playing with other people. and blaming friends for not being careful lol!",1577030926,1681569154,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I've grown to accept this game as viable fun with a qualified recommendation.  Matchmaking and bots have helped the solo problem, though doesn't nullify the value of friend team members.  More weapons/items and boosters gives more team build variety.   Gunplay feels a bit better.  Multiple rundowns are available.  There's some progression related unlocks. 

Overall the game has evolved to a more balanced place.  I still have reservations about how the gameplay loop can seem stale due to the forced method of stealth and lack of more depth (ie. more options with navigating the facilities, intel/cyber options, more puzzle solving, etc); but if you're after a team challenge and you have a team that has patience for it, this game works.  

My thoughts previously during the early stages of early access:
---------------------------------
Somewhat surprised about the amount of positive reviews; this game is in development and hopefully will be improving, but in current state is nowhere near worth the price point of the offering, nor does the current game represent the 'gameplay' trailers they have on their store page.  Requires 4 players, no real exceptions; no matchmaking, find your own friends; the first person shooter element is not really viable -- your fireteam cannot fight their way through every scenario, or even most situations where things 'go loud' as the guns are weak and aiming mechanics feel rough; instead, the core gameplay loop is playing whack-a-mole with synchronized crouch walking up to sleeping enemies.  Supposedly there is more to the game, but watch actual gameplay videos -- it seems to be a repeating theme in every room with few variance.  Hopefully, the game will develop further and change significantly with some much needed complexity/layers added to the core gameplay loop.  In current state, I don't particularly recommend the game for the price point.",1581924741,1681542967,True,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

For the most part, they are designed around a relatively simplistic and often repetitive gameplay loop, with any sense of variety banking on the interactions between players and with the game's environment. In that sense, GTFO isn't much different. The bulk of the game consists of the same handful of tasks spread across many visually indistinct levels and prefab rooms (especially true in earlier rundowns). To add to that, even with the various task types, the general gameplay loop is often very similar, consisting of slow, methodical progression interspersed with small moments of intense action.

That said, the true value of GTFO doesn't arise from its objectives or scenery. it comes from the sheer brutality of its difficulty. Missions are a resource efficiency problem disguised as a co-op FPS. Every section is intentionally designed to make the path to victory feel like precariously balancing on a knife's edge. Missions are long, resources are scarce, and fatal mistakes are never more than a misstep away. Literal hours of setup can fall flat because you or your friend had a momentary lapse of situational awareness.

You accidentally wake an enemy at the wrong time? Restart.
You use your guns a little too liberally at the start of a mission? Restart.
You fat-finger a four-letter code on a computer terminal? Restart.
You ignore the medipack your team left near the start? Restart.

You guys should really just tone it down by 50% and it'll be much more manageable, it's understandable that you're trying to make it atmospheric and intense in those eerie scenarios in-game, but when it's on nearly every level- it's not that thrilling. It's just annoying.

and you guys missed your chance at doing gun customizations, doesn't even have to be at a csgo level skins and stickers etc., but just give us SOMETHING hahah. Even choosing between a red dot or halo or acog scope would be nice on select weapons

Trust me, you are gonna need every health and ammo you could spare later into each expedition; that's just how hot and out-of-hand the situation tend to become when the alarm is sounding and the enemies are swarming.

The enemies in GTFO will prove themselves challenging to tackle. Not only they are quite dodgy (they do not stand still), their attacks are not easy to evade, too; They can perform melee from a greater distance than your shove/bash, and their range attacks have a slight ""homing"" property so it can't be dodged with simple side-stepping (you'll need to change direction when the projectile is just about to hit you).

GTFO is grim, harsh, sweaty. It's not your typical horde-game where players are merely required to fight at each other's side and shoot at everything that moves; They will have to carefully decide their loadout, play their part properly, coordinate with each other, and most importantly: Be patient and take it slow because screw-ups are likely to cost valuable resources.

The pace of GTFO is probably the most unique aspect of its experience, albeit it can be deemed too time-consuming and not inherently exciting, but the stress that slowly builds up is indeed heart-racing and deeply rewarding for you would have come to realize that how much it takes to succeed or just how easily it could have failed.


If anything else, the system and QoL isn't amazing but serviceable, Bot AI can be idiotic just like many other games, there is little to none appeal for casual players, and you definitely want to delve into GTFO with 3 friends.

In sum, I'd say GTFO is a 7.9/10 -- Work together or die together.",1677278539,1680590834,True,107,6,0.877858996391296387,0,True,False,False

The matchmaking sucks for solos. Yes, I know you shouldn't play as a solo anyway due to unreliable teammates, but its really all I have. The bots aren't horrible but you still need at least three players and a bot to be any level really. 

Another issue was a common bug I ran into myself; glitched mission items. This happens if anyone on your team has picked up the item and you have re-spawned at a check point. It creates two versions of the item; one on the ground and one in a player's hands. These can be swapped as long as a player carries one of the items. If only one person is carrying the item they cannot drop it or perform most tasks. A level ruining bug and possibly causing a mission restart as it effectively removes a player permanently.

That's all. 
Other than poor matchmaking and a few bugs for the devs to work out, you are looking at a great coop shooter. Great graphics, gun play and balancing. I will say the game is certainly difficult and would be a great challenge for a group of four. 
Despite the bugs I think it was worth the money.

This game is fantastic if you have a few friends to regularly play with but sadly if you are a solo player you are given 3 bots which although are more useful than ai companions in most games, DO NOT cut it especially farther into run downs. IF YOU ARE SOLO/DUO CONSIDER OTHER GAMES

-Constant attention to their tool use and bugs in doing so (Many times in a heated moment you'll tell a npc to mine a door before it implodes and then they simply just don't do it even after addressing the player with an ""I'm on it"" or ""Will do"")
-Inability to coordinate movement (incredibly challenging for security scans where many more waves than usual would spawn because of AI being unable to efficiently turn off the alarm)
-Inefficient use of resources (I'll regularly see bots shooting shotguns at far away enemies, attempting melee combat while being over ran, taking A TON of damage most players could avoid, and wasting special weapon ammo on normal mobs.)
-Not going past doorways resulting in them being locked out and downed or causing you to take more damage waiting for them (sometimes they'll just straight up melee fight infront of the door while hordes are rushing towards your team)

A lot of my gripes with the game simply boil down to their FIRM stance on not scaling difficulty to player count, if I could solo without the help of bots and have a equivilant challenge I would simply adore the game, but I cannot, and seemingly from the dev responses will not be able to. You are forced to play with either randoms (terrible, simply bad to have to work in a team with brand new people not to mention most are just losers crying whenever something goes wrong or any resources are wasted or if you perfer a weapon they deem inferior to the other choices, you run into many alpha commando's shouting orders and letting you know why you suck and are being removed from the lobby.) or with your friends which is an amazing time, besides most people not wanting to spend 40$ on pretty much the equivilant of masturbating with sandpaper hands--which don't get me wrong I fuckin love but it's not everyone cup of tea obviously.

While it is fun, the fact that is it has no save mechanic and the levels can last over 2 hours, I cant recommend this. Not everyone has this much free time all at once much less coordinating 4 people to have the same. There are bots with commands and I think a matchmaking system now but what is the point if I dont have the time to do the entire run in one sitting like the game demands.

The game desyncs for me and another friend of mine after roughly the 30-45min mark. Sometimes the game starts desynced, Doors not opening, invisible players, watching everything happen up to a minuet ago (very weird). Then you have to leave and come back which doesnt fix everything. Its really frustrating when the animations on the sleepers get desynced. Also dont hold a battery durring a checkpoint or you wont be able to drop it and your entire run is killed.

Mods dont allow progress of any kind, so even if you wanted fix various things like lighting colors, giving resource packs to your friends (but it gives it to you instead), or the inability to ping sleepers then you give up all forms of progression.

It's far more complete than the last time I played, but it's not actually finished and it never will be. The dev's can call this whatever they want, but it's not a finished game by any means, at least not compared to what was promised. I was there from the start I remember your marketing. 

Matchmaking: What matchmaking? Apparently that's up to the player. All matchmaking as far as I can tell has been 
                         exported to Discord. Which is laughable. The only way I could see of getting people to join me when I host these 
                         days is to copy paste a link into Discord and only Discord.

Community: Tend to bully and harass in mobs anyone that dare try to criticise the game. Hate noobs. Lovely. 

Social features: None exist as far as I can tell.

Payer base: Very, very small. In the hundreds.

 
Learning curves: Everything in this game is a learning ledge. Either you know or you don't know and that's it.
The stats of the all important weapons the selection of which can and probably will determine your success on a run? 
There are none. Nothing but a vague written description like 'fast', 'slow', 'medium' 'high damage/low damage' semi auto etc. No numbers not even those really stupid sliders games these days love. There are redundant weapon combinations that will get you killed and you have no way of knowing this until you're dead.

Same with navigation a core part of the gameplay loop. To find an objective one must look it up on a terminal, which one must find without any directions. Once you find a terminal (at least one of the few things the tutorial/'training' teaches you how to do) you must enter a command to 'ping' the location of what you're trying to find. Cool, sounds great.

So let's say the object is in zone 60 area J. Well you won't know that, or that there even is a Zone 60 or area J until you are told about it (or happen to stumble into it and notice where you are), and when pinging an object in another zone you only get the zone it's in -zone 60. OK so where is that and how do we find it? Ping the object..... 

Do you see the issue yet? Well at least you can find out where you are by looking at zoning signs on doors and walls, as well as typing 'info' on a terminal. Well that's step 1 and 2 done -where are we and where we going. How do we get there though? How do you know which direction to go in, how do you draw a route from A to B? You don't. The game says you can and that pinging continuously pings objects so you can home in on them, but it doesn't.

The only part of the map that is visible is the map you've already visited and the only part you can zoom in on and read is you're current location. SO even if you find the right area, miss the objective and leave you can't fucking see that correct area on the map properly UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY THERE WTF!?

The only way to know the map is prior knowledge. The only way to know where you're going is to already know where you're going. So each run challenges you once in this regard and then never again, unless you completely forget.

The entire game is like this, and the existing community love it because they have already gone through the learning curve.
They love torturing people with the crucible of total information blindness that is this game. I'm one of those people that have gone through most of the learning curve by the way, and I still think it's horrendous. Every single knowable thing in this game relies on memory because it's not recorded anywhere else in the game and it's terrible. I'm sure someone somewhere has written in depth guides and such, which would is great, but that's not a merit of the game.

For the price, the broken promises and the continued toxicity of the everyone involved in this thing I cannot recommend it.
Even buying with a group of friends to play together that is minimum $220 AUD which is an absurd price. 

The game is unfinished, unpolished, barely supported no new content just shuffling around runs and it's going to stay like that.
I'm going to try and squeeze what enjoyment I can from GTFO since I already own it, and maybe I will change my review as a result. I hope it redeems itself the more I play it, but I have a ever growing list of concerns and annoyances with this game.",1679936590,1679936590,False,10,2,0.53273308277130127,0,True,False,False

Good Game.In all seriousness, I am a huge fan, this game is exactly the thing you want when you're looking for a challenge to take on with a team. Keep in mind it is balanced around having four players in the sense that the the threat level of enemies is proportional to the equivalent of 4 human players, which means teamwork, communication, and coordination are heavily rewarded when playing with teammates. If you can't get a consistent group together and you don't want to play with randoms through matchmaking you're either soloing or playing with bots. Soloing isn't really realistically accomplishable for a player learning the game so I would say if you're only going to play this game with friends, make sure you have at least 1-2 friends who will try this game with you, are comfortable matchmaking with randoms, or like me don't care to just play w/ bots all the time. Bots have a fair amount of flaws, between bugs and their AI they often will not fulfill the same role as a human-controlled player could in the same situation (not to mention their aim isn't the greatest). As to how much you can reasonably progress without that ideal consistent 4-stack, with some time and practice you can probably do most levels if you have more than 1 other human controlled player if you fill in the rest of the lobby with AI.",1679178304,1679828629,True,2,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False

What I got was a more serious title. Not more serious in tone or mood, but in the way of playing. For me, when I join GTFO, I feel like I should play with the mindset of just straight beating the game, not as much as having crazy times with friends. Because of this, me and my friends got quite bored of the game quite quickly, all putting it down. A couple months later, I decided to hop on the game with some people on the official GTFO discord. I feel I've found a new way to enjoy the game, but definitely one that subverted my initial expectations. I've gotten into that mindset of getting each level done, and I'm more into the social aspect of the game, but that's fine for me.

Can't rightfully recommend a game that the devs are purposefully gimping in the name of some bizarre sense of hardcoreness and ""community."" If you want community, build it in game instead of shunting it off to a third party, your playerbase is already small enough without splitting it like this.Really really excellent game, I like it a lot and I'd like to play more of it however...while there is an in-game matchmaking system (kinda), matchmaking is done almost exclusively through the Discord and the devs encourage this almost to the point of seemingly resenting the idea of just doing it in-game. Your mileage will vary but I really don't like it. The community is already pretty small for an already niche game and, while it's a simple one, the extra barrier to entry doesn't really help with that. Sometimes I just wanna hop in without all the rigamarole but I can't really and while solo is possible that's not really what the game's about. Basically be sure to bring some friends.Other than that though the game's gold. Graphics, art direction, UI style, and atmosphere are all incredible. Weapons are all cool but the gadgets really steal the show and let you be an asset to the team even while you're getting used to the game.

And they don't actually expect you to come back.

Now, let me get this clear: don't think of this as another L4D or B4B or whatever else.
This is different.

How do i even explain this... Think ""SWAT"" meets ""The Thing"" meets ""Aliens"".
The loud shooting sections only make up like 1/3 of the game, with majority of time being spent on stealth, exploration and trying to figure what is even your objective.


[h1]THE GOOD[/h1]
[list]

[*] Immersive tactical horror sim

[*] Challenging objectives that will often take multiple wipes and reattempts

[*] Teamwork is not optional - good communication and preparation is key to success

[*] Amazing feeling of accomplishment when you complete the mission

[*] Subjective: cool aesthetics of ""heavy industrial sci-fi""
[/list]



[h1]THE BAD[/h1]
[list]
[*] Completely unfriendly to solo players.

Playing alone is not really an option. You have bots that work [i]OK[/i] but lack the intelligence to perform advanced team maneuveres which is crucial to complete advanced missions.
You'll be able to get by through A's, B's and maybe even some C's with them but by the time you hit D's - either you find actual players to work with or you're stuck (unless you are a god gamer or something).

[*] Mandatory Official Discord Server participation.

As of v1.0 release [i](Rundown 6 update)[/i] the game has a proper ""matchmaking"" feature.
Unfortunately - it basically doesn't work. Not because it can't but because it has no one to work with.
95% of the game's most active community members all hang out on the official Discord server and use its' LFG (Looking For Players) channels to find people to play with.
Every so often a newbie comes by, asking why the hell he can't find anybody and we have to explain to him why and make him part of the cult too.
And so it is, that matchmaking remains undead.

Here's the link btw: https://discord.gg/gtfo

[*] Low performance.

The game is build on Unity Engine and has some intense visuals, but also new levels are often not very optimised. Depending on a level my average FPS can be 100 or 50 on my 5/10 PC. It also tends to degrade with longer sessions and checkpoint reloads, especially the latter. 

[*] Long gaming sessions that require commitment. 

Missions take on average ~60 minutes to beat, with shortest being ~30 minutes and longest up to ~90 minutes. This does not account for team performance and wipe restarts, which can prolong a single mission attempt to 2 and more hours.
There's no ""continue"" option - either you get it done in one go, or you wipe / quit and try another day. 

[*] Overbearing, borderline sadistic difficulty. 

This won't hit you immediately, but it will.
A and B tier levels are fine, but once you hit C-tiers - the game will start showing its' true colours. Don't even get me started on E's.

Soulsborne's Git Gud crowd got nothing on these psychopaths. 
[/list]




[h1]THE GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Each mission has its own unique set of objectives. Usually its something related to keeping Complex operational, or making progress on whatever the hell Warden is up to. 

The gameplay generally consists of 2 sections: stealth and loud. 

Stealth is NOT optional. Most of the time, anyway. Ammo and other supplies are scarse and it's preferable to avoid any unnecessary spendings.
This is where most of playtime goes into. You'll be crawling through dark rooms, smacking sleeping monsters on the head, until eventually you'll run into one of alarm events.

This is where loud section begins.
The alarm will keep blaring, sending waves of monsters your way, until you do something to stop it. If you even can, that is: some alarms are permanent and will continue until the very moment you extract.

During loud gameplay the rest of game's mechanics come into play.
Not only prisoners have access to a variety of firearms, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and roles, but also to tactical tools: automated sentries, mines, construction-grade foam and even an Alien-style biotracker. 
Bringing correct tools for the job and using them appropriately is the key to success. You won't get away with just shooting things yourself - not with this limited ammo supply.

You stealth to conserve bullets, you shoot to survive, you survive to get shit done, and you get shit done to get your extraction point and GTFO.



It must be noted that there is no progression system in this game.
All the gear is available from the start and there's nothing new to unlock, not even a new aiming sight or anything - all the guns come completely pre-baked.

You do, however, receive random cosmetic items for your character upon successful expedition clears. Better than nothing i suppose.",1642218649,1679534411,True,5,0,0.568141460418701172,0,True,False,False

However, there are two glaring issues, or perhaps better framed as features I dislike, that prevent me from recommending it to anyone but the wiki-warriors who plan meticulously their actions in advance, look up what is coming, and/or the rare player who doesn't mind losing hours of progress to simple mistakes and retreading the same ground over and over till the task is done.

Issue #1: Checkpoints
Not that there aren't any, they are just so sparse that you may not realize they exist, and when some levels can be upwards of 2 hours long, this is a major problem when you fail at the last second, and are forced back to the main menu, all progress *poof* vanished before your eyes.

There could be a checkpoint system too, the security scans in the game are clear delineation points between areas, and all players must be present, so it would be a natural assumption that they would be checkpoints both in a literal game sense and in the context of the setting.  The choice to load an earlier checkpoint, restart entirely, or quit out to re-gear would be so helpful.  However, I do understand why they are so few and far between, and I'll touch on that at the end, but for now, the issue of losing all progress due to bad loadouts, mistakes, or simply being overwhelmed is a big sore spot when the progress lost is measured in the half hour plus range.

Issue #2: Planning & Foreknowledge
GTFO, it feels to me, assumes that you will play through a mission at least 3 times.  Once to blow through as quick as you can, reach the end or an impassible obstacle, fail, and take those lessons home.  A second play through with meticulous note taking, what gear is available, where are the enemies coming from, what tools would be best used here, etc.  Then a final successful run with the right gear, the right resource management, and the right tools and traps to overcome the frankly overwhelming numbers the game can sometimes throw at you.

This is just my assumption, because the missions give scant little in the way of clues to their parameters, expected difficulties, suggested gear, weapons, etc, or really anything in the way of information with which to make a run successful.  At least in my experience you have to do one of two things before a really successful run, die multiple times banging your head against the foe because you brought a mine layer with no tight corridors or good places to set up mines, or look up what to bring from a wiki/guide.  Now, as to why these two issues may or may not be issues to you.

Final Thoughts and Extreme Difficulty
GTFO sells itself as an ""Extreme cooperative horror shooter"" and that you must use ""Stealth, strategy, and teamwork"" to survive.  These things are all true.  However, for many I imagine the 'extreme' part of the extreme cooperative horror shooter is not going to be something that most people will like, as it FAR and away leans on the ""Extreme Stealth, Strategy, and Teamwork"" than ""Extreme Shooter"".  With some exceptions, you cannot get through a level without stealth, guns blazing, and still succeed.

I would say that stealth is an absolute necessity, but recent updates have made more fast paced gun play or aggressive melee possible, which is very welcome, in earlier versions the damage enemies, even basic ones, dealt was so high and their aggro range/speed so great that we gave up playing till the game was updated.  Which it was.  An enemy that is 'unfair and unfun' to fight is a type of extreme, but not one that I would subject myself to.  And, to be clear, the enemies as they are now are not unfair or unfun, but can be tedious due to a lack of variety and their propensity to run up behind and repeatedly whack you in the back, but that's our fault not the designers.

GTFO, again, I assume, wants you to go through each level blind, then informed.  While it is possible to win earlier rundowns blind, later ones will punish poor planning with intense fervor and while possible to make it an hour into a mission struggling, the last push is often an overwhelming wall that can only be surmounted by excellent resource management, pinpoint gun play, and liberal application of 'go ape' melee when the chips are down.  

My main complaint about GTFO is its main selling point, the 'extreme cooperative' part.  With four confident, capable, and communicative friends, GTFO is a great time, though sometimes frustrating with how it dribbles out resources and information.  With even a single AI or heaven forbid some random person on your squad, CoD mentality and racial slurs in tow, the game is impossible beyond the first few rundowns.  A ""sneakin is for wussies"" mentality will just get your whole squad killed, and no amount of ""The game should give us more ammo"" whining can prepare the average boomer shooter fan for success in GTFO.

However, what's even worse to me, despite all the planning, trial and error over multiple runs, and careful resource management, runs can still end in failure with only a few simple mistakes.  Hours of progress lost to the callous whims of enemies who can melee attack with lightning reflexes, ranged attacks that are near silent, homing, and extremely tedious to deal with, and enemy numbers that make you wonder how it was supposed to be done when you have 100% ammo across the board and multiple refills yet still can't outlast the foe.

I applaud the developers tuning back stealth somewhat so it's less a manic game of red light green light, more flexible, and more open to creative melee chaos ruling the day, but there are so many small features that make me question why.  Why can't we see the stats of guns?  At least their ammo values, like, how hard is it for someone to count the bullets in a magazine?  I'd love to have a Planetside 2 damage chart with dropoff at range and all that, but even just the ammo count at 100% would be better than the nothing plus 2-4 vague adjectives the game currently has.  That artifacts are so fiddly, finite, and frankly feel pathetically useless.  What in the hell is 4% melee damage supposed to do for me?  How could I even tell this was helping?  It's the exact opposite problem of the guns, why do they tell us the artifacts piddly little buffs but not something substantial like how much damage the guns do?  I could go on.

If you somehow got to the end of this after reading all that rambling above, thanks, and I do hope it helps inform your purchase of GTFO.  I can't personally say it's worth getting, because I'm still waiting for it to be a better game, but I don't think it will ever get there because the game I want isn't the extreme game that the developers want, and that's okay.  If nothing else, it's worth playing at least for a few hours just for the amazing atmosphere, tense stealth, and frenetic firefights that occur even in the first few rundowns.  Whether you get your $40 worth out of just that is very debatable, but if it's half off for a 4-6 hour experience I'd easily recommend it just because there isn't much like it out there. 

tl:dr - Game's fun, but frustrating if you don't treat it very seriously, be prepared to lose hours of progress to figuring out what tools/guns to bring if you don't look up guides, and it's probably best purchased on sale unless you're into red light green light.",1679269612,1679269612,False,3,0,0.511770725250244141,0,True,False,False

I've only played through one mission but i'm reviewing it now since I dont know when else i'm going to get the opportunity to play it since it requires a group of pretty close knit friends all around the same skill level to get the most out of it, due to it being a really hard co-op game. I can see the game potentially getting repetitive to some people due to there not being an overwhelming selection of guns and tools, but to me that kind of adds to the charm and allows you to get a base understanding of each weapon really quickly and figure out level strategies faster. Despite being really hard I don't find the game overwhelming at all; the only part that is kind of confusing is how level progression is structured and the whole ""rundown"" bit, which isn't really explained well to new players. But the actual gameplay itself is surprisingly straightforward and easy to jump into- my friends had played the game before and I was brand new, we just started a level they were stuck on and I got the hang of it pretty quick.

I enjoy how the levels don't randomize very much between runs, the structure and doors remain the same so you can actually plot out strategies by playing a level over and over again. The gunplay is fairly standard but feels good and it's super satisfying to hit an enemy in the head with a sledgehammer. There's a half & half split between ""stealth"" and ""action"" so it never feels like you're doing the same thing for too long and there's a lot of on-the-fly thinking to figure out what strategy you should use in what situation. If you mess up and get hit you don't die instantly; you actually have a pretty generous amount of health and ammo given to you at the start... the challenge is that you have to make it last nearly the entire mission since there are very sparse resources.

Overall if you like survival horror games and want to play a heavily co-op themed survival horror game this is probably the absolute best game for you. I never felt super scared while playing it but there definitely was a tension that never let up during the whole game, similar to early survival horror where you have extremely limited resources and hate having to take any unnecessary fights.",1679033794,1679033817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game, developed by 10 Chambers Collective, has been touted as a challenging and intense experience that requires high levels of coordination and communication between players. However, the game's potential is hindered by its limited stealth mechanics and lack of gameplay variations. This is particularly disappointing considering the potential that the game exhibited in its early stages, particularly at the conclusion of rundown 2.

However, the game's issues have continued to mount with the introduction of rundown 3 and subsequent updates. This phase can only be described as experimental, marked by fluctuating difficulty levels, strange balancing decisions that suggest the developers are not playing their own game, and tedious and (mostly) uninspired level designs. While the game includes promising concepts, their implementation is often lacking, resulting in a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. Additionally, the game sufferes from numerous bugs, further detracting from the overall enjoyment of the game.

Another significant issue with GTFO is the lack of replay value or incentives to keep playing after clearing a rundown. Once players have completed the levels, there is little reason to keep playing. The absence of meaningful rewards or progression systems makes it difficult to stay engaged with the game for an extended period.

It remains a mystery as to why the developers chose to implement a half-assed matchmaking system instead of a straightforward lobby browser, and then encourage players to use the third-party platform Discord to find other players. The current matchmaking system is not only useless, but it also undermines the game's intended cooperative experience by making it frustratingly difficult to find others to play with.

Finally, the lengthy content droughts in GTFO make it a constant struggle for players to stay engaged with the game. These prolonged periods of inactivity leave players with little new content to explore. To make matters worse, the developers have actively worked against their core community by ignoring valid feedback and targeting modders who were trying to create interesting new content for the game.

All in all, I would have wished for nothing more than this game to succeed, and having spent a lot of hours playing, modding and discussing the game, maybe it did. If you have 3 friends, there is still fun to be found in GTFO and to some degree I recommend it. But for me, GTFO will always be the disappointing game that could have been.

 It really is worth a shot, the guns feels like shit and the movement feels like you running with your pants down while having diarrhoea attacks, but stills the atmosphere of this game is unprecedented, I'm an horror fan cause I'm a pretty horrible person my self and if you are somewhat the same(hopefully not) you have to play this game. 

But honestly this game is very overpriced, it's nothing particularly hard or innovative at it's core and Deep rock galactic offer MUCH MORE for less but like VERY MUCH MORE, i'd say that 70% of the game is the atmosphere. Still if you like horror tactical stuff and you have 30 quid to clean your butt with, use toilet paper instead and buy this game and play with bots, It's really cool, plus the game is surprisingly well balanced.

Imho the actual honest price for what the game has to offer depth and progression wise should be free to play at max, just joking but it should be around 15 to 20 if you out of your mind to be realistic.

Now buy the game play it at night with surround and shit yourself, this game is a better horror that all the horror movies made in the last 15 years all together, comparable only to Dead space, whoever is the fucking psycho that gave birth to this should be put in psychiatric ward, but so should I so it's fine.

And really my only gripes with the game are the use of a discord server for online play and the dog shit bots.

Looking at the sheer number of positive reviews for this game I feel like I'm missing something because I did not enjoy this game at all, and co-op survival horror is my jam so this surprised me. There is a ton of potential here and the core of the game is strong. There are some great visuals and good ambience throughout but some things felt really out of place.

For one, the UI is clunky. I had to search online to figure out how to create a multiplayer game with my friends. Ammo, tool, and health packs weren't intuitive to me at all. When I picked these up I couldn't figure out how to use them. The UI font choices are very small, and in some places the contrast between the text color and background is not sufficient so its very easy to miss UI queues. Lastly the weapons feel pretty shitty compared to other FPS games. I was constantly underwhelmed by the damage I was doing to enemies and frustrated by how unrefined the guns ""felt"". This is difficult to explain but I've played a lot of FPS games and the machine guns felt ""cheap"". No matter how good my aim was it seemed like most shots were missing just for effect.

The ""questing"" is very tedious. Go find this item, now find a terminal and enter a command, now go find a key card, now double back and go open a door, but wait for the security scan. If you compare this to Aliens Fireteam Elite, the level mechanics just feel unnecessarily slow (with lots of doubling back and repetitious ""tasks"" to perform)

As I said before, the bones are good. This game has potential and I can see how others may love it but it wasn't for me. I'll come back in a few months to see if patches have smoothed out the UI issues and streamlined the gameplay experience.",1668051882,1678416254,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most of the reviews that are negative (not all but most) are because of the difficulty. Like the devs say the success rate for most missions is very low. That doesn't mean you can't trial and error your way through it even with minimal skill. The same goes for literally any game. The devs are incredibly transparent and even tout the difficulty of the game (which in all fairness is fine). The game plays great, feels great, and is very rewarding/satisfying when you finally beat a level you've been stuck on for a while. All in all I feel like it's fine to not enjoy the difficulty. The game's just not for you. However, I don't believe it's fair for that to reflect negatively on the game or the devs because of that. They are VERY transparent about the difficulty before people get into it. Not to mention most of the things people find difficult have a simple or easy solution you can use to manipulate your odds by utilizing the tools provided for you. Again... trial and error like ANY other game. If you don't like difficult games where you can lose a lot of progress from a loss then don't play.

When you're done, go to the fan wiki, go to youtube, dive into the gtfo deep lore and be pleased!  Don't have any boys?  Join the dev's discord, they've got an LFG channel, and you'll have a squad ready or not to gtfo in no time flat.

Longer review

The coolest thing about the game is the build up. For example. 
1: The Menu
2:The ""drop"" 
3: The initial 30 minutes of playing

Then you realize its an extremely repetitive and tedious and enemies are overall pretty boring and everything is messy when the fighting finally does happen. I don't care if this is ""realistic"" I care if the damm game is actually fun.
There is also little to no ammo? Apparently everyone likes this? Why would you send a team down to accomplish something you benefit from, without proper resources from the start? If the game had cooler stealth mechanics and cooler melee combat I guess that would make it better but why not make the game more dynamically difficult and just have more ammo? I don't know. I like what they tried to do but ultimately it is pretty meh. 

If there weren't so many better games out there, I ultimately would think its more worthwile. But lifes short yall lol",1678076422,1678252998,False,2,1,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Each """"rundown"""" is a collection of levels which get progressively harder following some kind of theme. they are actually hard, but in the sense that if your friend misses half a mag you might not have enough ammo to even finish the level an hour later. earlier levels are much more lenient though.
Atmosphere is fantastic and sound design is cool. the weapons and tools also feel good to use, and the *lore* is presented in a way that makes it interesting and speculative.
Replay value is very minor, levels are the same but with objectives moved around each time, but this is more of a game with missions that you struggle through and then never play again because theres no need. which is why the game dies a month or 2 after a new rundown is released.

Note the game is just about a year or so from being no longer updated i believe, since the devs are adding back all previous rundowns for good. they vehemently believed removing previous rundowns when a new one came out was an awesome idea but it was dumb. regardless there will be plenty of content to make it worth it assuming you have friends to play with. but if you REALLY want to get in and play with randoms from the discord this is likely the last year for it.",1677892475,1677892475,True,1,0,0.526627242565155029,0,True,False,False

This is an experience
And that is why it sadly sucks and has been gathering dust in my steam library
Basically you NEED other people to play this with since majority of the missions (which swap rundowns making the previous levels unplayable) are hard as balls
And it is a good expirence and feeling when you succeed with a squad of people but most hard missions can and or will take up to 2-3 hours and NEEDING other people to play the game to even have a chance at winning is just too exhausting. (That and people just often have lives and want to do other enjoyable things so the whole length fucks everything over)

in the comment section to this game on the 2022 end of the year post you can find one dev stating they are happy that the rate is so low because no other game lets you do that.

the matchmaking is basically non existent. the alternative that the devs give is to join their discord (an off platform application so they can moderate without discretion). which users have posted being banned from (no reasons given so take that with a grain of salt).

lastly here we go about game play. its very fun. so fun in fact that this is one of the two reasons why people will back this game up so much. slowly crawling your way through hordes of enemies and hacking your way at a problem with precision and timing with 3 others. this makes you feel like a real specialist who is doing something that really no one else can.
now that's the thing. almost no one actually can. because the in game runs are so long that you or anyone else on your team WILL mess up. and the ensuing gun fight will take most of your health and resources because you were caught out of position. leaving you under prepared and unable to continue on with the rest of your mission. one of the main contributing factors on why over 80 PERCENT of player runs fail.

lastly i give you one last piece of evidence on why or why not to buy this game. GTFO won on December 22nd 2022 the steam award for ""BEST GAME YOU SUCK AT"". even players who love this game and say that there isnt anything wrong with it had to come out and vote for this. because they know in their hearts that this game is so hard, that even those few who know the intricate ins and outs of this game still truly suck at it.

now then if you still wanna buy it because you love the challenge then please go ahead. as i said before the game itself is truly fun. hence why i put almost 40 (and soon to be over 40) hours into it.",1677858752,1677858752,False,159,50,0.603725314140319824,71,True,False,False

Long sneaking sections makes the combat parts more intesive and as you go deeper ratio seems to skew toward that aspect. 

Gunplay could be more polished. I realise that it was designed the way ist is with a purpose but I'd prefer sth more mainstream. 

I wont lie, for long time I was on the fence wheter reccomend or not. Eventually two factors mattereed. One - I want to come back to GTFO despite it repetetivness.

Considering the price and amount of content they could at least make working matchmaking system and fix game breaking gliches that exist for years now. Yet they prefer to put all thier efforts into discord server and that's the only way to play the game.
You don't want to use discord, well that's to bad. You got banned by trigger happy mod for not being not super friendly and stuff, too bad. You want to appeal, go diddle ursellf cuz it's not a forum with appeal system.
And I can't post this on thier discord or they would probably ban me for not being positive about the game and I still want to play it online.

Amout of  content for the game is good considering the slow pacing, the gameplay is solid even tho every so often you will be locked out of finishing a mission bc of bug that persists for long ass time.
But considering broken matchmaking and price being just too high, I can only recommend this game at -50% (up till now it goes for -30% at most).

The original idea that a Rundown (which in short is a collection of the 'missions') would rotate after a few months and the previous Rundown would be deleted. This system was meant to be iconic, but unfortunately for me it meant that I did not have the time to complete them with my friends. Life meant we could not pick it up everyday. I was disappointed that I could not finish the first, then when we tried to complete the second it switched to the third. Finally I put this game down and we took a break. Finally, after all this time, they decided to release all of the Rundowns, which has made this game fun again. We can redo the first missions we missed, and can experience the story without having to research it post-Rundown.

In terms of the gameplay, it is fairly stock standard for a FPS which does not mean that it is derivative. It is quite challenging even for half decent players, but still very much enjoyable. So I recommend this now because any newcomers can actually experience the game and the story without being 7 Rundowns in. To any who complain that the team has changed their original tenants, I cannot agree that the devs have 'ruined' their game. I think that it has gone on for a long time getting rid of old Rundowns, and now as they prepare for new boundaries in the game they want to open this up for everyone and not just the elitists of old. And I could not be happier for this decision. So please buy this when you can if you enjoy stealth tactical shooters with Co-op. I would have recommended it during Early Access back when it was just the first Rundown, but now I do so to encourage this game and community to continue growing.",1677380101,1677380101,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Matchmaking exists ONLY through the use of Discord.

2. Bad actors can join your lobby and make your match 100% unplayable, there is no ban function to remove them.

3. Discord is trash, allowing blocked users to see your messages, join your voice channels, and overall zero restriction from people harassing you.

4. Mods will do nothing even with extensive proof of harassment. Have fun getting screwed over by a few low-life losers.


Detailed:
Amazing game if you can find a group. Unfortunately I cannot any longer recommend this game. The reason is simple: the matchmaking.

Matchmaking is non-existent inside of the game itself, instead forcing you to use their discord server. Which would be fine if it was modded properly. However, if you have a bad encounter with a player or players, the mods will do absolutely nothing and continue to allow harassment while you're posting ""looking for game"" posts. Annnnd since Discord is garbage, players you block can still see your messages, join lobbies, harass you, and even reply to your ""looking for"" posts. Again, mods will do nothing.

It's rare in the community to find anyone that is actually willing to play with new players, let alone teach them anything about the game. Which means new players are spending a bag on a game that is essentially impossible to be played alone. I have quite literally joined the ""beginners"" discord chat just to help new players learn and have fun, only to listen to them get cursed at for being new. 

Aside from that, finding players takes long enough as is, especially if you play at night, it's just not a very vibrant community in terms of numbers anymore. You'll run into some of these people over and over and over, and there's nothing you can do about it.

A couple examples: 

There's a player with like 3000 hours on the game, but this player in particular will quite literally join and afk over and over. I don't know what they're doing, but they will just afk for 30 seconds every couple minutes. I've politely asked the player to not join my games, I've asked mods to do ANYTHING about it, but they do nothing, this player will join your ""looking for"" games and do the same thing every time. The only possible way around it is to not even post a lobby code, in which case you'll get attacked by the community for not posting a lobby code.

Then there's my personal favorite: joining a pre-made that posts, publicly,  in ""looking for"", but already have a full team by the time you join, unknowingly.

It is an extremely fun game to play. so why don't I recommend it? simple, it barely functions on good days, the level design can be a bit uninspired, and there are a ton of game breaking exploits that trivialise the entire game.  

some levels, such as rundown 7's D1 overload objective dont even function and will have downright mindbogglingly bizarre effects on enemy spawning unless everybody leaves the lobby and joins back before. The semi recently added checkpoint system brought with it a literal mountain of run ending bugs. every time a checkpoint is loaded the level will often continuously become more and more unstable, doors will be completely invisible, enemies from error alarms will just stop spawning, and worst of all, if anybody was even thinking about holding one of the large carry able items during the checkpoint scan, there is a chance that they will find themselves completely unable to drop said item, completely preventing them from playing the game, killing the player or having them leave and rejoin does not work. sometimes certain alarm sounds will just be permanently playing in the background before they are even activated, timers sometimes wont appear, fog wont be in the right place for some players, which will either trivialize a level, completely blind the players, or make them unavoidably get infected. This next one isnt a checkpoint bug, but during an r7 E1 attempt, the game randomly decided to teleport everybody back to the beginning of the level right as we were about to win without any explination.

one of the newly released enemies from rundown 7 (which I will not be describing too much for spoiler reasons) also has a plethora of issues, such as bugging out and leaving a certain screen effect on a player's screen, completely blinding them. or just straight up teleporting players to the shadow realm where they once again, must leave the match and cannot rejoin or be recovered.

the game also has various issues regarding it's environment collision. What is absolutely baffling is that the problems include downright nonsensical hitboxes that allow for players to easily cheese the absolute shit out of certain level challenges, as well as overbearing hitboxes that are seemingly meant to prevent cheesing in the most bizzare spots that tend to impede on general movement. oftentimes players can get stuck on invisible barriers trying to walk up stairs, or just not be able to walk into a completely empty corner. yet somehow, for some reason, there will be collision programmed onto some random pipe that is 20 meters into the air, allowing for players to jump onto said pipe, and trivialise entire sections of levels. other items that allow for this kind of cheesing include: scaffolding, rooftops of small indoor structures, construction equipment, solar panels, actual fucking cliff faces, giant black crystals, railings, shelves, rocks, pipes, suspended wires, sever boxes, tubes, random concrete blocks, random canisters (which not only can you stand on, but you can also fall in between the tubes on this single setpiece, which softlocks you as the game just puts you back there when you try to rejoin the match), and many many more things. this naturally leads me to my next criticism, how easy it is to exploit the enemies

despite the fact that this is supposed to be a 4 player multiplayer co-op game, practically every single one of the levels ever released has been beaten by a solo player. No this isn't because the developers are bad at balancing things, there is reasonably no way that a solo player can actually hold off the waves of enemies on their own. this game's enemies are fantastic at being intimidating at first glance, even the basic enemy feels reasonably tanky without using certain guns (which tend to be quite ammo inefficient), they arent unreasonably unkillable, however they are just durable enough to make your weapons feel just a little bit weak against them, which makes a scenario where you wake up an entire room of them, or have a hoard barging through a door during an alarm quite terrifying, in a way that most base enemies in most games never tend to be capable of doing. there isnt really any cannon fodder in this game, which is absolutely fantastic. starting out, for a single person, 7 or 8 basic enemies can feel genuinely overwhelming, meaning you have to really think about positioning, and strategy when you have to deal with a hoard of like 30.  
is what I would say if it weren't so easy to cheese these things. outside of a few exceptions, most enemies are slower than the player's running speed, meaning you can outrun them quite easily, combining this with closing doors behind you, it is quite easy to make some serious distance between you and the enemies, allowing you to run them on a wild goose chase around the level so you can run back to the scans for whatever alarm you are doing to slowly complete it bit by bit, and this is even after the stamina system was introduced thanks to the various cheese spots that were previously mentioned. with this tactic in mind, the enemies become a bit of a joke in most circumstances that the game throws at you, and even if you arent soloing a level, if your whole team goes down except for you,  you can simply run around the level for a while to buy yourself time to revive your teammates, which not only removes tension and punishment for playing sloppily, but it is also just really really boring. This is also not even counting the door glitch, which still has not been completely removed, despite the devs claiming that they removed it. Which if you dont know, basically lobotomies the enemies and permanently traps them behind air. 

I also cannot go without mentioning the infamous ""sniper melee"" bug, caused by desync between server hosts and clients, which leads to very unfair seeming instances of damage being taken from what feels like way too far away. which despite according to the modding community (and the plugin that has been made to fix sniper melee) is an extremely easy fix, yet the developers still have not fixed it. 

I love this game, I really do. however I cannot recommend it to new players because of how miserable it can be like 80% of the time. there are those moments when this game really shines and everythig comes together, and sadly nothing else comes close to it, but as somebody who is working on making their own modded rundown, this game is held together by paperclips",1675714078,1675714078,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

Players I played with in the matchmaking are new like me and it's fun seeing all of us struggle to find out how to get to the objective, looking for resources or knowing where the hell are we so basically, how to play the game. Though, it takes a while to find other players but that's fine. Kinda wish my friends would play this with me. My favorite part of the game play here is the resource management and plotting your escape path. When you accidentally wake up the sleepers, got caught by victim seeking noodles, or triggering the alarms, resources depleted it is. Found 1 ammo pack after wiping the hordes and we had to decide who gets it then when we opened the next door, we found 3 big daddies near the objective that triggers the damn alarm. You bet we got wiped out.

Do I recommend this game? Yes! Can I play this solo? Damn right you can but it's recommended to have other friends or random to play with. I think the bot is helpful enough during the expeditions.

game doesn't pull it's punches, it's goddamn hard. communication, resource management and making use of mechanics like barricading+mining doors and sentry placement matters a lot. this is one of the few games where i feel like strategizing situations with your team is necessary, and it's very unique for it. i'd say voice comms are basically mandatory.

hardest mission i've done so far was R7C1 which took us a whopping 3 HOURS, but was really satisfying once we did beat it. reminds me a lot of old school killing floor on higher difficulties, and L4D realism mode.

downsides i would say:
you really need to play it with a full party, especially at the more difficult levels. there's bots but they aren't very smart. playing with 3 friends is the way to go.

Matchmaking.... and it's unfortunate because when I do get to play(after waiting 1 hour in matchmaking and multiple reloads) Its a great time full of raging at teammates for starting countdown when no one is ready, but also busting skulls and amazing final stands at every corner. 

I stopped playing this game a few months ago for the same reason, and came back to find matchmaking even worse with the new update. Could it be cause I live in Europe? probably. Either way I have no problem with matchmaking in other games that are smaller than this one.

I played it during early access and can attest to the dedication of the development team. The addition of matchmaking, AI bots, buffs, and cosmetics were all welcome touches, and have helped to polish the overall experience. More recently, the ability to return to previous rundowns with the addition of buffs and varied weaponry is pretty cool for us OGs who have been playing awhile. Hopefully the devs continue to support this title for a few more years of life. 

As it stands, GTFO is one of the best co-op horror shooter experiences out there, and it's one of my favorite multiplayer games of all time. Buy it and start dropping hammers or get the #### out. :)

A game so realistic, so tense, so brutal, that it would mark the true peak of skill. A medal for Gamers to wear on their chests, like beating the original dark souls in 2011. Undeniable proof of superiority. An eternal pedestal to stand upon.

GTFO makes a strong attempt at becoming that game, though it brings with it the realities of what such a game would be like both stylistically and development wise. There is no celebration in GTFO, only survival. There are no grand coats of gold to flex over others, only drab unfitting clothes pulled out of a dumpster. There are no heroes in GTFO, only those who remain alive.

It’s with these factors in mind that I’ve fallen in love with GTFO. A game so unapologetically itself that it's hard to criticise what would conventionally be annoying. For example, gaining information on terminals as to where keycards, resources and objectives are is essential for survival. Yet the game never explicitly tells you how they work, only giving you commands to enter and a stance that the player will either learn or not succeed. And it works.

The aesthetics in this game have legitimately gotten my arm hairs to raise on multiple occasions. Veterans of multiple rundowns still get panicky when faced with an unexpected scout. It all creates an environment where you must face humanity’s oldest fear, the unknown. The unknown of where the enemies lurk in the shadows. The unknown W.A.R.D.E.N watching your every move, unfazed by your death as merely another failed team, with another shortly following. The unknown of when you are battered and beaten, and praying the next locker has ammo, for the security door awaits and the W.A.R.D.E.N expects results or termination.

In place of the usual soundtrack review, I instead wish to highlight the sound design of this game. Alarms are loud, uncomfortable and ear piercing as they ring out for all to hear just how fucked you are. The sleepers are a particular highlight from the grotesque full body throbbing signifying your potential doom, to their little chirps and creaking as they slumber in semi agony. Furthermore, the combat noises of the sleepers were made by the development team screaming and howling into microphones, only to be digitally warped, corrupted and bludgeoned as much as the sound team saw fit. Resulting in horrifying but still faintly human cries as you see the horde crest round the corner. Guns crack like thunder against the deep quiet of the facilities, helping to further elevate the sense of power and importance of turning a room clear from a stealth mission to a last stand.

Gameplay wise, the golden rule is given by the game: ‘Work together or die together’. You can technically beat every mission by yourself without even the support of bots to assist you, however this is the same vein of technicality as me being able to technically swim from England to France and back in under 3 hours. Physically possible, 99.5% chance of failure, 80% chance of horrific failure. The game is thus a mandatory multiplayer experience and even with close friends is an exercise in communication and teamwork. GTFO is filled with situations where a half hour of progress can be lost due to one fuck up and you best not be the one who does said fucking up. 

In conclusion, GTFO is less a game and more an experience in my eyes. An experience in a beautifully traumatising cosmic horror world, an experience in teamwork, an experience of endurance, an experience of fear, an experience of what makes games challenging.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The game isn't actually based on gunplay, believe it or not. It is a stealth game that plays way too slowly, is extremely boring, and insanely punishing for messing up. The parts where you have to use guns are just way too hard. They don't give you enough resources to handle them and enemies are difficult to kill efficiently. For example, enemies' projectiles have homing properties! It's literally a ball of acid! But no, I didn't need that 10% health that I almost never get to heal. Literally, everything in this game just beats your ass into the ground: resources are given in varied portions (typically very small) that have to be split between 4 team members (The game is way less fun without friends and public lobbies are a joke), you start with reduced ammo portions, and checkpoints almost never happen. Stealth is the main feature of this game and it's nauseating! You have to very slowly creep up on enemies that detect you quickly with almost no room for error. Now factor in 3 other teammates that have to do the same, and you're bound to screw up at some point. ""But that's alright! I'll just give it another shot!"" No, you won't. Missions take upwards of an hour to complete, so have fun. Of course, there's the argument to just get better, but who cares? If you're a masochist that likes to get their cheeks clobbered multiple times just to complete one level, this is the game for you. But for the normal majority of people that just enjoy playing a video game in the afternoon, this game is a work of chicanery that will provide less fun than purchasing The Last of Us 2 for full price, while also putting a considerable dent in your wallet (Even if you paid 5 cents for this game, that's a robbery).

Playing with randoms can be difficult, since it takes so long to join a match, usually 1 person that always leaves mid way through, and the poor communication. I know there is a Discord server where you can play with many people and use voice to help with communication, But people just sometimes want to play the game without having to worry about Discord with randoms. I think that a good feature that could possibly be added is the ability to join specific games from a list. I think it would speed up matchmaking.

Overall, This game is really fun, really hard, and is best played with friends. Poor communication can mean the death of your whole squad, resulting in a failed mission/having to restart from a recent checkpoint. Matchmaking can be decent, It takes a while to get a full squad sometimes, but that usually doesn't take long.

GTFO is not a fun game. It's not fun at all. 

It's made by a small Swedish indie team called 10 chambers, and as such, there's a palpable, constantly underlined sense of limited resources. The demo we play is chock-full of fixed assets, with none of them visible in the 3D environment. Instead, the characters, the ammo crates, the panels of shattered glass all feel like they've come from a janky Game Maker amateur project - and not in a good way. 
What we see is a flabby, nondescript survival game. When the game's in action, everything is difficult, sluggish and utterly exhausting. A camera is stuck low to the ground - in first person mode - which means it's harder to see what's in front of you, and, without a modicum of slow-motion or something, there's simply no way to hit anything in the distance.

For someone with tunnel vision, this is a recipe for disaster. In a first-person shooter, I need to be able to focus and lock on to targets, and there's no way I can if I constantly have to adjust my peripheral vision to see the bad guys - which they will invariably be.

Not being able to spot enemies, and therefore not being able to hit them, is the whole point. It's practically a shounen manga trope. In GTFO's case, it's just clumsy, and tedious.

That's pretty much the extent of what's wrong with GTFO.

Sure, you can stealthkill most enemies and play slow and stategic, but there are scripted hordes that you cannot avoid and easily get overrun by small crawlers, while some others spew homing projectiles or call their mates throughout the whole map...

Also, every time you start a level, enemy placement and available loot is randomly placed and mixed (except for the scripted attacks, of course) and it comes down to luck how much ammo and what equipment you get in the run.
So you might only find some door lock melters in almost every box and run out of health, ammo and equipment before you get to the horde and get rekt...

A really intense and fun game but it is ruined by frustrating, unfair and unavoidable scripted attacks :(",1636150756,1673893298,True,0,0,0.47255370020866394,0,True,False,True

At this point I cannot recommend this game (unless on heavy sale).  The game was early access/beta for a couple of years and it had some issues which were being ironed out.  That is completely fine and don't mind that at all.  
Recently, 10 Chambers went on a ""small"" hiatus, which essentially brought all development and tech support to a halt.  Since this hiatus, the game has deteriorated in quality.  There are multiple networking issues when playing with friends.  Desyncs, crashes, and literally not being able to see other players are the more prevalent ones.  You can report these via their official Discord, however their community-dev outreach will ask about VPNs, then blame it on some sort of VPN (even when not in use).  Other reviewers have stated that 10 Chambers is about to start working on other projects, which completely makes sense for how they're responding and acting in the Discord.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a game that will slowly get worse.  

It had such potential and is still very very fun and difficult...when it works.  
The problems we've had are consistent in every drop and are pushing us, and some other players away.  

I WOULD recommend this if you can get past and be patient with the bugs and networking issues.

Step 1: Do some preliminary looting in the first area

Step 2: Start a 5 stage alarm that slowly goes up through platform hell as toxic fog rises, while fighting enemies

Step 3: Once the fog lowers go into a big hub room, there's enemies in there so maintain stealth (also loot the room, you won't get much more so you're gonna need to make it last through three different huge areas lol)

Step 4: Go into the first of the three areas, go through it stealth and get to the end (doing another 5 stage alarm, this ones a cluster though so get your running shoes on)

Step 5: Get the two RTX 4090s (power cells) and start running back to the first area quickly because fog will start rising until you put them in the generators of the main hub room (there's a door locked by a generator in this first room that you use to get the overload key, DO NOT USE THEM YET or you'll have to go through the next two areas in toxic fog the entire time, including the alarms)

Step 6: Do the second area which is similar to the first except there's more enemies and scouts to stealth kill (also you have to fight enemies on your way back through the fog once you get the two 4090s)

Step 7: Do the third area, find the overload door, and get the two 4090s after you do the alarm, there's no enemies this time so go back to the first area through the fog (you'll have 100% infection and 1% health so don't fall lol) and use them on that generator I previously mentioned

Step 8: Stealth through that side area (there's a lot of scouts be careful) and get the key to the overload door. You'll also get another 4090. Keep it because you'll need it for the actual overload section

Step 9: Go back to the third area, use the bulkhead key to unlock the overload door (make sure that the 4090 you grabbed is close) and stealth your way through a ton of chargers (hopefully you brought a spear), giant chargers, and charger scouts (hopefully you brought a friend because there's like 5 and you need 2 simultaneous weak-point hits to kill).

Step 9.5: You'll likely choke on the charger scouts but that's fine just make sure your turrets are set up preemptively so you can last through the waves (btw the toxic fog is still on the map so you'll have 1% health but it's fine just don't get hit)

Step 10: Bring the 4090 to the generator in the first overload room and slot it in. There'll now be a 6 stage mixed alarm with multiple full team scans and flying enemies that shoot projectiles (the fog still hasn't gone away yet so you'll still be at 1% health, it's fine though just don't get hit)

We died at this part, keep in mind we had not completed the FIRST objective of the primary progression and had not even started the secondary objective.

Games like those of the early Resident Evil franchise always stuck out to me. The idea of scavenging every bit of ammo or meds, and balancing not wanting to miss shots with not wanting to be eaten really defines that genre of games. 
These concepts are a core part of GTFO, but cranked up to 11. 

Try conserving ammo, not on 1 or 2 zombies slowly lumbering forward in the narrow hallways of RPD, but instead while gunning down a horde of monsters in a full sprint at you. This game is a test of both marksmanship and nerve, where every game of red light green light stealth could mean wasting more of your invaluable supplies. Communication, stealth, game-sense and marksmanship blend together in this one-of-a-kind co-op experience. Find out just how much your friends suck at video games, and when you get tired of losing get carried by randoms on the official discord and see just how good the steam community can be at them. 

GTFO is an experience I would only recommend to those who are willing to engage in a social game, and willing to commit time and frustration to learning it. If you choose to dive in your reward is getting to explore the dark and ominous yet gorgeously crafted complex, and experiencing the mysterious yet intriguing story of the world.",1673178458,1673178555,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The second one learning that alarm and/or scout waves can spawn in zones you have not cleared yet which I find a little unfair depending on if scouts are in the rooms, namely R2D2, but this isn't a game breaker.

You clear levels, complete security scans with waves of enemies and fight off different things and scenarios every time (some being more difficult than others). The placement of every mob and placement of resources is AI generated. The issue normally run into is being on the same page and also resource management.

the single player is a different experience in my book. the bots are alright however they do not equal another human player. the big benifit of single player is you have absolute control over the mission and the bots as they will not activate or trigger aggro , allowing the solo player to have full strategic control.

They won't compromise on this being an obligate 4-player experience, so they helped set up a community on discord to find squads. But if you think you can accomplish any difficulty beyond the easiest without a 3 or 4 man squad then you're going to waste allot of time dying over and over.
This game is HARD. Friendly fire isn't just on it's amplified. Ammunition isn't just scarce there's actively not enough by design. The Enemy aren't just hard to kill they're hard to see, aim at, and even hit, and that's when they're inactive sometimes.



The Premise of this game is simple, enter a maze-like building, accomplish your Objective(s), leave. Preferably alive. But it's so hard this takes up to an hour or more (especially on longer harder levels). And they refresh and computer generate the levels every new season or so to keep it fresh. You've got a variety of gun types and tools that are all incredibly powerful, but there's so many enemies and they're hard enough to kill that it doesn't help. This is true horror to me. Not some pansy ass ""Run from the enemy and hide because you don't know how to throw a punch"" like most modern ""Horror"" hide and seek games are. In this the tension and fear come not from being a helpless rabbit, but from being strong while your enemy is far stronger. It's exhilerating. 2nd favourite horror game after Alien Isolation.

now.. they all act as if i dont know. act as if the pointless trailers show fun gameplay. And it looks cool. buy it
So if i hit a minor issue the gameplay sucks.
SO
This entire negative review is just 1  big thing to say ""I still dont know what the fun is. cause if it was fun i'd fucking tolerate 24fps""

I got scammed again? I need to test.

FCKING GAME IS THROWING ERRORS AGAIN

OK SO
FUUCKKK
the game is ok... as in... Mediocre .

it does not need the graphics it carries for its gameplay. It does need the animation tho. Can't have a game like this look as goofy as L4D2 or Payday 2. I appreciate the graphics but not when it gets in the way of performance

basically its . big fights every zone. and then 1 big rush getting out. 

Problem is.. Mouse lag... Or something.. Its responsive as fuck... but.. i can't aim where i want. it feels like I am missing the enemy many times
people on youtube as well.. horizontally there is an issue. People can't track targets. won't be a problem in no lag fps games. Like cs.. or some other games i keep forgetting.

now people think that means i am shit at FPS.. And while im not CSGO pro. Why does it matter. In any other fps game when there is no mouse lag.. I miss... I learn.. I correct. and when i miss i know i wasn't going slow.. I know i was goign way too fast. 

here it felt like i needed to differentiate between mouse and crosshairs. sort of like arma. but arma gives you time to take aim. 
i feel the need to complain because none knows what the fuck went wrong.

look the entire fun is.. I DONT KNOW ok. Im not the dev. but. it feels like its mild fear.... which in the moment feels like it might kill you.. intense
and gunplay against terrors unknown.

And right now im questioning myself. even tho in memory im sure what happened cause i tested. The mouse very weirdly was slow or fisheyed. 
which is a sign of the graphics and animation was good so it gaslight me. ""surely if it looks this good im at fault""

the guns are not ok
And the stealth becomes waiting boredom way too fast..

edit over

I bought this game cause it looked awesome. but i was also scared. I bought this game out of compulsion i did not understand what i bought.. and that was my reason to buy this.

then i read that Ulf anderson from the Bo and Ulf andreson brothers , founders of overkill. Ulf being the creative director of Payday... quit payday 2. then after 2 yrs of consultant to payday made his company and this game

apparently simon vilkund works on this too. and he's known for being into Payday 2 so i guess he's into this too

Anyway. That gave me a bit of trust and i went in

the objective.. how you win is ""go in , complete objective , gtfo""
the game is basically 3 parts
Hide and seek using red light green light. walk until the blind enemies pulse. then stop until they stop. over and over until you get close to them and then clobber them. if you don't they will all rush you.
Save ammo. 
keep doing this until you get to a part where you WILL trip the alarm and then its a horde mode firefight until you all complete a ""Hold the objective"" ..objective.....doesn't feel like i can snap shot them easily. feels like either the mouse is too slow or the enemies are too fast. but if i can click on the icon on desktop with ease.. then how come its a speed issue
basically repeat these 2 loop to get to the objective. Then the ""extraction point""
And the 3rd thing is there to compliment this. The terminal. Its basically very simple dos. List to see items. query to find what zone they are in. and ping to .. find the ""sub-zone"" in which the item is.. basically zones are numbers.. Say zone 49. and zones may or may not have sub-zones A-Z. Ping helps you with that
so this part of the game is....well if it wasn't there you'd be playing a chore. having to basically smash all boxes until you get the item you needed which would be fustrating. and if they straight told you it would be boring.for it to be a game there must be a loss and a win.. yet all you need to do to win is query objective and then ping objective. the only way i can describe it is.. Use dos or get lost in an infinite maze. you won't survive if you dont use it. cause not enough ammo.

and its basically mission based like payday. but has trees of it or something. idk but each level is basically its own ""hiest"" in a sense. So dont worry about it too much just keep doing individual levels for fun

So that's the game. hide and seek. Go loud on alarms. find objective extract. use terminals to find the damn thing using very simple ""how does dos work"" gameplay. 

Why the no
Recommended 1060. 
my 1060 6gb is used 100% on high AND low. And well .. it stutters. now i didn't think it would be an issue since during combat who even remembers that. well the alarm happened. and i didn't know if the enemy swipped me , my aim was shit , the sometimes jittered and i missed my chance to shoot.
AND
and
I bought it so i could MAINLY play it solo and sometimes with friends
I didn't look like an online only coop. games like that have a warning. HELL PoE could very easily be offline yet the first thing you notice is online only.
but this game is ONLINE ONLY
the game quite literally won't start without an internet. What happens when the net is down and i want to play
what is this PUBG
I CAN PLAY PUBG WITH BOTS CAUSE I HAVE FUCKING ARMA

something like arma 3 doesn't have the nerve to go fully online. 
but these new kids and the fucking retarded Dons in game publishing think they have the balls to go fully online like google services or something.


Anyway. that's why the no
It can't handle performance after being.. well.. Not a lot of things going on. It looks very realistic.. but so does Death Stranding. And not a drop. So does dark souls. not a drop. 
and offline issue

that should just be a minor issue realistically  cause it doesn't stop me from playing the game. The game is there.  and it is fun... I think......altleast it isn't ""Guess what the game is"" or ""perform a perfect no hit run or its not fun and we will kill you later on"" 

but i have to put up with 1 more inconvenience .. I might as well just give up. 
If im using this much effort and ignoring many MANY other things about life and game
I might as well just shut up. give up and just work on office stuff all day. if im not working. im working to get better at working

OH
and toxic userbase on steam.
They will gaslight the FUCK out of you ""my 2080 i7 cpu isn't giving me good frames"" .. what answer would you expect... Why how .. that sounds bad
nope ""I have a 2080 i have no issues""  ""That seems like YOU have an issue"" ""none else has issues like these so we will priorities a bug""
and if you have a 1050.. not a 1060.. god help you
""Lol 30 fps. its more than you deserve with 1050. lol lol old useless hardware""

and they give out jester awards as a ... ""you are a joke"" thing i guess
Eh. the mark of a cult always proves my point
Useless people who .... what kind of human even ""patrols"" the negative review section.

anyway. no until it gets to a level i can be ok with. 
online always is ok. 
the performance
its not THAT bad.. its more than playable with mostly 60. but the stutters so are damn frequent on all quality levels ... that seem to happen randomly.. that im scared a firefight..
the reason i bought the game. the guns look cool
will die for me.. Just ""guns and Lag"" 

anyway its early access right. Still has a few years to go before ready

What you should bring:
- You are comfortable joining discords to find teammates or have friends who want to play with you.
- You are capable of being a patient team player for up to two hours without breaks.
- You are capable of dealing with difficulty and overcoming skill and rng-issues, sometimes retrying levels many times.
- You can deal with others fucking up once in a while and you are not a prick.
- The occasional bug that ruins your run does not mentally destroy you.
- You are capable of preserving ammo.
- You are able to control yourself and not panic the instant you see something move.
- For the love of god bring a mic, your voice is not as bad as you think. Nobody cares if you are 12 bro.

What the game has to offer:
- Many pretty long and challening levels for you to play and reattempt - a lot.
- Well balanced weapons and tools (loadouts).
- No ingame microtransactions of any kind.
- Nothing like vibrant pink weapon skins (the atmosphere and vibe are very well preserved in this game).
- This game makes you and your friends a better team.
- Stealth, stealth, stealth and stealth.
- Big battles where you not only have to stay alive, but preserve as much ammo as you can too.

SHOULD YOU BUY THIS?
I am a university student so my budget is rather small. If you are like me don't buy this game at full price.
Buy it at 25€ or below and MAX 30€.
Make sure some of your friends are willing to buy it too or be willing to meet lots of new people.

You can then use two bots with limited issue. IF you do not have immense patience, do NOT play this game. IF you do not like to stealth about 85% of the time, do NOT play this game. This is NOT a guns blazing situation! You will not progress without patience! IF you do not have at least one reasonably smart friend to play with, do NOT play this game! My husband and I play this game together. We are very good at gaming and this game is challenging for us (this is not a brag..just truth)We have about 55 years of gaming experience between us. We have 20 hours in game so far and we are on the third level on the first mission. Make sure your friendship is decently solid. You will yell at each other. You will blame each other for things that the other may or may not have done. The frustration is real! What worked on one level will most likely not work on the next. You will have to put thought into equipment and strategy for each level. You will most likely fail each level multiple times before you succeed. When you do make it through a level you will feel amazing! I personally love that you have to change things up and plan ahead and have new strats for each level. The only bug we have encountered is: Mouse will freeze up at random times. Example: You will be about to hit a creature with say, your hammer and instead of charging it hits as soon as you click and hold. Which causes a shit storm. Other than that, every problem is one we accidentally cause lol. I think this game is worth the price. The devs are very involved. The sounds are things of nightmares, as are the creatures!

Imagine playing Chess against a computer that was permanently set at Grand-Master level and you were just learning the game.  No fun at all.

Unlike other games on the market this game cannot be tailored to allow players to adjust the difficulty of the AI, gameplay etc.

I am sure the developers see this as a unique selling point and wanted to giver players a challenge but the formula that is tried and tested with other games is to allow difficulty to be chosen and adjusted by the player who after all  pay for the game and so surely its up to them how they want to play it (Rookie, Regular, Veteran etc.) therefore, making the game suitable for all abilities.

2 friends and I have played this in Co-Op many times and find it very frustrating. We take our time and are careful and try and be stealthy and manage inventory etc. and yet will die before reaching the end of the map. We try again and fail again and again. Everything is trial and error, how to stop certain alarms, finding items, retrying the same missions over and over only to fail.

The game survives on these updates, with huge spikes in player count and then a subsequent loss of those players about a month after each update, making it super hard to find people to play with. Unless they can implement some kind of new refreshing gameplay loop to keep players coming back like procedurally generated missions for instance or a simple free battle pass, the game will inevitably die. If you can get this on sale with 3 other friends then go for it, just don't go in expecting a thriving player base and more content on the way.

I'm pretty bitter about this game because it had so much potential only for all of it to be squandered by the devs. I've been playing this game since alpha and I used to really enjoy it. The atmosphere is super cool and gameplay is difficult yet satisfying, but playing it now a days feels like a chore. Especially when you're only playing to get the limited time cosmetics that they added to temporarily boost the player base. There hasn't been that many major changes to the game since 1.0 has released. There are still things missing from the original trailers that I want to see implemented. The only notable additions are customization and checkpoints. I can't recommend this until they come out with a big update that adds sustainable content. Sustainable meaning more replay-ability so that the player count doesn't immediately drop off after each update. When the game stops coming out with new rundowns, doing the same missions over and over again will get boring quick. Aliens Fireteam Elite suffered from this exact problem; it had great gameplay but only 12 missions to chose from which lead to its death. If every mission plays the same and theres no room for player freedom/exploration then the game will get stale and people will leave. I really think this game needs a gamemode with randomly generated missions alongside the rundowns. This would be feasible since this game mostly takes place in rooms, plus theres already a small amount of procedural generation with the objects placed in the world. They've recently started re-releasing slightly improved versions of old rundowns as new content for players that didn't get to experience them when they first released, but for players that have been playing for a while its pretty underwhelming and feels like something that should have been there from the start.",1576013666,1672281364,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're always on edge and when things go wrong they go wrong in a hurry! The game pushes your team to be stealthy and strategic, especially when engaging enemies. Perfectly timed melee strikes are your teams' best friend. However, there are plenty of opportunities for those who are trigger-happy. New missions, weapons, and utilities let you try out several strategies based on your teams' strengths. The game is punishing, but boy is it a fun/scary time! And when your team succeeds, you feel like you are on top of the world! 

Be mindful that rundowns can take quite some time to complete (several hours in some cases)! So have several hours freed up before you begin your journey into the Complex!

Anything beyond the ""B"" section of the rundowns are nearly impossible to solo. The bots are slightly better since launch but still have a ways to go. They still routinely run though doors that you're closing or stand right in front of sentries. They also auto use items if you move too far from them (can be a death knell for a solo run) and don't seem to respond to the preset text communications (aside from dropping sentries, mines, or foam). Make no mistake, this is indeed a hardcore game and its built around having 4 players with good communication skills. The movement's very realistic for someone carrying weapons and gear. I'd say this is about as far away from call of duty as a FPS can get in the best way possible. Visibility is often near 0% and monsters can kill you in seconds if your not careful. You can only keep one pickup item at a time (Fog repellent, Glow sticks, mines, foam, High viz light) plus only one Health, Ammo or Tool refill, at a time.  Managing what to divvy out is key to survival. There are levels with toxic fog that will whittle your health to 20% and its not uncommon to sink 45 minutes into a game only to fail. I highly recommend looking up the commands for the terminals you'll find ahead of time, some shortcuts are lifesavers. I think this is why i keep coming back to the game; Its a good challenge and the difficulty never lets up. I do hope they focus a little bit more on the solo side of things as it gets very unbalanced the farther in you get. A good example of the unbalanced solo stuff is the Alt 2 B level, where you have to unlock a sec door that spawns lots of monsters for like 5 minutes (eats 90% of all team member ammo and about 100% of sentry ammo) and then they chuck like 20 huge monsters at you all at once while your trying to extract. it just seems like they haven't tested it at all with solo players. All my friends are deeply afraid of this game as it appears too hardcore for some (45 min+ time investments are hard to sell) and the matchmaking just does not appear to work for me. Even on the quick play option, not one person joined my lobby after a half an hour. If they fix the matchmaking and add more solo based gameplay options, i think this game would do twice as well as it has been.  I should also mention that it runs very, very well for such a good looking game. I've played this on a 3070, nearly maxed out at 1440p and I was getting nearly 100fps. After switching to a 3080ti, its been running 60fps at 4k nearly flawlessly with everything cranked to max. This type of slow methodical gameplay lends itself well to 4k @60 and the extra details really add to the immersion. Anyone whos a fan of realistic shooters should pick this up, especially if you actually have friends, just don't plan of using the in game matchmaking unless you use discord.",1672214865,1672214865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of recently, it was announced that GTFO has entered the end stages of development and will be releasing one more rundown some time in 2023. After this, the game will be ""completed"" and 10 Chambers will begin to focus on other efforts. This is shocking news to me, mainly because this game has several glaring issues regarding multiplayer connectivity and quality of life discrepancies that seem odd to run across in a ""nearly completed product"". This is disappointing and I cannot stress how annoying it is when obvious issues of quality exist in a product and people accept it as ""just another modern gaming experience"".

The positive aspects of this game largely revolve around visual appeal, sound design (gunfire is distinct among the various firearms players can equip, and many of the guns sound extremely powerful), and difficulty. This game is quite difficult upon starting out, but once the player completes a few missions (or has to retry the same mission over and over again), they will be able to grasp many of the game's nuances and begin to speed up their in-game actions, making smarter moves with each obstacle they encounter.  Even some of the more tedious actions within the game (like typing on terminals) become second nature once a player has dealt with them a few times. 

Unfortunately, the negatives far outweigh the benefits of buying this game now that we have a clearer picture of what GTFO's ""finished"" form will be. GTFO (much like 10 Chambers lead Ulf Andersson's previous game ""PAYDAY"") is filled with fixable yet ignored bugs and quality of life issues that range from ""annoying to deal with"" all the way to ""my friends and I just wasted 2 hours of our night because someone's game crashed mid-door scan"". It's painful to see how much potential this game has and how wasted it is due to what feels like a flat-out refusal to add features that are commonplace now in games. For example, GTFO's matchmaking system does not include a lobby list that players can choose available games from, rather it merely has the ability to select what mission a player wants to play, what languages the player speaks, and if they have a microphone. While this sounds like enough, a player using matchmaking will often sit for literal hours trying to find other players to cooperate with. Out of the 87 or so hours I have on this game, about half of those hours have been spent in the mission select lobby waiting in vain for another player to join. 

Additionally, 10 Chambers has removed many of the rundowns that were once freely playable. This is virtually cutting off access to over half the game and while these rundowns are slowly coming back with the final Rundown addition releasing soon, it should not be the case where new players (or veterans who just took a break for a period of time) simply cannot access features that were in the game a year ago. That is classic user manipulation to artificially inflate the active player base. This is likely to hide the fact that GTFO truthfully has an active player base of just under 1000 people, which is not good. For reference, Left 4 Dead 2 (a game that launched in 2009) registered over 27,000 active players for November 2022.

Finally, if one chooses to play the game with the 3 AI-controlled bots, it is very likely that players will never complete the more advanced levels as the AI is terrible in a fight and is basically a detriment to the team regarding certain objectives. Bots are generally regarded as ""useless except for using their tools"". They miss almost every shot they fire (seriously, watch any video of a player running a mission solo and it's likely the player will be merely using the bots for their tools and not their presence in a fight). So, in order to really experience the game and fully complete rundowns, a solo player will have to find other solo players to team up with if they do not have personal friends to schedule with.

Which comes to my biggest complaint regarding GTFO and a large reason why I am not recommending this game for purchase; the community (for the most part) willingly accepts this matchmaking SNAFU as ""just a small side effect of an early access game"" while they chide you to ""simply use the GTFO Discord server"" if you wish to play GTFO with strangers/as a solo player. While there isn't any major issue with this in a vacuum, the more prominent members of the player base are... quite picky when it comes to who they partner up with for a mission. Because this game's ""shortest mission"" is around 30 real life minutes, many players want guaranteed completion of the mission when entering the lobby and/or Discord call because most people do not have the patience to run through these missions more than once or twice. One of my biggest issues is the feeling of wasted time while playing this game, and this feeling is most prevalent when failing a mission at the final obstacle (which will probably happen a lot) because there is no checkpoint system (sans Rundown 7, which does have checkpoints on certain levels). It's all or nothing and many players from my experience simply are not good enough to jump into a match with 3 other random players and coordinate effectively enough to succeed. This is especially so now, since the game has had an influx of newer players since it went on sale.

The GTFO Discord creates a somewhat stark cultural divide in game availability for the average player, with older players who have had GTFO since Alpha projecting a sense of inflated ego onto newer players when they match up together (talking about the kids who offer to be ""coaches""). Those newer players looking to complete harder levels will likely go through what feels like a high-level job interview with the average older player, being peppered with probing questions to assess your skill level. While it is understandable to want the best teammates available, it is also apparent that many players are willing to spend an unreasonable amount of time nitpicking you on your playtime or your choice of weapons, more time than it takes to simply play through the mission and call out incoming issues to said new players.

A majority of the regular ""Discord"" experiences a player with live through will be one member of the party (usually a ""veteran of the game"") trying to control every movement the party makes in-game. Marine drill instructors give more leeway than the average GTFO veteran player will, every small error resulting in a cacophony of condescending comments and rude diatribe. Many players you encounter will have a ""my way or the highway"" attitude, resulting in lots of passive-aggressive commentary from your team. The only mistakes die-hard fans are willing to accept with grace are the game design failures from 10 Chambers.  Any legitimate criticism of this game's flaws in forum posts or discussions usually results in a loyal squad of fanboys rushing to defend the laziness of the developers regarding fixing these issues. Stockholm Syndrome be damned, I refuse to be a sheep and just accept mandatory usage of the Discord as a customer because the game should effectively matchmake for me if that system exists in the game. I should not have to make a strictly-formatted post on a third-party service and wait around for some weird Europeans to join my game and harass me at every turn just to screw up the mission for everyone at the end because [b] they [/b] got cocky and assumed [b] they [/b] couldn't make mistakes themselves. 

There is almost no progression system involved in this game. Players looking to ""earn"" something will only be able to grind out clothing options which are mostly randomized, meaning you can spend weeks playing through the game staring at the same helmet or chest piece. There is also no weapon customization, which feels like a huge miss considering this is an obvious factor of PAYDAY 2's success.

The key parts of the game are definitely stealth and resource management; as a player you need to foster patience as rushing around will just get you killed. Learn to use the terminals and the map. They'll help you find the resources you need and coordinate with other players.

For the visuals, the game runs surprisingly well. Very good ambiance, graphics, combat, etc. I love the design of the mutants, and the level layouts are really cool, the combats fun, and the whole stealth and tactical approach you need to take is fun(for the most part), especially with friends. I have some complaints though and if they fixed these things, id play this game like 10x or even 100x more than I do now. (Keep in mind I havent played the last one or two updates, but based on the update notes, I havent seen any changes to these things). 

For one. REMOVE OR CHANGE THE FOG. Oh my god. The fact that the items that spawn in the lockers/chests are mainly RNG and sometimes wont give you as many de-foggers as you need is INFURIATING. My friends and I would give up on levels the moment we saw they were just filled with fog. It was just a headache waiting to happen. People can argue oh you can use the bio-tracker or use the infared scope. Unless they have changed it in the past few updates (I havent played in a while to be fair), I just know the infared scope when it first came out didnt work in the fog (unless mine was bugged), and the bio-tracker is nice, but its tiring to spend an extra hour or two as a group moving from mutant a mutant in the fog. I tend to have decent patience but this is just really really tedious, especially when a whole level is covered in fog. Its not fun. I get the game is supposed to be tactical and difficult, but this is just a really cheap way to add difficulty to levels. 

My second complaint. ADD THE ABILITY TO SAVE. PLEASE. At least at checkpoints. The game isnt so hard I cant complete in with friends, its just we all dont have 2-3 hours to complete one expedition. A lot of us have work and play at the end of the day before bed, or want to play a different game halfway through expeditions. Just knowing in the back of your head you have to complete an expedition in one run or you'll not beat it adds a whole new level of tedious to the game. The amount of checkpoints they give you is so little as well, and they are sometimes put in places that are so hard to reach, like it can take you up to an hour or MORE to reach the first checkpoint in an expedition. I would be totally fine with this, if the host at least could save those checkpoints. I dont care if it was buggy, or you couldnt go back, etc. I get this game being difficult on purpose for the player, but this is a quality of life change that would benefit this game SO MUCH. I know personally my friends and I would play so much more often, but for now, we only play when were willing to sit down knowing the next 3-4 hours we will be stressing over the expedition and probably trying to get through some bullshit fog. And as of right now, we dont feel willing to do that very often, because it doesnt sound fun, and frankly sometimes its not. Its a game killer for me.

The game is so fun outside of these two things, and I see other reviews talking about bugs, but I have only encountered one major bug where a hoard never ended in solo play. I do believe these bugs exist, I havent experienced them personally. I also see a lot of negative reviews talking about the matchmaking. Ive never tried using the matchmaking, so I also cant really comment on it. 

Game looks great, runs great. It has a lot going for it, it just lacks some very simple quality of life features that are almost a requirement for games, especially this type of game. This game IS incredibly difficult to play, but not because it necessarily requires skill (it does), but because its also just so incredibly unfair. 

Ive heard that this game is going to leave development soon, and the devs are planning to call it done after adding all the rundowns. Unsure if this is true or not, but I really hope they at least add saves and other quality of life changes before they finish. In the state its in right now, its a great game, but 100% NOT a finished game.

Despite a strong first few hours, as you acquaint yourself with the game systems and enemies, the experience of actually sitting down to the game becomes a repetitive chore extremely quickly. The approach to absolutely every problem is nearly identical, the weapons are hit-and-miss (as far as feel goes), and what little context you're provided with is not only very poorly presented, with voice-acting straight from 'The Scenery Chewer's Guide to Overdoing It', but also has little-to-no reflection in the environment, which given its anonymous aesthetic and lack of integration with the telling of the story, feels procedurally generated, even though I'm given to understand that it was not.

If you can sustain yourself through the repetitive trudge of the primary loop with nothing but the barest mechanical escalation and piss-weak context that roundly fails to tie it all together, there is a solid foundation here. Once you've found a gun that feels right for you, the shooting usually feels good, and the atmosphere is, for the first few levels you play, consistently oppressive and really rather solid. But GTFO only has one mood -- oppressive. Were it a single player game, it might feel genuinely horrifying, and legitimately desperate.

But the multiplayer barrier to entry, and the episodic nature of the mission-based format, gives rise to my main issue -- you never feel genuinely trapped. Because of the episodic nature of the missions within the rundowns, we leave at the end of every mission and go back in at the start of the next one, and any sense of hopeless isolation is irretrievably lost. That episodic, mission-based framing doesn't work as well here as it does in an aesthetically grim game mission-based multiplayer shooter like Darktide, though, because Darktide is in fact a very silly game with a great deal of humour in its world, even if it is only sporadically successfully funny. GTFO has no such tonal contrast in its presentation, and the inherent sense of detachment the format is therefore catastrophic to the intended oppressive tone for me.

Ultimately, it's the sort of thing that would benefit from a sequel or remake -- add some even halfway-decent story context, and integrate it with the environment in a way that is meaningful, and you could have something genuinely special. But GTFO is ultimately extremely unspecial, with nothing really to recommend it other than ""it's very difficult and acceptably passes the time between cradle and grave"".",1672114894,1672114894,False,3,0,0.515624403953552246,0,True,False,False

The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into creating an immersive experience: the UI, sounds, story, graphics, and stealth mechanics mesh together perfectly.


Unfortunately, as expressed from other reviews, Ii you're planning to play with less than 4 people, the experience is weighed down by a number of issues mostly related to the ai.

I would mostly recommend buying this game if you have a group of at least 3 people. I was only able to play it with one other person. I also enjoy playing single-player.

Consider the following issues:

[*]The bots will steal any resources from lockers if you step too far away.

[*]The bots are completely inefficient with resources.

[*]I don't mind when the bots accidentally step in front of gunfire while hordes of enemies are attacking at a time, understandable. The main issue with the bot pathing is during the stealth segments. The bots would often walk in front of players while lining up both melee attacks and gun shots, which was incredibly frustrating and immersion-breaking. 

[*]Missions which require an [b]item[/b] be brought from one location to another do not mesh well with the ai. The players can tell a bot to hold the [b]item[/b], but said bot has deployable equipment (ie a turret) they will refuse to pick the equipment up when told. The bot will also automatically drop the [b]item[/b] when monsters are aggro'd. Normally this is not an issue, but if you need to bring the [b]objective[/b] to a location while being chased by enemies, only the player would be capable of carrying it (because the ai will refuse to pick it up)

[*]The levels are littered with alarm doors that only open when the players have stood on specific locations in the room. Instead of standing on the positions that would turn the alarm off, the bots follows the player like lemmings.

[*]If any character has been downed, the bots will all simultaneously prioritize reviving, despite the fact that having all 3 teammates reviving 1 person does not revive any faster. This is often run-ending.

[*]They will not stop saying the same 3 voice lines. Never give Dauda the bio-tracker.

[*]I find the most fun comes from coordinating melee attacks on sleeping enemies and splitting up to clear a room while playing multiplayer. Unfortunately, the bots will not do anything while undetected. I wish the countdown function worked with the bots.


[b]DESPITE ALL OF THIS,[/b] I still enjoy playing every now and then for a super quick 2 hour session. I can't deny how intriguing the story is, and how enjoyable the game is despite the issues. I greatly recommend this to anyone willing to drop $32.",1671915272,1671915272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if I had any gripes for the game is that you can sometimes sneak your way to your goal with very opposition if you work together, but once your done with your main task, I haven't had one clean sneak away undetected yet. for me it was always a frantic blitz of screaming enemies that fire magic homing light emitting projectiles that almost never miss their target which is you.and the monsters ranged attacks don't just chip away at their target again you, they knock off 40% hp most of the time. which wouldn't be a problem if you could just kill the enemy with a few bullets, but these little bastards have weak points in randomised different areas that look like a grotesque raspberry like infection. even blowing their heads off isn't always the end for them. 
if you like an intense team focused game then I would highly recommend this game to you. Just know that its best taken in small doses and probably not the best marathon game session.",1671912152,1671912152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay is enjoyable but multiplayer stealth is difficult. If anyone messes up, everyone is punished, and because there's 4 of you, there's 4x the chances for a mistake. The shooting is good enough, but more often than not enemies teleport, lag and jitter, standing up in a single frame due to stagger animations, attacking you before their model has finished climbing up a ladder..

The game has been out for a long time and yet I've encountered +- 20 serious bugs that completely ruined the experience. Enemies randomly waking up in stealth, invisible doors, visible doors that are not there for my teammates. These issues are apparent and constantly complained about by the community yet the developers do not seem to recognize or admit that they exist, offering no help on their Discord, although they make it seem like they do.


Edit: A harsh review but looking at it later I still agree with it. Many issues I encountered have been in the game for far too long. It's fun- But as usual, it needs work.

Every level you drop in with 3 other players (or bots, if you're alone) and are set with a certain task to complete. The task varies depending on the level you're playing through, going from ""Go collect something"" to ""Clear this area"" and etc. 

Generally speaking, your approach to all of these objectives can be very similar; go into a room, try to kill as many enemies as you can without alerting them, and move on as you try to find hints to the location of your objective. 

Playing alone isn't the most tedious experience, bots can actually be quite useful at times with relatively good accuracy and their complete immunity to triggering enemies as well as covering you up whenever you accidentally alert one. However, the control over them is still fairly limited as you're basically only allowed to tell them where you want them to use gadgets (this might change with a future update).

Playing with other players is a very fun experience, depending on how good everybody else is. I heavily recommend joining the discord server and using its dedicated ""LFG"" function to look for other players to play with as matchmaking can be hazardously random with the people you play with and never consistent. 

If you get this, try playing R2 and above, R1 is relatively barebones from what I've heard and it doesn't shine what makes this game so special.",1671593877,1671594600,True,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

This game is way easier than I expected, but people will keep telling you ""it gets much harder"" and all that nonsense, because they want to identify as ""hardcore"" gamers. This brings me to another point. Not only the devs, but especially the game's community is holding this game back with their absolute backwards mentality about missing features that a co-op game should have in this day in age. People will tell you that ""a game like this does not need a matchmaking system"" or ""everyone is used to the discord already anyways"", which is so self absorbed of a take that I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that people come up with these arguments. There are tons of other co-op games that are not only harder, but far better developed than this.

Games I recommend instead:

If you take the time to learn the bot behaviors almost anything can be done solo with bots (as of now R1, R2, and R7) with a few exceptions (R7D1, R7D2, and while I haven't attempted it I imagine R7E1 also). That being said playing with people is where the game really shines. If you don't have people to play with DO NOT try matchmaking as no one really uses it. Instead use the GTFO discord to find randoms to play with or convince your friends to get it. The discord is also a good place to ask questions if you/your team are struggling on levels. 

That being said there are a few bugs that can be annoying at times, especially with checkpoints which were added to later rundowns. Some of the more notable ones are: don't hold objective items during checkpoint scans or they might be fused to your hands, bots can't hold objective items during combat, and one where c-foam will stop hitting a door. My team seems to have mitigated the last one by having the lobby host have the c-foam gun but the other two are waiting on the devs.

493520,128685078,76561198274942042,0,2,1574,0,1233,1703287296,"I really liked the concept of a stealth/zombie/weapon/equipment manager-type game. But I think it was designed for the most part poorly. This game is VERY challenging it is very easy to die with bots so you better have friends.

Stealth 6/10
The game revolves around stealth because you don't have enough ammo to go loud on every engagement. I like this it creates tension and fear because you don't know how much you are risking while going close compared to going loud. But it really just means coordinating charged melee attacks with friends while crouched and moving when the sleepy baddies aren't glowing. That is to say after some experience the experience doesn't really change at least in strategy. Sometimes when you go loud and use firearms some units in a bigger room don't wake up. Which is strange to me, considering there is a unit that screams when you touch its tentacles it screams and pulls units that just spawn in from ""outside"" of other rooms to come and storm you, which can be VERY punishing. That is also annoying when you take precautions to clear the previous areas just to have them storm from those areas anyway.

I was hoping for some sneaking that was similar to ""the last of us"" where you had baddies that were at different levels of awareness with much different body language to communicate this to the player. The player's advantage is that we have more methods of ""seeing"". Including different states of awareness would add much more depth to baddies. Especially one that could ""smell"" the player, meaning as soon as the door opens they begin hunting until they have eyes on or equivalent then become aggro'd. 

Zombies 9/10
The baddies are very well done, they are up there with AAA games. The way they move as a single unit and in crowds really adds a dynamic fluidity to combat (they move so weirdly in crowds that it's hard to pick out a target). It is difficult to get consistent headshots as it should be. The baddies are TOUGH, even the standard units. They have range/projectile units as well as rushers who have significant range on their melee attack. All this to say without a proper team with proper preparation and coordination, any engagement has the potential to wipe out the team. The addition of glowing parts helps target acquisition but is basically necessary because the game is so unforgivably dark.

The only addition I can think of is if the new ""boss"" became a regular hunting enemy that can kidnap players and put them in different rooms by themselves around the map.

Weapons 3/10
They do weapon classes in a very weird way that I do not enjoy. Its system is similar to FO4 where weapons that shoot fast do less damage and have more ammo but weapons that shoot slower do more damage but also have less ammo. Weapon calibers aren't addressed in any way so its not like there is a weight value given to the ammo per round. You are just limited to a certain amount based on the specific weapon. Ammo is also refilled based on a percentage of ammo not by round. There is a generic ammo refill pack that gives 20% capacity of primary and special to the player regardless of how many are left. So if you really like your primary and barely touch your special you could potentially be wasting ammo by refilling when your special is already full. Weapons also come with predetermined sights and accessories. One of the only thermals is on the semi-auto high caliber rifle which is unfortunate because there are few scenarios that allow a slow-shooting weapon to shine where as the fast-shooting LMG-likes would be best with the thermal, but since they shoot fast they do terrible damage anyway.

I had hoped there would be a level of customization on par with like COD, FONV, or even better like Tarkov. A system where you can collect weapons, resources, and accessories to constantly improve your loadout. All while weighing the options of carrying too much ammo compared to other resources that you could have instead. The argument could be made that players would just bring obscene amounts of ammo and dump them in a weapon cache area. But this could be regulated by the price of ammo in the game or by an increased range of enemy earshot for firearms. But I suppose that this ""improvement"" in customization might clash with the theme of GTFO and the story where you are basically a prisoner sent with minimal gear. 

Equipment 1/10
The equipment in the game kinda seems like an afterthought. There are few options for equipment but there are basically four options. The first is a bio sensor that allows the player to sense bio signs in the form of white dots on a small screen within a short area and the ability to tag ONLY moving bio signs. The first option is basically useless because the sleepy baddies glow in the dark periodically so you can see them farther away in gameplay than you can on the biosensor and if you were planning on avoiding them you can't even tag them in case something goes wrong so at least you know exactly where they all are. It's mostly used to see if there are baddies behind a door. But opening the gigantic loud doors does not wake any sleepy baddies up or even alert the one baddy that walks around blindly, HUGE missed potential IMO. The second option is an elephant toothpaste dispenser gun thing. It secretes a substance that reinforces doors and slows down enemies that walk through it. It's okay but the grenades that do the same thing are waaay better for reinforcing a door because they reinforce the door fully and in an instant. The dispenser is also a hog on equipment refill packs. It slows down enemies fairly significantly but the baddies are really tough so might be better to option 3 or 4. Option 3 is a laser trip landmine dispenser that dispenses landmines on any surface. It is also a hog on equipment refill packs but they do a lot of damage but considering they are landmines there is not a lot of collateral sometimes they kill just one baddy. which annoying because the one tough baddy you wanna kill is often in the crowd so you need to place high on a wall so only the tall baddy will trip it. Or ya know just shoot the tall guy far away with a slow shooting gun, it takes way less preparation and is often more effective. Option 4 is really three options and IMO it is the only real option, which is sentry guns. There are three varieties shotgun, machinegun, and sniper gun. They all perform as you might expect but they are damn effective probably more so than the players. In fact, they are probably the only reliable way to handle a horde without risking a ton of invaluable HP. They all carry waaaaay more ammo than your personal weapons which makes no sense to me, they are easily deployable and easy to pick up, and the single most important thing about them is that they will be ignored by the horde. So you can place them wherever and they will whittle down the horde while taking no damage and only expending a moderate amount of ammo. Then the guys that slip through will be few and hurting so they get absolutely destroyed by the player posse. 

The best method I found is to have only sentries and use them as often as possible, have only one sniper sentry while whatever mixture of the other two works best. Landmines feel like a waste everytime I use them and an extra sentry annihilates the horde instead of moderately slowing them down with the elephant's toothpaste dispenser. At most have one bio scanner. But there might be a surplus of equipment ammo if you do that, which I find annoying because I want to have that slot open for med packs instead.If the player had to choose between supplying ammo to his sentry or to himself this would be a more interesting dynamic. Like if a player had to worry about ammo compatibility in his loadout. Computer terminals are a thing but they have no real impact on gameplay. They are only used to locate things. You can't use them to hack defense systems (which don't exist) or open doors (which you can break).",1671225239,1671225239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bots in game are not really supportive and get in the way more then they are useful.
 as there is no current command system for them, currently they run around on there own mostly
 getting in the way as soon as you engage an enemy they just start firing at will in a stealth base game... 

the overall game mechanics are  hard to learn at first there is no real story also the interface screen is basically unreadable as all text on screen is exstreamly small red and blurry due to this its almost impossible to complete in-game missions

the in game matchmaking is broken if you already have a friend in your lobby you 
want to play with and try to match-make it will split you up from each other most times leaving
 the host in the server by him self

another issue with the current game is they expect you to use a
third party program to find other players to play with (Discord) if you don't use this program you
are SCREWED as the matchmaking system never usually finds someone else as the content is locked to only players that have completed the previous maps

monsters in-game are pretty cool looking however the learning aspect of how to play 
is not at all straight forward you are dropped into a area with monsters that are exstreamly hard 
 the tutorial is not very informative on how to play at all, they only give you 
a few monsters to try to learn on and that doesn't help as level 1 gives new monsters that are not in the tutorial so your once again learning how to play all over 

now if you can get past all of that and you do go and get discord
and chat with some of the community you also get to learn that previous content was actually removed from the game not just locked until you beat previous missions. come to find out they take away all previous content every few months.
the website shows that you are getting this content when you buy the game an Example of this is Rundown 3-6 removed from the game all together meaning that if you were lucky enough to have got the game when they had this content it no longer exists and that's to bad for you...",1670977457,1670977457,False,3,2,0.499278724193572998,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is mainly divided into stealth or shooting. The stealth mechanics is unique, levels are filled with sleeping monsters and your team can kill them silently with melee or sneak past them. if you accidentally wake up a monster, it will scream and wake up the entire room. This makes for some intense moments because one mistake can end the entire run. 

As for the shooting, there are ""alarm doors"" sections where you are forced to hold your position against waves of monsters. These sections plays more like a traditional fps game, but you can't hold down the fire button to spray and pray because ammo is pretty scarce like any other good survival horror game. The whole game is highly dependent on teamwork so make sure you're using a mic when playing.

But be warned, this is not a mindless shooting game. You have to be patient, strategic and cooperative to succeed in harder levels. Also some levels are quite lengthy, inexperienced players can spend up to 2 hours in a single level just to fail right before the end. If you don't like to get frustrated at a challenge, then GTFO might not be for you. 

Also there are a lot of bugs in this game. For example C foam sometimes no-clip through doors, enemies glitching into walls, a large black dot appearing in the middle of your screen. And the performance is poor, there are frame rate and stuttering issues

Overall I highly recommend GTFO because the high stakes gameplay gives me an adrenaline rush no other game can. But you need some time to learn how to play the game.

The game concept is an interesting twist on the L4D co-op shooter style of games that has you starting out on the hardest difficulty and only gets harder from there. It requires teamwork, communication, skill and lots of patience. On paper, it's a really good game, [i]however...[/i]

I bought into this game with the release of 1.0, since leaving early access tends to be a sign that a game is polished and ready enough to be enjoyed with all it's base content in an overly hassle-free experience, but in this case, that is just not true.

The matchmaking is very poor, if not completely broken. You can't create a lobby, have a friend with you and then matchmake the two remaining slots. It looks like it's supposed to be possible, but it kicks you out and weird things happen. The only way to play with a friend and two randoms is to hit the matchmake button at the same time and hope for the best. Even then, the lobbies tend to be bugged out with some players names not loading in, not displaying as ready, etc. We also got consistently matched with Chinese players that didn't speak English when matchmaking from Western Europe. Honestly, even with how hard this game is, getting into a working game is harder. 

You can use bots to fill out the slots too, but they're a death sentence for any run except the easiest one. They don't pick up or use packs, they love to run in your way, and they sometimes get stuck in ladders or stairs. The devs need to make it so that bots teleport to you if you get too far away. In one game, everyone got downed except for 1 bot who had glitched into a wall. He couldn't die and wouldn't revive us. We couldn't even restart to the checkpoint at that point so had to restart the whole run. 

There are still plenty of other issues too. Last game just now one player put down some 10 sentry turrets (not sure if whether to cheats or lag) and lagged us all out before he disconnected. And after that our flashlights wouldn't toggle and were angled in the wrong direction. I've talked to other players that mention run-breaking issues with regards to vital quest items glitching out in so early as the second level, and that sort of thing is just inexcusable for a 1.0 release to be honest. 

On top of that, the gunplay feels a little bit janky somehow. Like there's a short delay between shots and hits and it's hard to figure out if you actually did any damage or not, and it's hard to judge when you will hit with your melee strikes or what bodypart you will hit (or even should hit, as some enemies continue fighting without their heads) . Closest thing I can liken it to is Vermintide or maybe Star Citizen. It's not bad, but it could be a fair bit better.

I think this game could be great with some more time in the oven. The concept is good, and there's probably plenty of replayability, if only the whole experience would be more polished. Until then, it's not really worth all the headache.",1639415579,1670614964,True,0,0,0.527581512928009033,0,True,False,False

The game has surprisingly enjoyable gunplay, and the mechanics are pretty solid and feel great to master. This is immediately offset by the game's BRUTAL difficulty, which is not always fair but gives the Complex a unique identity, that identity being that it doesn't give even a tenth of a f*** about you and your ""fun."" You should absolutely play with a squad of 4 people as this is both intended and substantially more fun, but bots are available if your friends suck or your mom told you not to talk to strangers on the Discord. If you are playing this game casually you most likely will not complete every level, and shouldn't aim to as it will probably sour your experience overall. The game is challenging in a way that feel satisfying upon completing a level that has been giving you trouble, but for some can devolve into frustration quickly, especially in earlier rundowns as they did not feature any checkpoint system and levels could take up to 3 HOURS to complete depending on how much you play like a b****.

The atmosphere is fantastic, and newer players will definitely feel the tension as they play. Y'know, if getting swarmed by 40+ enemies at once is tense enough for you. Every decision matters so careful planning is usually necessary alongside proper communication with teammates. You never know what horrors you may encounter next, so resource management is key to your survival as well. Don't be the guy who keeps taking fall damage jumping off platforms, your team will hate you and I won't blame them. Speaking of horrors, the enemy designs are grotesque and unsettling, contributing to the atmosphere in spades. Environments are crisp and grimy, the UI is tailored towards the game's narrative, and while the story is about as present as the story in a Dark Souls game, it's intriguing enough to make you want to learn more.

Now, the development process of this game is one of its weakest areas in my opinion. While the devs have definitely worked hard to get the game to where it is today, it feels like it should be far more substantial at this point. For the amount of development time that has passed, the enemy variety is still pretty limited, levels get repetitive after a while, many essential features (like a functional ping system) have never been implemented, the progression system is not very satisfying as it only includes some cosmetics that can be very bland at times, and there are still plenty of balancing issues. Hopefully the devs keep their passion for their product and work out these sorts of things going forward. The fact that they made it out of Early Access and didn't abandon us gives me some hope at least.

Overall, the game is absolutely worth your time, so I implore you to join us down here in the dark.

Be ready to die though. A lot.

I've played Deep Rock Galactic which relies on flashlights/flares for decent vision, however this game is not only way darker and with the occasional fog, but you also need to be careful using lights because of enemy aggro.
 It's important to learn a bunch of terminal codes in order to play at a higher level, unfortunately the tutorial only teaches a single command.
Enemies' aggro threshold is not easy to master, sometimes it's frustrating when you don't know why they woke up.
Melee weapons can feel clunky when you miss a swing while the enemy is at point blank range.

The main bug that is keeping me from playing this game is the fact that at some point in the run I can no longer interact with items (i.e. I cannot pick up items, deploy items, use consumables, etc). Which sinks my chances of making it through the run, and more than anything makes it incredibly frustrating to play. My friends and I have also been screwed over multiple times while moving through the checkpoints because the neonate objective is showing up in the hands of one of us while also being on the ground. As long as one of the neonates is on the ground, whoever was unlucky enough to have it in their hands cannot put theirs down.

it feels like a game with great potential ruined by an artificial difficulty spike insted of being hard and even harder to master like for example what the souls games go for which feel unfair but often times are becuase of player misinput in this game you can do everything right only for an enemy to die to a sneak attack and then alert everyone in a 30km radius it feels like.

maybe just increase the ammo by a bit or dont drop people into the mission with only 60% to 80% Ammo which is beyond dumb imo and fix some of the hitboxes and the random stealth mechanics and the game would be even better until then avoid this especially if you dont have a group of 4 i wouldnt even try it at 3 maybe if you are some extreme sweaty player go for it.",1670036787,1670036787,False,3,0,0.491620838642120361,0,True,False,False

If they play as usual, you will be crouching across the whole map when they wipe out the enemies, find the lockers, find the artifacts, or use the console. You are replaceable, and if you're not fast enough, you get nothing to do until the end when you get things to do, but then you fail because this game has no difficulty slider and you're not ready to pull your weight.

Let's compare GTFO and DRG. 

In DRG, the difficulty changes depending on the number of players. The overall difficulty can also be selected. Each class has its own role that other classes struggle to replicate. Even if the team is top-notch, you can res your mates, drill a shortcut, light the cave, or help to mine minerals.

In GTFO, the difficulty is set in stone and dialed up to 4 persons always. As a new player, you're wandering like an NPC because everything is already done by your more experienced mates, unless there is a place where you _must_ help, which of course you fail to do because you're new.

Also, rewards? What rewards? All weapons are already unlocked, the powerups are near useless at the start of your journey. The only thing to aim for is to level up powerups and finish all secondaries. GTFO has no progression, basically. Nothing in immediate vicinity to strive for.

And that was my experience in a trio with the guys I know. With randos, it would be pure hell.

Of course I'm a newbie who does not understand the beauty of this game yadda yadda.

Once you start to learn the mechanics, it's quite fun.

I enjoy going into games without reading all about how to play, so the discovery of how to use the tools provided from trial and error is pretty enjoyable. At first, the glow sticks felt very pointless, until i realised they work well at illuminating enemies in the fog, and if you place the glow stick between yourself and an enemy, their silhouette will be visible. Learning how to use these resource is fun, since they appear kinda useless to begin with, till you know how to use them.

The game has two game play loops, stealth and action. The stealth portions can vary from boring to suspenseful. For example, if your team has lots of resources to use, it can seem pointless to stealth when you can just shot the remaining enemies in the room. On the other hand, when your team doesn't have enough resources to fend off another wave of enemies, it's suspenseful and exciting, as one mistake will have great consequences.

For the action portions, generally you get time to prepare, since some doors will have alarms that trigger waves of enemies to come, this allows for your team to develop strategies for how you'll survive the wave, which is quite fun. 
Other times, you're thrown into the action, usually when your team fails to sneak past a room full of enemies, leading to chaos and using more resources then was probably required.

The resources are some what limited, meaning you have to think about how to approach each new zone you enter. Should we take it slowly to preserve our ammo, or move a bit quicker, since we can afford to trigger a small group of enemies? I enjoy when a game makes you think in this way. It feels very good when you have lots of resources available, such as max ammo, spare med packs and full sentries. But as you progress through the level, your resources start to dwindle. It doesn't feel unfair when you run low/out of resources, since the level does provide enough to get through, it's up to you to make sure you use them correctly so you have enough to reach the end.

There are other things, such as the terminals, which once you learn the commands (google is your friend here), you'll be able to find resources/objective items much more easily, which is very rewarding once you get the hang of it.

Overall, GTFO does have a learning curve to start truly enjoying the game, the mix of stealth and action is good, and the resource management adds another layer of depth that keeps your brain thinking and engaged throughout the level.",1669739931,1669739931,True,7,0,0.591584146022796631,0,True,False,False

(Point of review I've finished around 10 level which would be roughly 1,5 Rundowns (Level clusters for example Rundown 1 has 6 or 7 levels) or a lil less. Most of them were before the Rundown1.0 update.)

[u] Things I really like about GTFO myself: [/u]
 [*] You're really getting the feeling of the Game while it already starts with some kind of Hydrostasis Protocol to begin with.
 [*] I heard there is a tutorial now, which seems to be quite useful (Haven't done it myself and only seen parts of it)
 [*] Your comrades are probably the reason you're actually losing and not the level or enemies. (A challenge for yourself would definitely be if you like to plan things out, because at least one mate is gonna do the Leeroy Jenkins)
 [*] There are many Weapons to choose from on any of the 4 Weapon/Tool slots to fit most of the individual playstyles.
 [*] Has actual Quest/Story targets and not just ""take this Item from the very last room and you got it"". You have a big complex which you can explore, but you definitely don't have to, because the object you're looking for is mostly at a place which doesn't require you to find everything beforehand.
 [*] Sets a really good vibe and kinda makes you actually stealth to be productive. Also makes very good use of other aspects like Light, Fog and obstacles (There are no special parcour possibilites. I meant based on the experience of gameplay)


[u] Things that might be annyoing or problematic: [/u]
 [*] Meleehits sometimes connect to the enemies Shoulder and not Head, even tho you're aiming right on the Head because it somehow calculates the way of your model to the enemies and doesn't go directly towards their head or smt like that.
 [*] Sometimes Stealth might feel weird. It's a thing of train and error, but they can wake up by you uncrouching or standing too close without doing anything, so watch your step for real.
 [*] There are Rundown specific guns/equipments. If you like a weapon and it's handling it might be only for one of the 7 Rundowns. But that shouldn't be a problem too dramatic.


[u] So for the conclusion: [/u]
I think it's a very great game in total, it's very fun to play with a Squad, especially if there's at least one Person missing the plan, being very easily frightened or is just plain on dumb. The Level and objectives switches often and it seems like the Game can also tell quite a story if you're careful and looking. If you're more of a lone wolf I think this Game isn't suited for you, because it's sometimes even for 3/4 people quite challenging.


Never forget, there's always that one person how's able to make any situation worse, this game filters them out to be pointed at.",1669647527,1669647625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will be losing a lot, I certainly am, but I still get a lot of fun when losing. Now, when you win it feels like you really deserved it and it's such a rush!

This is really not for solo. You need 4 people to make it doable or a lot of practice for doing it at 3 or at 2.

Solo is not an option even if some people say they can solo missions. They are most likely extremely good and very lucky in the drops.

The game has very good ambience it gives chills, at first u're probably gonna start shooting mobs around like in any other games and find ur self in a situation where there are no bullets left in ur weapon magazine aaand next thing u know, u're dead, with that being said it's difficult aswell, u have to count your shots, use your melee weapon more than your guns and yeah ""WORK TOGETHER OR DIE TOGETHER"" don't forget about your teammates, play with team, communicate with team, help your teammates with ammo-health etc.

Soo the visuals are fun
weapons are cool
monsters are very interesting
The game is really awesome..... but.....

There are 2 things i want to talk about

1.Not enough players
2.Price of the game

1. You have to play with teammates as i said before ""work together or die together"" but unless you have 3 more friends to play with you'd have to control the bots all the time and trust me it's not what you want to do, it's quite the pain in the ass with em, you have to tell them exactly when and how and why they have to do something while being in the middle of the fight against the 30 monsters it's almost impossible

2. 40euro ? well, i'd say not yet
It has alot of stuff to do and to achieve but not for 40euro
Im okay with buying this game for 30 but i'd say 20 is the best price for this game rn
And since you're going to be stuck for 5-10+ min in the queue 40 way is alot to ask from the gamers.

You'll need a team of 4 (the game can fill the lobby with some extra bots, but I'd honestly just recommend looking for an additional team member on Discord or in-game matchmaking if you're short a person). I'd say this is the game's biggest strength (as it forces you all to cooperate, everyone has their own role) and the biggest weakness (as the game is expensive and requires a lot of time, so it's hard to get together people who can 1. afford it 2. enjoy this particular type of gameplay 3. get together regularly for runs that can take a few hours).

If you have a team together, this is one of the coolest games I've played in a very long time.

Things I'd watch out for if they're a dealbreaker for you are:
1. The game can be glitchy at times
2. It's hardcore and unforgiving, which is a good thing for a lot of people and a bad thing for a lot of people
3. It's expensive for a multiplayer-only game
4. It requires a considerable time commitment on a per-run basis

Kidding aside, I highly recommend GTFO for anyone who's into a dark sci-fi procedural first-person dungeon crawler.

You may notice that I did not mention the game being a horde shooter like Left 4 Dead or Vermintide because it's not. I DO NOT recommend this game to people who expect a horde shooter from it. Contrary to what most early marketing of GTFO and Youtuber let's plays make it out to be, GTFO is more about slowly and methodically clearing rooms in stealth than gunning down hordes of Naruto-running aliens/mutants.

Unnecessary gunfights will deplete your resources. First Aid kits and Ammo packs don't necessarily fill up your status. There are no crowd control melee attacks or secondary weapons which means that every encounter with a horde will significantly drain either your health or ammo so the only good time to engage a horde is when you're forced to engage a horde. Resupplies are so rare that any significant expenditure early on will cost you and means the difference between actually finishing a level. 

Runs in GTFO also take a significant amount of time compared to horde shooters. Where clearing a level in L4D or Vermintide can happen within 20 minutes at the most, first time runs can take up to an hour and a half for new players and still around 45 minutes to an hour for more experienced players which does not include deciding to tackle side-vaults. It's easy to shrug off a bad run in other horde shooters when things go sour and try again. In GTFO, you end up wasting an hour or two of effort in your life. I remember the days when failing a run meant starting from the very beginning. They have since implemented checkpoints to the game, but you still need to set the expectation that runs still take a significant amount of time to accomplish. 

Progression in GTFO is also different from the norm. All equipment are available to the players from the start with no need to unlock them via levels, experience, or challenges. Variety is achieved via some of the more specialized equipment rotating in and out every season/rundown. The only unlockables you can expect from GTFO are cosmetic items for your character. I think this is apt for the game as it highlights the game loop of successfully clearing each ""dungeon"" and not unlocking equipment for unlocking equipment's sake.

Before you get this game, make sure to consider first if you have anyone else in your friend group interested in it. If not, you should ask yourself if you're willing to go into the GTFO official discord and find other players there. While the game does have public matchmaking, it's still filled mostly of players who picked the game up thinking they were getting some sort of sci-fi Left 4 Dead and have no patience in actually playing the game for what it is. These kind of people will waste your time. You'll be a couple of minutes into a mission when they snap and decide to go Rambo and you never get close to actually finishing any level. Looking for a group in the official discord cuts down the amount of players who go into the game with the wrong expectations and you're most likely to find like-minded people there. 

If you go into GTFO understanding that it's not anywhere near a horde shooter like Left 4 Dead, where communication is important, where the goal and satisfaction comes from beating the game's ""dungeons"" and not having the most number of kills among your team, you will have a good time in GTFO. 

TLDR: The best advice I can give to people who are interested in this game: THIS IS NOT A HORDE SHOOTER. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT RESPECT YOUR TIME.

PROs:
- Super immersive 
- Gun play feels good
- Amazing CO-OP Experience, no lag, solid FPS
- Volumetric fog!
- Intriguing story
- Finally, someone utilizing darkness correctly!
- Overall beautiful graphics
- Challenging

CONS:
- UI reads mostly as visual noise
- Bots are a nice addition but still buggy.
- Every room / set-dressing looks too similar. There is almost no visual distinctions between areas throughout the environment, making it hard to navigate without the map (no minimap). Also gets a bit boring. It feels almost procedurally generated (I Know that It's not)
- Would be nice with some more environmental interaction; breaking glass, physics objects, more ways to barricade, turn on lights in a room, destroy existing lights, place some turrets, or just something. The world feels incredibly dead and static without anything to interact with besides the same type of blast-door over and over.
- Could be nice if you could drop ammo/objects to your team",1641219166,1669478394,True,0,0,0.519676864147186279,6,True,False,False

The game's core functionality is very unique to it's genre. It almost makes me want to define a new genre for this game entirely. As the developer notes state: IT IS NOT A RUN AND GUN. My friends and I have confirmed this note multiple times (took us 3 days to get through the first level so if you haven't done stealth games before, be prepared to have multiple attempts on this game) 

If you definitely haven't played stealth missions that are purely stealth, get more people to do this game with. This game is hard without four people, but not impossible. The game (as I am writing this review) is not matchmaking capable, but they are working on it. If you don't have friends to play this with, I strongly recommend that you join the dedicated discord server for this game. 

Lastly, I would have to say the thing that caught my eye specifically about this game was the combat system. Even though it has hints of multiple combat systems tied into one, it's something that is unique for this specific genre. This game is best to be played with headphones (both sides need to be working to ensure a good gameplay) and is all about proximity when it comes to melee combat and stealth. 

Can't wait to see all the updates and possibly a steam workshop for users to make their own custom levels on!

EDIT: Glad to see that they are doing something unique. Kinda sad that they aren't going to keep the first rundown as it is sort of iconic because it is the FIRST official rundown. Rundown two is about to be amazing with my friends. Can't wait to log another 100 hours on this game.

EDIT: I feel bad not playing it as often anymore but this Rundown I am going to be playing it much more here soon. I can't wait to get into this rundown and try to solo some of the levels.

EDIT: They've fully released it! Happy to see that they are doing limited time rundowns that also remove certain guns. We are seeing more gameplay and lore in the rundowns. They've also added bots to the game that make the ""Soloing"" part of the game, more do-able. C1 Can eat my whole butt tho, that whole rundown is Satans Dick

Notes: Quite a hardcore game to play if you don't have friends and you don't play seriously, there are bots and matchmaking but nothing beats playing with friends. it's like a l4d2 game, you have different maps different objectives you go through them and complete them, so far a little bit of weapons and some cosmetics not alot yet waiting for more progression content.",1592450684,1669428215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Just do a spiral knights and have RNG rundown levels based off community inputs lol you have a modular map maker. 

[old review]

This game is fantastic if you think being one of the marines from Aliens that died sounds like a good time.
Its mostly stealth exploration with bursts combat. Maps are very long and can easily take over an hour to complete. You get very few resources so death is never more than 1 wrong decision away. 
Playing solo is not really viable in early access though, its designed around 4 players using different tools to complete the objectives.
Use the lobby code system, not the match maker, to find groups. GTFO is still a work in progress and lacks many quality of life features but the core gameplay is solid. Hopefully the dev supports this game for a long time.",1607743903,1669427270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game proves that not all EA games are money grabs, these are people that really care about the experience they give their players. With a small team having accomplished something so unique and rich, I definitely have high hopes for this game and will certainly be watching GTFO as it grows and becomes something special.

I love how challenging the rundown's are; rewarding cooperation, but very punishing when something goes wrong. I can imagine this will be the new 4-player coop game of the next decade if 10 Chambers keeps up the awesome work. 

But the aspect I love the most about the game is the terminal interface. Currently, it's fairly minimalist with just a few commands, but being a Linux programmer/gamer/analyst (by the way, this game runs flawlessly on Linux through Proton), seeing something like real terminal commands and queries in a game just adds that special flavor of realism. In a high stakes environment like GTFO, you really have to know your stuff to be able to use it quickly and efficiently, which was just that small nudge from liking the game to loving it. I can't wait to see if they improve/add on to the terminals like scripting to break into big loot rooms or enemy statistics throughout the level. Again, keep pushing devs, this game is well on it's way to GTFO:GOTY someday in my opinion.",1576005555,1669416767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But as i started playing my first real mission with my friend, i have felt some boredom as i was wondering around the map with repetative actions as killing enemies with melee weapons because it is the quietest method of killing enemies. The tasks were also the same and i really did not understand the point of the game. The second mission was to collect 12 id cards or something like that and for each one of them i would have to find a key somewhere, kill a lot of enemies. It felt like a very grindy task which i was not expecting in a game which costed me 20 usd (i live in a region with somewhat cheap prices).

WOW. where to start with this game. First of all, for 8 people making it and it being in early access after just 4 years, this game is in absolutely amazing shape. It is exactly what it claims to be: a hard, puzzle-fps-stealth game that is insane amounts of fun. If you like games where you have to prepare defenses, think tactically, and make quick precise decisions, then this is the game for you.
[h1] Rundown [/h1]
The ""Rundown"" is the area you are diving into with a few different maps that change every now and then, with most of them being different difficulties. As an example, the current rundown (005) has A1-2, B1-3, C1-2, and D-1 (i think). Each letter being a different floor and each number being a different area of that floor, in increasing difficulty order. As with most games, they do a great job of introducing the much more basic enemies first. As not to totally spoil the experience, I won't list them, but he first enemies you encounter are called sleepers. To navigate around and kill the Sleepers, you must pay attention the the level's transmission log that you see before selecting it, this will help you will the further challenges to come as well. 

[h1] Weapons [/h1]
The weapons, unlike most games like this, dont actually do a boatload of damage as you see in most of these games. Ammo runs low real quick, so staying stealthy and using your melee (which all do the same damage, but can be buffed through charging your attacks) is a pretty damn good idea. Going loud means the chance of survival is drastically lowered, and often times, it'll be an accident when you actually do. 
That being said, for the guns- I'm kind of torn. Some of them are pretty good, some of them are meh. Most of the ones labeled as [rundown specific] tend to be on the better side. But your pistols are great for headshots, shotguns and sometimes smgs are good for crowd control, but the AR's are mediocre at best. You want to not the ranges of the weapons, as well as their fire modes. Other than that, for the most part you kind of just have to get a feel for each one and use what youre best with, which i love because of an perhaps odd reason: [u] there's no clear meta. [/u] Personally at least, I hate games with metas where one thing is just super OP and decimates everything- even if it means i win, which makes this game great. 
[h1] Main Points/Things to Know Before Buying [/h1]
[strike] - it is harder than a peen in a brothel [/strike]
- It is incredibly difficult. like if dark souls became an FPS-stealth-zombie-ish game
- You will die. You must persevere and try try try try try try try again and again and again. BUT YOU WILL GET IT.
- It is NOT an easy or casual game, it's players are aiming to WIN. These means HEAVY cooperation between you and your team. A mic is [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommended. 
- Your objective log will help you understand where you are going A LOT. Pay attention to it. (top left or open your map using tab and hit the ""O"" key.
- In the rundown, as long as the rundown doesnt change, each level (A1,A2,B1,B2,B3,ETC) will always be the same except for the spawns, but the shape will remain, use this to your advantage.
- Watch game clips on youtube or twitch or whatever platform you choose before purchasing, understand the game's mechanics at least a [i] little [/i] before you buy.
- If you are interested and thinking about it, but are unsure if you want to get it now or later, remember that it will be a full $60 at release. But its -$25 off now, you can help with the development of the game, have a great time, and gitgud before this game blows up.
- Buying the game expecting to only play two hours and then requesting a refund is a terrible idea. This game is kind of like risk of rain 2 for those of you who play- it takes a long a$$ time, and you still might not finish the level. Each level I've completed has taken anywhere to 30 mins to over an hour. Make sure you have that kind of time.

Other than that, all that's left is for you to make your choice. It's a great game, but not for the faint of heart nor the dull in mind. 

Feel free to comment if you have a question, I'll answer if I can!

It's a hardcore co-op shooter aimed for people who like to push themselves to their limits, the game achieves that goal with ease as it makes you savor every last bit of resources you get and forces you to all work as a coordinated team. It's a serious game and has very little room for silly and funny shenanigans, though some may happen at times.

While all of the above are good, I cannot bare to play this game sometimes and it drives players off due to the unreal amount of bugs it has. I cannot compare it to Fallout, god no, but it gets close. The number of times that we've gotten softlocked, unable to pick up items e.t.c. are more than I can count.

[h1]A list of bugs that I have encountered:[/h1]

- Getting stuck carrying an item, aka getting softlocked (e.g. Power Cell, Fog Turbine)
- Becoming completely invincible after getting hit by an enemy
- Falling through the map after getting hit by a certain enemy, resulting in a softlock
- Becoming completely and permanently blinded after getting hit by a certain enemy.
- Becoming immune to projectiles
- Having infinite consumables
- Getting stuck between game objects, resulting in a softlock
- Randomly getting kicked to the main menu with no warning, ending the run
- Enemies randomly waking up through walls, or not waking up randomly
- Hitboxes being quirky. Back hitboxes depend on your position, not the angle of the shot, resulting in many scenarios where the hits don't count as the enemy's back and often are quite buggy.
- A lot of client side shenanigans such as the host having a major advantage when it comes to dodging. No matter the distance from the host, anyone who is connected to them, can be hit through walls with melee attacks and from further away. Enemies tend to teleport around and even run inside walls in some occasions.
- Random crashes tend to happen a lot, and people lose their boosters due to that. The game does not save your boosters.
- Checkpoints often cause things to bug out and desync people from the host, often resulting in people being downed in inaccessible rooms upon respawning, resulting in scouts touching them and waking them up sometimes.
- Sometimes the 'Respawn From Checkpoint' button doesn't even exist, though it may appear later if you give it time which is often the case.
- Sometimes people take random fall damage when walking down the stairs (Excluding host)
- Mines sometimes explode when the enemies' collision boxes phase through the door
- Enemies can absorb C-Foam through the door, resulting in some issues when you're trying to re-apply c-foam during an alarm.
- The ally A.I. tends to not be too co-operative. For some reason they have FRIENDLY FIRE ENABLED?! They tend to not go inside scans or follow you through doors, they sometimes phase through said doors to follow you which is great, but wouldn't be needed if they followed you into rooms instead of staying outside and having to go through extra steps to fight with the A.I. during high stress situations. They are of little to no help when it comes to stealthing. You cannot command them to kill a specific enemy and you cannot tell them to synchronize in order to kill a big guy all together.
- No HDR support
- Sometimes you get credit for objectives you haven't completed

All of these bugs are far from uncommon. And while the positive ones are funny but rare, the negative ones have led to hours of our lives wasted due to one thing gone wrong in the spaghetti code that this game is. I love this game so much and the only thing that holds it back is the amount of bugs that it has. Sure it can use some quality of life features like having a checkpoint at the start so you don't have to go through the loading sequence again, or saves on checkpoints at least temporarily until the issues above are fixed, but other than that, the game would not even need checkpoints if it weren't for all the potential bugs that can happen. I will absolutely change my review by the time these bugs are fixed, but for now, on RUNDOWN 7.0 Despite an update AFTER it's full release, you can hardly call it more than a Beta.

Good luck.

with the new rundown 2 update the game released a bunch of new updates including: 
[list]
[*]New Monsters
[*]New Weapons
[*]New Levels
[/list]

Each level is different from the last, each one serves a new challenge and keeps the player engaged in the level. The developers made it clear they want everyone working together to clear the levels. The levels are ridiculously hard that a casual player won't stand a chance completing it on their own. They also locked the last 2 levels and will be unlocked when enough players clear the other 8. This game is not a solo game and you will need to find 3 other friends/randoms to play with. 

The level design and immersion is insane, the game is super fun to play without a HUD just to get a spine chilling experience of being trapped underground with a bunch of monsters. 

Character loadouts are well thought out, giving the player lots of options on how to deal with a certain level.

_______________________________________________________

Currently i agree with a lot of my friends on this, that this game is becoming stale and stale. The deviation R1 that came was a complete copy + paste with the only difference being hybrids in C1 waves.

Other than that, there were no difficulty spikes at all, duo-ing the rundown is easy enough.

It adds nothing, especially with the lack of variety in enemies.

Striker, big striker, shadow striker, baby striker, black striker with spikes called a charger, a big version.

Shooter, big shooter, shooter that shoots a barrage and melees, scout, invisible scout

mother, tank, pouncer/snatcher, spitters, flyers, squidward <- These are the only unique enemies

There isnt much variety at all, no variety in behaviours, no different attack patterns, which are extremely easy to do, no other debuffs like bleeding, infection is the only debuff in the game.

Its more like a Payday 2 game in a dark setting, losing its uniqueness as it becomes developed.",1578496425,1669289856,True,3,0,0.526315808296203613,2,True,False,True

I have beaten most levels solo but some are just purely made for playing with others which is a stigma i hope the devs
drop in the future as players completely die off and more attention and buffs to bots are made.
This game is too good to just let it die due to losing players.

All of the Old Rundowns are coming back which makes for ALOT of playtime.

* The Gunplay and Stealth play are both great, the game does lean heavily towards Stealth though, do not expect CoD.
* The Graphics are beautiful and the monsters look and sound great.
* Whilst not all the weapons are super viable, they all do handle and sound great.
* The Lore and Story are both really intriguing

The only gripe i have is there are some gamebreaking bugs that still exist after all this time (Been playing since release, Rundown 6)  but i have only experienced a couple of them, most notably when i HAVE tried to play with a friend or two.

The game is extremely brutal and punishing, even for a group of friends/randoms let alone a solo player... but the game was'nt marketed as a Solo player game but most of it CAN BE DONE with enough patience and practice.

Cons: 

- Some clipping issues and path finding issues for the AI, resulting in spots the players can get into to abuse the AI of the game.

That is pretty much the only con of this game. Some spots in the maps have places where you can climb due to the clipping of the props and objects. However, this can also be a Pro in most cases. It makes the game feel more immersive and more mobile than it is. Personally I do like the immersive part of it, however I do think abusing the AI is not a good part of the game. Obviously this game being in early access will have bugs, this being one of them and the developers will likely fix issues like this in the future.

Pros:

- Environment is REALLY well done
- A horror, co-op game that is made to challenge even the better gamers out there, requiring the use of teamwork to really be able to advance through the levels
- Literally everything else

I say literally everything else because this game has so many amazing features (including monsters) that I feel that the player(s) have to experience themselves to get the full effect of how amazing this game is.

Sure this game is hard, but that's what keeps bringing people back to it.

As of right now, Rundown 2 is released and I have beaten all the levels from A1 to D2 once and A1 to B4 at least four times. E1 is still a challenge that I hope to complete one day. 

I hope this game continues to receive updates and support from the developers that are making this, as I can see this game being a revolutionary game for gamers to conquer.",1589945727,1669273360,True,87,1,0.740327119827270508,6,True,False,False

With more people it slightly takes away from the horror ambiance, but adds more of a strategy plan to it during door alarms or siege doors. With Rundown 7 out, now is the time to try it out since they added a tutorial. With the new weapons added in and all of the levels to explore, the replay ability is there. It is a blast trying to figure out were to go and how to survive on the way.

[b]Great things about the game:[/b]
-Updates are super frequent
-Devs are super communicative on their steam posts/updates
-Has an atmosphere that is unmatched by anything else
-Mod support
-Gameplay is incredibly intense and allows you to take it as seriously as you want to [as long as you don't start trolling super hard]
-Great Visuals + enemy designs
-Bots were added to allow more people to ""solo"" levels

[b]Less great things about the game:[/b]
-It doesn't have matchmaking [In my opinion this isn't a bad thing because of the amount of information you have to deal with. I'd rather not have to deal with a random person joining and trolling as well. But I'm gonna put this here because I see that there are plenty of people complaining about this]
-Since the connections are p2p sometimes during the middle of a run someone will disconnect or the host will stop responding and everything stops working for a bit
-They made their own discord for people to use in case people want to play without using the bots, everyone who I've talked to from there seemed pretty nice but I understand why most people don't like having to join a discord server to play multiplayer with random people
-After every update they add and remove certain maps [There's a rotation, I'm not going to explain it because honestly how it works seems to be changing all the time and I just didn't keep track of it at all]

[b]The ""bad"" stuff[/b]
-Some levels take a GOOD while to finish and since you can't stop in the middle of it you have to have quite a lot of time to be able to finish some of the later levels
-It is incredibly punishing for a more casual type of player, I'd say that most people who got into GTFO got into it because of the ""challenges"" that it presented with its gameplay, etc. But for a more casual player this can be viewed as a bad thing, I think. Since there are no difficulty options [even though the first levels are often quite easy when compared to some of the stuff at the end of the game] it can be quite daunting for someone who isn't experienced with this type of game

[b]The actual bad stuff[/b]
-Sometimes there are some pretty ""intense"" bugs, textures sometimes completely disappear, the audio sometimes completely bugs out, etc. Sometimes these bugs can affect gameplay by quite a lot. But usually it only happens for a second or two and then everything goes back to normal [although bugs related to audio usually don't]
-The audio levels are EVERYWHERE with this game, every time I open it I take off my headphones because if I don't I know for certain that I'll go deaf by how loud that opening is, the noises for when you're going down to a level are incredibly loud as well [I know that you can make the argument that it helps with the immersion, etc. But to me those could be quite a bit less loud and it wouldn't lessen the immersion at all]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
GTFO is probably one of the best games to play with your friends, wouldn't really purchase it if I didn't know anybody to play with me though.",1669272121,1669272121,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,1,True,False,False

It relies heavily on cooperation and knowledge of the game and levels. Learning how to play the game will take some time and an open mind. The gameplay is a mix of stealth and loud section. The stealth parts are critical as you can save a lot of ammo and health that are needed for the loud sections. You will need to learn how to properly stealth as well as hold your own while fighting hordes. The stealth part is a bit of red light / green light, but there are most subtleties to it. The shooting parts are srtaightforward, yet the enemies sometimes move in a pretty erratic way, complicating aiming. There are multiple weapons with varying degree of damage and range, nothing different from other FPS. You will also have a selection of tools, knowing how and when to use those is critical to completing levels.

The game also has matchmaking. While it works ok for the early levels, it will be quite a long shot for the later levels. If you really get into the game, I highly recommend using the discord or find a regular group to play with.

Lastly, this game is HARD, it will take you a couple tries and take advice from more experienced players. Expect to wipe the floor with your face many many times, especially in the later levels. This game is not for everyone. If you are unsure, try it out for less than 2 hours and consider refunding.

Update 2022-11-23
With the re-release of Rundown 1, !0 chambers announced they will be including older rundowns one at a time. I think this is the best decision they could have ever made. We have to be honest, games eventually end and stop being worked on. Having all the levels available at all times is great to attract new players seekings cool gaming experiences. I'd say this is now a must buy for any hardcore FPS enthusiast.

Background :
I have been following and playing this game since it was talked about. I played Alpha and bought the game once it came out in Early Access. I played every single rundowns, albeit not every single levels. I always hit the C's and sometimes the D's with the right team. I got to a E once, during R4 and sadly never finished it (some toxic people would say ""skill issue""). 

All through development I feared the game would be too hard and too unforgiving, especially in the early parts of the game. The early game experience is critical to on-boarding and retaining new players. If you discourage them early, you lose customers and potential new ones via bad reviews and word of mouth. 

Communication and PR from the devs was never good, up until v1.0 was out we had very little idea of what would be next for the game. Which is a bit worrisome and created a bit of ""suspense"". 

When I saw all the core changes, mostly checkpoints and bots i was relieved. Playing the game myself, solo with bots, was quite enjoyable and confirmed my initial feeling. The early game is now vastly more approachable, which bodes well for the future of the game.",1601649623,1669234266,True,44,0,0.583210587501525879,1,True,False,False

When missions can easily last several hours, having to start from scratch multiple times is frustrating, repetitive, and boring.

I first played this waaaaay back when it was in early access. At the time it wasn't like anything else I had ever played before or had even thought about playing before. I dragged my friends into it and, as you can see from my hours, we played it A LOT. 

In terms of the game itself, it has seen a lot of updates and finalised updates that have brought heaps of content; the devs really do care about what they're making and strive their best to produce updates that not only are they pleased with, but also the community is pleased with. The game play is your average ""Get to point A"" or ""Carry Thing from point A to point B"", but the atmosphere, environments, the enemies and the complexity of the lore behind the game make these formulaic missions some of the most butt clenching, heart racing experiences I have ever had in a game. The enemies are unique and really terrifying, they really put your FPS skills to the test and are probably the most creatively designed creatures I've seen in a while (considering that this is a FPS horror game and not just strictly a spooky game). 

Playing with friends makes the experience 100% better than playing alone or with strangers. You'll find yourself either becoming a troop of hardened and jaded militant soldiers- OR - a group of deliriously screaming babies who don't know what a 'russian stealth' move is yet (trust me- you'll soon find out). Working together as a team is incredibly rewarding when you finish a mission or perfectly clear out a room of enemies without alerting a single one.

My only setback with GTFO is that my computer isn't able to handle it. This part is my own fault, I'm playing very graphically heavy games on a Surface Pro 7 that can barely load Firefox without crapping its pants. But even so, there are settings in GTFO that do allow you to customise the graphics more than enough to compensate for older computers. I still manage to play the game on the lowest graphics and other settings, and the game still looks polished and amazing. My true gripe with the game, and my friends can attest to it, it seems whenever enemies load in from another room or they're spawning in the game gets tremendously laggy and often freezes my laptop, or in the worst cases, kicks another friend from the game. I haven't played GTFO since last year, but with the way the dev team operates, they've probably fixed this issue by now.

It's a 9/10 for me. Great game to play with three close buddies on a weekend night, hop on voice chat and scream your guts out lovingly at whoever is left standing to come and revive you.",1669199117,1669199188,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This isn't a dark souls level hard, it is in a league of its own and it is fucking good at it. It is a true coop game, that requires communication, and some brain power. It is also super satisfying when finally clearing a level. I recommend this game, but you're gonna need a normal entry level gaming pc at the least, and 2 friends.

With that said, I'll say that if you enjoy slow paced, tactical games, with sprinklings of intense action when it does come, you probably will like this game. But it's also very difficult, with a high skill floor to overcome when you're just starting out, which that alone is often a turn off to many players.

The last major thing I want to mention is that when I say how this game is slow paced, I mean it's overall very slow. You can spend several hours just in one level because of how long things can take, especially when you are not super pro and know how to blaze through sections in the fastest way possible.

Very difficult to play solo; a group of friends is more or less mandatory for this game if you want to complete all the levels in a rundown. You may be able to complete the easier levels with just bots, but it becomes impossible in later levels where you have to coordinate terminals with another player. This game does not modify the difficulty when you start a level solo, it's been designed to be completed with a full group of human players. You do have access to bots, yet they can't sequence terminals with you. They are essentially walking sentry turrets. I believe this game would be more accessible to a wider audience if the difficulty scaled to the number of human players in a level. As of writing this has not occurred. 

Update: This game is still difficult yet fun and I continue to come back to it with a group of friends  every so often. The maps can take up to an hour to complete if not more. Previous rundowns will be re-released as alternate variations of what existed in the past.

There are times where you want to stealth, where you want to go guns blazing, or where you need to defend a position. Stealth is a major part of the game and it works very well. Every creature placement determines how you go about a situation, if it's too saturated you back off, if it's not saturated then you pick creatures off one by one with melee. Or you can just ignore that entirely and kill them with your loud ass guns.

There is no right or wrong way to play, only live or die. It's unforgiving and you may lose 30 minutes to an hour of progress, but it just means you get better when you play it again next time.

GTFO is tough, you should team up with friends, but you can find people online on the developers discord as an ingame matchmaking is not implemented yet.

You are prisoners send down to accomplish some tasks, and these tasks are varying per level, which makes each level quite unique. As the devs are re-using the assets for new levels, they can't make sure old levels will still work in the future. This introduces the rundown concept: A rundown is the current set of levels, divided in tiers, each tier may consist of on or more sublevels. This set of levels is called rundown and gets replaced when new levels are released. So you might not see all levels before the rundown gets replaced. On the other hand, with this concept you get new content again and again.

The game has a steep learning curve, and without hints you might have to do several tries until you find the right tactics. And even if you might know the most promising tactic, you still need practice to beat the levels without wiping. The game is meant to be tough, so don't get frustrated if you fail several times. How to stealth without triggering, or how to kite enemies when you triggered is something you need to practice. When you fail a level, you have to start from the beginning of this level. You need to beat all levels of a tier to unlock access to the next tier.
The feeling when you finally manage a level is awesome.

The atmosphere of this game is astonishing. It totally fits the setting, and over time parts of the lore are revealed.

The GTFO community is great and helpful, so if you fail too often, don't hesitate to seek for some assistance.

Not enough ammo always, but after few updates from A to B it's enough to complete a level with fire.
Only 4 players win gameplay. If you are CYBERcutlete you can do it all alone (not from C ofc).

Playing with bots can be irritating at first, but once you learn their mechanics/how they work and act it's actually quite fun. At times the game can feel unfair but it's almost always the player's fault, not the game's. For example one thing I thought was a bug for the longest time was long distance aggro. It turns out that if an enemy is glowing and has a line of sight to the enemy your killing it has a chance to get angry, which was news to me once I actually looked it up. At times you may feel like quitting or you may feel like you can't get any better, but if you keep moving forward, trying new weapons and new tool combinations, and trying new strategies, you'll eventually get it. My only complaint is that some levels are impossible to beat with bots, like R7 D1. At the end of the level you must do an alarm where one person must enter a code on a terminal while another player enters another code on another terminal. However, bots can't enter commands, and many of the terminals are too far apart to run from one to the other in time. This is quite irritating for me because I don't have any friends that are willing to play that level with me and I'm not a fan of the discord server. If they were to give the bots the ability to enter certain commands where it would be impossible for the player, or if they were to give the player more time if he/she was the only one in the game that would be one thing, but straight up making it impossible isn't fair to players who like going in solo or with bots.

I was so excited to play this game with friends in the US... 
But after many, many attempts and soooo much troubleshooting (official support, forums, reddit posts, others) I never got to even go past the ""drop"" loading screen. The loading screen would just play infinitely - not just for me but anyone in my game -- my buddies in my room on steam. We tried switching who hosted too.

How many attempts? Steam won't let me get my money back from a game I never got to PLAY past loading screens and attempts to get over the infinite 'drop' loading screen.
Steam tells me I've spent 2.5 hours on this.
2.5 F'N HOURS TRYING TO GET PAST THE INITIAL LOADING SCREEN.
That's also 2.5 hours annoying other players who were wondering why their game wasn't loading because I was stuck.

DO NOT buy this game if you don't live in the US. I can't fault an indie dev for not testing outside their region cause I know how expensive and difficult it can be - but I cannot recommend this game to anyone who doesn't live in the main markets this dev aims at cause you're literally going to throw your money away.

I have not been able to play this game online since I bought it many months ago.
And I cannot get my money back because ironically I tried so hard to give it a chance.

This game will force you to work with two to three other people.

This game requires you to be both courageous and strategic in your endeavors:
-To conserve ammunition among your tools as well as your firearms.
-Utilizing stealth whenever possible to prevent swarms of enemies from converging on your location.

There are no suppressors for your guns, only melee weapons to force the enemy into cardiac arrest or straight up pulverize everything from the waist-up.

Finding ways to channel enemies through corridors and stay together to stay alive through security alerts or botched stealth attempts, are essential to survival.

This game stresses smart looting as well as team composition, fail to cooperate with your team in terms of getting the right tools or guns for the job usually results in death. But if you got the guts to pull through with nothing but guns and glory, just don't run out of ammo.

Word of advice, if you travel in a four-man squad armed with four sentries, you have eight combatants prepared for the onslaught of the Horde, but be smart about ammo reverses.

As the developers of Dying Light said themselves, good night, good luck. Ten Chambers Collective will not make things easy for you. Never a moment of calm in these long 2 to 5 hour game sessions that captivate and terrify. If you are easily scared or moved by the horrors of the dark, this game will surely not let up on that.

All right, I can say the devs did make the game way more playable now.
I'll analyze all the negatives back, and check if they got resolved:

[list]
[*]The game isn't as buggy as last time, but I didn't check the ""checkpoint item"" bug yet, hoping it's not there anymore.
[*]The netcode still makes enemies glitch sometimes, but it's way more rare now.
[*]The combat is still meh, but without the enemies glitching it can be handled
[*]The stealth is way more consistent: you can be sure to be heard only if the enemy is glowing or pulsing really hard, if not, enemies will not even hear a friendly getting bonked two meters away.
[*]I still hate the stamina system. There's no excuse in that one, eccept understanding that some pro players were probably abusing infinite stamina to fly around
[/list]

I'll analyze the neutrals too, to give an updated ""feeling"" of the game:

[list]
[*]As the game is still for the ""hardcore"" players, opening up the """"previous"""" rundowns you can really see those are way more easier and the difficulty doesn't spike as hard as the previous rundows did.
[*]The game still looks ""ok"", and the performance was ""ok"" too. I guess they did fix the strutters.
[/list]

---- ORIGINAL REVIEW ----

I'm giving the game a thumbs down just because the game quality has been dropping rundown to rundown. If it wasn't for that, it would have been a thumbs up to view as a ""meh"".
I've been playing sporadically since rundown 4.
The review has been written duing rundown 7.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[list]
[*]The game idea isn't overused. Trying to make a coop game wasn't common at release date, a stealth one is even more unique.
[*]The atmosphere and the feeling of the locations you visit are really well made, a very spooky game indeed.
[*]The enemies graphical feedback is great: the pieces flying away after shooting an enemy and seeing its skeleton underneath is very cool indeed. Too bad you can't see it after the combat is over (see ""negatives"").
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*]The game has been getting buggier and buggier with each rundown, and the bugs don't seem to get fixed. The same bugs I've found in rundown 4 are still in rundown 7. There's even some new ones, like fog (even the ""bad"" one) not showing, static lighting totally disappearing, leaving maps in pitch-black darkness, or story items getting bugged after a checkpoint. As a session in this game can last VERY long and getting one of these bugs is game ending, you probably won't feel keep playing the game.
[*]The netcode is horrible: even with 40ms ping, you'll be able to see the monsters teleporting around. In this last rundown it seems the problem is partially fixed, but it keeps happening sometimes.
[*]The combat, even if it's inevitable (it's not a ""stealth only"" game), doesn't feel right and hasn't been polished at all since I've started playing. There are many things that contribute to this, from the guns' recoil feeling raw to the aftermath of a fight being only some red puddles on the floor (imagine looking at the great gibbing system after an alarm).
[*]The stealth feels weird. The range where you can be heard bashing an enemy seems to be inconsistent, from ""it must have been the wind"" to ""guess the whole room will be alerted now""
[*]Many features added to the game each rundown (""Infection"" fogs, respawning enemies, the stamina system), seems to be making it boring more than hardcore (see ""neutrals"" for more info).
[/list]

[h1]Neutrals[/h1]
These points can be freely ignored. You can see these as ""subjective opinions"". 

[list]
[*]The game is aiming at an ""hardcore"" audience, and I guess I'm not part of that. Every session feels too long and dragged on, having to open multiple alerted doors, going slowly room to room (leaving aside hazards and complex enemy placements) just to take a keycard, backtrack the whole thing and noticing the door you'll have to open is a ""class IX alert"" type. I didn't place this in the negatives because everything listed has to be expected and it's the experience the devs want to give to the players. The game is simply not for me.
[*]For the graphics the game has (nothing special), it runs bad. There's very little performance gain setting everything to low. I didn't place this in the negatives because I classify my pc as ""low-medium"" for 2022 standards, but still, there are games looking way better with better performance than this.

Every level is a smart excercise in teamplay and/or planning, and to pass it you need to build your experience fist - messing up, dying, wasting precious resources and time, taking hits of adrenaline mixed with frustration. Once you have your plan developed - you beat the level making it look easy.
There's some lore smartly weaven into the game. Aesthetics are great. Gunplay is designed to make you feel like things gone to shit and the messy part started, so don't expect to make any 360 noscopes.
Don't expect to find a team via matchmaking - but you have an options either to go to GTFO Discord and assemble the team there or host the game with bots (it's basically a solo game, but is great for exploring the levels).
All in all, GTFO is a deliciously hardcore experience for any shooter fan with good taste.

Right out of the gate the game dumps you in the world's worst rollercoaster and kicks you half a kilometre underground, expecting you and your schizophrenic comrades to do the bidding of the mysterious ""Warden"".

The gunplay is great, the weapons punchy, and the gadgets and gizmos incredibly fun. This isn't the focus of the game though, which would instead be the team-based, communicative stealth/thriller-style sneaking that you have to do in-between alarmed security doors to ensure that you've enough supplies to fight off the horde when they arrive.

Whilst the game is definitely best played with friends, the developers have included bots that can at least act as a few extra guns in a firefight, but don't expect them to be much more than that.

You have various missions throughout; exploring this huge multi-level facility level by level. One more difficult than the other. Often, you have to hack or gain access to relevant doors from locations that are off the beaten path, ultimately coiling you through corridors and rooms like in a maze.

Ideally, you want to reach your destination (and sometimes back again) with as little attention drawn to you as possible. The base is filled with monsters, mostly blind ones, that have keen hearing and can pinpoint you easily if you make a ruckus. So it’s essentially about sneaking and avoiding confrontation -- until you slip up, or the game forces you to trigger alarms to draw in the hordes. You only have so much ammunition to go around. And nothing is more disconcerting than arriving at your final destination with an empty magazine, knowing what’s about to go down. 

There’s nothing really unique about the game [i]on paper[/i]. It’s very much a co-op shooter like a lot of other games before it. What makes it unique though, is the atmosphere and pacing. It’s also very particular in how it wants you to play. You need a steady hand. Patience. You’re always scrounging for ammunition. It has a very oppressive and hopeless feel to it. You’re always [i]just barely[/i] pulling through, regardless of how well you know the mission. 

I love it. Highly recommended if you want a slow-paced and gritty co-op shooter to play with some familiars.
